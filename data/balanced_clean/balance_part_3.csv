1.0,"This is not KHAKI! It is PINK. If you want the tan color that is pictured, do not order this one"
1.0,"The mesh does not sit close to the body, wants to sag even though the actual bra fit well. The padding is absolutely ridiculously thick, would not recommend."
1.0,Nor even close to being the size it said it is
1.0,Looks nothing like the pic an they were all scratched up
1.0,4 left gloves! Come on what's going on? Please just send me 4 right gloves and I'm happy
1.0,Cheap quality. Didn’t fit on face. Used for Mr Smee costume
1.0,"Poorly made, very thin material, raw edge without sewn hem. Extremely disappointed."
1.0,"Fabric is thick, stiff, slippery. Feels like good fabric for table cloth or curtains. I put it on and, while it fit just fine, made me feel like I was wrapped in card paper. The sleeves make this item look like a mockery costume. It's going back."
1.0,"China size, also, wasn't the model I ordered. Didn't even bothered in returning it."
1.0,It’s beautiful in the picture but the quality is not good and the waistline is to tiny for a large sized
1.0,Money wasted. Cheap material. Doesn't look as good as pic. Missed window to return.  Will never wear.
1.0,Clasp broke first time I wore it.  It did look nice forthright 2 hours I was able to wear it.
1.0,would have enjoyed the belt if it lasted longer than a month before the pin broke and fell apart from the buckle as I was wearing it. Of course this happens at the least opportune time and fell apart just before a wedding I was in. I really wanted to like it because it was half the price of some major competitors. wish I could say it lasted half as long. I got about 40 days of use so would not recommend.
1.0,This does not fit older shoe stretchers.
1.0,The earrings were much smaller than I thought they would be
1.0,Very cheap highly disappointing. It’s thin and feels like I got it from the Dollar store!
1.0,"I had to return this because it would not adjust to my Soprano Ukulele. It looked like it would have worked on a larger instrument, but the reason I purchased it was that it stated it could fit it.<br /><br />The thing might be good, but just wasn't good for me and my needs."
1.0,"I hated his belt. It has two levels of leather in the front, one for the buckle  and another underneath for what ? Makes the belt to thick in front. Too much of a pain to return. I really was trying to find another Guatemalan belt that Amazon used to have."
1.0,Terrible product that looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,I don't recommend you to buy this product .
1.0,Incomplete<br />Did NOT receive all items
1.0,"It’s very confusing to put it on, and very small.<br />Not easy to return, and I did not receive a shipping address from the email. I ended up putting it in the trash."
1.0,I’ve been sewing for 50 years and this is not rayon/spandex.  I’m guessing polyester…
1.0,"The legwarmers I ordered were multicolored. These are a solid, ugly brown color however, I’m not surprised as nothing I order from Amazon looks like it does in the picture."
1.0,"I love the look of this swimsuit, however when I put it on, I was so disappointed to find out that material is more like wearing non-stretch clothes than a swimsuit. There's no flexibility in the suit, at all. If compressed my chest down so much it looked like I had no chest at all, and this wasn't due to sizing. It is strictly a very strange and inappropriate material choice for a swimsuit. Do not recommend, even though it's cute to look at."
1.0,HORRIBLE quality!
1.0,Stone fell off first week
1.0,not true to size and lays weird. Sadly the sleeves are the worst part. too big.
1.0,"I wanted to give this product a review based strictly on the workmanship of the sweater.  I had initially ordered a large but once received it, it was smaller than expected and had a hole in one of the pockets.  My wife fixed the hole and it was returned.  Later, I ordered an XL and it fit great and was very nice to wear.  I decided to zip it up and then realized the zipper was not zipped onto the placard.  This company should apply stricter quality control measures, because the sweater is very nice and fashionable.  Buyer beware!"
1.0,100% see through
1.0,The images were pealing off. I have a few shirts from this brand and had no issues. It may have been a fluke.
1.0,The gems and bows fell off on first wear
1.0,Disappointed in fit.
1.0,My order clearly stated 3 pack but I only received one. Description has since been corrected. May return as it wasn’t what I paid for.
1.0,"The picture shows mirrored image earrings.  What I received are two of the exact same earring.  I'll never wear them because they are exactly the same instead of mirrored images.  Poor quality control that ""hand made with care"" earrings are sent out this way."
1.0,"I ordered a size 12 and the tag says size 16, but it looks like a size 1X or 2X. It is HUGE!! I am really frustrated to say the least."
1.0,"The magnets are not strong. When I took them out of their container they came in, the magnets seemed like they were nice, but I couldn’t get it to stay magnetized on my nose, like they are supposed to."
1.0,So big and bad material. I throw it away.waste of time and money.
1.0,I wore this for the purpose I bought it for. Will never wear again.
1.0,"I am 5’6 and this is so long I’m tripping over it, even with shoes on."
1.0,"We got 4 of these, two fell off on the trip their and two on the trip back, total  4 flights. The flimsy ones from the airline made it on all flights and segments. They are a pain to write on also and not smudge. Don't waste your money"
1.0,"I paid a little more money for these than the cheaper versions thinking they would be better glasses. They did nothing to improve night time driving nor did they reduce any glare. Description states polarized but when I used the card that came with it, the image hardly appeared at all. I originally didn't see an image but then saw a very faint image. I compared them to another pair of glasses that are polarized and there was a huge difference. I read ALL the reviews and noticed how they didn't really talk about performance. The glasses are nice but they don't do anything but add a yellow tint to everything. The packaging was designed very well, I wish they had put some of that money into the actual product. I will be returning."
1.0,Wasnt made well.
1.0,"Se partio desde una altura de 40 cm lo que indica que no es piedra, se aprecia que es vidrio"
1.0,"I didn't like it. It was too expensive, plus the seller doesn't price match. The watch should be much, much, less than what it is being sold for. Not a happy camper, never again, will I buy from the company."
1.0,I order the small size however still was to<br />Big sleeves to long for a small size blouse<br />To baggy
1.0,A couple of links broke the first time I wore.
1.0,Broke first time I Wore it
1.0,Pitiful whistle 😣
1.0,"Bought this for my daughter who pointed out that those are not Surf Boards, they are paddle boards, which to a teenager is a big difference.  Item clearly states it's a surf board &#34;1.5&#34; Hawaiian Print Ukulele Strap - Blue Surfboard&#34;  But if you look closely at the photo you will see it is a paddle board.  The item's description is wrong."
1.0,"So... I'm an extra large kinda girl so I can have a loose flowy feel.... I think this is a child's shirt... it fits more like an adult small.<br /><br />The measurements of an XL laying flat is:<br />Length: 26""<br />Bust: 16""<br />Waist: 17""<br />Hips: 18""<br /><br />Super cute. Wish it wasn't so small! Will be returning asap."
1.0,The fabric and the print of this dress is very nice and I would have kept it for the left arm hole was either sewn wrong or they had the wrong size sleeve. I couldn't  put my arm through that side. So that's why it got a low rating.
1.0,Not for summer..
1.0,Did not like that I asked for tank tops with built in bras and that is not what I got when I got these! I ordered a medium and their medium is actually a small on me. Both sizing charts suck.
1.0,What not recommend they are too hard to put in I don't even know how they feel because I can't get them in my shoes
1.0,Could not see or breathe through mask.  Extremely extremely extremely chemical smelling.
1.0,This was definitely not what I was expecting! I was expecting 3 compression shirts and these are 3 flimsy non compressive peices of material. I will not order this or recommend it to anyone. Very very dissatisfied.
1.0,"Said 47 inch, not even 46 in length"
1.0,"The price is good and I like the pockets, but it rolls up the thigh and is uncomfortable, chafing. Won’t buy again."
1.0,These always got stuck in my hair and were a pain to wear.
1.0,Stone fell out before I could even wear it
1.0,The crotch area makes your crotch look big
1.0,I wear a size 14/16.  I bought a XXL because I wanted to layer it.  I could not get it on over my shoulders. My daughter wears a size 4 and it Just fit her. Very disappointed
1.0,"So there’s nothing on the description about the lining. The lining is almost like plastic. I tried it on and I was immediately sticking to it. Also, it runs small. Like really small. I don’t know why everyone says order a size down bc I normally wear an XLG but decided to order a large based on the reviews. Don’t do it. Actually, just don’t buy it."
1.0,"These are not merino wool socks. My feet are cold, even right now in my office. They are also too large for me, and I wear a size 6.5 shoe, which means they should fit. These are very basic socks that should have cost way less than I paid.  Very disappointing purchase. I plan to return them."
1.0,"These caused me to have dermatitis. I thought the stainless steel would be okay, but I don't know that the earring backs are made from stainless steel."
1.0,They are to big and doesn't fix around your face tight
1.0,"Arrived quickly, fit as expected but really cheap material and very poorly sewn. This is a picture of a seem that was completely open🙄"
1.0,Zipper located on wrong side for a women's jacket.<br />unsatisfactory.
1.0,clamp on one upper ear broke
1.0,"I wouldn't bother wasting your money. The hat came bent, and the belt was haphazardly glued on."
1.0,Hate the shirt. It’s boxy looking on and the material is super thin.
1.0,Very disappointed with the poor quality made hat. Received this item on 2/6/15 & less than 24 hours the pump on the flipeez fell apart in my 6 yr olds daughter's hand.
1.0,First week I had them the screws fell out and the nose guards fell off and I can't even contact the seller for a replacement pair talk about piss you off!!!
1.0,This shirt fits weird. And the design is printed much bigger than it appears in the picture
1.0,"Way too small for 18 month baby.  In the positive side, it was very cheap and some mommy at goodwill will be glad I donated it."
1.0,Seriously strong chemical odor that does not wash out!!! Don’t buy.
1.0,Verry flimsy and not verry good 2 have alredy broken and i have only wor them once the seams are verry noticable
1.0,Looks like a cheap Halloween costume.
1.0,"I love amber. The stone has such a beautiful color and it’s always so mesmerizing to me. I bought these earrings for my mom and we were both truly disappointed. The hearts did not look like they were amber. They looked like they were plastic hearts that got brown and orange injected in them. There was no shine to them, very matte like. I wish I could’ve taken a picture before I returned them! Definitely not worth the money"
1.0,I'm on my second band. This one too has broken off at the buckle part. The pin comes out and it completely falls apart. Tired of spending the time to reassemble this piece of junk. This is from normal use too--nothing crazy. I'll be returning this one for good this time and will not replace. I really liked the design of the mesh though. Too bad.
1.0,That pants were horrible they didn’t even last me a full day. They rip on the crotch.  I wish I could my money back.
1.0,Color wore off in less than 1 week.  They promised to replace it.  Never happened.
1.0,"Can't see in the water anymore.  It's nobody's fault, but mine.<br />What bothers me is the the answer to who or what allows these people to sell this crap."
1.0,Don't  like them
1.0,"The watch band is not long enough to fit the wrist for which it's intended. I contacted the company because it says on the insert that they would send more links if needed. They said they would send them. Didn't.  Contacted again, said again they'd send them. Didn't.  Don't get the watch if you think you are going to get more links if you need them, you won't. Glad it's December, I had a longer return window and will be returning this watch. Too bad, he likes the look of it...."
1.0,This showed up broken.
1.0,"so i ordered a size D and i normally wear C cup so i took a bigger size because of size differences and stuff always being smaller. it fit like a B cup, Total waste of money"
1.0,I'd Do a negative star if I could.... I ordered a medium... im a size 6 medium in everything... this top wouldnt even fit my 10 yr old niece.<br />Giving it to my younger niece.  DO NOT BUY IT. Unless you have a six year old niece
1.0,Will review one I wear
1.0,The lettering is ironed on and peeled off after the third wash. Don’t waste your money. Very disappointed.
1.0,I have problems with the bars of both bracelets open alone
1.0,Please next time don’t change  quality I’m not Expected
1.0,Too small and plasticity for the purpose I intended it for. I donated it and bought a more durable crown.
1.0,"Fit like a small large , but was marked XXL."
1.0,False advertising
1.0,[[VIDEOID:f85955e7d2d1eb8a4d2e7838d6451c1e]] I was very disappointed with garment. I believe that they sent it out before the ink dried. It has black ink all over the front and back of the tshirt :(
1.0,Need to make big sizes
1.0,To support breast
1.0,Pin popped out twice. Lost watch once had to backtrack 3 hours around town to find my $300 watch. Not again getting a better band
1.0,Quality was cheap and material is terrible feeling on skin.
1.0,cheap quality and relieved bigger size...and there is not return policy.
1.0,Cheappily made
1.0,"The quality isn’t bad but it was a bit tight for the size I ordered (large). I’m more disappointed in the color as for what I ordered, I anticipated more of a brown, not mustard top color of the sweater. The bottom stripe also is much more orange than a reddish color I expected. I don’t hate it but these colors make me look pale as a blonde, fair skinned individual."
1.0,Don't waste your time. Shipping was horrible and it's very poor quality.
1.0,Cute shoes but way too small. I got size 4 but it's more of size 2. It's a waste of money!
1.0,I purchased these gloves to use while working in Alaska. They DO NOT keep your hands warm in below zero weather. And they don’t work as far as touch screen either which is another reason my hands were freezing. I had to take my hands out of my gloves take pictures on my iPhone.
1.0,"When I first put this set on I was so excited because it was so comfy and felt great. But then I looked in the mirror and saw it: the dreaded camel toe. The leggings are missing gussets in the crotchal area, so they are 100% guaranteed to put your flaps on display."
1.0,It's shorter than I expected and the material is thinner than expected
1.0,"The charm I received was not a Pandora Charm.  it was white, but thats where it stops looking like the one pictured here.  It didn't have the pandora stamp.  Very disappointed.  returning it!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00JWZQDJG Pandora 791617cz Clear Effervescence Charm]]"
1.0,The size was not true to fit
1.0,Every fourth or fifth glove survived me trying to put them on. Garbage in terms of strength. Waste of money.
1.0,For 12 y/o far too thin.  And they run small.
1.0,If I could leave a negative I would. Shirt looks nothing like what is pictured. It is not anything close to tshirt material and the shape is basically like a square.  It took almost a month to receive. I have since returned it but had to pay for shipping with a tracking number so I'm out $6 for a $15 refund. For $15 I didn't expect designer but this was a joke.
1.0,The patterned socks were all way too small. I actually threw them away!☹️
1.0,Rose gold color start coming off after just a few days of wearing. Really sad about that because I really loved the look of it!
1.0,Wrong size!!
1.0,The socks feel soft and warm but the inside has lots of little strings which are very uncomfortable.
1.0,poor quality<br />very small top.<br />Look like pyjamas<br />Am so sad
1.0,Ok don't dryer it no good fit...have to thrift store
1.0,Was not what I wanted no where to what I ordered. Waste of money DONT ORDER!!!
1.0,"The first thing I noticed when I placed it in one hand. Still Tached by a string to the other glove, Is that is broken. Paper thin quality."
1.0,Doesn't even fit the frames they're supposedly made for. Huge pain trying to install them just to figure that out. Get Fuse lenses instead. They fit.
1.0,This bag is very poor quality.  I would like to return it but it is too late.  I didn't realize it has to be returned by a certain date. I guess I am stuck with it.
1.0,"Every single pair of boxers ripped after the 1st use and washing. Extremely poor material and workmanship. I saw other complain about this, but I purchased these shorts many years ago and they were better made. Not these!!! Buy only if you want Holy Boxers!!!"
1.0,The black ring is red the clasp is hard to use.  I'm not happy at all.
1.0,"Poor material, fake hat."
1.0,"Now that the weather is cooler I just opened this jacket.  I love the color and the material.  But I’m so disappointed because there are 2 holes, one in the right and one in the left sleeve/shoulder seam.  It’s not torn it just looks like the material wasn’t sewn together when it was made.  I’m very disappointed!"
1.0,Large and heavy. Could not return.
1.0,"According to the measurements on here compared to the measurement on my glasses these should have fit no problem, they barely fit over the glasses and stick so far out"
1.0,Huge design flaw. Nice looking case. Unfortunately the watch does not sit properly in case. Crown stays pushed in and activated Siri. Home button also stays pushed and turns watch off. Buyer beware
1.0,Definitely not like the pictures
1.0,"Not as dainty as it looks. It's actually kind of bulky when you have it on and catches way more than I would hope. the pictures all make it look like a matte finish, it isn't. It's a very shiny silver color, and feels cheap. Looks way better online than in person. Not even worth the low price. I will be giving it away to anyone who wants it."
1.0,They did not send the colors shown. These arrived one day before school started and they were supposed to be for my son. They showed up with pink and rainbow. Only one was suitable for boy colors. Very upsetting.
1.0,Not fit  very good
1.0,My daughter broke out in a rash when she wore this sweater. Wash before use.
1.0,"They didn't even make it through one washing, immediately fell apart"
1.0,Terrible fit not true colors.
1.0,This poor quantity
1.0,"we must have gotten a lemon.  after using 2 times, one of the hinges broke.  :-(<br />I'm trying to see if there's a warranty or if I can contact the company/seller about this."
1.0,Received the vest in used condition…no tag and dirty collar.
1.0,Although it fit I ordered a size up based on comments. So it fit fine. However they designed without adjusting for a bigger girl. It shows near the arm bobage and the width of the bands are the exact same size as a small fit so it looks tacky like a thin strip across a wide arm. Very unflattering especially when your shooting for elegance which is what this dress is. My return experience has been excellent so thankful they are good that way and when receiving them was on time.
1.0,It was very cheap looking plus Stones were missing and THEY NEVER GAVE ME BACK MY REFUND!!!!!!!!!
1.0,Do not buy. Not true to size. Runs about 3 sizes small.
1.0,"cheap and  see through, terrible material, unfinished edges. so disappointed. will never purchase again."
1.0,"if i wanted everyone to see my butt then these would be perfect. they are loose in the band, and aren’t tight, and they care comfy, but VERY SEE THROUGH!!!!! VERY VERY SEE THROUGH. even before u put them on, u can still see how see through they are."
1.0,"This has got to be the cheapest made costume I’ve ever bought. The thigh high stockings were TWO completely different sizes. One seemed like it was for a child and one fit “fine”<br /><br />The entire thing is see through, the sleeves are too short and stockings way to long.<br /><br />I’m not a big girl, 5’0 and 125 lbs and was expecting it to fit a little loose since it’s one size fits all. Truth is the bottom is made for someone who’s 5’7 and the top is made for someone who’s 4’7.<br /><br />There is loose thread all over the body suit and the zipper comes about 2/3 of an inch above the body suit. Made terribly. DO NOT BUY."
1.0,I do not like the fabric and the fit is small. The finished stitching is not good on the hem. Should have sent it back as it will sit in my drawer or I will give it away.
1.0,Took forever to arrive. I ordered this for Christmas didn’t get here until after Jan 15th 2021. The material is very low quality I could probably done a better job myself. The red color is vibrant but not the best quality.
1.0,"Sorry to say, Very cheap... doesn’t fit as expected. Very think and flimsy."
1.0,It is not as pictured! The slit is only 3-4 inches from the hem! It fit to size but the quality wasn’t what I expected.
1.0,"This dress is ridiculously sized wrong. I ordered based on measurements provided and some of the reviews. I am 5' 6"" and 120lbs. I am not big busted. I ordered a small. I couldn't even get over shoulders for fear it would break the straps and I wouldn't be able to return it. The fabric doesn't have any give either. It is thin see through fabric that people make cheap scarves out of. Is it pretty pattern yes but really cheap looking garmet. If I had gotten it over my head I would have to guess it would have been tight in the waist.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this if you have shoulders, ribs, or any bones that do not contort, dislocate, or fold in on themselves. I also wouldn't recommend if you don't like to struggle finding garmets to wear under see through clothes that have high slits and odd necklines. Just go to the mall and try something on in person. You will be much happier."
1.0,"Low - Cheap quality , not worth the hassle of purchasing !"
1.0,Broke trying to put on 1st time. Very poorly made.
1.0,"I ordered a V neck, it came in a scoop neck.  Color and pattern different from the photo too.  Really disappointed.  I returned it with no problems though, so that was nice."
1.0,Wore it once and it broke within the first hour of wearing it!
1.0,I found the sunglasses to be flimsy and cheap.  One lens actually was loose.
1.0,"Bought one color to turn around and buy the maroon one, maroon one was VERY SMALL.<br />I purchased one in the same size as my other then a larger one for my sister. The largest one wouldn't even button. Completely different fit. The dark blue floral one however was perfect. ( I included the picture of the blue one that is perfect"
1.0,This case is bad<br />Rear plastics cover do not feet with goober and can't be instaled
1.0,These were way smaller than depicted in the picture..They are pretty but very small. Wish I would have returned them.
1.0,"Shirt is &#34;okay&#34;  If your a size XL or larger, this will not be flattering on you.  I'm an XL with large boobs, descent curves, semi flat belly. This shirt looked HORRIBLE.  It reality, I don't see how it really looks as pictured, as mine didn't hang past the button on my jeans.  On the picture, it appears as though it hangs past her shorts.  That is not what I received.  It was so horrible and scary I couldn't take a picture."
1.0,"It took 6 weeks or so to receive the glasses.  When I finally received them, they were very poor quality & and were not as described at all !!  Actually, you could find better quality glasses at a local gas station convenience store on a spin-rack display near cash register checkout !!  When I tried to resolve issue and request refund, it took 4 emails to get resolved.  My expectations of the item were high in the beginning but once item was received, I was very disappointed with the purchase."
1.0,I was not happy at all . I read the reviews and I went 2 sizes up and it's still way to small it fits my 13 year old .
1.0,Waste of money .. very thin
1.0,"These are the most painful things I've ever tried to wear.  They pinch your head and have sharp edges, not to mention that you can't even see through the small slits. Then the lights quit working. Save your money and look elsewhere for better quality."
1.0,"I'm honestly really disappointed in this purchase. I ordered this bracelet along with the multicoloured &#34;evil eye&#34; style bracelet, expecting them to be the same, just this one to not be multicoloured. This assumption was based on the products being from the same brand, the names of the products being similar, and the pictures of the products being very similar, just with a colour difference.<br /><br />The product I received isn't what is pictured at all. I'm not sure if this is a result of being shipped the wrong product completely or if the picture of the product on Amazon is incorrect. The bracelet I received has two loops instead of three, is all blue with large oval eyes and small blue and silver beads. It looks nothing like the multicoloured bracelet in person, and nothing like the picture on the product's page.<br /><br />With all of that said, the bracelet I did receive looks like a fashionable bracelet, and I will probably gift it to someone in future. I have not opened the package, so I can't comment on durability or materials. If you feel like taking a risk or just like eyeball motifs, this may work out for you.. but then again, it may not."
1.0,Love look but super itchy.
1.0,"Length was not to the floor, more like 3/4 length. Poor quality material, was expecting sweatshirt fabric as advertised. Washing instructions say Do Not Tumble Dry. Now I’m apprehensive to even wash it. I should have sent it back."
1.0,Arrived with a large yellow streak down the front and the stitching came undone before I even was able to put it on.
1.0,"I received an old and used purse, am so disappointed. ."
1.0,way too large for a standard L
1.0,The fabric is nice and soft and I really like the colors but the quality is terrible. There are holes where the stitching wasn’t complete. One of the hats has a lot of fraying. Uneven stitching so much so that the hat sits unevenly. Huge gaps where bow sits. I keep going back and forth on whether to return because a couple hats are okay and workable but I think they will fall apart if I was them. Also too large for a newborn.
1.0,too small-would not even fit my 13 year old daughter who is on track and in soccer
1.0,Unfortunately these are falling off when I walk. I've ordered from this brand before but maybe these camp ones are different material? I even washed them and dried them.to see if they would shrink but they didn’t.
1.0,"Product only lasted less than one month, the edges are tearing up all ready. I’m not ruff but I do use it allot, as you should it’s a wallet. Would not recommend this product."
1.0,Cuff is very small.
1.0,"Super, inappropriately short. Thin cheap material. Return."
1.0,"I returned this skirt as it has no stretch to it, so unless your size was exactly to the skirt it wouldn’t fall well when on."
1.0,Not good for small children. My child is 8 and it keeps falling down. Filter isn't comfortable and unless because sides pop up so no point in the filter. Maybe if it had a nose clip it would be better. But in all not worth the money spent.
1.0,Very poorly made I would not buy from the seller again!
1.0,Came in broken would not latch close.
1.0,very disappointed in this looks super cute but is sheer
1.0,"I'm here to tell you ladies, if you're an apple shape this will not fit. They will roll down! I thought they were all cotton. No!! only the crotch!! Horrible material and the waist ban stretches out. Shame on Just My Size!! They're usually on point! I have several pairs of underwear. Cheaply made! SMH."
1.0,"Be careful on this,way to small then what it saids!"
1.0,As the title says. I was excited since I can never seem to find something I can use “every day” with blue roses but they weren’t connected together. Seriously? The clasp is a joke too.
1.0,Thin see through material.... can’t wear it outside of the house. Maybe as a beach cover up? But really I just don’t like it.....
1.0,👎🏽
1.0,"The amount of lint on this scarf was incredible; It got all in my eyes while wearing it. I went to wash it according to the instructions and this linty scarf got all matted together. Fail. Poor product, poor quality. Skip."
1.0,Product is for a child
1.0,This hat sits up very high. The only use would be to cut the patch and put on a properly designed hat.
1.0,Fits small - item does not look like picture
1.0,The fabric is that of a cheap Halloween costume. Thought it would be soft.
1.0,So cute when arrived. Quality is disappointing and after wearing one day the charm fell off and is gone. Disappointed! It would take longer to repackage and send back.
1.0,"Does not look like the picture, it is not flowy  at all."
1.0,My niece loved these shoes until the lights stopped working on the third wear. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Way way too small, followed the guidelines for purchase, gave them to my young daughter...buying online, shoppers have to rely on companies  to state  truth about their products...slightly irritated...."
1.0,They don’t glow
1.0,"I liked that its confterable, they are fresh. But what i realy disliked is that the zippers breack open. I lost my wallet do to that."
1.0,I haven't gotten it yet it was a valentine gift for my daughter n she nevr recievd it but she still waitn for it...
1.0,Horrible fit and fabric. Not at all how it looks on the picture

1.0,The headband came with several flowers already detached.
1.0,Not a good product very bad way to close it I could never were them because they would not close. Pretty much use
1.0,Arrived Very Wrinkled and was very large<br />Not a very good quality
1.0,"This is my second pullover I got, I was very happy with first one I got and waiting on my 3rd that did not arrive yet. But this one had a hole in front, good I noticed it so I was able to return it. Check the return policy for this vendor to make sure what your options are. I had to drive my return to the UPS drop off which for me is not convenient so I wasted 1 hr of my Saturday. Otherwise I do like this pullover, very comfortable and wears well. Just hopefully quality is there with every purchase. I purchase things online as I don't have time to drive to stores, not to mentioned returning them that cannot ship back from your home. So for me if quality is not there every time even if I like the item a lot, it will be a deal breaker for me."
1.0,"I ordered 1 pair of the zoomies magnifying glasses on the website for $10.00, and added $7.00 for the shipping and handling for a free pair, that's it, I refused everything else. My invoice said $74.70, and does not allow you to cancel the order. I called the number on the add but that was 100% automated and the customer service number I got from the sales line, the young lady said she could not help me because the order had not showed up as yet. So, I called the credit card company and they said they did not get the order as yet either. I'll have to call everyday to block this zoomies charge.  Save yourself the trouble, and buy elsewhere."
1.0,Day two of recovery towing and they need a wash and already have a tear in the back of the left hand. Not through the thinsulate or my hand lol but nonetheless for day two and them never encountering anything sharper then a fender edge while strapping cars. Other gloves haven’t torn like these. But for 12$-13$ after taxes and etc They overall are decent will buy again because of price point. But quality is definitely lacking that of say some VDO comparable models
1.0,"Does not fit this loosely, very small."
1.0,Sizing chart unclear there is no return or exchange policy. I am stuck with a jacket to sizes too small and cannot get a refund
1.0,"This scarf was not the name brand listed…I was going to give this for Christmas, hopefully I can get another one in time…"
1.0,Had for about a month and they broke
1.0,"Very disappointed in how it fit, the outfit fit way too big by the crouch area and the color is way off from what I was expecting."
1.0,"Review to the blue dress - The material to this dress is no good, I read a comment about it looking like an auntie dress lol she was definitely correct! This dress makes you look old, it makes you look like a wrapped up curtain. Negative to buying a dress like this online, very cheap looking, the material feels like a curtain, the side slits are not visible even if you walk. This is by far the ugliest dress I've purchased. Returning this product -thought about reselling but not worth the try. I'm a buyer that will keep online purchases even if it's not what I expected- not a picky buyer either. I just can't with this dress. I hope this helps you!"
1.0,These were not what I expected when they arrived. I decided to give them a try though. They lasted for about two days until I could no longer tell a difference whether I was wearing them or not. I was bummed. On to the next ones.
1.0,Within minutes my earlobes were red and swollen despite the fact that I cleaned the earrings before putting them in :-(
1.0,"These are way too small for anyone, even if you are petit and very skinny. They are tight on a normal arm, so will cut off circulation in anyone's legs. DO NOT BUY"
1.0,Love the design. Love the printing quality. Great shirt.<br /><br />EDIT<br /><br />After a few wears and washes the print flakes off.
1.0,"I ordered this bra size 34B and I got an 32C, totally wrong. I will return it. The cup C its more like a B, caution!"
1.0,"it looked horrible on me but looks amazing on the model.... idk was way to big so unless you have a large butt and large boobies, it’s gonna be a no go."
1.0,"The boots look very cute but are VERY cheaply made. The sole on one of them is shaped so straight, can be worn on either foot with discomfort. The stitching on top pulled out before I even wore them.  They might last the one season but that’s all. They are falling apart every time I look at them. If you don’t mind using for one season and buying new next year then they will be for you. Shipping cost almost doubles the cost and makes them just NOT worth it.Cheap, cheap, cheap but cute.<br /><br />I WORE THESE ONCE AND THE SOLE ON BOTH BOOTS CAME OFF. HAD TO RETURN. WAITING FOR REFUND. AFTER PAYING FOR SHIPPING AND PACKAGING TAPE I END UP WITH NOTHING MUCH. Dat not buy!!!!"
1.0,"Not the same Carhartt sock that I was used too, they must have cheapened them. I got a large runner putting a pair on."
1.0,This is a very bad product. The bag broke after one day using.
1.0,"I sent it back.  The dress was too clingy and almost see-through.  I thought it would hang and be a bit more flattering.  I am a size 14 and ordered an XL, and it looked terrible.  Skip it!"
1.0,Nice color and all but way to big after 1 wear.
1.0,"Run small, little stretch. Size up."
1.0,Received item 12/31/2020 and it is already fraying and falling apart
1.0,This is too small for age advertised. Especially the shirt. get two sizes bigger
1.0,"I'm very disappointed with these and would have given them no stars if I could. I ordered the black frame, grey lens glasses and instead got a gold frame, either black or grey lens glasses. And the glasses are ugly. There's no way around it. The lenses are really big and cover most of my face and then the gold frames just stand out. The glasses were also dirty when I got them. There was dust and dirt all over the lenses. I had to clean them before I could even put them on. The only thing I like about the glasses is that the frame feels pretty sturdy. I dislike a lot. I don't like the color of the frames or the color of the lenses. I also don't like the nose pieces. They are bent and crooked and I can't bend them to the correct position. Because of that, they won't sit on my face straight or evenly. Overall I'm very unhappy."
1.0,"es transparente todo se ve la tela no es buena calidad, cuando pedí reembolso, que yo pagara el envió, así que aquí lo tengo, perdí el dinero."
1.0,"This is not a dress, but skirt and top. You know the difference, right? The quality is extremely poor and it looks nothing like on the picture, real cheap. Will be ok for child Halloween costume with low expectations but not for dance performance. Returning."
1.0,Cheap an runs big
1.0,"Broke into 1,000 pieces after just a few weeks"
1.0,"Sent a different bracelet, very disappointed!"
1.0,It didn’t say I had to pay to return<br />I pad 9.99 and cost 7.99 to return<br />It wasn’t posted that I had to pay<br />I’m really not happy<br />It was way to small
1.0,This was made very cheaply ... The band falls apart like a french pastry in your hands.
1.0,Nowhere near the size advertised! Deceptive!
1.0,"The backs did not hold up.  After using them several times, I lost a pearl earring because they got loose and did not hold the earring!.  Not Happy!"
1.0,I purchased purse to see very nice and cute picture but its quality is very cheap. Never buy it again.
1.0,I paid $38 for rush shipping to receive in time for my daughters wedding. The dress came in time but the breast pad was down in the bottom of the dress and not able to get it out. I had to wear my backup dress.
1.0,"Very cheaply made, the liner is very loose and pokes out of the sleeves. Hood attaches to little things on the collar but one of them was too small so the good doesnt connect all the way."
1.0,So ugly!! Didn't get a true color. I ordered blue and got red! Ordered large and got extra large!! Material is so cheap!! Pockets are tiny. WTF!! Hate it! Gave it to goodwill...
1.0,You can see through this shirt. I returned it.
1.0,They look nice but extremely poor quality. Not worth any money.
1.0,Arrived with the seam torn open on the side. Looks as if it was someone else's return because the tag is cut off as is the cloth. Unfortunately I don't have time to return and wait for another as we have gymnastics in 2 days so I will be attempting to fix on my own. Product itself is good and I would order another to replace if I had time but I don't.
1.0,There is no place to put a picture. You would have to glue it in. It is big. About my thumb size but I was upset it was a &#34;locket&#34; but no place to put a picture
1.0,"WAY, way too small!! I wear a 12, ordered a 16 because I wanted it to fit big. Ha, the joke was on me! I couldn't even get my arms in the sleeves! I'm not fat, but thanks for making me feel like I am"
1.0,"CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP.  Do not waste your money.  Purchased 2 and 1 arrived damaged.  After a few weeks chain broke.  POOR quality and POOR customer service."
1.0,Didn’t even open the shrink wrapped package. Just assumed it would always be Full of wrinkles
1.0,Soooooo much fabric on the bottom it looks more like a tent
1.0,The material was more like that of a swim suit and it barely looked like the picture. It was very cheaply made.
1.0,The material feels very cheap and the size is way off.
1.0,This is extremely overpriced. Purchased a 4 pack for $37.99. Costco.com is selling an 8 pack for $16.99.
1.0,This is smaller than the current size medium my daughter is wearing.
1.0,Really bad quality. The fabric gets really bad within the first use.
1.0,"Product is not as described, company is based out of China so returning this is going to be fun...:( the top one is the one I ordered, bottom is original lens"
1.0,Very disappointed The glasses are distorted when you look through them!  What I assume it would feel like to have cataracts on your eyes
1.0,This dress sucks! It's made small at the top. It's cut different then the picture. The pattern is big print Polka dots Not the little dots like the picture. Looks like A Tablecloth!!
1.0,"While adjusting it, it bent.  While bending it back, the band broke.  Dont try to make it bigger than a 9 or it could happen to you.  We'll see about an exchange."
1.0,Very small - maybe for a toddler it would work but not an adult size club whatsoever.
1.0,This product is only for very petite women. If you are larger than a zero this will not fit.
1.0,This is advertised as a sweater so I assumed it was. I received it today and it is a nylon thin long sleeve shirt. I would not have paid as much for this material. This to me is misleading advertising. Very disappointed. I do not have time to purchase something else due to I need for Wednesday 11/21.
1.0,"If you want a new pair of panties, these are comfy, but if you need protection from leakage don't buy this product. they are just an expensive pair of panties."
1.0,Very cheaply made the stitching is already coming completely apart...never been washed only used to dance in.
1.0,I really like these gloves. A lot. They are a little tight but I like how precise that makes them when doing things like grabbing for a zipper or grabbing something out of my pocket. Problem is they broke at the zipper after wearing them 3 times for only about 5 minutes each time. Also the right thumb stitching for the touchscreen fabric was not sewn properly and was coming apart when delivered. I want to love them....
1.0,Don't buy. First time washing and all the thred came off one end. The ends kept rolling down as I was wearing it. Not worth it.
1.0,Quality of material is not good. Don't waste your money!
1.0,I do not like them. Static electricity makes them look fuzzy. Horrible!
1.0,"I purchased these bandeau bras to wear with some formal dresses on a cruise.  I should have tried them on before I washed and packed them.  The material is flimsy and does not stay up. The width of the bra is way too wide - the top lace shows, as does the elastic on the bottom. I threw them away on the cruise because I didn’t want to bring them home."
1.0,This was not a flattering piece for me. It was totally see through and had absolutely no support.
1.0,Broke the first time I wore it
1.0,"I sent it back for a refund immediately without turning it on after I saw the damages to the leather from the small shelf compartment. I attached photos for the damages but Is the shelf suppose to be loose and free flowing like that? If the seller could answer this question I would appreciate it.<br /><br />The size, weight, and color were very nice. It felt very luxurious and like a solid product for the cost but the shelf compartment really was a disappointment. I can not review to the function because I immediately wrapped it back up without taking off the protective tape because I saw the shelf just so poorly constructed. If this is a defect then I understand but if it is not then it should not cost this much.<br /><br />Besides that I am still waiting for my refund which should be issued within the week.<br />(To: Seller) I would like to purchase this automatic watch winder again if it was just a defect, so email me after the refund is in my account so we can move forward."
1.0,"The garmin brand band lasted us over a year, this one LESS THAN  A WEEK.  I had really hoped it'd be the opposite since this knock off brand is thicker."
1.0,50/50. I bought two of these. One made it theew being washed the other came unstitched the first time I tried to wash it.
1.0,"I ordered this dress in white some time ago, it was really beautiful but on a tight side and I decided to get a different color. I returned it to get it in gray. I had to wait for few weeks as it was sold out. When I finally got my gray and one size larger it was horrible. Made of cheap polyester, uneven stitching and the size was exactly the same as the dress I returned. I don’t know what happened to the quality of the dress in just 2-3 weeks but it would be nice if seller could fix it."
1.0,EDIT: my original review is below. I still think the cameos are beautiful and I bought it for myself because I liked them so much BUT now I REALLY REGRET BUYING it and spending that much money for such POOR QUALITY. I tried it on when I first got it and wore it for like 15 min only then about 2 months later I actually had an event I could wear it too ( not practical for me to wear at work or home) when I took it out it looks like the gold is rubbed off along the outside of the back of each and every cameo and clasp!!! Perhaps but is just tarnished but how? I had no lotions or perfumes on and only wore for 15 min!!! I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED! I wish it wasn't too late to return. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING BETTER QUALITY.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is beautiful. I love it but it is impossible to put on yourself.....and no I don't have any hand or carpal tunnel problems. I am looking to buy a magnetic clasp converter....there is a very expensive one made by the same brand which seems a bit intentional.....I will be shopping around.
1.0,"I realize I didn't pay much for this necklace, but was still surprised and disappointed to have it tarnish within the first 24 hours of wearing it.  I put it on at around 10 AM, wore it all day and fell asleep with it on. (maybe weird, but still...that's what I did).  When I woke up in the morning my neck was black and the &#34;silver&#34; on the chain had worn off enough to look like copper in several places.  I'll never wear it again, of course.  Its too bad because its a very cute necklace!!"
1.0,"Good quality, but the sizing is off, trust the negative reviews, definitely runs small"
1.0,"The ring was almost impossible to clasp, and also the one ring broke as soon as I opened it. It's cheap and crap."
1.0,It’s missing the black gem in the middle!! Also the brooch was poorly glued... What a waste of money!
1.0,"The dimensions are not at listed. Instead of being 5"" wide, it is only 3"" wide so it barely covers any surface."
1.0,"One glove came working fine, but the other malfunctions...."
1.0,Does not look like photo. Has black straps instead of white such a shame took forever to get here.
1.0,don't waste your money. the second band was way too loose and looks terrible.
1.0,The bras were so cheaply made. Had to return them
1.0,Tienen un olor muy desagradable
1.0,"The cup size was way off (small), it was itchy, no stretch, and the cups themselves were bizarrely pointed. This is the most poorly made bra I have ever come across."
1.0,There's a reason this watch was 75% off when I bought it and in no way is this a $40 retail watch.  I have seen better quality watches a the dollar store.
1.0,I ordered 4 of the mirror-silver-frame wayfarer sunglasses and ended up with aviators.
1.0,No battery. Even though it specified ‘battery included’<br />Returning it asap
1.0,Looks like a potato sack.  I may try to tax a small piece of blk elastic in back -otherwise I wouldn't wear it.
1.0,"Too short, material not the best quality"
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:9d74c48b3cfa9a863c00ddf6f763b824]] I ordered the first one and when it came the jaw was defective, it was completely crooked and then the top teeth portion fell right off, it’s only affixed w double sided tape which won’t hold.  I sent a replacement request which they immediately sent out a new one and it did arrive, however it not only has the same defective bottom jaw that is totally crooked but again the top teeth denture plate was not attached and..... on the second one the fur is not even properly attached and it’s coming off, as is visible in<br />The video I attached.  I’m sending both back and getting my money back because for the price this should not be so cheap let alone come broken, defective and falling apart."
1.0,I was so disappointed since I have 2 other hats from this company that fit me. In comparison this was huge. Came way down over both ears. I looked like a little kid trying on Daddy's hat. I returned it. Continuing my quest for a decent hat for my little girl head.
1.0,Stones started falling off after first few days.  One month from purchase totally fell apart.  Very disappointed
1.0,Was super cute when recieved them my son loved them and started wearing them in september for school and by october they were falling apart :(
1.0,I loved them until they broke. They literally fell apart on my 5th day wearing them I was so disappointed. Epic fail!!!!!
1.0,Horrible fabric stretches out extremely unflattering
1.0,Way too small and almost as much to ship back as it cost. 😬😬
1.0,"The pin fell off from the back  the first day I wore it.  To make things worst, I had only pined it to a thin blouse."
1.0,"These are your typical Chinese t-shirts - very small in size - very cheaply made.<br />I realize most t-shirts are now made off-shore, but these t-shirts are terrible<br />I bought two of these t-shirts - one XL for my son and one L for my grandson. Both were too small.<br />I was going to wash my truck with them but they were not even good enough for that.<br />I would not recommend this vendor. They ship from China and that takes 3 weeks.<br />There are much better vendors on this site - better quality and faster delivery - I would suggest you use one of them."
1.0,Super thin and to shiney
1.0,So my tan colored umbrellas turned pink within 3 weeks on the side exposed to the sun which looks absolutely ridiculous....
1.0,The e is sowed in to the hoody
1.0,Poor quality material and you can see right through the pants. Unfortunately I will be returning them.
1.0,The fabric caused allergies
1.0,Adult only item.
1.0,THIS IS A SWIMSUIT TOP. It's NOT a bralette. The clasp was tarnished and it's cheaply made. Awful.
1.0,Terrible quality. Feels awful to the touch.
1.0,"I had to return this item, it was a Medium, but it fit like a Large."
1.0,Too white.  Every white top I have was not white enough.
1.0,"About 3 sizes too small. Sleeves are long, but the material doesn't line up underneath arms. Not as long as what is pictured. Material is light and thin."
1.0,After wearing a few times the stone fell out  they are very pretty but it would be more of a hassle to return them. Requested a replacement but was sent a partial label and told to pay postage to return them.
1.0,"I ordered one visor in cream and another in purple.  They sent me a bright pink visor and supposedly, the purple visor is on its way.  When I tried to get an exchange, the system says that it is not possible for this product because it may be out of stock. If they send the purple visor at least one of us will have what they wanted.  I'm the buyer and am left totally dissatisfied."
1.0,"it literally broke in half, two days after I can't return it anymore!"
1.0,No top came in package & the bottoms were stain as of they had been worn before! Worse buy so far!
1.0,These run smaller. My foot slid down even though they were too small. No arch support. I only tried them on. They were immediately a no go
1.0,"Stitching is already falling apart with no uses just trying it on. All zippers sit against bare skin and you can feel them all. The main zipper is hit and miss to get to work. Half the time it will not line up and very hard to get to start to zip up. Not meant for any really cold weather or any actual rain.. soaks right into the jacket does not repel like pictures show. “Watermark” is also not the same, no written care instructions like in the item pictures.Symbol mean do not wash........ Not washable really China.....Just all around not the same thing as displayed in pictures"
1.0,"I love this brand and have bought many items from them but this one is a miss.<br />You could call it lightweight, but it is not breathable material. Its like a shirt made out of pantyhose. It is also very tight around the wrists - it always makes me itch terrible on my wrists when working out. Because of these things, this particular item, I would not buy again and would not recommend."
1.0,"Nice, cute bathing suit. Would have given 5 stars,  But I payed $28 for it and the tag attached to the suit says $10.47 from Wal-Mart. Triple the price. Ridiculous!!"
1.0,"Way to thin, it's annoying to wear"
1.0,Very cheap material that will rip at any given moment. I didn’t even wear it. Not worth it at all!
1.0,these have no change in shape from ankle to knee and cut off circulation instead of helping it.  I would have returned these if i had not tossed them into the closet to deal with later and forgotten about them.
1.0,Cheaply made and not worth the price
1.0,"So, yeah... all sorts of green nose issues from the brass"
1.0,"Poor craftsmanship, right out of the package and its already got a broken button for the mouth cover. Very unimpressed with that."
1.0,"Up-date. Beware..This shows in my size and color , Free Returns. So I took a chance and bought it. Big mistake!<br />But when I tried to return this, now the seller wants me to pay for International shipping!!<br />This was a 2 star, now its a One star.<br />I called Amazon, and they took care of my refund.<br />Amazon is the Best, that is why I shop on Amazon.<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />The design is ok  but the gray is a strange color. I can't even describe it!<br />For me it ran big, Hugh. I ordered a large, as I can’t figure out if some of the clothes from china ,run bigger, or smaller !.<br />I’m 5’2 138 lbs, older women,  and this was too big, or tight in the wrong places!!!.<br />Around the neck was saggy, and so was the back part of the neck..<br />The back near my waist  was sewed uneven, but in the wrong places.<br /><br />I have found out these tops are a hit or miss. I guess it depends on who is sewing them..Are they 10 years old, or what?<br /><br />The top part has No seams, its made from one piece of material,including the  sleeves , very strange.<br /> The bottom part is a separate piece of material that is sewed  on.<br /><br />I’m returning this.<br />Btw, it took a month to finally receive this!!"
1.0,Looks like something a street walker would wear
1.0,"Es demasiado ancho y no tiene relación con el collarín por donde debe entrar el pie, es muy angosto y casi sin elasticidad. Evidentemente tiene un error de diseño."
1.0,My daughter is size 5 n shoes n the slippers run to small
1.0,"The earrings were put together backwards and I can't return them.  I know it's only 5 dollars, but still it's the principle."
1.0,Zipper broke before I put it on and the quality sucks!
1.0,"Tarnished in 24 hours , not even touched by any liquid"
1.0,Did not fit my wife at all
1.0,Misleading as it is a lightweight material.
1.0,The silver flakes were not consistent throughtout...some pieces had just one flake. The biggest issue is that the resin is yellow and cloudy. Not transparent like the advertisement. Looks crusty and old. I can not use these. Will be returning.
1.0,"Ordered a medium and it was way too small. I am by no means large and one of the buttons ripped through the fabric, and can no longer be returned. I feel like I got scammed for $16z"
1.0,"Arrived smashed, looked like the face melted,  the back is the sheerest, most low quality fabric I've ever seen. Took a month to get here. DO NOT BUY THIS"
1.0,Ordered correct size was way small
1.0,Not Swiss. Not a tourbillon.
1.0,This was a very disappointing purchase.  I carried it ONCE and the main zipper split and would not go back together.  VERY poor quality - and too late to return.  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!
1.0,"Luckily broke before I put weight on the strap. (Was just about to try it out.) The back of the button fell off and the strap flew open. It looked great, but not going to risk it. Switched to a string."
1.0,This item is so small it is ridiculous.
1.0,"When I met my first husband, I was wearing a Jessica nametag. I always got more dates wearing that nametag. Apparently, the wrong type of dates, but that's a story for another time.<br /><br />I got this necklace for my daughter, but I'm fairly certain she's going to have no use for a Sarah necklace because that's not her name.<br /><br />They call me ""Hell""<br />They call me ""Stacey""<br />They call me ""her""<br />They call me ""Jane""<br />That's not my name<br />That's not my name<br /><br />There's nothing more useless than a necklace with someone else's name.<br /><br />That's not my name.<br /><br />I'd consider giving this to someone named Sarah, but it looks like costume jewelry, and the only Sarah I know is an adult who probably wouldn't appreciate it."
1.0,Did not work at all
1.0,"The face masks were junk material with product slips in Asian characters/writing, so while it may have shipped from the US, that is not the product origin. There's no way I'm putting this on my child's face. I have to pay the return shipping cost too (which the product isn't worth the cost to ship, let alone the price I originally paid).  Save your money and buy a better quality product."
1.0,The chain broke as soon as I took it out of the bag.
1.0,"I ordered an xl and when I got them I could barely put them on, come to find out they were one size fits all... so thanks for that."
1.0,"This ring appeared as a Mystic Topaz, mainly purple with slight flashes of green, never turning a full green, even under fluorescent 6000k bulbs. Very sad as this really is a very pretty ring, and other Silvershake rings properly change from green to pinkish-purple. Returned as I was looking for a color change Alexandrite, not a Mystic Topaz."
1.0,Broke instantly. Barely any force.
1.0,I got this band for my wife back at Christmas. Yesterday she was walking and the metal that connects the band to the watch broke. It wasn't hit. It just snapped and the watch fell on the concrete driveway and cracked the screen. Very upset with this product. Just became a much more expensive purchase. Looks like I am not the only one that this has happened to.
1.0,Bad material. To stretchy for me
1.0,"These shoes are just fashion work boots , after one month this work boot bottom  was out for the count ."
1.0,Much prettier online than in actuality
1.0,Do not worth the price at all!!
1.0,Poorly made product. I've had this for a week and it's already begun to tarnish and bend. If my husband wasn't so amused with this I'd be returning it immediately. I'm very unhappy with the product.
1.0,I never saw the girl I get it for wearing it :(
1.0,Cute but you can't get them on your foot the space is to Small and then elastic won't stretch enough. So sad and can't return because I don't the have box etc. I just assumed they would fit!
1.0,I bought these for a child who has wide feet. The slippers squished the feet too much.
1.0,Was not flattering to my shape.
1.0,"Ordered a 5x. It was more like a large or maybe, maybe an xl. And it was super short!"
1.0,"Bad materials, low quality boxer!"
1.0,"I ordered a small in Black, I am 5’8 and weigh 111lbs. The sewn in waistband is 4 inches thick and so tight it basically cuts off your circulation. They are extremely uncomfortable and the material is shiny. Not what I anticipated, but I gave them a chance. Wore them once and I was so uncomfortable with the waistband I took a scissors to the waistband so I could breath for the rest of the day. Not worth returning. You get what you pay for..."
1.0,Lenses peeled after 2 days of use
1.0,Sweatshirt was ripped on sleeve. Really weird small material
1.0,"Design was nice, I just didn't care for the material, too silky, like a night gown.  Also, longer than what I wanted."
1.0,Do not wear in public because everyone will see your panties. I will wear them to the beach as a cover up for my butt :~)
1.0,"These are some sort of plastic, not &#34;oxidized sterling silver&#34; as advertised. Also as you can see in the attached pic, they are more of a brownish red then the true red I saw in the product picture. They are nice enough, but not worth the $30+ price I paid."
1.0,"Hard plastic treads. previous pair were softer rubber.<br />Bottom of shoe (must have a plate in it.)<br />It bent and has a ""bunch"" in the arch now."
1.0,"These glasses are not polarized.  They include a picture of a empty road throught a forest.  When you put on the glasses you are supposed to see cars on the road, but with these glasses nothing appeared.  When I tried viewing it with my regular polarized sunglasses,  there suddenly appear three cars on the road.  This is the second pair I returned that were not polarized as advertised.  First pair was a different company but it seems they all buy their polarized lens matrerial from China."
1.0,"I bought an XXXL because I wanted it to fit like the pic, I'm a normal size 10/12  however this shirt in an XXXL would fit someone size 5/6. Disappointed in the size,"
1.0,I purchased these glasses 3 different times. The little screws always back out and the lens drops. 3 week return policy is a bunch of crap! Will NEVER purchase from them again!!!!!
1.0,This is nothing like the photo :/ I don’t know wbhy I expected to actually receive what was pictured but just know that white fluff in the photo in nothing like what you’re receiving.
1.0,Straps are very small. Even my 5 year old can't wear it by herself and remove. Very tight to put it in and take it off. We need to help them.
1.0,The bands were not the same color! One half was darker than the other.
1.0,"The neckline is horrible, it’s huge and the bottom area where the snaps are are super small. Leaves gaps when you snap and falls of the shoulder! Definitely do not recommend."
1.0,There is a back spot on one of the yellow beads that will not come off. Will be returning product.
1.0,", will damage newer piercings trying to maneuver to make this fit"
1.0,"These boots are fake.. received these as a gift for Christmas. I knew when I couldn't get my heel into the boot that something was off.  I have 2 other pairs of Uggs I have bought from the department stores different styles they all fit the same..I instantly knew these were a fake. Box wasn't sturdy the UGG tags are wrong and the tissue paper is wrong. Also they didn't come with a typical Uggs card inside and the tags on the inside of the shoe are wrong. If you hold the sole up to a real Ugg boot - you instantly know. Would someone who hasn't had any uggs know the difference? I don't think so. if these were cheap it wouldn't be an issue, but they aren't. Do yourself a favor and just buy from their website directly or go to a department store."
1.0,This bikini is absolutely horrible. The top dug into my sternum and the V is very crooked. Bad quality.<br />Returning.
1.0,"Cheap looking, goes with the price.  The large was huge and the medium too small.  Weird."
1.0,Scamer never buy
1.0,"The sweater sent to me is REALLY undersized - looks like child sizing.  I love the color and like the material, but sent it back bc it is way too small on me."
1.0,"I bought these shorts for everyday use, but the material was extremely light weight.  The pockets were zippered and too narrow to let my hand in them."
1.0,"Ahhhh,  what a disappointment! Thankfully they were cheap.  I guess you get what you pay for.  They fit great,  look awesome! Even got a compliment 1st time out on them.  One huge problem.... Don't get them wet!!! Came in from a down pour and wiped them off.  Checked them 2 minutes later and they have the coating from the glasses coming off or its stained.  Can't get it off for nothing.  Loved them besides that.  Can't even wear them now...."
1.0,"The shirt fits perfect and is breathable material, however it not as aligning to my posture as other posture shirts."
1.0,"Horrible shape... makes you look like your nipples are showing... or like you have 2 on each side,  dissappointment... Don’t waste your money!"
1.0,One bracelet arrived broken
1.0,Wife doesn't care.  Waste of money
1.0,"It doesn’t stretch at all. Even if I could get it over my head, it be so tight not only squishing my nose to the point of bleeding, but can’t even breathe with it on. I highly wouldn’t recommend unless you’re willing to buy extra material to add on to it. Waste of money."
1.0,"I had to refund this dress. The bust libe was all wrong and the dress is very unflattering. Made me look 3 x the size I really am. I will say the quality WAS very nice, but my girls were flopping everywhere and if i wore a bra it would be completely exposed"
1.0,"The first pair had the glass fall out after two days and another pair’s side piece broke off the first week. They are nice looking glasses, but fragile."
1.0,The velcro was shot after 3 months. Garbage:(
1.0,"the zippers are tough to open/close. product is very poorly manufactured. I am returning the bag today, because of it's poor quality difficulty to use."
1.0,I dont know why but I wore this ring for a couple weeks and it made my finger blister up and start peeling under where the ring was.
1.0,The rose gold came off after after 2 weeks
1.0,"Fit was horrible, straps too long!"
1.0,Quality is not that great and the little cartoon character came off within a week. I would not buy it again.
1.0,I didn't get the product I selected.  The color looks washed out and fake. I was very disappointed.
1.0,"When putting the spring into the slots, it bounces out right away and won't stay in. The original Seiko click spring fit in right away with little effort, but this one just won't stay in."
1.0,"I bought this dress in the hopes of wearing it to a Christmas party. I was not sure how it would fit because there were mixed reviews, so, I bought another size and color. The sizing is wierd and inconsistent.<br /><br />A medium size in two different colors is not the same. Clearly, this is mass produced without attention to quality. The dress was flimsy, material was poor quality and disappointing. When I tried it, I was afraid it would tear or something. Forget about washing this in a machine, I think because of the sequins it may not be possible at all, but I did not try. I ended up returning it.<br /><br />I would not recommend."
1.0,"Price I paid: $3.30<br /><br />The goal of these glasses are to reduce the amount of blue light on a screen to reduce eye-strain. In actuality, all they do is provide a slight yellow tint that doesn't reduce blue light levels at all. I have provided a picture of the glasses looking at two lines. If these glasses truly worked properly, the two lines would look fairly similar. As you can tell, the lines still look different in the picture. On top of this, when using them for about an hour, I could still feel the same amount of eye-strain I would normally get just staring at the monitor with no glasses."
1.0,"Be warned these shirts are made of a terrible fabric. It feels like wearing a 70s throw pillow. One touch and I knew it, I didn’t even bother to put it on. Went right in the discard box"
1.0,Es muy corta para niños mayores de 5 años .<br />La pinza no se queda en su lugar se resbala y necesita ser ajustada cada momento
1.0,"I would give it no stars if this was an option.  Came missing a stone, and broken"
1.0,They arrived very stretched out.
1.0,I’m very disappointed in this purchase.  The material is nothing like the photo’s and not sized correctly.  I will be returning this item for a refund.
1.0,THIS ITEM HAS ABSOLUTELY NO RESEMBLANCE OF ITEM DEPICTED. **PURE TRASH **
1.0,The side edge broke and now catches on my clothes and scratches my arm. I’ve had bands like this in the past that lasted a year or longer. Very disappointed.
1.0,Bought these for my bridesmaids they arrived two weeks after the wedding. The first one I opened broke in half. Don’t waste your time
1.0,"For my last watch purchase and it's replacement both had problems with the ""seconds"" hand. It keeps on stopping . I'm afraid this will be my last watch purchase from Amazon. Too bad the past 4 purchases turned out fine. Grew tired of returning my watch and wait for another replacement. SO LONG GUYS YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME PURCHASE AGAIN. QUALITY IS NOT GOOD!! IM JO5 GIVING YOU EVEN 1 STAR FOR IT."
1.0,WAY TOO SMALL!!! Ordered extra large they fit like a medium.
1.0,"I love the design on the shirt. However I  ordered a 3x, the tag says 3x, but it fits like a large. Waaay too small and big waste of my money."
1.0,broke within a day.
1.0,"These lenses are losing it's coating, have scratches everywhere and are not durable at all.  I have only cleaned them with the cleaning cloth that was included with the lenses and I am still having this problem.  I have had them for 1.5 months and I have to replace them again because I can not see out of them at all.  I would NOT recommend REVANT LENSES."
1.0,Really uncomfortable.  Sent back and never got a refund...said it was lost and I needed proof. Not worth it or the money.
1.0,its not as shown in photos i thrown it in the trash bin....
1.0,"As I diabetic, I sometimes get stasis dermatitis - an itchy rash on my lower legs.  At the recommendation of my doctor, I wear compression stockings.  This helps with the circulation in my legs and helps prevent the itchy rash.  I bought these stockings because they were a higher compression level than what I had been using.  They did not help - after just a couple days, my legs broke out!<br /><br />They are comfortable, with nicely padded feet.  However, they would be miserable and too hot to wear in the summer.  Overall, I would not recommend these."
1.0,There was paint or markings splattered on the chrome. Need to send back
1.0,"Alarm worked for a while, then, when I wanted to change the alarm time, it no longer vibrates. Waste of money."
1.0,This item was cheaply made. I did not like it at all. I would not recommend this item ever!
1.0,Awful shiny material like thick running tights.  This is going back.
1.0,I Purchased another one said it was the same size but it’s actually maybe a half an inch shorter and I have a big wrist
1.0,Useless  came about 5 sizes too small and poorly made
1.0,Definitely does not fit loosely as expected. I would suggest sizing up.
1.0,This ring is a gem! My new favorite! The colors are gorgeous! I'll be buying a couple more
1.0,Who sells baby and toddler clothes that shrink in the wash/dryer. Bought a 4t washed it and it came out the size of my 1 year olds clothes. My fault because I didn't check the wash instructions because I never would have thought to check because seriously who sells clothes that are going to shrink for kids??????
1.0,"This shirt fits nothing like the photo. It's boxy, shorter, and weird."
1.0,"cannot get the ball off for the life of me... tried prying it open with plyers, and with gloves and a lot of force, didn't budge. It's really cute and I want to wear it but i can't. &lt;/3"
1.0,Se rompieron muy pronto.😡
1.0,It was too cheesey
1.0,It’s steady breaking
1.0,"I purchased this 3 sizes larger than I usually take in case I needed to wear a sweater underneath.  When I put it on, it would not close in front by 6 inches.  Very disappointing."
1.0,Looks super cheap and nothing like the photo. The material is thin and the design is stamped on rather than woven in. The colors are also off. The &quot;cream&quot; part is more brownish.
1.0,Se caen súper rápido los nudos. O están bien hechos la calidad es buena
1.0,Low in price and low in quality. Waste of money.
1.0,"You get what you pay for here.  It's nothing more than two rough-cut pieces of plastic (carbon fiber?) with an elastic band around them.  I personally didn't like the fact that basically all your cards are together like a sandwich and they move around around easily.  I stuck this thing in my pocket and I'd pull it out and everything would be out-of-alignment, one card sticking out farther than the other, etc. -- it was a mess.  Plus the edges on the plastic pieces are rough-cut, not smooth.  The whole program is bad.  I returned it."
1.0,Turned my finger green but says it's stainless steel.
1.0,"I love the sayings on the tanks but they are really see through. I am sure for some its not a huge deal, but I don't feel comfortable at the gym working out in a see through top. I had to return them."
1.0,i don't like it
1.0,Way too small. NOT true to size at all.
1.0,Items were much smaller than described would not buy again
1.0,"The L pants were too small.  Returned them.  Returning them was impressive.  Took them to Whole Foods.  Received the refund, was really quick.  The pants seemed too clingy to my skin also."
1.0,"Runs small, paper thin/see through, and arrived with a 3 inch hole on the lower left side. Don't waste your money."
1.0,I've just realize that it wasn't in the delivery box with the other products.
1.0,Not true to size. I ordered one size larger and it was still to small for my granddaughter
1.0,Poorly made. Bad material. Way too small. Have to ship to China for refund. Waste of money :(
1.0,Horrible hat. looks nothing like photo and mask does not attach correctly cheap crap definetly returning
1.0,They don’t match the picture at all and are a horrible dark blue color. They don’t match the dress I bought them for and I’ll have to wear something else.
1.0,Ordered correct size. Item two small across bust
1.0,The material is almost like jersey not formal.
1.0,"I should have read the one review before buying! The print is so blurry,  it looks ridiculous.  I want my money back."
1.0,Piece of junk. Do not order this
1.0,This product is nice but it broke right off the where the ball connects in just 2 days . Poorly made waste of time and money !
1.0,Horrible Quality
1.0,This kept riding up over my derriere. It seemed to go higher and higher as the day went on. There were very visible lines under my dress across my buttocks. I spent the entire day trying to pulling the garment down. The section in the back that is sheer was positioned over my lower back and not my bum! The center of the garment did hold in my waist very well. The straps were too wide and dug into the area just above my armpit. The skin is still red and sore 3 days later.
1.0,Poor quality material and it has a line type defect in the material that I notice when I put it on. I don’t wear it because of that. Too late to return so I will donate to goodwill
1.0,Did not like these at all. The pants had to come over my belly button in order to fit. The top fit decent but was still too long. I ordered a medium and I'm a 5'8 woman and medium is my normal size in everything. The material was also very scratchy and uncomfortable. They were cheap but not at all worth saving a few dollars. Will be returning.
1.0,"Arrived missing one of the nose pads, which renders the glasses unwearable."
1.0,It is nothing like the picture it looks like a dam sleeping dress dnt order this !!!!
1.0,"First off these sunglasses are flimsy and cheaply made!<br />I purchased a (4) lens package of Rx'd wraparounds.  This pair uses a prescription insert inside of the colored wraps.  I wanted them for (2) reasons.  1.  I wanted a pair of ANSI rated lenses (not necessarily &#34;safety&#34; glasses, but I was willing to use them for this purpose, even though they were not said to be &#34;safety&#34;) that conformed to US standards as these said they did (The ANSI Z87.1-2003 standard includes requirements for basic impact and high impact protection. In the basic impact test, a 1 in (2.54 cm) steel ball is dropped on the lens from a height of 50 in (127 cm). In the high velocity test, a 1/4 in (6.35 mm) steel ball is shot at the lens at 150 ft/s (45.72 m/s). To pass both tests, no part of the lens may touch the eye. [22] (Sub-section of ANSI Z80.3)<br />After looking at the ANSI standard that they conformed to , I summarized they would indeed perform as needed in my first criteria and circumstances.<br />2.  I wanted a pair of wrap around Rx sunglasses.  Sunglasses that would &#34;double&#34; as work glasses and sunglasses.  All I needed was a series of lenses that would give me clear lenses for inside buildings with prescription inserts and replaceable lenses of differing shade of sun protection for outside.  VIOLA!  Rapid had just what I wanted !<br />What I got was exactly as I wanted, except within the first (2) weeks the tabs that attach the outer wraps of my darkest sunglasses wraps broke of one of the two minuscule little crap plastic nubs, rendering the darkest wrap unusable.<br />No biggie!  I had (2) other colored lenses with the set.  OK I figured it was my fault, I hadn't put on my regular reading glasses to perform the removal and installation of the wrap lenses to change from the clear lens to a colored lens and as small as the tabs are, I snapped one of those<br />little suckers off.  Disappointed, yes!  Did I figure it was their (Rapid) fault, no.  A little cheaply made, YES!  I consider myself to have extraordinary dexterity (I'm a Toolmaker/Machinist) but I realized that these were a small plastic framed pair of glasses.<br />I did wonder how the average schmoes would accomplish this task when it showed difficult for me, the &#34;metal surgeon&#34; that I am!!!!.  But Oh Well!<br />A couple of weeks later, I was cleaning the clear wraps with soap and hot water under the faucet, when I snapped of the right lens from the plastic frame!  Are you FREAKIN KIDDING ME!!!!!<br />What a piece of SH_T !<br />Now keep in mind I work with extremely precision instruments every day measuring Tenths of  Thousands of an inch.  My trade takes the deft touch of a &#34;Vascular Surgeon&#34; every minute of every day to hold these types of tolerances.  So I would realistically consider my dexterity in the upper 1% of the human population!  Can't imagine the what rest of you &#34;fumble fingered&#34; population would do!<br />Oh WELL, what are you going to do?<br />I had resigned my $200+ wrap around &#34;multi-purpose&#34; glasses  to be only sunglasses at this point.<br />So, on Janurary 28th I decided to ger replacement lenses for the busted up lenses that were no longer usable.<br />I went online and ordered a couple of lenses and some parts to fix a lens and now I'm waiting!  Remember this is the UK we are dealing with!  This may take some time.  A few weeks right?  You know they probably have to go through ultra violet and molecular screening from the Department of Homeland Security to make sure that they aren't Taliban or ISIS, contraband or Drug Cartel Cocaine made to look like sunglasses.  You understand what I'm talking about, don't you?<br />So yesterday (Feb 26) I figured enough is enough!  I emailed the company, Rapid Eye wear, and said basically, Hey! Wear is my lenses I ordered,  My Visa has been billed and I haven't seen squat from Rapid.  What gives?<br />Mr John Clark from Rapid Eye Wear responded by telling me that the problem was on my end.  &#34;They (USPS) said there was a problem with my address and it was undeliverable.  Huh?<br />I've lived in this house for 22 years, I get pounds of mail each and every day from the United States Postal Service, I can't imagine that the problem was on my end.<br />I checked the order confirmation I printed out when I placed the order.  Yup!  It was me I had them bill it to!  Yup! it was my address I had them send it to!<br />Mr John Clark supplied me with a tracking number that I checked online.<br />And low and behold they transposed wrong numbers on the shipping label and sent my package into Postal Service LIMBO!<br />Mr John Clark was absolutely &#34;dead on right&#34;  The problem was on my end!<br />Cause I'm still waiting for their product that I have already paid for to arrive!<br />My Bad!<br />Sorry to have assumed that you did something incorrect!"
1.0,looks smaller in picture wanted something smaller
1.0,"Poor quality, sleeves are coming apart. Very improperly sized. The left sleeve is longer than the right. I would NOT recommend this product. Save your money ladies because this is a WASTE!"
1.0,"I was stupid and in a hurry to buy tons of gifts for coworkers with only a few days left before I left my company. As such, I didn't pay attention and bought this not seeing the obvious spelling mistake. (Lifes).<br /><br />So now I have a useless gift and no time to return it or purchase something different.<br /><br />Angry and disappointed"
1.0,Cheap junk hat
1.0,My 4yrs old girl don't like it won't stay up it roll down . She is wearing a dress i tought is perfect for her to wear she get cold her legs. She never wear anymore. Hope this reviews help
1.0,I feel like I was ripped off. Not allowed to return to Amazon is not a full service company.<br />Very disappointed.<br />To order a XL item should mean some moving room. It fit like a small size.
1.0,"I've received some pretty low quality stuff off of Amazon before, because I am the kind of person that doesn't care how much an item costs, or how &#34;low quality&#34; it might be considered to some, as long as it fits well. After some trial and error, I have learned to simply order multiple of what I am looking for, and return whatever I don't like. This was definitely returned, almost before I had it entirely out of the box! The body of the cap is totally fine, just your average hat... and then we get to the bill. As long as a freaking Subway sandwich, no exaggeration. Okay, maybe a little exaggeration. Still, unless you want to be hitting the windshield of your car with the bill of your hat, pass on this one. *shudder*"
1.0,"These panniers are flimsy and could barely support a lightweight satin! Not only are they expensive but they did not come quickly by any means! Do not buy these panniers, they are not worth it! If you are looking for panniers, make your own or find another seller, honestly, anything but these panniers would work well. The only good thing was that they could compress into a small shape which is helpful for storage."
1.0,"This cap is small for a child’s head, it seems AND the “E” is not centered on the cap.  Throwing away."
1.0,The product looks nothing like the picture it all and it fits weird the arms are too tight the dress is too short to be a floor-length dress like it's supposed to be and I am only 5 5 and cosima ankle and a portion of my calf muscle
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:8c36cfc872ef4d09ddf6d3d017f34701]] No stars! Overpriced, low quality, cheap, unattractive, pure marketing gimmick, waste of money. I got all these casio watches for the PRICE i got the original grain watch!!! Back when I bought it in Dec 2016 I paid $108 with a $25 discount! Now they want to charge $169 ??? No way. Invest your money in a tried and tested brand like Casio, Seiko etc and don’t break the bank! Anyways taking a video here sucks bc the I couldn’t focus the camera but other than that’s I hope this helps!"
1.0,"This purse was horribly disappointing.  When I opened it, there was an overwhelming odor eminating from it.  It smelled like gasoline.  It was disgusting.  I rushed it out of the house and put it in the garage until I could return it.  Unfortunately I was too busy to return it so I simply threw it out in the trash.  What a waste of money!"
1.0,"Read the reviews and ordered a size up however was still too small. Requested a return it stated that I would have to pay for shipping. Being charged a restocking fee as...Just sad runs really small plus poor material, but for the price so so"
1.0,Way too large. Proportions were way off. Looks more like a dress one might wear in a thanksgiving school play
1.0,One strap was broken and the dress had deodorant stains. I am so upset. This is clearly not a new dress.
1.0,Too thin. Too small. Faded after the first wash. Thumbs down
1.0,I spent a lot of money trying to get the right size even an extra large is a small to me wouldn't do it again.
1.0,Omg more like extra small.<br /> the medium was small so I order the large and it’s the same size as the medium<br />I returned them
1.0,Zipper broke after 2 days of wearing and i really like this bag.
1.0,So much smaller than expected
1.0,Product packaging was opened when received and product received was not as pictured or described. The material is not moisture wicking - it is a thick cotton. And I ordered a plain black visor and received what is pictured.
1.0,"When I opened the packing, many of the beads were coming off already, I am not sure about wearing it in a party as it might come off any time...won't recommend this product to anyone!"
1.0,not the right size for a fitbit flex. doesn't fit at all
1.0,Won’t stay clasped. Won’t wear again.
1.0,Already changing colors. Looks so Fake. Cheap.
1.0,"Not sure where these glasses come from (but I can imagine). The level of magnification is nothing like the level shown on the package. I purchased level 3.25X and the magnification is significantly less than a pair I purchased from a pharmacy store (2,5X). In short, don't waste your money on these."
1.0,"I wear an XL, purchased an XL and a 2X in case they ran a little small. The 2x fit me like a Small and these shirts are not as pretty in person as they are made to look in the pics."
1.0,"Stupid, waste of money.  Does not help with glare, only makes it more difficult to see at night."
1.0,"Update 2: I received a replacement pair. Seams were fine but now I have to drop the review down to 1 star again. This time the issue is I received a dark navy blue. I guess they didn't have another gray to send. That's fine as I was able to choose which one I wanted. The problem however is that this color bleeds. I washed it with colors but I have a couple items that got stained. I have since worn it another time and I have been having to hand wash it and it still bleeds blue. I am hoping that after a while, it would stop bleeding and I could wash it with the regular wash. Note that I have these in both gray and black as well and neither of the two bleed. Only the navy blue does so it depends which color you get. The company kept having me go back and forth. First I emailed to let them know, then they asked for a follow up email explaining the issue, then now they want pictures of the faded product. It doesn't look faded to me but doesn't mean it doesn't bleed. I am just overall done with them and its been a waste of time.<br /><br />Update 1: I received a message from the seller stating ""The durability issue didn't happen quite often, thanks so much to bring this concern to us. I will raise it to the manufacture department. Sincerely thank you.<br />According to our satisfied guarantee, here are the solutions offered to you, please advice.<br />Would you like to give this shorts another chance? I will be more than happy to request Amazon to send you a new one if you want to give it another chance. Do you think it makes sense? Please advice. The durability issue didn't happen quite often, thanks so much to bring this concern to us. I will raise it to the manufacture department. Sincerely thank you."" I have accepted them sending another pair. I have increased the review to 2 stars for them addressing the issue. I will update the review further as needed.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I have only worn this item once and it is already separating at the seam. I have contacted the seller and have not<br />received a response back. I like the fit but let me also point out that they also do not wick sweat well. I used them on an 11 mile run in Florida and I got really sweaty. They were mostly soaking wet by the time I was done. It is not due to the material composition as I use another brand that wicks sweat so much better. The reason why I got these is the pockets that I use for my phone. Road to 5 stars would be that it last longer than 1 run and that it should wick better. To get it to be better than 5 stars would be improvement on compression. These are so stretchy that they have minimal compression."
1.0,Hole on top where chain goes through snapped right off shortly after receiving. Cheaply made. Would not recommend or purchase again.
1.0,waste of money but you get what you pay for
1.0,Very flimsy! Bent the same day
1.0,Not really white. Has an ivory tint
1.0,Runs extremely small. Returned the same day.
1.0,"I was expecting the product shown in the picture, but got something totally different"
1.0,Very pool quality. I returned this item.
1.0,"Very tight , it cuts my circulation."
1.0,"It says 2x  on the product fit, but it's NOT. It's smaller"
1.0,"The top and sleeves are beautiful, but the skirt is WAY too tight in the hips! I can't wear this dress!"
1.0,"took forever to come , then it wasn't what I expected."
1.0,Did not like the texture of us felt cheap
1.0,They are junk. The &#34;pearl&#34; wasn't even on one and fell off the other the first time I wore it.
1.0,The watch looks good but picks up 15 seconds a day.
1.0,Watch was broken upon when received
1.0,"It fell apart within just 3 weeks of it being delivered.  The glue came undone on the edges, the seams began to rip.  This is a piece of junk!  Don't waste your money!"
1.0,The item said come with T shirts and pants but I received pants only
1.0,My regular size is a lrg-xlrg. Shirt was ordered in an xlrg waaaay to small.
1.0,"To thin , not warm buyer beware"
1.0,"I was very excited to get this however, it does fit going on but getting it off is a nightmare. In addition I see that as a blessing in disguise as the ring tarnishes my finger which prevents me from wearing it, the discoloration is gone now but I was highly dissapointed when I'd found out. I don't recommend buying from this seller."
1.0,"There’s nothing like a cheap suit. Ordered this suit for a special occasion. I read the reviews and ordered the next size up due to bad reviews on the size, so I would normally wear a large in most clothes, but the jacket fit well as a large, the pants were hip huggers, not a very professional look. Thanks but no thanks."
1.0,As it turns out this isn’t turquoise; it is simulated turquoise (color way off) painted over rock or some hard material.  The band has now broken in the bottom middle.  $31.25 is way too much to pay for such a poor imitation passed on to be turquoise.
1.0,"Ordered the largest and it was still too small, these is for a woman that's xs or a child"
1.0,Broke first wear.
1.0,It's as white as a piece of paper. super bummed.
1.0,The chain is really cheep. I wouldn’t buy it had I known.
1.0,"Too small. Had to return for larger size, would recommend sizing up."
1.0,It has a v shaped neck line which makes it look like a girls hoodie. My son hates it. It’s also very short. I ordered a men’s size so it would fit better but it didn't
1.0,"Super thin, didn’t like at all but great if you like super thin socks"
1.0,"Bought this for my daughter. It has a weird fit to it. Too skinny I guess, but she is tall and skinny. It’s just not a regular fit."
1.0,"This is very cheep made. Fell apart and was not shaped correctly so it won’t fit your face to keep out saw dust, which is a large particle. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
1.0,Umbrella was broken. I came defected.
1.0,Really poor quality belt. I wore this belt once and the leather and the holes started to crack. Not recommended.
1.0,"Horrible product, fell apart in one day."
1.0,Arrived with holes all over dress!!
1.0,These are horrible. They are very poorly made and do not look like the photo. They had an odd smell and are most definitely not leather.
1.0,Love it! Beautiful. Really high quality for low price. Highly recommend.
1.0,Longer on the ear than shown online and color was not as bright as shown.  I returned
1.0,Received broken. Nose piece missing
1.0,"Like one of the previous customers acknowledged, ""it was delivered from China."". I'm happy with my purchase but I would've been much more pleased if it were delivered within 2 days. Tops. Hence, the PRIME subscription. Hopefully my shirt doesn't smell like an ocean container."
1.0,The fabric looks super cheap and notthe color that is shown.  Definitely not going to wear it.
1.0,Poor quality.  Not as good as the ones in the store.  We ordered online because we couldn't get our size in the store.
1.0,It fits like a sack. It could be nice if at least the shoulders fitted as pictured but they don't also it is too see through.
1.0,earrings too  small for an adult returned.
1.0,Cute but all the buttons came off :(
1.0,"Don't, Don't, Don't. I orded a pair in black,  my husband and daughter in law both thought they were either brown or purple. I call customer service they were great, very apologetic and gave me a refund and I orded another pair.  The same color showed up, NOT black.  I say keep looking"
1.0,Photo is not indicative of the actual color which is almost a maroon.
1.0,Bag broke within 2 day of using it. Don’t buy
1.0,Arrived on time but it fell of my ear even with tightening it about 10 times first day I wore it and the last time I didn't feel it fall. 1 days worth not to mention it hurt as well. The back is flat making it a weird clamp fit. Not worth it!
1.0,NOT FLEECED LINED .  Just a pair of windpants.
1.0,"I purchased this watch for my son as a Valentine's Day present in February. It states that this watch is waterproof. It was full of water, and my son didn't even go diving with it. He just wore it in shallow water at the beach and in the shower. It worked great for about three months."
1.0,"Very disappointed.  Cute BRACELET, but I ordered the quantity 24 with the display stand and received ONE bracelet!"
1.0,Dye from belt came off on a pair of my light color shorts.  I really like the way the belt works but I'm not happy with ruining an a good pair of shorts.  The dye didn't come off in just one area it came off all the way around the pants.
1.0,Pants were too short for me. Returned
1.0,I received mine and it was broken and it’s senseless to send it back because you have to pay to send it back and I don’t have a key I have a money to pay for that
1.0,The XXIV is supposed to be twice the size on the hat.🤔  This was a present to my Grandson😭
1.0,Material horrible
1.0,"I put them on, put my foot on the floor, and down they rolled. Nothing to keep them up. Waste of money. Also left indents of the ribbons."
1.0,One wash and they're ruined
1.0,Fits tts but the style isn’t anything like the photo. It looked like a paper bag/grandma dress
1.0,No bounce? Uhhh - fair amount of bounce. And the lowest hook & eye are already coming loose.
1.0,These do not work. I wish I would of returned them but I hate returning items.
1.0,"There is no quality control on fit or material between the different patterns sold for this pant.  It’s frustrating.  I have 2 of the flower patterns - material is soft and fit is perfect.  I purchased these red ones for Xmas and while the fit is perfect, they feel like plastic.  Horrible material.  I also purchased the grey/blue ones with polka dots... the material was nice and soft but the crotch was sewn half way down the leg.  I wonder if I purchase again if I’d get ones sewn properly. 🤷‍♀️  It’s a crap shoot."
1.0,I do not believe  this to be leather but a well made pleather.
1.0,The chemical smell is aweful! It also rides up so that it ends up covering your breasts which you definitely don't want.
1.0,The skirt is cute if a little small. But the third time I put it on the zipper broke. Super disappointed.
1.0,"This dress runs super small and the material is thin and cheap.  I guess you get what you pay for with this one!  I'm a curvy size 8 and usually wear a medium.  After reading the reviews I decided to go up to a Large and the dress was way too tight!  Not figure-flattering at all.  The arm holes are big, so I know an XL will be huge up top and probably still tight on the bottom.  Oh well!"
1.0,"They're cute, but not worth the price. I barely tried 1 on and they already broke."
1.0,The compression is perfect however they seem a lot shorter than my SB Sox.
1.0,"I do not care for these scarves at all.  I had purchased them to perk up handbags in the Christmas holiday season.  The quality is just not there and they feel slimey.  Also, it's pretty obvious that the folks who make these have never experienced ""Christmas"".  The design is pretty tacky and not sure about that one with a duck hanging out with an anime style snowman.  And the writing ""Doke Duck""??  Just not sure...of the four there is only one that I might take a chance on come next holiday season.  I don't like the price; it's too much for such poor quality.  Truly disappointed with this order."
1.0,"I was happy to receive this shirt... Until I tried it on. The material is so stiff and uncomfortable, the design is so thick that it lays funny and feels like an odd iron on."
1.0,It was broken when it came.  Very cheaply made.
1.0,"I'm very curvy and have a true hour glass body shape. The bra looks great in the morning but about an hour later it starts creeping up to the point that it feels like me girls are up to my throat. I'm a c cup, 34in around and I feel so constricted by these bras. I ordered a size 36 thinking I probably bought it to small but now I have to pull it down constantly that I end up with bruising and friction burns. I want to believe these type of bra is not for gals with my body shape."
1.0,"My daughter and I loved this dress and the fabric, but when my daughter put it on, I immediately noticed a big gap on the neck that wasn't sewed shut properly.  Unfortunately, I didn't have a needle and thread to try and sew it shut (but I probably wouldn't do a good job on the front neckline had I attempted it), so I intended to return it for a new one, but never got around to it.  If this quality issue could be solved, I have no problems with this dress.  It's really cute and it's unfortunate that this big hole was missed in a quality review check."
1.0,The fabric is itchy and cheap. I was looking forward to this sweater to become an elegant addition to warm clothes wardrobe but I was sadly mistaken. Do not recommend.
1.0,"Dry upset, it was delivered with  one of the stones was out"
1.0,"For the price, it showed"
1.0,The sizes are not correct. I ordered 0-3 months and they are so big!! Not even close!
1.0,Ordered a size 9.5 and received a size 12.
1.0,Ran way short and small
1.0,"I was so excited when I ordered, thinking it would be as adorable as the picture!! the print was dingy and shirt size fit snug, the tag on inside of shirt was very stiff which made for a very uncomfortable fit.When I cut the tag out so it wouldn't stab me the shirt tore!!  so it is poorly made."
1.0,Terrible product the anklets broke easy and I can’t even get a refund on it
1.0,Weirdly short... probably will give to my step-daughter...
1.0,"I returned, it wasn’t a good fit."
1.0,Terrible. See through- trashy
1.0,"The sleeves are clearly not the same, it's missing the outer flap/layer. Fits as expected but the plain sleeve takes from the cuteness I saw before ordering."
1.0,Broke first day it was worn
1.0,Ummmm not even close to the size it was labeled. 2xl was maybe the size of a large.
1.0,I loved this watch at first but the watch broke after having it for only one month and a half. I could not even get a full refund so I am quite upset. All I wanted was for them to replace the watch.
1.0,Very colorful but did not like it much; very light and unimpressive.
1.0,"I got these for my wife for Christmas. She put them on an the post broke off of one of them.<br /><br />The finish is all scratched up, too.<br /><br />She still loves me, though, because I got her a bunch of other things, too."
1.0,why is this even a thing
1.0,Way too big. Returned
1.0,Awkward dimensions. Not long enough for a 3 year old’s hands. Poorly made.
1.0,Liquid cleaner was open and stained packaging.
1.0,This was too big for my face and I’m an adult….
1.0,so cheaply made do not bother
1.0,"top was super small for a large size.. not big chested girl friendly at all, keep scrollin"
1.0,Don't like the fabric. Thought it was cotton. But it's cute. No tags to tell you how to care for it.
1.0,"I didn't feel it was worth the $70.  Mediocre quality (it doesn't open/close), the crystal is dull unless you shine a light directly on it, and the hinge on the collector's box broke the 1st time it was opened it (so the box is now useless).  I was hoping this would be the same higher quality as the Marvel Legends replicas, but this was the first prop I was disappointed with from a quality vs. price standpoint."
1.0,"I have to say I liked the case, it worked well, til it cracked!!"
1.0,Do not purchase these leggings! They ripped in several different places after wearing them just a few times.
1.0,Well I’m not sure what size came. No tag on the dress or bag. Definitely not a small. I normally wear a small top and women’s bottoms 120lbs. It comes down to my knees looks like a xl and a v neck came. Not crew neck.
1.0,Tangles easily hard to untangle
1.0,Not like material
1.0,"UPDATE<br />I've had for about 3 weeks now & I'm not happy... 1st of all, they are separating on bottom & 2nd of all I wore one day & started to rain & my feet were Wet! It's because of the separation & lastly it's got a hole on the top. Cheaply made"
1.0,"Huge, too big for any part of the ear aside from maybe the first hole of your ear lobe."
1.0,Broken rhinestones
1.0,broke as soon as i put it on waste of money and time didnt fit
1.0,I ordered a medium but received an extra large total disappointment the shirt didn’t even look the same color as on line
1.0,"item was packaged poorly, the frame was broken and separated from the lens and they are flimsy and off center."
1.0,Broken when recurved
1.0,The elastic band sewn in the waist folded and twisted within the waistband.  It is not wearable like this.  Have only had it since May.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Wrong color for me. I was hoping it was pink as the pic looks. It's not. And size is smaller than it should be. Returning. :-((
1.0,This sweater has no tag located anywhere on it. Very cheap material. MADE IN CHINA was on the bag. Wish me luck on washing it... Maybe my daughters next sweater.
1.0,These are to small for my face. Other then that I like them I wonder if they come in a wider size
1.0,Broke the first time she wore it
1.0,Hat is absolutely massive!! I don’t know anyone’s head this would even rest nicely on!!! Unwearable even with a thick wig
1.0,"This looked cool, but when it arrived-direct rod China- it had a weird chemical smell. I am, honestly, afraid to use it."
1.0,The purse just arrived and it’s being returned. The only thing right about this bag is the color. The zipper pull is broken and the tab missing..not worth the $$$! Please issue a return label. Thank you
1.0,broke after wearing it about 4 times
1.0,"The fit was great but the color was so distorted. It was a very bright orange, like TN football team. I was looking for a harvest burnt orange look so I returned it. I thought about ordering the grey hut now that I know the color isn’t accurate I’ve decided to pass"
1.0,arrived broken/cheaply made :(
1.0,So disappointed! My XL was more like an XS and wouldn't fit over my head 🙁
1.0,"I purchased this dress in green and blue. They fit beautifully and are well-made. I liked them so much that I ordered this one, black ""flowers"". It's as if this dress was made by a totally different manufacturer. The fabric is very cheap, the fit is sloppy, and the flowers look more like bats. I'm returning it but will probably take my chances on purchasing another of the solid colors."
1.0,ordered with extra battery pack and after a month or 2 batteries will charge to 100% but then I plug into jacket batteries say zero charge.... so now it just a jacket.
1.0,"Very large neck line, model must be wearing smallest size.  Guess I'll use it as a nightshirt."
1.0,You will be disappointed.
1.0,Product pictured wasn't even the product received. Same design just absolutely not the same bikini.
1.0,not made that well came apart from chain. when i took it out of package
1.0,Super thin- not true to size
1.0,"Love the looks, but the product is worthless. One month of use and the winding stem breaks. I didn't even use this watch every day, just when i  wore a vest with a pocket for the watch. Always careful not to overwind, but care made no difference. The sad part? This is my second attempt with this brand. I'd give it 0 stars if that were permitted. So be warned: If you want a watch that lasts, don' buy this one."
1.0,These are seriously the size of a pencil eraser!! I hate it you can’t eve see it
1.0,Zipper really didn't work!
1.0,"This is Not a plus size. The 3XL was snug on my body even though I fall between a normal 2/3 XL. And the sleeve length fall Way too short. Even with the 6XL the sleeve length was about 4 inches too short, and I don’t have long arms. This Jacket is a Miss/Junior; This is Not a Woman’s, let alone a Plus Size."
1.0,"It WAS a very nice belt.  However, the buckle broke after less than 6 months of use and it is now useless.  The metal portion that goes into the holes of the belts broke away from the buckle and cannot be fixed.  BOO!"
1.0,"The Blazer size does not match the size chart what so ever.<br />The material is very light weight which is what I was looking for, for spring dresses and tank tops.  I'm disappointed in the size."
1.0,Bought for St. Patricks Day and it was cute. Was a little snug even ordering a size up. Strap unraveled after first wash and I had to throw it out.
1.0,"Out of the 3 sets we purchased, there was an average of 2 good working lights per set of 5. Definitely would not by this again. I am glad so many others had success but there seems to be an issue with quality control."
1.0,"5' 3 ordered a large thinking it would be comfy and loose. It did not fit at all as pictured. It would have only fit like a dress on a toddler plus its very, very see-through. Wish it would have been as expected. Don't even try it"
1.0,Stiff material. Uncomfortable
1.0,"I love the feel of these flips. But they do not last. The straps themselves bust fairly easily and the rope hurts to the point of bleeding due to the hardness of the flip flop strap. They are not worth buying, these flip flops lasted me a total of 9 days before being completely useless."
1.0,"The sole of the shoe is very soft, only had them for  4 days, wore them to work each of those 4 days and I can press my finger into the sole like puddy.. don't waste your money ladies"
1.0,"I bought these as a gift for Christmas, they have already unraveled in places!"
1.0,Feels like wearing a cheap tablecloth.
1.0,I couldn't wear them as the zipper & fastener broke as soon as I tried them on. I would recommend getting at least 2-3 sizes bigger.
1.0,The rubber is thin and flimsy. There are no knee pads as shown.
1.0,This is the cheapest belt ever made. Do Not Buy!  Put it on and it broke into pieces within a minute.  I had saved the packaging tried to return. They don’t accept returns.  Lesson learned.
1.0,The bras were very uncomfortable because the  Wire dug into my skin on the sides. I even bought some moleskin tape because it was so painful.
1.0,"When I ordered this item the only sizes available were small or standard, I ordered the standard size and it was too small. I am only able to either get an exchange for the full price or lose 20% for a restocking fee. I am not a large girl and if the standard size didn't fit than there is no point in exchanging it for something else. They also told me to put an EA or RA number on the outside of the package, a number I didn't receive via e-mail or on the invoice. I will not be ordering from them again and nor will I recommend them to my friends or family."
1.0,Material is stiff and uncomfortable
1.0,"Sometimes you get what you pay for. This is one of those times. The T.A.R.D.I.S is too big to be &#34;cute&#34; and also big enough to show the poor craftsmanship. The chain is an awkward length. And for one reason or another I wasn't expecting there to be a little gem on top, which just seems cheesy. Since this item came from China I won't even bother with returning it. Basically, this is one of those purchases that makes me feel like a jerk."
1.0,Wayaaaaaaaaa to small
1.0,Very cheap and fuzzy print on worthless fabric.  I would not know it is my clan tartan except for the label.  Don't waste your money
1.0,Not too much variety...I was pretty disappointed
1.0,This looked like a tent on me and had no shape. I returned both colors. Same fit.
1.0,Nazi símbolo
1.0,Didn’t fit right and fell apart before even putting it on
1.0,"This was my first clothing item I was unhappy with. The quality of sewing was off and the description was not completely accurate. Which you get what you pay for, yes, but I have had amazing luck with clothing purchases through amazon and this one has me worried to try again."
1.0,"Earrings tarnished right out of the bag, big waste of time and money."
1.0,"Socks look good and are comfortable, but the heel is not reinforced and a hole quickly wears through after fewer than 10 uses. The hole in the photo is typical."
1.0,"These are impossible to get in your ear and once they are in, they fall off immediately. I used this in my tragus and I lost the front within an hour."
1.0,I don’t like it it’s was to big I’m a small lady and it’s was a size small but it was to big 👎
1.0,😒😒😒😒
1.0,"Huge! Weird material too, like a swim material."
1.0,Broken after 2 mins!
1.0,"This product was a rip off, I would not purchase again nor will I recommend this product to anyone else!"
1.0,"These shoes were purchased August 31, 2022 and worn seven times. Already the sole is peeling back from the shoe. There is not a way to contact seller on their Amazon website. I would like a complete refund on these shoes."
1.0,"Not good, it was all marked up, thought it had dirt on it, sent it back"
1.0,Too small for my face.  Returned it.
1.0,"The boots are super cute and comfortable but fall apart sheet only a few wears.  I bought them for my mom, sister, and myself as a gift and they ago feel apart after just a few nornal wears.  All three pairs!  Would not recomemd."
1.0,Bought this for my mom to take to a college basketball game. Would have worked great but one of the straps were broken where it connected to the bag. There was really no way to fix it because there was a small metal part not there. First picture is the good strap. The second picture is where you can see on the bad strap there is a tiny part missing  so it won’t stay connected with the bag.
1.0,Ring was thin and had no substance.
1.0,Terrible quality. Do not waste your money.
1.0,It's really a cute shirt and material is nice. But it just doesn't fit right. Can't tighten or loosen anything. Size smaller would be too small and size bigger would be too big. Guess if you have B cup or smaller it might fit but anything bigger it just doesn't. And not sending back because I only paid $5 and would cost $11 to have it sent back since we don't have a UPS anything for over 100miles.
1.0,NOT flattering. NOT med-large bust friendly.  The lace along the middle hit me in the worst place. T
1.0,No me agrado y no lo pude utilizar porq esta mal cortado
1.0,The product I purchased broke as soon as I had it placed on my scooter. Not great quality for the price. I would not recommend. Velcro straps worked way better!
1.0,I may have liked these skirts if the sizing was correct
1.0,I ordered 4 different pair of these yoga pants. Had wholes where they skipped stitching on the side. So annoying!! Shipping takes for ever!! And Yoga Pants Shrink!! I wouldn't recommend these Yoga Pants.You totally get what you pay for!!
1.0,"The feel was not very supple, they felt like 100% rough Polyester. And, The cut didn’t fit my body well...not for me"
1.0,Not described as a child's hat on website but they clearly were sized as such. Useless at an adult birthday party.
1.0,Im a photographer. I got this because from the picture it looked like a great quality and like a realistic miniature lens. Looked partially metal in the lens from the photo but was disappointed to find its just a poor quality paper print under resin. The necklace part of it is decent. But the lens kind of makes it look like a cheap necklace for a child so i probably wont wear it. May return.
1.0,"terrible, itchy and way too tight."
1.0,"The dress is falsely advertised to be polyester with chiffon fabric in the picture and description, but it really only has chiffon sleeves. All you get is this polyester dress that should be the lining and it makes the dress a shade different than the sleeves. Such a disappointment really. I had bought it for my mom to wear at my wedding and we both hate it so much that I must return it."
1.0,I wanted to by an extra wrist band for the watch my boys bought for me a few months back. Did not install it until last week. To my surprise the rubber part of the band separeted from the watch in 2 days luckily i was not running or I would have lost it. I was only installing a screen protector! Not happy. Waited too long to use it for the first time and now I can't return it. Dont waste your money on this.
1.0,"The fit is average and true to the size chart. The sequins, however, look NOTHING like the picture and are cheaply done. There’s no cute ombré, it’s a sad, unflattering line. I’ve been eyeing this jacket online for awhile and am deeply disappointed. I may never recover."
1.0,After One wash (others inside out to protect it) the letter and heart are Faded they are now Grey... What a waste. Glad these are pjsand not something worn to school 😠
1.0,"These plugs were gorgeous when I first received them, but my stoma conformed to the shape and they made my ears itch and drain. They also turned green after a couple weeks of wear. I'll stick to wood and silicone from now on."
1.0,"We've ordered these finger lights before from a different vendor and they were fairly sturdy, with a small circuit board inside that switches the lights on and off and a velcro clasp for putting them on your fingers and a little battery door for replacing the batteries.  We got them a year ago for the same price as these and they work great!  We've replaced the batteries many times and they are still going.  The good ones are these: [[ASIN:B0018LAGZY 40 Super Bright Finger Flashlights - LED Finger Lamps - Rave Finger Lights]]<br /><br />These ones are utter and complete junk.  It's an LED with two metal wires attached to batteries and a switch that pushes one of the wires onto the batteries, no real switch, tiny batteries that can't be replaced easily.  Over 25% of them did not work at all, another 50% only work if you squeeze them together, and the other 25% flicker if you move them even a tiny bit.  Seriously, do not buy these you will be very disappointed."
1.0,This watch face cracked five minutes after my granddaughter charged it and put it on her wrist. I can only deduce that it was defective when it arrived.
1.0,The application instructions state it can be used on copper. DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR PENNIES! It took the top finish right off. I would never buy this product again!
1.0,"Vans shirt &#34;seemed&#34; good quality until my son in law wore it.  It was washed twice.  The hem started tearing apart and rolling up.  I asked about their policy about returning it for a new one and they said, &#34;if it had been worn and damaged then it isn't returnable.&#34;  I disagree as the damage was due to normal short term wear.  I don't recommend this product."
1.0,"I love the boxers.  I find it very disagreeable to my constitution that I received 3 pair instead of 6 packs.  Im noticing today, first day of school.  $4 a pair is pricey."
1.0,This belly ring broke after two weeks of wearing.
1.0,I will not be ordering again. Appears to be home-made by beginning seamstress……
1.0,It broke  after one use. But we had a wonderful time with it
1.0,"Small, uncomfortable, don't slip on."
1.0,I hated this! Thr front tie looked like two horns coming out out of the front where the tie should have been. I got what I paid for which means it was a new addition to my rag pile. It was cheaply constructed and indescribably hideous. Please don’t waste your money.
1.0,"I figured with a review of 4/5 stars, I would be pleased with these. Unfortunately, I was wrong. I bought these as part of a gift for each one of my preschool students. I recieved 40 finger lasers, of which only 27 actually worked. What a disappointment."
1.0,Description is not true. It is not stainless steel. So disappointed.
1.0,Runs narrow through bust- the rest is fine.
1.0,weird shaped pants. wouldn't buy again.
1.0,Garbage. Guarantee they bought from wish for $15 then have the nerve to charge $30 on here 😈
1.0,"Thought the price was great, however when the sizer doesn't lock firmly in place and you have to throw the hat out before you even wear it, then it's to much money spent.<br /><br />POORLY MADE, LOOK ELSE WERE IF YOU WANT TO BE HAPPY."
1.0,lights did not work
1.0,It’s fake. Check the label and compare.
1.0,This band came in defective. It was $6.99. It will now cost me more to return the item in gas to drive to the return points. I emailed the seller and they are requiring me to send it back. I will think twice before ordering again since their quality control department failed on this order!!
1.0,"These were my second pair, first pair I lost on my motorcycle..  This pair the frame just broke.  When I put the sunglasses on they felt odd against my face. So after looking at them I noticed the frame was cracked allowing the frame to flex..  Bummer... I really liked my first pair.<br /><br />It was brought to my attention that the SUNGLASSES has a LIFETIME warranty on the frames yet the return/exchange window has expired!  BAD BUSINESS, FALSE ADVERSTISING!  Lifetime warranty means LIFETIME!"
1.0,"Size down it fits big, loose and unflattering."
1.0,This broke after one wear. Will not buy this again!
1.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift and it’s maybe been worn a dozen times. Today when it was taken off of the recipients head, it unraveled completely! Waste of my money at this point. Extremely disappointing."
1.0,"The only thing this apron was good for was filling my trash can.  It was simply awful and made of such cheap<br />""fabric.""  It was like a disposable, plastic, table cloth.  I ordered it for a friend of mine who recently became a Corgi mom and would have been embarrassed to send it to her."
1.0,"Very bad quality, thin, came flattened"
1.0,The free bracelet opener does not have the words pandora on it like shown.  Does this mean it is not real pandora.
1.0,Do not have tummy control!!! Just a wrinkled up mess!!!
1.0,These are cheaply made.  I returned
1.0,worst quality metal tonughe rings ive ever saw not 14 gauge and balls unscrew too easy and took forever to get here
1.0,Quality was not  good. Not true to size.
1.0,So painful
1.0,"Turned my ears green within two days, they’re also bulky and look masculine in person."
1.0,"I ordered this dress 1/16/22. Color of the dress was just as I expected but the tie that cinched the back was missing. By the time they replaced the tie, I realized the dress was just not going to work out for me. It had very rigid plastic cording in the bust area that made it very uncomfortable. I requested a return and mailed the dress back immediately. They posted that the refund was issued on 3/19 but it could take up to 7 days to appear in my account. As of this morning (4/13) I have still not received the refund. I have contacted them several times with no response. I would not recommend ordering anything from this company."
1.0,Not a good quality and kid’s size. I ordered XL as some reviews said that they fall out small. But what I received is leggings for children. I will have to send it back.
1.0,To large i returned to Amazon at ups Swampscott ma on Tuesday January 19th I expect a full refund
1.0,This mask was very hard to breathe in and it swallowed my whole face. It’s terrible.
1.0,Save your money. They are impossible to open and close without even being on your ear.
1.0,"Seriously the worst. No support at all, the girls might of well just roam free."
1.0,"Don’t bother, took almost a month to arrive, when description indicated much earlier arrival date and not one of the items look like the items shown in the picture. All of the mask are ugly manly colors."
1.0,"I ordered a pack of 5, but received 1. Even the heading of this review says that it's for: ""Men's Underwear Briefs 5-Pack Cotton Low Rise Multi Color Soft Underpant"""
1.0,The belt constantly looses its grip. I would not recommend
1.0,"These are NOT thin at all, these are actually very thick. The picture shows thin ones but these are not. I ordered 1/2 inch and Because of how thick they are, my ears look like maybe a 00 gauge. I already have some similar to these but wanted thin gauges like Eyelets.  I'm extremely disappointed that I paid $9 for these ones because I paid $2 for my others. =( Dissatisfied!!!"
1.0,Cheaply made and doesn't last. The only reason I am giving any stars is they actually do look great. I have had 3 pairs of these and the last two pairs both arrived distorted or broken. Definitely needs better packaging.
1.0,"I just received this, this morning. The sizing is perfect and super cute, but it came with one gem stone missing. I was so disappointed. Since there are five gems and the second one was missing, I decided to remove the fourth one to make it look like there were only three gems. It looked symmetrical and intentional so I was happy with it. Until I went to remove the jewelry. The jewelry has a really awesome, sturdy clasp that takes a bit of force to remove. Just holding the piercing to unclasp it, the middle gem came out. Now it looks ugly. I’m so disappointed because it’s such a cute design but none of the stones were set properly."
1.0,Beautiful watch that doesn’t work.  Light tapping  on face makes it start and stop working.
1.0,"Claimed as 100% silk, but it’s not soft, doesn’t like silk at all."
1.0,"I bought a size large for my cousin and when it came in the mail it came to my house and I tried it on and it fix like a medium so I suggest you buy a size up, and I also bought the long sleeve for her and it was a short sleeve like WTF!!!sorry I don’t got no photos i already put it back in it’s package and I’m returning it tomorrow !"
1.0,"Falsely advertised as &#34;Paintball&#34; gear. I have been playing paintball for well over a decade. I played on my university's paintball team and traveled the country playing the sport. First, there is no way any professional field will allow a mask like this in their games. The reason is liability. If you look at ANY other paintball goggle system, you will see the lens is a THICK polycarbonate. This is because paintball shells can *and will* find their way through the metal mesh on a mask like this. Paintball lenses are one piece in order to maintain rigidity and integrity. For the love of all things holy, please DO NOT BUY THIS MASK FOR PAINTBALL. I don't care what brand you buy, but please, please, please don't buy this for paintball. It may be fine for airsoft, but airsoft BB's have much less mass and are less likely to cave in the metal mesh protecting the eye. This seller needs to re-evaluate what they're offering and the implications of advertising this as something it absolutely isn't."
1.0,Very cheap metrial ... also not  well done  alteration on this dress ..... it was done super cheap .<br />Don’t ever buy it .
1.0,The band would not stay on the watch. We sent it back for a full refund.
1.0,Malicimo
1.0,Face is toooooo big
1.0,"This dress is much smaller in person, so please size up! Material is also cheap"
1.0,"The product did not fit true to size but is very soft.  However, it took almost two weeks to get in and it is completely see through! I bought the white for a wedding next week and unfortunately, there is no way I can wear it. Will be returning it."
1.0,"Honestly not good, It would not sit on my head and when I took it off red fluff went everywhere and the white puff at the end fell off... not good"
1.0,"The band broke off the watch face after 2 days of use, This was after having to pay a jewler to remove links, as it was IMPOSSIBLE to do on our own."
1.0,Sock is too thin for long hikes
1.0,"they say in the fine print that they are one black and one white pair. however, the images all show 3 pairs. 3 colors. the main photo is grey, and all of the photos show a grey pair as well. I would have bought the item if there were an option to put a grey pair in here. Unfortunate, and deceptive. i wonder how many people but this product expecting there to be a grey pair in there. oh, and they are not socks. the photos show leg warmers with little bows."
1.0,"The watch bracelet looks nice....until it breaks. I have very small wrist and had no problem sliding it on and off, yet the elastic bands broke just after few times I wore it. Very disappointed with the quality of this bracelet. Waste of money.<br /><br />Edit: June 22, 2019.<br />Was contacted by seller few days after I wrote my  original review. He  offered replacement and I decided to give it another try. That was then....never heard from the seller again nor received replacement bracelet."
1.0,"Definitely not the same color, looks like a cheap print out that u shouldn't pay more than $5"
1.0,"These ba*tards do stretch, but too much!<br />I have about 6-8 inches of excess.  I could've gotten a 38 instead of 44."
1.0,The box was severely damaged. I had to take the gloves out what was left of the box
1.0,Fit odd. Does not look as depicted.
1.0,"I purchased these, because they advertised no center seam.  That in fact is false.  There is a seam right up the center, and if you want to print a square photo on them, you simply can't.  I do not recommend these."
1.0,Bad quality.. :(
1.0,When I first saw the bag I was sad because the color was off... it wasn't the trendy mustard yellow color. it was more bright orange. I decided to give it a try on and it was way too big. it fit like a smock. I suggest sizing down.
1.0,Attach points broken after two uses.
1.0,I have a 2019 Cayenne. it's a wrong size cover even seller posted this will fit Cayenne.  Please see attached pictures. It's slightly smaller and the back piece does not stay.  Please contact me for either replacement or  purchase return.  Thanks.
1.0,The box was already open and two of the wipes were missing. Other bottles looked like they had been handled…definitely not new. This was meant as a Christmas gift and now I have to scramble to find an alternative.
1.0,I recieved the Earring NOT 2<br /> JUST 1 UGH!!!!<br />Very very Disappointed!!
1.0,"No wonder this bag was 6 bucks, it's horrible. There is not one good thing about it. The zippers get stuck, the quality is poor, the design is horrible, I mean whoever thought up this design must have been under the influence of something. The main compartment in the front, it opens on both sides but not on the top.. so that means when you put your stuff in, it all falls out. It's hard to explain, I should have taken a pic of the inside. The strap is short. the snaps don't line up, much less close without a struggle. I'm sure I can think of 10 other things, but I'll draw the line here and just say don't waste your money on this. It may be cheap, but it won't serve any purpose. You can spend twice as much and get something decent, or you can spend half and get something useless. I took that risk, but I'll be happy to return it."
1.0,"When it arrived I was so excited to try it on, only to have it look like it was made by a third party. The embroidering was done awful, came way too large, & the fabric felt gross. It altogether looked cheap & something you could find in a goodwill, not for homecoming."
1.0,The print is not clear at all .
1.0,The sizing is VERY wrong.  Even compared to the first generation climbers jersey (which I wear a medium in) this one fits a full size smaller than.  Order 2 sizes up from what you're used to wearing in a race fit jersey.
1.0,I thought I read through all the reviews before buying the item. The material is perfect on the outside however the inside is soo rough!!!!!!!!!! It is also too small. Returning it. Also fair warning you’ll have to pay the return fee.
1.0,Looked a lot better in the photo. Very cheap looking IRL
1.0,"Did not fit as expected, I returned it in July and the return is still ""in process""!!"
1.0,This was a cheap watch which came in a bent plastic box with no instructions on how to operate it. I was very disappointed 😞 with it and returned it for a refund.
1.0,Poor quality - color look yellow. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Only needed for one day, and it didn’t hold up! The chain broke, the purse fell, everything came tumbling out! It was just too much!"
1.0,"As soon as my son tried it on. The button came off. It broke. Was going to try and return it, but to my surprise i cant return it."
1.0,Buyer beware! These are itsy bitsy. Like Barbie sized.
1.0,Unless you’re looking to wear one time and one time only. Go for it. The bracelets Broke while it was on my arm😞
1.0,"Very poor box container, very bad quality of bracelet. I had to find a box and buy a better bracelet to improve the presentation of the item. I'm not happy with the wat it was delivered"
1.0,had to give it away. way way too small
1.0,"The Cable & Gauge Plus Size Basic V-Neck Swing Body Pocket Tee with Hi-Low Hem, which is made in China, is frankly disappointing.  The overall design isn't as pictured, the cut makes for an odd, mismatched fit, and I wouldn't pay $32.99 for it!<br /><br />The shirt I received has little variation in the hemline along the front, not much difference between the high and low side to side and isn't at all as pictured!  For reference, I'm 5'2"", rather busty and have broadish shoulders.  As I often do, I ordered this t-shirt in 1x to compensate, fully expecting the shirt to be shorter right in front, even shorter than pictured on Amazon, but that isn't the case.<br /><br />Moving on, the back of the shirt is also shorter than expected, shorter than pictured, and the sleeves are much shorter and tighter than pictured, not at all flowy, and I do not have large arms!<br /><br />The shirt is much narrower in the shoulders than other 1x shirts I have.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the t-shirt is an odd cut, an odd fit.  It's as if the top half of the t-shirt shrunk in the sleeves and shoulders and the bottom half didn't. Or as if the manufacturer used pattern pieces cut for a smaller size and put them with this t-shirt.  The overall effect is odd, sloppy, not at all flattering, not at all like the picture on the product page, and not worth the price! And this was BEFORE washing the garment in cold water, and leaving it laid out flat and reshaped to air-dry. After all that, the fabric wrinkles!!<br /><br />In summary, and needless to say, I'm disappointed with the Cable & Gauge Plus Size Basic V-Neck Swing Body Pocket Tee with Hi-Low Hem,  which is made in China,  because the overall design isn't the same as pictured, not even close, and the cut and fit is just odd! I never imagined a shirt could be both a bit too small (shoulders, short sleeves) and too large, but this one is!🤪<br /><br />Bottomline: I wouldn't buy this garment again, nor can I recommend it. Too bad because it's a nice color, and the fabric feels soft and silky.  It's a fun design idea that was poorly executed."
1.0,"I wanted to love this shirt but it had too many negatives to keep it.<br /><br />1. Super sheer. Like as in I am removing it from the packaging and my son says &#34;mom, that would be inappropriate for you to wear.&#34; So I think, I'll wear a tank underneath which leads me to...<br /><br />2. Hot material<br /><br />3. Too small. Now, if you have any hips whatsoever this shirt is NOT for you. The sides goes down in a completely straight line, so it just all hits a spot and the material bunches at that point.<br /><br />4. The shoulders and top part make you look like a box, not flattering."
1.0,"Material is cheap, thin and stitches on the finished product is not neat<br /> I would not wear this product and need to return it."
1.0,Already fell apart
1.0,"I ordered these twice, hoping for a good black tunic tank. First order was a little shorter and tighter than I hoped. I think I ordered a M (I normally wear M shirts). The second time, I ordered XL, (L was not available, plus I thought I would mostly just get extra length). The length was much better than M, but the armpits were cut kinda weird and stuck out. These were a bit expensive for three shirts, the quality of the fabric felt kind of cheap. I wanted to like these, but I ended up returning two separate orders."
1.0,I will be calling customer service. Advertised as white gold plated sterling silver. ABSOLUTELY FALSE. Not even 3 months old. Trash.
1.0,I would give 0 stars-it took a month to arrive-the material is not soft like cashmere more stretchy like soandes-I would NEVER have paid $20 if I had been in a store shopping
1.0,I'm a 16 woman's. Ordered the largest size to accommodate for shrinkage. These would fit a child at best. Save your money and pass on these. I'll be returning these.
1.0,Way to small can almost go through hole in ear.
1.0,Not that good I going possibly return.
1.0,I ordered the sky blue dress and it is kuch darker/duller than the image displayed. It is also terribly wrinkly and short. Very disappointed and will return as soon as possible.
1.0,Somehow I thought the &#34;coral inlay&#34; would look less like a cross between a tiddley wink and a cinnamon hard candy. I didn't have time to return because I bought as a gift. My bad.
1.0,Poor quality and look nothing like they are pictured
1.0,This set was really disappointing. The earrings and necklace look cheap and almost plastic. I do not recommend.
1.0,"I bought this for camping and hiking.  At first I really liked it.  It is not overwhelmingly huge like a lot of the G-shock watches and has a lot of nice features.  I particularly liked the barometric pressure trend graph.  When you are out hiking with no cell service to check the weather forecast, this will give you a hint as to the likely weather for the next few hours at least.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it did not fully survive its first, short camping trip.  The inside of the glass fogged, showing that the waterproof seal has failed.  The watch still works, but a sports/outdoors watch that is not waterproof is essentially useless.  At this point, you have to take it off if you want to wash your hands with it.  So much for 100 ft water-resistance.<br /><br />To be clear, this went on a few moderate day hikes and was never abused or subjected to any rough treatment.  It hasn't even picked up any scratches yet it is still so new.  The waterproof seal died with less than 30 days worth of time on my wrist.<br /><br />The motto of Spovan, the company that makes this watch is &#34;To Be Great&#34;.  That motto is accurate, although not in the way they probably intended.  It could be great in the future, but it sure isn't now.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor - if you are thinking about trying to get a knock-off G-Shock watch to save a little money instead of a real one, learn from my bad experience and just suck it up and buy a watch from a manufacturer with an established reputation that knows what they are doing.  For this watch to fail after such a short time is inexcusable."
1.0,Pretty cheap material.  Totally disappointed.  This is supposed to be warm - it is not. It is thin and should retail for about $6 and not $30.  Do NOT buy this product.  Go to Wal-Mart.  Twice as nice for under $9.
1.0,"The picture of the shorts is deceiving.  I should've read more details.  The fabric is not a soft cotton or linen like the picture might imply,  it's a weird polyester fabric that reminds me of cheap kids pajama material and doesn't look like real camo print.  Just weird.  Though the style is cute, and the size for me was right (medium) the inseam hangs WAY down, like almost mid thigh.  I'm average build but am short waisted.  I think even on a normal waisted person, the inseam would be too low.  Save your $20!"
1.0,"Bands are ok but the screws rusted after a week of wearing it. The screws also protrude, so they'll be abrasive against your skin."
1.0,Very disappointed.  It said Sterling silver but the chain with the cross on it turned black.  I used different silver cleaner and nothing worked.  I was very upset because i had been wanting itty for a long time.
1.0,So small you cannot see what it says. BTS was scratched as well. Chain came without a clasp to close it.  So cheap and horrible and definitely note worth .25cents let alone over $12.  In the process of returning it.
1.0,"I normally wear a M and judged by the &#34;fit&#34; remarks that a L. will do fine. Well, the large was so tight, I could tell what my blood pressure was. This is ridiculous, and what's worse, is that I don't learn! So, Large is small."
1.0,"This is a big, real big hat"
1.0,"So this outfit is really really cheap. The material is not soft at all, and the arm cuffs are hanging by a thread- PUN INTENDED. You move to quickly and you will snap the arm cuffs from the body of the tip. It’s legit a piece of thread keeping it all together. The concept was great, execution- not so much. I usually can make outfits work, but this was an instant return. Skip it"
1.0,"I measured myself using the sizing guide. I am 5'6&#34; and weigh 145 lbs. I ordered a large as suggested and it was WAY too big. I am returning for a smaller size and will update my review to reflect a better fitting garment. The dress itself is gorgeous. The material is thick and stretchy.<br />UPDATE: I got the medium and it fits much better. The belt is quite large, but that's a small thing. This dress does need a petticoat to flare the right way.<br />UPDATE: Even with a petticoat this dress doesn't work. It just looks bad on me."
1.0,Cheap material. Strap broke after 2nd use. I would not buy again.
1.0,"This particular item is too short, it keeps coming unstuck from my pants."
1.0,I received the incorrect wig.<br />I don't order trollific troll of trolls.
1.0,"Followed the size guide, they seem to fit, they’ve been through the wash. But they don’t stay up. They slide down the calf, down the ankle, and bunch up around the arch."
1.0,They were too small in the waist and extremely long. You would need to be very tall and thin to wear them.
1.0,"Stupid design. The female side of the buckle is &#34;tethered&#34; to the main body of the belt, so you either have to fish it through your belt loops, or completely take the buckle off every time. Either way, there's no putting it on in a hurry. It's not very rigid, either."
1.0,"A very bad set. I expected different  charms, got numerous  duplicates and some indistinguishable  blobs. Pick another brand."
1.0,Tiny. Smaller than shirt button. Hart has a hinge that wont stay closed. Not worth the money in any way. Purchasef better quality at chain stores in close put sections. Truely no quality so poo rI question if it is even gold. 10 dollars would be over priced.
1.0,i was super dissapointed by these. The lens are thin pieces of plastic that can easily flex within the frames. There easily broken and im 99.9% sure that these are not zebra wood. I paid $50 because i wanted real wood and not cheap bamboo frames. You can tell these are made from bamboo because of the dots that appear along the edges of the frames. Plus the variations of color in the wood grain is not as bold as zebra wood is. This is 5 years of wood working talking.<br /><br />Plus i had to keep reordering them because amazon sends them in a envelope and not a box so they kept showing up broken
1.0,"so dissapointed thus dress is soooooo cheaply made you kan see her underwear the fabric is so thin didnt worth the wait they should post and actual picture of the dress they make it look so pretty and cute but its not what you receive, already requested a return for this item, i wouldnt recommend it to anyone"
1.0,Not and accurate size and nothing like pictured
1.0,Did not fit with my thick lenses
1.0,"Wrap looks nothing like the photo on Amazon. The wrap I ordered showed white flower inlays distinctly woven into the pattern and clearly visible on the fringe. The wrap I received contained neither. It was also very narrow, insubstantial, and not of high quality. Measurements and description of this item were inaccurate and misleading. Very disappointed."
1.0,Way too small. Definitely would fit a teen tho
1.0,Too small. I wear 1x tops. A 2X sports bra should have been perfect. Couldn't even get it on. Very disappointed.  Could it be sized incorrectly?
1.0,Came broken and scratched. Very cheap.
1.0,"I bought the white one, but it’s not white at all. It’s ivory and COMPLETELY see through. It’s like wearing a night gown. The material is so thin you cannot wear it in public even with a slip it would show everything. I’m very disappointed. Returning ASAP."
1.0,The glasses are nice but not sized appropriately for a man. Disappointed that I can only get an amazon gift card and not an actual refund for this!
1.0,"Too small of a foot base, order a bigger size than you need."
1.0,"I ordered a size larger but was disappointed when I took it out of bag, it was too small. The only reason I rated it a 1, it arrived very quickly."
1.0,I wear a med and bought and xl because I wanted it to wear with leggins. It is way to small now they will only give me 20% back. Never buy anything from china this is the second time this has happened. never again
1.0,"The ""diamond"" choker was all twisted and I could tell it wasn't going to stay straight.. but I couldn't even latch it.. did not fit my neck. I returned it."
1.0,Fabric is cheap.  Would not recommend to anyone.  This onesize item wont fit anyone over size 12 or 5'0'.
1.0,"I thought these would look so cool. Wrong. They are not particularly well made which is a surprise because Inblue's stuff is usually very nice, balanced and detailed. They're very cheap looking. They look VERY awkward on, and they are a pain in the ass to put on. They have some kind of weird screw type post which is very hard to insert. Plus the little rubber gasket thingie is constantly falling off. It's not glued or affixed at all. I would save your money and select something else. Inblue has tons of fantastic earrings that are priced ridiculously low. They were shipped very fast. Just didn't work for me."
1.0,The tie dye shirt is nothing like the photo. All tie dye is different however if you advertise the shirt having multiple colors those colors should be on the shirt. The shirt I got was only hot pink and baby blue. Complete disappointment!!!
1.0,Poor quality.Runs very small.
1.0,They do not come with the clips on the back. Button only.
1.0,Fell apart first time my 16 year old daughter wore it. You get what you pay for
1.0,Cheap looking for a cheap price
1.0,No don't waste money on it rings fall apart
1.0,"The gray color has BROWN RUST STAINS  on tights, it seems as it was previously worn, or some sort of liquid stains. I purchased 2 packs which has the gray tights (both paid has rust stains, the other colors doesn’t) could be Manufacturing  issue."
1.0,Is very comfortable just need s heming about six inches. Love the color and fabric but
1.0,"I ordered the 30 inches tail and it was too heavy and stiff. I am in the process of returning it and now they are telling me that they will charge me 20% returning fee plus the shipping! Terrible, I do not recommend this company."
1.0,Item runs very small. To get the fit like the model in the picture I would have had to get an XL size. Material was very thin and see through. Quality did not match the picture.
1.0,Item does not look like the item purchased.
1.0,"They are really thin and cheap.  Maybe one wear at the best.  Waste of money.  Look good, but oh well.  Live and learn."
1.0,These are too loose and the hooks bent out of shape in under 3 months. They look good but just not that useful.
1.0,This was ALOT smaller than advertised
1.0,I ordered a large but the dress is way small
1.0,I am an OT and was looking forward to using this product and recommending it to my students. However it came with a hole so I wasn’t able to use it and itmakes me question its durability.
1.0,"This product is horrible quality. I ordered one, it broke the first time I wore it so I returned it. The second one I wore today for the first time, it broke too. Now I am past the return window. Do not bother buying!"
1.0,"It was very cheaply made.  And, they should have shown the stripes on the panties ... not flattering."
1.0,"This is very cheaply made. I have worn it for less than a week and it has already cracked (see picture). The design is obviously sprayed on as the pattern does not even go all the way down the sides and it loses the color on the sides. The ""leather"" is EXTREMELY stiff - it squeaks/creaks and cracks when I move my wrist. The color is much more dull than the pictures make it look. It fits on my Galaxy Watch and looks ok as of now but I doubt it will hold up over time.  NOT happy!!!"
1.0,This watch band does not stay fit and not that comfortable!
1.0,Loved the looks of it
1.0,"Not a great fit poorly made, order arrived as expected after 2 washes the inner lining fell apart. The inside or inner pocket stitching was the first to fail then along the legs. Wouldn't buy this product again."
1.0,"First - I never write a review as I'm a very busy professional woman.  Nonetheless, I feel it appropriate to write about this item that was sold to me at full price.  This item literally had the smell of perfume and terrible body odor throughout the entire dress.  It smelled so bad that I could instantly smell it as I took it out of the bag.  I order online clothes very often and have never had this experience.  This should have never been accepted as a return item and then attempted to resale a used item at full price is a huge Company fail."
1.0,"Not a good band,"
1.0,"I bought these as a replacement for a chain my boyfriend had that broke. The first one he wore can coming unfastened, the second starting breaking him out and turning green after several weeks."
1.0,These workout shorts were a disappointment:  poorly made and ill-fitting-too tight in the front and too baggy in the back. I should have known the Coofandy brand was not a good one. I previously ordered one of their workout shirts and it was a bad fit.
1.0,"This should not be in the men's section because there is not enough room in the crotch area for any man. Very disappointing, specially because I'm usually a fan of the Joseph Abboud brand."
1.0,Not worth it at all and made cheaply. I don’t know why i bought this in the first place...
1.0,"the wrist strap broke on first use like if it was rotten on brittle, would not recommend, supossed to be military tactical.<br />not tough at all."
1.0,The band broke just after a week of wearing it. Not good quality
1.0,The spikes were falling off
1.0,"Way smaller than picture, feels cheap"
1.0,So dissaplinted. They are ok for around the house but they don't stay in place. If you are &#34;actually&#34; working out expect your undergarments to show. Will not ware again at the gym.
1.0,"Too tight, Not true to size.  Really like the dress tho."
1.0,"Had to return it<br />Wanted to revisit my comments and would like to add, manufacturer contacted me with apologies, offering me a $10 refund also, very impressed with their prompt handling of this situation and generosity, would certainly try their products again"
1.0,"I'm disappointed in the quality of this new copper fit 2.0 material. I wore them once and washed them. On the 2nd wear, one of the socks ripped while putting them on. I've purchased many pairs of the original style socks and never had that problem. I would expect something like that from cheaper brands which is why I spend the extra money on Copper Fit. Also, they were not much easier to get on than the old version. I won't be buying these again."
1.0,Trash

1.0,Crappy product . I wear size ten and they don’t stay put. Also “tread “ is already peeling off. Definitely don’t recommend.
1.0,Bad quality and poor worksmanship. These necklaces were falling apart left and right when I tried to wear them. The claps broke off so I had to sew a different type of binding so I could tie it together in the back. They look so great but the quality is so crappy. You get what you pay for I guess.
1.0,"The shirt is huge! After measuring it against 2 other shirts the same size, this one was at least two inches larger on each side! Too embarrassed to give as a gift."
1.0,This dress was super thin and more of a long sleeved t-shirt. Not sweatshirt material. Not soft. Super baggy and unflattering.
1.0,can break if you put them down on counter
1.0,Bought a 2x so it was baggy. It is more like an XS. Barely fit my left tit.

1.0,"I ordered this 3 sizes bigger than my usual size to be able to wear it as an oversized shirt dress and it didn’t fit at all…. Must be Chinese sizes or something. Horrible quality, not oversized."
1.0,"I’m writing this in hopes someone sees it, and makes the decision to show your ears some mercy. These are absolutely HORRIBLE. I got size 0g, and they are so incorrectly sized, it’s almost funny. My husband barely touched my ear lobe, and it came popping out. In the picture I included, the blue one is from this pack, and the purple is a perfectly fitting one from HT. I have had my ears stretched at 0g for a year now, with zero issues or pain. I wore a pair from this pack for 1 single week (cleaning and taking out each day), and my left ear bled, swelled up, and showed signs of infection. I took them out, cleaned my ears, let them breathe and replaced them with a HT pair, and my ears are now fine. I will literally not even put these anywhere near my ears again. This company is pure TRASH."
1.0,It was too good to be true.... I sent it back.
1.0,"*** I am an Amazon Vine member. As such, I have received this product free of charge for review purposes.***<br /><br />Advertised Product Performance: These crease protectors are advertised as being able to prevent creases in your shoes, keep your shoes looking brand new, improve the appearance of old shoes, and to extend the lifespan of old shoes.<br />They are also advertised as being able to keep your favorite shoes dry every day, enhance the comfort of your big and little toes, and be easily trimmed to size.<br />They are advertised for Men’s shoe sizes 9-15 and as being compatible with Air Force’s, Jordan’s, Dunk’s, Yeezy’s, Kobe’s, Lebron’s, Smith’s, Timberland’s, CAT’s, and all other sneakers (as per the image in the product description).<br /><br />First Thoughts: There is zero part of me that thinks these crease protectors will work as advertised. If the description is to be believed, I am sure, with 100% positive certainty, that these are a waste of money.<br /><br />Let’s break it down, shall we?<br /><br />• These crease protectors are advertised as being able to prevent creases in your shoes - The only way they would prevent creases is if they didn’t allow the shoe to bend, which would require a form-fitted, hardened material with no flexibility. They are, however, made from a soft, bendy, plastic material.<br /><br />• keep your shoes looking brand new – An unrealistically massive claim for a product focused on creasing. I used a pair in my brand new custom-designed Air Force 1 MrHlywd Edition’s while testing. I took the shoes brand new out of the box, installed the crease protectors, and left to DJ for the evening. It took a matter of minutes for someone to scuff them. By the end of the night, they were dirty, scuffed, and had spilled drinks splashed on them. They looked far from new, despite having the protector installed.<br /><br />•  improve the appearance and extend the lifespan of old shoes. -While the appearance of my old pair of Air Force 1’s was slightly improved, adding a slight curve to the toe box did nothing to repair the holes worn through the heels, the scuffed leather, and the separating soles, and therefore did not extend the shoes’ lifespan.<br /><br />• They are also advertised as being able to keep your favorite shoes dry every day -According to this, all I have to do is own the crease protectors and, if they work as advertised, I should be able to put on my favorite shoes without the protectors in them and go walk into the lake and my favorite shoes will stay dry. Yeah. OK. Sure.<br />• enhance the comfort of your big and little toes -Nope. I had these crease protectors in every pair of shoes for nearly 2 weeks and felt no increase in comfort when wearing my slippers at night or walking barefoot.<br />• be easily trimmed to size. ¬-This one was SO close to being true. “Be easily trimmed”, that part is true. Just use scissors and cut. Unfortunately, it also says “to size”. There are three lines molded to the inside of each protector to use as a cutting guide, however, they aren’t labeled as to what size cutting along each would yield. I tried equating size 9 to the line which makes the protector the smallest when cut and then added a shoe size for each line, but that meant that not cutting them at all would make them fit size 12, which would be impossible since they are supposed to go to size 15, or is that ALSO incorrect? Plus, I didn’t cut them at all and they fit perfectly in my size 13 shoes. Also, there is zero information or instructions on how to adjust them for size through cutting, only the blanket statement that they can easily be cut to size. Easily cutting to size doesn’t make much difference if you have no way of knowing what size you are currently at, which size you are cutting to, or when you’ve cut enough to reach said size.<br /><br />• They are advertised as being compatible with Air Force’s, Jordan’s, Dunk’s, Yeezy’s, Kobe’s, Lebron’s, Smith’s, - Of the four pairs of shoes I tested these with, they worked the worst with the Air Force Ones.<br /><br />• Timberland’s, CAT’s, -There is no chance a flimsy little piece of plastic makes any difference, or is even noticeable, in a molded upper work boot, most likely with a steel or composite toe.<br /><br />• and all other sneakers.  -According to the image in the product description these work with every other brand of sneakers. Obviously impossible. They don’t even work with the sneakers mentioned by name.<br /><br />What’s Included in the Price?: The price includes two pairs of white and two pairs of black crease protectors. One crease protector from each pair is labeled R, for the right shoe, and the other L, for the left shoe. The inside of each protector contains three guidelines for cutting and trimming, molded into the protector. The packaging is a simple plastic zip lock bag, shown in the attached pictures, with a sticker on it of a bar code. Close inspection of the sticker reveals that the product was made in China, and explains the warranty and return policy as follows, “*Free Return/Replacement for Any Products Purchased on AHYGIOOS within 90 days.”<br /><br />Actual Product Performance: The attached pictures include all four pairs of shoes I tested these with. In each picture, the shoe in the foreground (the one closest to you in the picture) has a crease protector installed, while the back shoe has no protector installed. This makes it easier to illustrate the minuscule amount of difference made by the crease protector. I covered all the bases, new shoes which were mentioned by name in the product description, old shoes mentioned by name in the product description, and two very different types of additional sneakers.<br />The shoes used for testing were brand new custom Nike Air Force One MrHlywd Edition’s, old and worn down Nike Air Force One’s, Adidas style custom Avicii’s, and Fuego Dance Sneakers. The crease protectors would not stay in place in either of the Air Force One’s, in both cases riding over my foot, towards my ankle after a few minutes of walking, and then cutting down onto my toes with every step, requiring me to take them out. In the Avicii’s, they didn’t ride back so far as to cut down onto the tops of my toes while walking but rode back hard into the tips of my toes, causing me to have to curl my toes, and eventually remove the protectors from pain. The Fuego’s were the only shoes where the protectors didn’t move, however, Fuego’s are actual dance shoes, and therefore extremely tight to begin with all around. While the protectors didn’t move, because there was quite literally no room to move in, they did fold up hard on the outer sides and jammed against my outer two toes on each foot, which eventually began to rub raw, again, requiring the protectors to be removed.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: The translation from Chinese to English was done horribly. While any average person can figure out the intention of most of the statements, it is beside the point. When planning on selling and marketing a product in a foreign language, in a foreign market, your translation needs to be spot on, or else there will be confusion. While we can infer that the line about keeping your shoes dry is in reference to the amount of sweat, or lack thereof rather, created when wearing a shoe with the protector in it, that is not what is stated. The multitude of grammatical errors and mistranslations is not only highly unprofessional but also means we don’t really know which parts are correct and which aren’t. For example, are the crease protectors truly intended for men’s sizes 9-15? Or perhaps for women’s sizes? Or perhaps those are Chinese shoe sizes? We really have no idea, and no way to discern the truth.<br /><br />Verdict: These crease protectors neither work as advertised nor work as intended by the advertising. The tiny amount of increased curvature gained in the toe box is so minuscule that it is not worth the time spent messing around. This is especially true because improvement only exists when the shoe is not being worn, since wearing the shoe with the crease protector in causes such pain, the protector must almost immediately be removed. I didn’t pay for these, but if I had, they would have been immediately returned. Final verdict, save your money for a product that works.<br /><br />My Star Rating System:<br /><br />5 Stars: It works extremely well. Not only am I buying another one, but I am also buying one as a gift for someone else. I feel a strong sense of brand loyalty and would purposely seek out the brand in the future when doing product research. I will go out of my way to explain my positive experience to others. I will voluntarily spend time rating and reviewing this item favorably and will include detailed information, pictures, and videos.<br /><br />4 Stars: It works very well. I will be buying a second one. I feel good about the brand and would choose them again over a similarly priced and featured item. If brought up organically in conversation, I would explain my experience to others as positive. I would spend time rating and reviewing this item favorably, with a non-informative generic rating if prompted and convenient.<br /><br />3 Stars: It works well enough and gets the job done. I’m not buying a second one, but I am also not returning this one. I am neutral about the brand and have no brand loyalty, especially since the brand feels like just letters on a page, existing only to fill in the required fields of an item description form. I’m not going to go out of my way to explain my experience to others, as there is nothing of consequence to explain. I will not be spending any time rating or reviewing this item, either as favorable or unfavorable.<br /><br />2 Stars: It doesn’t work very well. I will be returning it. I feel bad about the brand would not choose them again over a similarly priced and featured item. If brought up organically in conversation, I would explain my experience to others as negative. I would spend time rating and reviewing this item unfavorably, with a non-informative generic rating if prompted and convenient.<br /><br />1 Star: It doesn’t work at all. Not only am returning it but will avoid other products sold by the brand. I feel a strong disgust towards the brand for having the audacity to even attempt to sell such garbage and resent the brand for wasting my time. I will go out of my way to explain my negative experience to others. I will voluntarily spend time rating and reviewing this item unfavorably and will include detailed information, pictures, and videos.<br /><br />Star Rating: 1 Star"

1.0,I was super excited to get this for my 2 girls but to my disappointment it was a waste of my money..my girls wore this only once for a short period and both of them turned bronze..NO STAR IS WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO GIVE 🙄
1.0,Completely the wrong size. Does not fit my Gear S2 at all.
1.0,Product way smaller than description
1.0,"It is a super cute dress. I usually wear a M/L and got an XL and it was a little big on me. However I 10000% would not recommend. It cut my arms up really bad and left me with a really bad rash that hurt for days, and I only wore the dress for 30 min (photoshoot)"
1.0,"The mask I received was not as advertised. The photos depicted for the product may be doctored or altered because when wearing the mask, the anatomy of the skull is way out  of proportion. Also the top of the mask has the eye holes of the skull on the mask. So, for anyone to properly use the mask the eye holes on the mask should be covering their actual eyes. What's the sense in that?? So I tried folding down the top bit to make it work..can't only solution I can find is getting it trimmed or altered."
1.0,The band doesn’t fasten securely. After several attempts my watch fell to the ground and shattered.<br />Do not purchase the product. It does not work.
1.0,The description of the outfit was 12 to 18 months I have a smaller 13-month-old and this should have been marked 9 to 12 months. Not to mention the piece was made entirely from polyester
1.0,material is similar to shower curtain and arms and shoulder area too small

1.0,Come with a hole in the side
1.0,Very small xl size actually is a xs size. The blouse is so beautiful. But dont fit at all i couldnt even try on.
1.0,Arrived tarnished- very dissappointing. Don't waste your money on cheap junk. You can see in the pictures how the chain for the neck is brownish color compared to the bright gold links around the red beads. It should all be the bright gold. It looks horrible in person.
1.0,"Bad advertising, cheap prices with OUTRAGEOUS shipping fees. Amazon needs to stop this type of deceptive advertising!"
1.0,Fell apart on me after a month. Worst part is they were really comfortable and I got a lot of compliments on them.
1.0,"Great graphic ruined by an ill fit. The T-shirt is made by Fruit of the Loom. The neck hole is almost big enough to fit two necks into. If you consider yourself average build like myself, my advice is to look for the Gildan brand tees. I suspect the photo in the description actually is a Gildan shirt."
1.0,does not work like advertised
1.0,"This thing broke within the first hour of use. I guess if you use it to make some simple bracelets, it will hold out. However, if your kid makes a complicated design, this thing wont take the strain and it will crack and snap.<br />So the bottom line; if you're cold-hearted and don't mind seeing your child upset, then by all means, go for this cheap imitation..."
1.0,Very cute style but very poor quality. Runs big
1.0,What tipe of people can sell this dress???? Is a big noo for me.
1.0,This was a really bad shirt. It was stained and the tag was cut off? Like what? The material was soft though. I’m 140 5’3 and the medium tank top was pretty flowy on me? Idk if it’s because it had obviously been used before (yuck) or what but wouldn’t recommend getting.
1.0,Ordered since nov 13 2015. Yet to receive it. So slow. Disappointed

1.0,I need bracelet thin because the charms is very small to my bracelet<br />Do you suggest some thin bracelet to this charms
1.0,"I LOVE Grateful Dead, and got these because they said men's small and I am a female. They weren't small at all and were like an extra large even on my fiance. I gave both pairs away to a friend, the material didn't even look comfy and was cheap. In fact one pair got a hole ripped in the fabric as soon as I got them. Very disappointed."
1.0,"After seeing the advertising pictures I was intrigued.  It appeared to be an attractive and functional watch with the important things I was looking for in a watch.  As a volunteer first responder,  I often have to check vitals in low light and dark conditions.  In order to check pulse and respirations, it is very nice to have a illuminated sweep second hand.  As I opened the box I was excited, expecting to see 14 wonderful little tritium tubes glowing up at me. Instead, I found a dark, plain looking watch with absolutely no luminous output.  Now I have to return this hunk of junk, wait for my money to be returned and then shop for something that will work. Thanks for wasting my time and advertising something other than what I paid for...  I will get some pictures and update this review before returning the watch so you can see (or rather not see) the lack of the key component that prompted my purchase."
1.0,The post are not long enough and too thick!
1.0,"I did like these aprons before. I recently ordered 2 more pairs, but when they came in, they were thinner and the V cut bows way too low to cover anything. Even with the adjustable strap it couldn't compensate for the wide opening. I'm very disappointed and will be looking for aprons elsewhere."
1.0,I loved this piece... but the Good Morning Sunshine charm fell off within me wearing for just a few hours on the day I received it! I was so disappointed! 😥
1.0,"This is a diving wet suit material, thick and awkward along with it would not wick away sweat fast enough to keep dry in normal settings such as the gym.  None to not much support. Runs big."
1.0,The material feels like some kind of weird synthetic plastic. Fits too big at the top and too tight at the middle. Just awful.
1.0,"Too short, pinches, and just generally uncomfortable. They ride up a lot."
1.0,no shorts come with this beware
1.0,Horrible product the first day they started falling apart. Total rip off!!! Would not recommend to anyone
1.0,"These are the farthest thing from water  resistant or quick drying.  I took them to Canada on a fishing trip and it started to rain.  They were soaked within a few minutes and took a full day to dry, even after I put them over a wood stove.  Maybe if it was a slight drizzle, or a drop or two it would  be a different story."
1.0,"Material is very slippery and my 6-year-old couldn't make it stay up. It's also a very thin, single layer and completely see through. This is not COVID safe. Please do not purchase it as a COVID face covering."
1.0,"runs small,ordered xl measured and wears on the small side, have a hand wash and line dry then is wrinkled ...terrible"
1.0,Ordered my size and it was super small and I had send it back.
1.0,It stretched out.  Doesn't look like leather.
1.0,"Doesn’t fit, cheap fabric rod in front it too firm it’s nearly impossible to wear. Waste of money"
1.0,"First, I loved how comfortable these pants were. But after the first wear, there were pulls or tears in the fabric at the seams. I hand washed & hung dry. The pulls make the material so thin, they are see through & can not be worn. After one wear! Manufacturer offered no resolution. So disappointed they are so cheaply made, because they were very comfortable."
1.0,Zipper broke with in a minute
1.0,Exactly what was pictured however didn’t last beyond even 2 weeks. Not worth $20 for the gentle use of it!
1.0,flower sits to high
1.0,Product is way too tight. Not true to size at all. My son could barely squeeze his foot into these socks
1.0,The bracelet was alright but I did not receive any of the things that was suppose to come with it so was very disappointed in my purchase
1.0,"I wear between a 2xl and a 3xl, but based on the size chart, I ordered a 5xl. I ORDERED A FIVE XL. Yes, read that again. It was TOO SMALL.  Very disappointed."
1.0,dont really use it. didnt seem to work well and wasnt all that comfortable.
1.0,"This fit so weird, and the material was awful. It shrunk, and was just not worth it at all. I was bummed because I liked the print."
1.0,Inferior product. The straps broke on each of these after one day of wear. The kitten appliques started pealing off almost immediately. I don't recommend purchasing these.
1.0,I couldn’t tell if it was even cute through all the horrible stains and discoloration to all 3 pieces. Was so disappointed and had to run out and find something last minute for my son to wear to his sisters graduation. :-(
1.0,I used the same size as everything I buy maybe a size bigger because I have big calves and I couldn't go past the ankle part. Everything it was on it brought down swelling. But hurt where the sock cut off at above my ankle. I needed these as I was swelling post surgery.
1.0,Took longer than expected. Size is very small.
1.0,Item is 95% rayon. Not cotton or a cotton polyester blend as stated in the description. Very thin and flimsy. It's a shame because it's a nice cut. It was supposed to be a gift. Ended up returnin it. The was also a stain on the back. Just disappointing all around.
1.0,Cute idea but the material they used was too over powering to wear.  Washing it did not help.
1.0,Strap broke on two separate dresses would like to still return at least one for a refund
1.0,This is a terrible product. Doesn't match the description of what I ordered. 5PC instead of 10. Polyester not cotton blend. No filter pocket. Very cheaply made. The seller is offering 40% refund if I don't mail it back. A full refund plus shipping if I do mail it back. Not a lot of trust here. DO NOT BUY!!!
1.0,They look cheap and you can't tell what they are.
1.0,"My child managed to destroy these (as in, the toe RIPPED OPEN) within about three weeks of wear."
1.0,Really bad quality. Very fragile. Wont even sit straight on my face.
1.0,"Shocking pink, not the color in the pic.  Long ties in the front with no beads.  Design is printed in hot pink, blue & white.  Not the colors in the photo.  Small & cheap, thin fabric.  Looks like a top from the 99 cent store.  A total piece of garbage."
1.0,Size is WAY off! XL is more like medium. Awful. Disappointing.
1.0,"Upon 2nd use, the closing mechanism failed. This caused the umbrella to lock fully open. Consequently, the umbrella is no longer able to be used."
1.0,"These are child sizes not adults. The quality is garbage, and look nothing like this picture. Wont be purchasing from them again."
1.0,Terrible quality and did not fit at all!
1.0,Thhe color is grey not black. Says knee high...wouldn't be knee high even on a kid.
1.0,"Like other reviews, it came with the cuff attached wrong and there is no possible way to attach it to your ear.  My 10 year old daughter bought this because she thought it was cool.  She waited everyday for it to come and was SO disappointed that it didn't even work.  Cheap piece of junk."
1.0,Super cute glasses just way too big for my face!
1.0,Was way too Large. I was surprised because usually these tops runs super small.  Had to send back. Nice style though!
1.0,"I feel so embarrassed, given to my sister as a gift,after a one week, the ring became discolored,  definitely is NOT! ! 925 sterling silver, I recommended do not buy.very poor quality."
1.0,See through and clinging
1.0,"Size is not really true size, still small. You won’t sweat like what a sauna suit does. The waist trimmer won’t stay fastened and the quality is very cheap."
1.0,"So I read all the reviews and took both sides into consideration, I was initially nervous about the embroidery and the little black flower things.  BE WORRIED!!  I thought they looked cute and discrete in the pictures....NOPE!  They look cheap and like something I would put on my 2 year old.  I tried on, doesn't look much better, returning this dress."
1.0,Arrived with two holes in the seam at the legs.
1.0,"I must say I am extremely disappointed in the 2 pieces I received today.  They are just 2 very small, very thin slivers.  I was expecting possibly small but something thicker then this.  Very disappointed and wish I would have checked out the reviews and Company before buying.  Will not recommend"
1.0,Multiple holes in the seams. Not very well made.
1.0,"It did not fit my daughter it was too small, my daughter was left  beyond disappointed and now said she doesn't have a summer bathing suit."
1.0,The item broke the first time I put it on.
1.0,"I made it work, it was very nice but as I barely wore it out and drove to my destination. I noticed the knee bone peeling off and other parts. Good for one use only."
1.0,"U think this is for plus size only, I got a small and it was emensely huge!"
1.0,Didn't like it wasn't what I expected.
1.0,"These cut my arms. Twice. The adjusters have a sharp pin that scrapes your arm if you make any sudden moves. I tried taping over the adjusters on the front, but it did not work and looked shabby. They are kind of cheap, so hardly worth returning. I will just throw them in a drawer. Another product that the designer never tried to wear."
1.0,"Material so thin and cheap you can read through it, didn't pay that much so not worth returning it.  I am so disappointed not sure I would even give it one star"
1.0,The knit of both the jacket and pants is such that it started pilling almost right away. After 3 months of wearing once a week for 2-3 hours on the ice it looks terrible. And one pants leg is longer than the other so much so that my 10 year old noticed it. Very disappointed for the price.
1.0,The hat always looks wrinkled up and is just not an attractive hat. Not much else to say.
1.0,"1. Comfort: poor, potentially needs time to stretch and adjust, yet based on design it might not work as will not stay as needed.<br />2. Sound: awful, like the cheap headphones given out by airlines 15 years ago without the over the head band.<br />3. controls are not trivial when wearing the hat.<br />4. Idea - great, yet idea by itself is not a product. Needs work.<br />Every physical part needs improvement, price way overrated, greed is the only thing that is exercised successfully. Will try the hat again since return is by end of January. Will give it another chance before potential return.<br />Great idea, very disappointing execution."
1.0,They just didn’t work on my head
1.0,"the red bracelets color rubbed off on my skin the first time I wore it. The dye stayed I. My arm for 3 days even though I scrubbed it with soap, very disappointed 😩"

1.0,Don't buy.  The clasp is extremely difficult to operate when made into a paracord braclet.  I can only get an occasional spark. The seperate flint rod is too small to hold onto while trying to make a spark.  I don't think it is a true flint.  I  purchased a different type of buckle from the same company that works  100% better. The only good thing on this is the small knife blade.
1.0,"Doesn’t hold shape AT ALL. If you’re looking for that thick material, this is not it. Flimsy."

I have used 3 and each one has broken.<br /><br />cute set. maybe better for a small child
1.0,Hat way too small-------Must be a young child size------even too small for my grandson was going to send it back----return label does not include postage----postage and envelope at post office was more than the cost of the hat---
1.0,It broke as soon as I opened it! So much for this birthday present.
1.0,These suck. The only xl gloves that don't fit. They are super thin and RIP. Don't waste your money!
1.0,see through. pockets make hips look big. cheap material
1.0,It's a nice looking robe. It's a heavy knit but the one I received was not evenly dyed as if it had been washed and the color ran out. I returned it
1.0,The way the arms are made (3/4 sleeve with a wide cuff sewn on) make this too small for an average person; much less a small person  to get their arm through.
1.0,"These gloves are just plain bad...they are poorly sized, 2 of the right hand gloves got holes within two weeks, and they have an awful, nauseating, rubbery smell that stinks when you're using them and stays on your hands for several hours or more that renders them unusable.<br /><br />Even if they fit right and didn't get holes, I would have thrown them out anyway because they smell so bad."
1.0,They smell they had two holes big holes they look like somebody wore them now they're in the trash don't buy don't buy don't buy
1.0,Lights stopped working the next day. Already ripped as well
1.0,"Worst shopping experience on Amazon.<br />My purchase started off bad quite early, purchased May 15th patiently waited, item never arrived on its shipping date. Messaged seller they told me it would arrive sometime last week, it never did.<br />Item get delivered the following week June 6th, open up the box and to great disappointment the hat is damaged, partially crushed and upon further inspection, turns out the hat is of poor qualityfor $72+, it was dry and brittle so much so you could heard the crackle. It also had weird tint of color. It's probably old stock. Sending it back for a refund, to have waited this long (22 days), what a disappointment 😒<br /><br />Buyer beware !!!!"
1.0,"I purchased two Crazy Horse Khaki wallets and they were about five shades lighter than what was pictured. The picture showed brown, but the actual color was very light tan, close to cream in color."
1.0,This cardigan would be perfect for fall and super cute… However there is a big downfall to this cardigan… The pockets looks like someone who doesn’t know how to sew has attempted to put them on in a last-minute ditch effort. I really wanted to like this cardigan but there’s no way that I would wear it in public because of how cheap it looks. Don’t waste your money on this item.
1.0,sun glasses came on time but very cheap looking/feeling and half of the lense is a different color than the bottom half so it makes it hard to see
1.0,Doesn’t even stretch enough to be able to get on my feet. Waste of my money
1.0,If you like tiny charms I needed something a little bit bigger these are about the size of a dime
1.0,"I am so mad! My watch came today and when I opened the cute little zip case it came in, a piece came flying out. Open it all the way to find there’s no plastic protection on either side of the watch itself and it’s scratched all to hell on the back. The piece that came flying out was part of the latch! So now I have not only a scratched but a useless broken watch."
1.0,hate the bag its so small.
1.0,"Looks nice overall and holds a decent amount of cards and bills, but the zipper is horrible and frequently opens.  Not a great feature for a wallet!!"
1.0,The quality of the t-shirt is poor. Stretches at neck and doesn't retain shape.
1.0,DO NOT BUY!!!!! This crap isn't even long. Stops half way by your stomach. So pissed off because it looked so cute from the picture. Never again will i buy amazon clothing.
1.0,"I did not like the item, looked cheap, was way to small. Will just give it away to Goodwill or just throw it away."
1.0,"Not consistent size. Nice design, but poor production craftsmanship. Return for one size up ,bigger size  way to big. My size 30x32 way to small.  32x32 way to big and looks different.<br />Return takes 2 monts."
1.0,Very pretty but broke same day i got them:(
1.0,too  short this  is  not  listed in  size  right  shame  on  you
1.0,"They are really cute and perfect for Harley. But I have thick legs, they didn't even get past the top of my knee and cut my circulation off. At least I don't have to worry about them falling down  :("
1.0,"Nice color but the dress wasn't the same length around.  Very small fit,  order a size or 2 up."
1.0,Not comfortable and not a secure fit. Returned.
1.0,It is way too small . Size up as far as possible if you want it to fit. I'm not a large person or obese.
1.0,"This dress was for a wedding.  It took forever to ship to me and then, as you can see, the color and style were TERRIBLE!  Supposed to be a 'mocha' brown...was cement colored. The gathering was massive and made me look 20 lbs bigger!  I'm only a size 12, 5'8"", and have an hourglass shape.  I even tried to have it altered and the tailor said 'never buy on line!""  This dress was NOT what they show!"
1.0,"I ordered a NEW dress, but when the dress arrived, there was a damage tag attached to it that said ""soiled"" and it clearly smelled like laundry detergent."
1.0,Cheap quality and poorly made
1.0,It was a waste of money. The material and the zipper is not good quality material.
1.0,Cheap material xxl fits like a lg ...
1.0,"The product is fine, except not true to size. My normal size is x-large, and I ordered xx-large and too small."
1.0,Ordered 2 sizes bigger and still too small.<br />Returning.
1.0,"As I opened the product bag, a Shein tag fell to the floor. Search on the Shein site ""Cheetah Print Lapel Collar Button Front Blouse With Shorts"", and you can get this EXACT shirt PLUS SHORTS for less than you get it here. I hate being finessed. You're welcome."
1.0,The post of the earrings are too big. Was not able to wear them. Necklace is too heavy.
1.0,It broke 2 months after buying. Simple fix. Just need a new spring pin. Tried contacting the company for help getting a new one and got nowhere. Horrible customer service. Zero help. And now I can't get specs on that spring size (it fell out and is lost) very disappointed because it is very pretty and very comfy.
1.0,Just does not fit right! The material was extra loose!
1.0,Cheap af
1.0,"I was excited about this hat, but had to return it upon receipt.  For some reason the lanyard was sewn into the TOP of the hat (instead of underneath) so that when you tighten to keep the hat on in wind, the sides of the had are pulled down over your ears."
1.0,They arrived broken and were not square dice. They looked like they had been cheaply made.
1.0,"Liners are extremely long, picture is not representative."
1.0,Not a single 16g top will thread in to the 16g 4mm posts.
1.0,"First of all, the sizing is sooo small, i’m typically between a small or medium and so I got a medium hoping for some extra room for clothes underneath but the spacing in the arms and shoulders were so tight! I could fit but not very comfortably. The quality seemed okay but not worth over a hundred bucks, the embroidery seemed good but the print of the blue was kinda wack. It took forever to ship so it was wasted anyway because it didn’t come in time for when I needed it, and when I returned it it cost me 40 bucks in shipping! buy at your own risk."
1.0,This is a pandora knock off that doest even fit pandora bracelets
1.0,Although attractive the plastic is cheap and they break.  I don't even know why. I just pick them up and see a crack and the lens falls out. Maybe I can use the sunglasses next summer for reading if I'm careful.
1.0,These are the worst pants I've ever purchased from Amazon.  The fabric is cheap and see-thru.  I don't know anyone who could wear these - unless your really skinny and like cheaply made pants and fabric that is unacceptable.  Plus I have to pay for the return shipping.  BE AWARE!
1.0,Compre unas mallas y recibí un suéter del tamaño de un elefante!
1.0,Was too large at the top of the boot and the top part of the boot had a wrinkle in it.
1.0,Not ask described and missing pieces
1.0,"Poor Quality!!! A waste of time, not worth your money, breaks tears apart as soon as you put them on. Ordered a replacement and it arrive with the ears off."
1.0,"The design was very nice, but it doesn't matter because these socks don't fit. It's not a size issue--the material simply has no give."
1.0,"This dress is not as pictured at all, it is not sheer, as my 12 year old put it...""it looks like it is made out of dry fit material"" not flattering not  cute... just a big no all the way around. I should have taken a picture of the dress but was so shocked by how different the material is than how it looks that it went straight the the UPS store for a return."
1.0,"Unless you have three hands at least, this tool is very hard and I will say almost impossible to use.  I have fixed Italian Charm bracelets before as I sold them, but I wouldn't waste time or money on this particular product.  Sorry."
1.0,Cheap. I returned it.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:612e22de2f0c6af965c907dee423cdca]] Beautiful purse but strong glue fumes rhinestones missing and wrong size sent
1.0,Awkward fit..Back  lower fit is double balloon size.. never seen this fit
1.0,se daño el primer dia
1.0,Thin fabric!
1.0,"Not good quality, thin and it was too big. I have to return it"
1.0,Cheap Halloween costume material .. plastic buttons ... falling off.. way to tight fir a large .. looks very generic .. you'll get laughed at wearing this dollar stor jacket ...
1.0,This is hilarious on. Just no.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture when you put it on. The overlay isn’t even ruched and the dress is pretty thin. Not worth the money at all.
1.0,"Addidas made a stripped jogging pant/soccer pant over ~2000 to 2013 that I LOVED.  I have tried finding replacements for my very well aged favorites, and so far, the newer stripped jogging/soccer pants from Addidas have a strange fit and are not available in as many colors.  The fit of Addidas jogging pants since 2013 is rather hard to describe.  It feels they are narrower in the hip, and not even/balanced, as if the left side is sewn a bit tighter than the right.  I have not measured seam to seam.  If I do that, I will update my review.  Also, the ""crouch"" seems considerably higher.  (Since through-out life I have had a few folks tell me crouch seam isn't the corrrect term, as odd as that seems to me, for those types of people I will appease them and say, the rise is too high.  Increasing rise on pants whether jogging or eans or even dress rose drastically in men's pants around the turn of the new millenium.  In order to where modern pants so that they contact at or near your perianum so as to allow as large of range of motion of your legs as desired, a man has to pull pants up over his belly button and nearly half way to his nipples (yes.  men have nipples just as wild bores, dogs and any male mamml even though they serve no function in male mammals.  Some people have given me a hard time for referring to nipples as nipples on male mammals in the past couple of decades despite men and male mammals whether a wild bore or a pet dog, all have nipples though the males of mammals do not lactate (normally) and do not nurse or acrry babies -- what strange times that I have to explain these crouches and male nipples.  The world has definitely gotten strange whether the extreme leftism and extreme conservatism to the extreme stuapidity and extremely dogmatic nature of folks for everything to be said in some way they prefer, as if somehow refferring to a man having nipples or a male pet having nipples is somehow offensive.  What do millinials call them, and what do millinials call the perianum region of woman, and why is it no longer right to call it a crouch.  Crouch was crouch all my life until the new millenium whther male or female.  Perhaps for professional tailoirs or clothing designers they may have a special venacular for theit trade but for lay people, a crouch has always been a crouch whether male or female all my life until th enew millenium.  Why do we have to waste so much time in modern times describing these things and learning unnnecesssary new veranacular instead of being a productive society as we once were?"
1.0,Very small to only 1 Butterfly and short pieces only 39. Most very small
1.0,So disappointed. It was way too big for a size 5
1.0,One of the nose pieces fell off a week after I got them
1.0,much smaller than advertised...i am was very disappointed.
1.0,way too small.  I wear a 12 and ordered a large....it doesn't even meet in the front.  Tried to return but no paperwork came with it and no response to an e-mail I sent.  very dissapointing.
1.0,"Really, really heed the warning about being small.  XXL fits a medium"
1.0,These are trash. Get what you pay for 🤷🏻
1.0,These do not fit anything like they say. The ruching is only at the very top next to the waist on the back. It is not flattering or uplifting for the butt makes everything look flat and bunched up under the shirt at the top. Do not buy these!
1.0,Not impressed-gave it away.  Look like a &#34;ripoff&#34;.
1.0,Poor quality construction - the metal hardware connecting the shoulder strap to the bag fell apart the first time I used the bag!
1.0,"Jesus Effing Christ. This thing is incredible. It sucks. I’m so glad I got one.<br /><br />UPDATE: After 3 days, the darn thing stopped zapping as strongly. Going to return and upgrade to Pavlok 3. Hopefully there are less issues, otherwise they will be hearing about it from me."
1.0,"Very disappointed.  Item was defective.  Fabric is nice and thick but the rabbit suit itself is poorly made.  Back panel was sewn inside out with the tag sewn on the outside of the garment between the back panel and the hood.  The ears were also sewn on upside down with the seams showing.  One would think quality control should have caught this pretty easily.  Truth be told, I'm more annoyed about having to return it to the UPS Store during the holidays with an infant in tow than I am about the defect itself.  Who has time for that?  I won't be ordering another one."
1.0,They said sterling silver so I brought it because I'm  allergic to nickel ...this chain turn as rusty as an old can around my neck..so disappointed with this product I paid more to bring it in that it was worth that's what pissed me off.
1.0,Horrible. Not the same product at all!!!!!!
1.0,"one of the snaps pulled apart the first time it was used and the piece the snap attached to was bent. while checking the other extenders, noticed the others appeared to be bent as well."
1.0,When it says sizes run small and so you go a few sizes up just to make sure they still are too small. Size chart is way off. Not happy with these at all.
1.0,Product size runs small and rips easily. Fabric was ripped from seams on first use
1.0,Huge and yo bright yo look at
1.0,Itchy and pretty heavy. Had to return
1.0,"It was too small and smelled Terribly of formaldehyde. I even washed it twice in cold water twice and it still smelled awful. I wouldn't have work it just because of the smell alone, but I tried it on, and it's itchy, made out roughy cheap material, and way too small. I am size 4 and bought the large and it was way short and the width from front to back was huge. Do not buy!"
1.0,Way to big and my head is fairly large I wear a 7 3/8  hat.
1.0,Like the rich coffee color.  I ordered 4x but received much smaller- 1x?
1.0,No paw...just the round coin magnet...sending back
1.0,"We ordered an XS/2 short and received a size medium! My daughter is very slender, these are getting sent back ASAP."
1.0,"Other than the nice color combination, this watch is worthless. It is tiny and should not be worn on a grown mans wrist. bought 2 of them, one in all black, waste of 25 bucks"
1.0,Package came without the necklace in it!
1.0,Save your money and buy something else. These don’t work
1.0,Not at all what I thought. I thought it was a soft style t shirt. Was some silky like material- like toddler pajamas ha/ not at all stylish. Bummed since had ordered for Memorial Day baseball tourney. Sizing also way off<br />Sending back ASAP
1.0,Product rusted after first use.
1.0,"These aren't whats in the photo , I'm very upset!!"
1.0,"I ordered larger than what I usually wear, but I could barely get it on. And the fabric feels like a raincoat."
1.0,Definitely not stainless steel. These made my ears react within a couple hours of wear and were itchy for days.
1.0,"This is China product. Company in China. The white guy is some random dude they hire to pretend he is the watch maker. This is pure China product. False advertisement. China, what do you expect"
1.0,Wore it once. Did not like the way it fit at all
1.0,All fingers on the glove fit fine except the pinky. It is distinctly shorter than the rest and the material between the pinky and ring finger doesn’t allow for full extension of my fingers and hand. Probably why model in photos have pinky really close to the ring finger.
1.0,Keeps falling out. Lost one of them today. Too bad my kid likes it.
1.0,"This does not look like a dress, but more like a nightgown.  I was very disappointed and returned it"
1.0,"Received sooner than expected, decent packaging however odd fit and structure and not sure I can wear them."
1.0,It came defective as you can see in the pictures
1.0,They are so small! This is made for a toddlers nose!
1.0,Wish
1.0,The photo in the product looked so good on the child wearing it. But I’m real life the clasps are very low quality and do a strange three wrap where the extra hangs loose in between the two other straps. The metal on the clasps are very low quality. It seems very big for the size we got. Very long and wide in the hips.
1.0,Very cheap material looks nothing like photo
1.0,These are horrible..... had a struggle getting my money back from company. It's like they sewed 2 different sizes together. too small on one half and too big on the other.... Don't buy!!!!
1.0,"Fell apart, junk."
1.0,"Im not sure if these socks suppose to be the way they are but I will not order them again.<br />1. The description and the color on the picture do not match. That was my error I guess for not paying attention to details.<br />2. They are really ruff material.<br />3. They are extremely hard to get on and off. So, if you have the time to waste or spare when getting ready go ahead.<br />4. I knew they were compression socks but these are way to compressed. So, if you are looking for serious compression socks these are for you.<br />5. They will not soften up when washed either."
1.0,"I can try to reorder the adult shirt, but it was inconvenience to have to create separate orders for each one.  They should allow an option to order both together.  Disappointed."
1.0,Well... the problem with this product is that is plus but is for plus size with no boobs. If you have big Breasts or at least  you have some  this is not for you.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
1.0,Girlfriend who wears a size 5 didn’t fit the size 2XL dress. Don’t buy this because it won’t fit.
1.0,The color don't look right.
1.0,"the fabric is so tacky and cheap. the skirt is weirdly long and unflattering (granted im 5'0 tall, but still). the scrunched up part is cute but its the frill thats really long. the top is really just a weird triangle fabric help up with skinny strings. really disappointed."
1.0,Clasp broke first day
1.0,"These bras offer zero support because the material is very thin. I don't think they would be effective even with an A cup.  You can literally see through it and it's a lot worse when it's stretched over the body. The pads are too small for the area and look awful-like weird pasties sitting in the center. Overall, they feel very cheap and while the cup size isn't quite big enough, the band under the breasts is too large in circumference."
1.0,"The zippers are gold (not silver, as pictured) and overall the pants look really cheap."
1.0,Shirt sleeve seam completely came apart when just trying on!!! Never even got to wear!!! Cheap as cheap gets.
1.0,Cheap. Most of them break before you can get them on.
1.0,"Missing the ""bones"" on one side! So disappointing, returning!"
1.0,well they are pretty enough but they are huge and they sit on the ears straight out not a good look
1.0,"I’m very disappointed with this costume, the gloves don’t even fit for the thumbs. The fur falls out so easily. The eye holes in the mask are no where near the correct spots. The pants run SMALL. Very very very poor quality! 0/10"
1.0,"Product was not the same color as pictured more so pink. The hing broke and will no longer latch securely I had it in for about 1.5 weeks, accidentally pulled it out and now it won't latch"
1.0,I bought the extra large as I am a DD.  They do not cover enough and they are not strong enough for the weight of my girls.  The lift was not a natural lift and the ears only stuck for a couple of minutes.  Then down the went.  Very sticky on the nipple.  If the ears stuck like that the product might work.
1.0,WAY TO SMALL! I went by the size guide offered and it is obviously wrong. I think this was made for a teenager.
1.0,Scratchy. Arms were awkward. Hard to tell if it was upside down or right side up. Didn’t like it at all.
1.0,"Didnt love it, got it for cheap while it was on sale. it was too big and didnt fit right, also the material was very flimsy. Returned."
1.0,This dress is not very practical and the cut is off.  It is a midi dress.  I got the 4-5yo size and it was too small for my recently 4 year old.  She is in a 4T in most other clothing and is slim.  The cut is off on the sleeves and through the chest.  It is very restrictive and she was really only able to try it on in an off the shoulder style.  The lace portion of this is also very fragile.  It won't hold up to much wear and would need to be hand washed or dry cleaned. I don't recommend this since I just don't think it's wearable for most.
1.0,I ordered 2 pair of these sleeves. I've only opened 1. They only stayed up for 1 week of use and then I constantly was pulling them up every 5 to 10 minutes. I was lucky enough to have a work shirt with sleeves to above my elbows so I just kept the sun sleeves just above my elbows so that they were not falling or rolling down. I was lucky enough to not have them get runs in them like others said.
1.0,The pin broke after only having it pinned for a few days after purchasing. Beware of low quality.
1.0,Not very good support.
1.0,"I'm disappointed. I bought this dress, which fit perfectly, for a &#34;ball&#34; and I will not be able to wear it. It tore at the seam and off the seam. Lost money."
1.0,Disappointed first Amazon dress at really disappoint me it does not Draper look anything like the photos when you try it on material is okay I'll find a way to make it work but definitely amiss don't buy
1.0,I really wanted to like this shirt. It had a tight band around the bottom and the sleeves were too short. It was a really bad fit and sadly I had to return.
1.0,Beautiful jacket one big problem the lace sleeves while beautiful snag on everything especially the zipper. Even zipped up they catch on everything. Wore it the other day and have six pulls in the sleeves already would not reccomend. Shame because i really like it.
1.0,"Very flimsy, broke within a month."
1.0,Tacky!!! Cheap looking and had a horrible smell!!
1.0,I am so disappointed in these. They slip right off my head. There’s no way they should have shown up in my search for “non slip head bands.”
1.0,Didn't light up and too small wanted 10 toddler
1.0,My husband loved it and it fit just fine at his normal size.
1.0,The right arm and the back get wet.
1.0,"The pants fit, the top though was wayyyy too small.<br />The top ripped along the seams as I was putting it on. Didn't pull it much if at all. This is a cheap cosplay I get it. but if you're normally a large or extra large, or if you have boobs over a size C, find a different one, don't look at this thinking it'll work for a day. It didn't last more than a minute for me. This wasn't worth the price. It's worth $15 maybe."
1.0,There was hardly any padding. So I just returned them.
1.0,Way too small. My 8 year old could fit it
1.0,Returned the product. Material too thin.
1.0,Stitching was not straight and threading shredded.
1.0,Not true to sizing
1.0,These were too small for my husband’s teeth.
1.0,the size of the upper body doesn't match the lower
1.0,This is false advertising. The sweater is not a sweater at all but very thin material.
1.0,"Bought set for the purple so opened it first, couldn't get hook open.  Didn't bother with the rest."
1.0,"I like the band, the size fits watch nicely...however one size clipped in quite nicely, but the other side doesn't clip in securely. I've had it come loose 3 times already...thankfully each time I've heard it fall and haven't lost my watch.  Looks like I'll have to buy another band before I can trust wearing my watch."
1.0,Not sterling silver. Color off! Very disappointed. I wanted to get 3 more for family members.
1.0,Broke in my hand
1.0,"In pink, this bathing suit bottom was transparent even before it was wet. Indecently so."
1.0,Product nicer than piicture.
1.0,These are NOT for large breasts at all and due to my large boobs the adhesive did not stick to well. I contributed it to the weight of my boobs.
1.0,"I haven't even tried these on.  A long time fan of Land'sEnd - they've outfitted me for decades- I've never been sent tightly rolled up balls of fabric in a tiny, unprotected, white postal,  Mailer.  I had no idea what was in that envelope and once I opened it , I was really put off to find 3 long, white, jacket like Cardigan cover.  I've owned these in the past and when handled properly, they look lovely when worn as a light jacket.<br />I'm not unrolling 3 jackets mailed/crammed into an 8"" x 4""  plastic Mailer.  I don't even own an iron.<br />Very disappointed."
1.0,Quality is horrible
1.0,Very cheaply made.Not worth the Two hundred dollars
1.0,"The pants looked nothing like the picture, also the material is very, very thin😡"
1.0,"These  are supposed to be glow in the dark, and in the cut out thats supposed to glow, there is nothing there to make it glow. Just an open cylinder.  Im dissatisfied with this order."
1.0,"I actually started out with a 5 star review. They fit great when I tried them on! However,  when I actually wore them they kept rolling down.  I don't know why thigh highs can't be designed to not roll."
1.0,"chain is total junk, broke after 1 wear but charm is nice"
1.0,"The size chart on this is completely off, I’m a 12/14, I ordered a large. When measured against my nieces size 11 dress in juniors it was an almost exact match with reference to size/width. The dress is somewhat see through but of decent quality. I just wish the sizing was accurate."
1.0,Broke after 2 days of wearing. Very cheap.
1.0,"The material is very thin and flimsy, not how it appears on the site"
1.0,The color changed on these way too fast
1.0,The material is fuckery
1.0,This ring is very thin and much smaller overall than the picture represents.  The edges are sharp.  It looks like something you would find at the dollar store.
1.0,I wish I would have actually paid a little closer attention and noticed the &#34;typo&#34; printed on the shirt.<br /><br />It has &#34;YOU'R&#34; when &#34;YOUR&#34; is correct. &#34;YOU'R&#34; isn't a even a word used in English language. What do they think that they contracting? Did they misspell a word and simultaneously make a wrong attempt at using the contraction &#34;you're&#34; meaning &#34;you are&#34;?<br /><br />Consider this: &#34;If you are dad doesn't have a beard you have two moms&#34;
1.0,"I wanted to like this dress, but the fabric was so flimsy it showed every lump and flaw—not only showed, but drew attention to it. I am a size 4-6<br />and usually a medium would give me a little extra room, but with fabric thinner than a lightweight t-shirt and an extra tight fit this dress just doesn’t flatter. I know women who bought this in other colors who liked it, so maybe it was the brown fabric that was particularly low-quality. I meant to return it, but got busy and the return window closed. I suppose I will donate it, but don’t think anyone will have a use for it. I wish I could exchange it!"
1.0,"Just  a cheep  shirt made in China  , nothing special and not slim fit at all"
1.0,"These were much larger than expected. Also, mine did not have all three in the box and only came with two."
1.0,"The paint is chipping off, but the worse part is that it is completely welded together so that you cannot take apart to put on charms."
1.0,Wasn’t sheer!!! My foot looks white and my body is brown!!! I literally have white feet.. embarrassing
1.0,Fell apart and won’t stay connected
1.0,Runs 4 sizes too small
1.0,Awful fabric so cheap and very sweaty
1.0,Like many other reviews that I should have listened to... the laces broke after the second wear. Don't waste your time or money
1.0,"This is ugly in person, it’s not the same color as shown."
1.0,"very small, not able to fit around my small/average ankles!  I gave it AWAY to a 9 year old child....."
1.0,Blister city
1.0,"not even close to any American size.  tried to return with no response.  the material is gauze, not cotton. please refund the money and email a mailing label!"
1.0,"The back draw string broke the first day, low quality."
1.0,Not at all what it looks like in the picture!  Main color of shirt is olive green while only the lace is emerald green.  I will be returning
1.0,Came cracked cheaper to throw away then ship back
1.0,Very very poor quality!! Will not order again
1.0,Color is BRIGHT orange and very cheaply made.
1.0,Runs super small and is very see through. Rough material and not very comfy. Two thumbs down.
1.0,Very cheaply made. Not recommended.
1.0,Skirt fabric feels like a curtain.
1.0,This is made for a child not for an adult. Several of my friends bought this shirt for a luau themed party and all of them are returning the shirts because no matter what size they ordered they are all too small. I ordered a xxl and it was more like an adult small. The sizes are WAY off.... I am returning it as I couldn’t even wear it for the event .
1.0,Melted big clump unusable.
1.0,"They are very pretty, however, I found the same pair half price at a department store. I returned them and bought the ones at the store."
1.0,Didn’t work...
1.0,"Looked great for the price but glass fell out broke all the min, hours, seconds fingers.... was my favorite watch for daily use....too bad there are no more to order."
1.0,"I bought these underware for my husband before and I purchased the same thing, same size and it’s not the same size. It was like a size larger. I have washed them in hot water even."
1.0,not good matryal its like plastic bag
1.0,poor quality lens ever seen.
1.0,"I'm very disappointed in what arrived at my house. I ordered this fascinator specifically because it looked like the shape of a flower and so unlike the other fascinators I've seen online. What arrived looked NOTHING like a flower, but simply a generic fascinator with a little extra organza over the face. It wasn't ugly by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not what is presented here online."
1.0,The size says L/XL.  Didn't even come close.  It's about a size M.  Very disappointed in this product.
1.0,"The key was poorly made.  The 2 halves are basically real long U shaped objects instead of halves of a box.  One side was compressed much more than the other.  The chain was not fed thru the loops properly either, is corroded or improperly coated. Needless to say I'm not going to suggest it to any friends or online buddies."
1.0,"The tower is poorly made. I am trying to decide if I should fix it myself or send it back. It is more of a rose gold color. It is not painted everywhere and parts are black because it has not been painted properly. There are gaps where they forgot to finish painting it or just missed several parts. The main frame of the tower does not fit together well and is wobbly. I am really annoyed I paid more for this than it is worth. The color is different, it's not painted well, and it barely stands up. It is so cheap! I'm very disappointed."
1.0,"After 1st wear the metal ring that holds the draw string came off, drawstring won’t stay in."
1.0,No was is this going to fit around anyone's neck; way too small to fit. You could possible wear has a bracelet; but that is a bit aggravating to do I would not recommend this to anyone.
1.0,"In the picture they were showing 2 different color frames, I received 2 brown frames. I don't think it's professional to show certain colors then deliver 2 frames not only a totally different color, but they're both the same color that I wouldn't have bought.  Were they not a blue and a red color?"
1.0,"these face masks that I bought for my grandson is absolutely not what was pictured,<br />Doesn't look anything like the product I thought I was buying"
1.0,"This ring is not at all as pictured. It is tiny and flimsy. Unless you are giving it to a young girl or stacking it (which won’t work well-I tried), don’t buy this!"
1.0,"Nothing like the picture! Not even the same material! It’s the stretchy thin material that after you wash, disforms the whole shirt! Don’t waste your money!"
1.0,I went to a boutique and saw this shirt there but it was expensive! i saw this shirt on amazon and got excited to order it. i knew that it wouldn't be the exact quality but the quality they sent me is just all the way bad. It doesn't fit the way it needs to and the material is so cheap. Plus because the material is so cheap it doesn't give the sleeves the same effect. I will insert a picture of what its SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE
1.0,Tooo large. I expected it to fit but unfortunately I have an outfit too large to wear.
1.0,Cheesy thin clingy fabric
1.0,"Bought this dress for my daughter, when it arrived I was very disappointed in the quality of it!  It looks like it was made from a bed sheet!! Horrible, u can see the seams were not sewn right, very see through, we bought the white one!  Will never order from this company again!"
1.0,"I purchased these for a pair if diamond earrings my husband got me for Christmas. I wore them today and this evening when I went to take them out, one was missing! Don’t trust these for precious earrings, you will lose them!"
1.0,Came from China in a envelop completely squashed flat.cheap to begin with but not wearable. I also have a big head physically and the glasses just fall off... not sure if it is due to being squished flat or just product design? Bummer because they have potential!
1.0,"No he podido dar con la formar de ponerme esa camisa, simplemente es un disparate 😡"
1.0,They are hard to adjust and the arms are not adjustable as advertised.
1.0,It is see-thru and large.
1.0,It’s adorable but the flowers Fell off as I took it out of the package. Some of them didn’t even appear to be attached in any way. It looked cute at first but obviously isn’t even functional as is.
1.0,Love it but it's held together by a magnet.  I have now lost 2 of them and am so bummed.  Too expensive to be made to fall off so easily.
1.0,Very small and falls apart when washed
1.0,very cheaply made and looks it.
1.0,I just received this. It is too short and so cheaply made.  I HATE it
1.0,shirt doesn't fit well
1.0,Like a piece of string.
1.0,"Honestly, not at all impressed.  Wondered if these were even authentic Johnston & Murphy’s!<br />They looked and felt very cheap, almost vinyl(ish).<br />Hubby has multiple pairs of J&M’s, these did not join the collection!  Another pair were to be ordered until the trouble with the return.<br />Contacted business for pre-paid return label, which was a complete “runaround” and never received (we paid return postage).  Refund took weeks.<br />**Not sure we even dealt with<br />JOHNSTON & MURPHY**"
1.0,Color is so dull. Not at all bright like the photo.  Very disappointed!
1.0,"I’ve been using the band for everyday wear, and I wear it to the gym. However it does get uncomfortable and I have developed a rash on my arm. I do make sure it isn’t too tight, and will be buying a replacement band that doesn’t bother my skin. I read other reviews after the rash developed and found it is a problem with this band."
1.0,Gray is more like silver. I was very disappointed.
1.0,"I don't understand how a 36in waist can vary so greatly.  I took off a pair of size 36 waist pants i wore all day to try on my iloveSIA shorts and found them tiny enough to pinch my belly.  also, the material is very thin and looks easy to wear out."
1.0,Not at all what is pictured or described. Came as fake gold costume jewelry.  Ended up giving to my granddaughter to play with.
1.0,Complete garbage made in China. It will turn your hand green after a few hours and will break very easy
1.0,Does not sit right on you sides. The chain that goes around you is not long enough and the rest of them sit to high. Looks funny on
1.0,"The necklace came in a little plastic wrapper, but was very pretty. My daughter is obsessed with the titanic movie and loved this gift; which made her very disappointed when it broke. She wore it for less than 24 hours and in that time, a rhinestone fell out from around the heart and the chain broke. We will be returning this."
1.0,Is not what you think. Does not hold anything  in
1.0,This treatment was not successful in waterproofing my Danner boots and all evaporated off the leather within a week. Subsequent applications also failed terribly. Not impressed with the quality or longevity of this waterproofing treatment.
1.0,"First time wearing it the sleeve has a nice rip in it. I love the dress and I will be having it fixed, just feel I shouldn't have too fix the dress until it was worn for some time"
1.0,Not what it's said to be. I should know better. If it's cheap it will be cheap. Returning.
1.0,Too flimsy. Returning
1.0,After about 3 hearings the toes split open
1.0,Arrived tangled and broken.
1.0,They do not fit on frame
1.0,Waist too small and length too long terrible quality. Returned.
1.0,"I liked the suitcase but it smells very strongly of chemicals, like gasoline. I aired it out for several days and the smell did not go away. No way can I put my clothes in it.  I will be returning."
1.0,The bottoms fit like a child's XL. Very unimpressed.
1.0,I received these glasses yesterday and when I went to put them on my face they were warped horribly. I spent nearly 30 minutes trying to bend and twist them to fit my face and just couldn't get it
1.0,It fit small but a cute top
1.0,Sizes listed do not reflect proper sizing unless you’re a concentration camp survivor.  Ordered two sizes up from normal waste size and still too small.
1.0,"Wow it was suggested to order one size smaller so I did. It's way too big on me. The size chart is wrong, I know this because my grandmother is a tailor and I know how to measure accurately. The sizes are based on American Women stores, where the size small is actually approximately size 10-14. If you're used to euro sizes forget about this outfit. My measurements 34-29-36, ordered S."
1.0,Graphics started peeling off after one wash
1.0,was very low quality
1.0,it's very thin
1.0,There is only one tiny internal circle of soft wool that i assume is the legally needed cashmere the size of a silver dollar on each the rest of these are scratchy and are likely of some synthetic fiber.<br /><br />Bad fit as the cut has weird sock tightening knit on both ends and out of the three very different bodies that tried it on only the supremely fit body builder could get it on at all over the knee.
1.0,This ad is misleading. It is like putting a blanket over your face. There is no way you can breathe easy being active
1.0,"These are extremely thin,  I can see my fingers through the fabric.  Definitely not good for anything outdoors"
1.0,No me gusto párese cartón las deadems
1.0,"Terrible product, It broke in the base during my vacations and I have to buy a new one, worst quality ever"
1.0,I ordered the large according to the measurement chart and should have gone with my normal medium.  The dress was too big in the bust and waist and was also kind of scratchy so I returned it the beginning of Oct. and have not been reimbursed for it yet and am not sure why.
1.0,"In the picture it appeared gold but once I received it, it was like Bart Simpson yellow and much, much smaller than expected. Would not recommend buying from here."
1.0,Not even the same dress and super huge. Nothing like the picture. I'm 5'4 and this is the small.
1.0,Not the quality i thought
1.0,"Arrived at my house broken, very disappointed. Will be returning"
1.0,Not 100% wool
1.0,"I'm 21, 5'4 and weight 128 llbs and this could not fit my thighs. I think this is meant for skinnier people/ teenagers."
1.0,"3 socks out of 5 were the correct size, the other two were tiny! Had to send back eventhough they are adorable.."
1.0,It is a nice piece to have but it immediately began to turn colors. So now it's become a waste.
1.0,Broken two straps already.
1.0,I liked this band at first as its really pretty. But a few days of wearing it i noticed my watch isnt tracking my sleep and doesn't track my steps accurately. Have yet to find a band i really like.
1.0,Only stayed on for a few days then fell off and I waited almost 2 weeks for it!  Never again.
1.0,"Fits very awkwardly, not sure where it is supposed to fit, up higher on the waist or on the hips, it just looks ugly on both places. Not a good purchase."
1.0,They did not work for us at all.
1.0,"Horrible.... i know that we dont get the ones in the picture but this was a great disappointment. Out of all 20 the majority were weed leave and infinity signs of all different colors and some only 1 or 2 shades different from another. Not impressed. Only 4 were different and even then, 2 were stars and 1 was checkered Orange and one was just stripes. I threw them all away. Also didn't know i was ordering from China until after i paid. Wouldn't have even spent the 3.99 if i had any idea of what i was getting."
1.0,Bought this shirt for the USA vs Mexico game and could not even wear it because it was extremely small.
1.0,Great idea but poor fabric. I ordered both L and XL bc I wasn’t certain of size. Either size was not good if you have cellulite. I was hoping the L would be tighter and smooth out the imperfections but no. Disappointed.
1.0,Runs at least 2 sizes too small
1.0,This hat came malformed because somebody just threw it into a box. Had to reform it with another like it. Sad really.
1.0,restocking fee just to return a bad product!
1.0,"These are VERY narrow- SIZE UP, AT LEAST 1 SIZE! They are snug for me at just one size bigger!! These are rubber so there will not be any stretch if you are hoping for it. They are cute and waterproof otherwise, but honestly, they sell the same exact shoe (like, for real, exact same shoe) this season for 10 dollars cheaper at a major store starting with a ""W"" and ending with a ""mart."" I ended up just giving the ones I ordered here away and buying the other store's regular (not narrow) size and I actually love them. If you have a narrow foot, you'll like them- if your feet are normal, this isn't the boot for you."
1.0,Mal no funciona
1.0,"These are listed as ""sterling silver"" but they most certainly are not. They turned my skin green. Highly disappointed."
1.0,"Great look, but already coming apart at the hinge. Had to glue it back on the hinge"
1.0,Cute design but the size is not accurate and the material is not sterling silver as described. Flimsy material and poor quality. 😢
1.0,WORST CHEAP GARBAGE EVER! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1.0,They really don't glow like I thought they would
1.0,First pair I got were bent and couldn't bend them back to where they needed to be to sit evenly on my face. Ordered another pair and style thinking they would be better and these are even worse. I don't have the time to be returning glasses my time is more valuable. Very unhappy with last 2 purchases.
1.0,"I ordered a whole size up, I’m not sure if they sent me the wrong size or what, but his feet literally<br />Hang off the back. Disappointed, it’s not like I can take them from him cause you know how toddlers are. He doesn’t understand :( if you buy these, go up two whole sizes"
1.0,"Horrible customer service. Very small outfit, only refund a qauter of what I paid..<br />Very unhappy!!!!!"
1.0,"NOTHING like the cute slouchy fit in the photo. This is an ugly sweatshirt, sewn with horrible seams, and the orange is not the deep autumn orange as depicted, but like, Halloween orange! It took forever to get here, and even after arriving, my account still says it’s “delayed.” Move on - give your time and money to someone else!!"
1.0,Never got it and never got a refund
1.0,"These shoes run really small. I bought a similarl pair at a department store in a size 7 and they fit fine. I got a 7 here and couldn't get my foot in them. I sent them back and went up a size and got them wider also, these were also too small. Now I've wasted money in shipping twice, very disappointing. I ordered 2 pairs and sent both back twice. I work hard for my money and feel I just threw it away."
1.0,"Shipping was slow, finally arrived and I was excited to wear it to work. I'm a Registered Nurse and wanted a watch to wear just for work and that was easy to clean. As soon as I put it on, the band popped out from the watch face, I was able to get it back in, but it continues to come out. I contacted the seller, they requested pics, so I sent them. They replied again asking for pics, as if they didn't even read my second email that had them attached. I decided for the price, it isn't worth the hassle. I don't recommend purchasing this watch.<br />I received this item at a discount, in exchange for writing an unbiased review."
1.0,The return policy on this is insane.  Lots of hurdles and no guarantee of a full refund.<br />Also runs smalls I am stuck with a vest that does not fit.
1.0,Looked great but made of 100% polyester. No one wants to sleep in polyester.
1.0,These do NOT improve low light vision.
1.0,They broke the first say of use.
1.0,Not happy with this one... The size is teeny tiny. I couldn't wear it and my 17 year old who is 5'2 and 115 pounds couldn't wear it either.... Ugh
1.0,This is designed as a small not large/extra large.  Size prevents ability to speak when wearing.
1.0,This was so cute I was so happy to receive but when I put on the leggings they ripped .. I was very upset because I lived for this set!
1.0,Este producto a la hora de la compra decía que era automático y resulto ser de baterías
1.0,"This sweater was such a disappointment. I did not realize that it was coming from China so it took forever to arrive. When it finally did it had a odd oder, very itchy and not at all cute like the photo showed. I ended up donating it to the goodwill because it was not free return. I wish I would had read the reviews closer I would have never of purchased this item. Buyers beware this is not what it looks like at all."
1.0,"In the reviews I had read this item ran small. I ordered i size larger. There were no selections for 2 sizes  larger. I could get it on, but it's not loose."
1.0,"I have small feet, women's size 6 to be exact and I can't get it past my heel! Waste of money!"
1.0,The swim suit wasn't the same as in the picture. And it runs super small. Not worth your money at alll.
1.0,Not a TGYC patch. Just a screen print
1.0,Wow could you get any cheaper any cheeser I wish my girl was a child still I could give it to her for her dolls.don't buy worthless junk.....
1.0,"I bought this pair less than a year ago. My left sole came of the shoe and was dingling abruptly during my last ride. The sole almost got caught in the chain and I could not use the gear lever anymore and almost crashed!!!! I had to stop quickly and had to leave the sole on the side of the road. I barely made it home as shifting wasn't much possible after that.<br /><br />I tried to find support for the problem from SIdi but all you will get a a distributor's contact with an email and phone # in the USA. They have a menu when you call for warranty but no one ever picks up and I left several voicemails never returned. Same for emails. They just go nowhere.<br /><br />The boots themselves are great though slow to put on. They size true, quite comfortable and and feel tight for good protection. Which I believe they would provide if you crashed.<br />But because I can't get a hold of Sidi and the sole came off I cannot recommend you buy these boots or any other from Sidi. The quality of my pair was bad and if they had helped me get another pair or helped me otherwise figure out what happened to this particular pair, Iw would certainly let it slide. But since you're on your own once you buy these and they evidently do not support their product in the US (might be different if you are a European buyer) whatsoever, I would sadly recommend you stay away."
1.0,False advertising no electronics at all<br />4 dollar headphones.
1.0,I liked the way the pants fit but I washed them before wearing and they developed hole. I didn’t even wear them once before they started falling a part!<br />Do not buy!!
1.0,Didnt come how it looked
1.0,Hankies did not cone in a box like they are dhown.  All were irregularly shaped. None of them were square. Smaller than stated.  Will not order again.
1.0,"I like the color and style. It is WAY too small and some other items ordered at the same time, same size fit fine. Boo!"
1.0,I lost one of the earrings and didn’t even know.<br />For all I know I could have been walking around with one earring for a whole day. I noticed when I went to clean my ears. Super annoying and probably won’t get my money back since I only have one earring. Buy at your own risk of course they enjoy hiding my review because they know there product is 💩
1.0,Not cute and long like in picture.
1.0,Ordered the biggest size so I could have that extra length due to my bottom (thick girls know the struggle with dresses being too short) so a size 3x but fit like a M/L didn’t cover my bottom ... material was super see through too!
1.0,Very cheap quality. Will not even wear it
1.0,Terrible!!! I actually threw it away!!!
1.0,My son wore these glasses for three times and the blue color just started peeling off. Definitely not very good quality.
1.0,"Don’t get me wrong it’s cute but I ordered it in an adult XL for my teenager to wear as a sleep shirt. Sadly after waiting almost 4 weeks for it to arrive, it was an oddly cut/sized shirt. It’s almost as wide as it was long. It would be great for a Oompa Loompa or possibly a T-Rex"
1.0,This dress run really small.
1.0,I bought a size 6 that should be an EU 24 but I was sent an EU 21. Very dissatisfied...
1.0,Definately not true to size.
1.0,"Stone turned a whitish color like it was painted on after 2 days of wear and the stone cracked, and black spot in it! The beads on the black necklace turned colors as well, was never water worn for about 8 hours total put back in original bag!"
1.0,Very thin. Not good
1.0,Fingers way too long. Cuff too stiff. Won’t wear these.
1.0,The color looks almost red in the picture but it's very very pink
1.0,Es una porquería no tiene presión para ajustarse y pues nunca lo use no vale ni la devuelta para atrás 🙄
1.0,Just more crap stolen from real retailers and remade in China
1.0,This dress was awful! Dress did not fit well and the color and material were a bit off. I think it came from overseas. I would not recommend purchasing this dress.
1.0,You get what you pay for. It looks and feels cheaper than the picture. It ships from China.
1.0,"Description said elastic, and no option for choosing size. Item was not stretchy....too small. Waste of money."
1.0,"it does block out the red light to some extent, it will protect your eyes. However, it's so cheaply made, it's a joke. There are better quality sunglasses in a dollar store."
1.0,I thought this material was heavier than what it was. My husband Did not like it so I return it
1.0,Did not look like photo. And front is longer than the back
1.0,The sauna suit tore in the crotch area within 3 days of purchase.
1.0,Arrived broken - the chain was snapped with part of the chain missing. Disappointed in the quality of the necklace for the price. Would not recommend.
1.0,"I will use this for outside work so color is not important, but still I'd say its a pink color with ugly purple undertones."
1.0,I bought these first in a size small and they were way too small so I bought them again In size medium and they’re basically falling off me. The sizes are no good. And the color is far more dull in real life than in the photo.
1.0,This was a waste of money
1.0,It was pretty but the stones fell out within a week and I had to throw it away. I'm disappointed in this product.
1.0,Waste of money sadly
1.0,These are very comfortable and fit true to size.  BUT they are SEE THROUGH!  Terrible.  I ordered two pair and can unfortunately only return one as I had the misfortunate to find out they were see through only after/during my wearing them!!!  Do not buy!!!!
1.0,Fabric looks old and dingy! They wouldn't give me a refund. We settled on a partial. Not happy!
1.0,"The sleeves are both too long and too big due to the sewing and shoulder pockets, Likewise the shirt is designed to be tucked in as it goes past the hip but it fits poorly around the torso and chest.<br /><br />The one I received smelled like BO and had visible wear and tear on it, whoever sold it had someone try it on while running a marathon.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend anyone buying this shirt, even if you have 36in biceps it'll still fit you terrible and if you're clad in airsoft gear most of the functionality won't work."
1.0,"In real ice, this is too short, boxy ( actually square body) , and scratchy."
1.0,Too long and very tight. Sent them back.
1.0,"This is incredibly cheap, scratchy material. Not only is is cheap but the cut of this ""cardigan"" is unflattering and square shaped. I've received better quality from Shein."
1.0,Cheap belt that runs on the smaller side.
1.0,These socks are of such heavy duty compression  that it is nearly impossible to put them on yourself. The material is such that it grabs lint like crazy.
1.0,"The picture is extremely misleading. Even if I ordered two, it still would not have the same look as the picture. It does not measure 60&#34; either. The color is too white, not off white. I was ordering this for a 1920's party.  I do not recommend this product at all.  Very disappointing."
1.0,"Pretty flimsy material, more plastic than cotton.  Stretchy.  The red color was more like neon pink not red"
1.0,7 out of 12 of the classes arrived broken. I'm returning them and won't be repurchasing them. They arrived in a sturdy Amazon box but the box the actual glasses came in was flimsy.
1.0,The material is low quality and looks nothing like the picture
1.0,Not very good quality and the beads look like plastic. Disappointed in purchase.
1.0,"I don't mind a large baggy overall, but the crotch was at my ankles.  It looked ridiculous."
1.0,Didn't fit at all.
1.0,My error-did not work for my need.
1.0,These are the cheapest made sunglasses!  The film on them is rising all around the edges.
1.0,Zipper broke after 2 months of use.
1.0,the fit was not accurate
1.0,Too heavy and too big! Very uncomfortable
1.0,"I was a little disappointed when pkg arrived. The sweatshirt barely fit in the bag so when it ripped during shipping there is a black stain where the hole was in the bag. If that wasn’t bad enough, the item has a horrific smell to it. I’m really sad about this 😢. These items ARENT cheap AND thanks for charging shipping then treat my purchase so carelessly. Unhappy transaction."
1.0,"This dress is crap. I waited for weeks for it to arrive excited because I would have been the perfect summer dress and what arrived was super thin, completely see through and what looks like unfinished ends."
1.0,This shirt runs two sizes to small ! It’s not true to size
1.0,"Beautiful, not not even close to actual US sizes.  I ordered a XXL, I usually wear an XL and the dress was still too small. It looks beautiful!!! I wish it fit!!!"
1.0,Order a size down!!! Had to give as a gift....
1.0,I ordered size extra large and these pants would not fit an adult size smsll. They were mailed from China. They did not fit at all and were cheaply made and poor quality!
1.0,"I ordered these shoes in 'taupe' color. I received shoes that were different from the ones in the picture. The color is much darker and only the trim is metallic. And the trim is darker than the rest of the shoe. More bronze than taupe.<br />I found a Cobb Hill shoes in similar colors and only a trim being metallic, but different model - Abbott. And these colors version is described as 'Khaki'.<br />Moreover, the shoe I pulled out first had a sock that was even darker than the rest. It's probably a leather dyeing problem, but it looked dirty.<br />Back they go."
1.0,"I just got mine today and I was excited to put it on. It wasn't too hard adjusting the links but where the chain connects to the watch doesn't stay put. I couldn't even walk without it popping out/off. Tried switching pins, etc, nothing helped. I am returning for a replacement and will hopefully have a better update. Save your money, don't even bother."
1.0,The fit is VERY small and the dress is very short. I am 5'4&#34; and this dress barely covers my rear. Cheap material.
1.0,Would not recommend after a month you have to throw them away. Not good quality
1.0,It was a terrible material. It didn’t fit right at all. Seemed very cheap. I returned it. I didn’t even want to give it a star but I have to. The shipping was amazing as always and return process as well. Just didn’t like the top.
1.0,Does not look like pic on website top is OK but bottom is not loose like shown in pic and its definitely not long as pic shows and material is cheapy and not soft
1.0,Made of cheap plastic like leather.... don’t recommend at all. The front fit my daughters foot weird as well. Looks much better in advertised picture than in reality
1.0,Poor quality. Unraveled even with trying on once.
1.0,"This case was so poorly manufactured. When it arrived, the lining on the inside (which was made out of cheap felt glued onto cardboard) was already peeling off. The outside of the case looked good, but the inside was just falling apart. The tiers of compartments that fold out were also poorly made, and misshapen. They were so malleable that I imagine it would be hard for them to hold anything of substantial weight (and by that, I mean a few tubes of lip gloss).<br /><br />Overall, I would NOT recommend. On the bright side, I was able to return it for a full refund."
1.0,Ítem bigger than expected.  Also broke on first wear.
1.0,This is a terrible quality product for the price point. The zipper doesn’t work well at all - it gets stuck constantly or won’t zip properly and having the jacket hang open completely defeats the purpose.
1.0,Item is defected
1.0,Arrived ripped.
1.0,too big for my glasses...very uncomfortable.
1.0,It's more pink than picture reveals.
1.0,This is the cheapest necklace ever my daughter purchased this put it on her bff neck yesterday on Halloween at around 5:15pm and by 7:45pm my daughters necklace broke their is no way you can fix it what is sad she bought this with her own money.The worse part is watching my daughter bust out in tears crying because she was so sad. Absolutely nothing to like about this necklace.Now to spend more money buying a decent replacement chain smh.
1.0,Horrible fit!  Nothing like advertisement!
1.0,This was way to small and poorly constructed. I felt like Theo when Denise made him that shirt. I would have returned it but it would of cost me more to have it sent back
1.0,Would not turn on with fully charged battery
1.0,"These gloves arrived in the package with a huge rip in the leather in the thumb/ palm area.  I'm thinking that the seller is getting seconds to sell, thus the low price.  I have several old pairs of Fownes and  they have been great.  I returned them and got a refund right away, but needed the gloves , so ordered from Nordstrom, at a comparable price.  The gloves are great, IF the seller is a reputable one. Selling seconds on Amazon is not a good thing!"
1.0,Very nice shirt but I got a 2xl because I'm tall and does not fit.
1.0,It broke within a week. The string of the web. Had to order another one.
1.0,"Not only was I sent the incorrect color but the zipper was broken.  Very disappointing because the tie is actually nice. ...nice enough for a student to wear to perform in a band concert anyway.<br />UPDATE: Decided to order another tie on the off chance they got the order correct.  Nope! Ordered black, received blue; and another broken zipper."
1.0,"I was really looking forward to trying these on, yet was disappointed when I did as the size is way bigger than a true 11.5 and double disappointed when I realized there was no return label or return instructions in the package to enable a return for a smaller size.  Not the customer service I expected…"
1.0,This Combat Infantry Badge does not appear anywhere near what it should be. I do not recommend all.
1.0,These socks are school uniform socks. They do not come to the knees and are made more for a person without bigger calves.
1.0,Do not buy. These are horrible and cheap.
1.0,I paid for 24 pull ups in each pack and was given 17 pull up in package not satisfied with this
1.0,Broke as soon as placed on finger
1.0,"Highly disappointed, the shirt looks like it was wored, stretched out and the color looks faded. I was so excited to recieve this shirt to use it for Thursday because it had so many good ratings but now I'm so disappointed.😞"
1.0,"The product came damaged, but it looked like the photo and fit well."
1.0,THESE ARE SO CHEAP! The shade color is more of a hot pink and it's honestly quite tacky.
1.0,Must be from China . Sizing way off . 3x felt like a Size small. I'd show you the video of me trying it on but Amazon would flag me for indecent exposure because the bra covered nothing
1.0,Received my mighty mouse shirt today.  It has to be the cheapest material I have seen for a shirt.  I do not recommend buying this company's shirts.
1.0,I am very dissatisfied with this purchase. It’s supposed to be floor length and it looks like a child’s size. The description says 41” long and it’s 37”. It looks cheap and the material is starting to come apart in places. The first picture is on my 10 year old daughter and the second one is on me. This third picture is where it’s tearing at the seam below where it ties around your waist.
1.0,So tired of cheap fake stuff on amazon. This is terrible quality and not at all worth the $20. Not worth $10 in fact. The image they’re using is from another shop and another dress. This is just a terrible knock off of that.
1.0,It came blackened metal NOT sterling silver like it claimed. The flowers were suppose to be pink; they look yellow-pink. I am not impressed with how bad it looks. But its not worth my time to deal with a return. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY OR PRODUCT. I gave it a 1 star ONLY because it made me choose a star.
1.0,"Low quality, change color very quickly"
1.0,These are way too big
1.0,Not like showed
1.0,"Not very happy due to the fact the second hand fell off and it was past the time to send it back so it is in a local repair shop now. It probably was only wore 2-3 times before it broke, used as a dress watch, not a everyday watch. There is very little detail here about the warranty is why I sent it to a local repair shop.  It has been repaired and still does not keep time.  Now I have over $200.00 in this product and it still does not work. Not a happy customer."
1.0,Way too big for the given size.
1.0,"I bought these gloves for a ski trip, and they were absolutely terrible. They don't breathe at all, my hands would sweat profusely while skiing, then freeze because the interior lining was soaked. I put them on the hotel room heater overnight to dry, and they were still wet on the inside the next morning...even four days into the trip they were still wet, rendering them absolutely useless. I ended up throwing them out as to not waste space in my suitcase on the trip home. Thankfully I'd brought my old gloves as well.<br /><br />They are also cut oddly, the seam between the first and second finger digs into the skin/hand between the fingers, although the glove fingers themselves are at least a half inch too long. I had initially ordered a women's version in two sizes, they both had the same problem.<br /><br />Perfect example of &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34;"
1.0,"Ordered a medium and the waist seemed correct. Unfortunately, the crotch was far too long. Halfway to his knees. And the leg width was about twice as wide as needed. Received a refund right away though."
1.0,Material is super thin and tiled on me the first day of wearing it .
1.0,The eye holes were horribly place and always poking u in the eye. Hard to see out
1.0,"They didn't stay on my boyfriends head, sliding off too easy."
1.0,The back didn't fit and I lost one :(
1.0,"The thickness of the belt itself causes the buckle to unlatch, worst design I have ever seen for a ratcheting belt. Avoid it like the plague."
1.0,"This dress was too small and the cut was funky. I am normally a medium, size 8 155 lbs 5' 6&#34; 32G. It felt really cheaply made and I would not recommend it."
1.0,This dress was horrible. I am 5’1 and 190lbs. I swam in it even after reading reviews. I looked Amish. It was horrible. I couldn’t even take a picture because I couldn’t quit laughing. I don’t recommend.
1.0,Ordered 2 and both broke on first use.
1.0,"The hat came completely warped. It does not have the clean, straight feel as what you see the in the picture. The seller did process a refund. But I wasted money to ship it back."
1.0,"The material was so thin that with very little stress the pants ripped the first time they were put on. The seller said they would take them back, but then strangely they could not be found by the shipping company. Save your money do not buy. Not only was the product a waste of money, but I also lost the money spent to ship the pants back when the seller couldn’t be found."
1.0,I didn't like this hat at all.  The visor is extremely long.  It sticks out so far that your feet would stay dry in wet weather. Also the hat is over sized. It covered my eyes.  I returned it right away.
1.0,"I only got a chance to wear this swimsuit once. The very first time I wore it the metal clasp on the back to connect the swimsuit behind your neck broke. Also, the top portion was loose on me. Otherwise I would have loved this suit."
1.0,"cheap quality, returning for full refund."
1.0,Disappointed quality not what I expected too small
1.0,"returned, very poor quality, seem in leg was ripped when i put them on."
1.0,I couldn't get it off once I put the bumper guard on. I had to cut it off.
1.0,Is not sized accurately & will not give full refund.
1.0,This too us horrible. The fabric is terrible nothing like I expected I'm returning this as soon as I can!
1.0,I thought I was going to get a boy and a girl I got 2 boy gingerbread very disappointed
1.0,"Terrible fit , especially after being washed"
1.0,Water goes through
1.0,"it needed a few adjustments - it was way to wide, so i bent the ends closer together than had to trim down the wire that goes into the ear because they were too long and very sharp. next, on one of them, the clasp wouldnt hold the wire in, so i bent that.  they look pretty tho.  remains to be seen if they last thru a wearing or two"
1.0,Don't buy it.  Not waterproof.  You will hate yourself after the first shower.  I regret ordering this.  One shower and done.
1.0,Worthless in my opinion. I'm not a large person but these are way too tight and do nothing except hurt. Made out of a weird silver material which I find itchy. Don't wast your money....these are going back.
1.0,"I was very disappointed when I received these pants. The fabric was very itchy, stiff, and a very poor quality. They were absolutely huge and looked nothing like the picture."
1.0,Too small and definitely not pink. Dress is short from the front looks cheap
1.0,"The left front had a large, unsightly outpouching.  I wouldn't order these again, as the quality is horrible."
1.0,"Ran really small I bought up a size and still to small , returned as they would not replace for the price I paid<br />Sad they wouldn’t honor"
1.0,Tore the first weekend I used it
1.0,"Absolutely beautiful, not too tight, but turn after one wear.  Not worth the $."
1.0,"Beautiful looking dress. Actually looks stunning from afar.  The size chart provided is way off. This is useless to me when I can’t even get it on. The material is thin, some of the sequins were missing, and a few threads were already pulled apart. I personally can’t say this was a good product. It isn’t worth what I paid."
1.0,"I would give 0 stars if I could! This item is absolute crap! The fabric is nothing like what is pictured, and the smell is giving me a headache! The fabric is weird, shiny, fuzzy, itchy and incredibly cheap; there are exposed seams on the front, and the fit is HORRIBLE!! I can’t believe I paid over $30 for this piece of trash. Amazon needs to get rid of these sellers of cheap, trashy clothing. The more people I talk to, the worse their reputation is getting."
1.0,I bought these in March 2017 as a gift for my husband but the skulls have already faded
1.0,"They are extremely small. Idk what kind of noses these are built for but they definitely do not fit mine. I put one on and then couldn’t get it unclicked because it was so small, and my septum hurts for the first time in like ten years since it healed."
1.0,"Don’t buy this , the reviews are misleading. This vest has a chemical smell to the point it is worrisome."
1.0,"If you are looking for a covid mask, this isn’t it. I was so disappointed. It’s almost as thin as putting on pantyhose over your face. Also, there’s no sewn seams. It’s going to disintegrate in your wash. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,Im 5'5 and this was to short for me from the beginning. It made me looks like I had a package but yet it was high waters on me. The material was very staticy also.
1.0,It is not the dress in the picture
1.0,"I ordered a 3XL, im 6'2 and 250 pounds, this should fit but its somehow to tight."
1.0,This necklace is VERY nice! I'm not a fan of the clasp because its round and a pain in the arss to put on. But other than that I love it. Necklace lays flat no kinks and looks great.<br /><br />UPDATE!<br />AFTER WEARING FOR 2 DAYS THE NECKLACE BEGAN TO FADE! NOT TRULY &#34;GOLD PLATED&#34;! VERY UPSET!
1.0,Print size is HUGE — Not realistic at all. Also took forever to arrive. Waste of money.
1.0,"All three of these were difficult to get open, then wouldn't even click back into place. Seriously. All three of them. Save your money and buy something that works."
1.0,Straps broke first time wearing.  Sewing on remaining shirts are abysmal too.  Don't expect them to last either.<br /><br />Update* washed the others once and the seams started unraveling.
1.0,House slippers....As recommended to order a size larger. I ordered 2 sizes larger and still to small.  They are warm...that is it. They were to small and they ran over to the sides by the second day I wore them. If they were true to size and didn't run over to the side they would have been nice slippers. Sorry people they are junk!!!
1.0,The ring came broken. It’s not worth it.
1.0,I too ordered the skirt and was pleased when I received it - except it was WAY too small.  Order sizes up!!
1.0,this was tooo large
1.0,"Dress is not as described, dress is made poorly. It comes it an envelope like a gum. The sizes are off and fit is the worst!!!!!"
1.0,Finally received this dress and it looks nothing like the picture it came really late later than expected fabric is not that good and the border at bottom looks bad. But I'm more angry because it came very late not on time and when it did I was disappointed in what I received completely different to picture
1.0,Difficult to make returns
1.0,It is huge! Beware and make sure you review the size
1.0,"Waaaay to small. Wanted to keep it because it's exactly what I was looking for, but it is not for the ""average sized"" WOMAN; more for a ""underfed shaped"" girl!"
1.0,"Too small . Make sure to go many sizes up"" . Clothing run small."
1.0,"These sandals look really cute in the photo, but the straps are poor quality and are loose.  Missing inside strap on each sandal. Looks like someone cut them off.<br />Not sure if these were shipped out previously and returned as ""new"".  Highly disappointed."
1.0,"I returned the purse, it was to small for my Kate Spade wallet - I can not give it a star rating"
1.0,This pair of shorts are very small and very short!! I can’t even wear them!! And they are the size I would wear!! They are kids size on me!! I’m very disappointed!! I would not recommend these to anyone!!!
1.0,Didn't like style
1.0,The grip material started peeling off after less than a year....
1.0,Worst bra ever purchased. Very uncomfortable and gives no lift. Underwire hurts.
1.0,Fit is horrible
1.0,"I've ordered several pieces of jewelry from Amazon sellers.This was the first one to actually make me shake my head in disbelief. It was so bad I wouldn't pin it to my dogs collar.Maybe it was a factory defect, if so Q.C. should not have missed it. The piece was a green blob, outlined in silver.The silver veins of the green leaf were either covered or nonexistent. Even some of the outlying silver vines that form the clasp loop and wrap around behind and over the bottom of the leaf were missing. this is the first time I've had such bad quality and because the cost was so low I will give the second chance we all think we deserve, but that's it for this trash peddler. Thanks for letting me vent."
1.0,"too big, description could have been more specific on the actual size."
1.0,Bad fit. Big on top. Tight at waist
1.0,Very poor
1.0,Turns from rose gold to silver in 2 days do not buy.
1.0,"Maybe best for individuals who take there ear rings out before they sleep/shower. But as an individual who constantly keeps my earrings in, they have become tarnished even after one or two weeks being worn 24/7. Would not recommend."
1.0,Cheap product looks nothing like the picture and it’s more of a hoodie than jacket Anywhome is poorly made and bad quality period..
1.0,Very flat very cheap I returned
1.0,Recieved one that won't open or Clasp.
1.0,MATERIAL IS CHEAP AND BAD FINISH.
1.0,eye glasses are too easy to break in half
1.0,rolled onto itself and you cannot wear it without it looking dumb. May cut each piece apart and try and wear seperately
1.0,This dress is so cheap and should cost $5
1.0,"These were advertised as boy jeans, but they are most definitely not. They have small back pockets and no pockets in the front, just a like women’s skinny jeans. Would not recommend."
1.0,Price was too much for the quality. Size too narrow for my granddaughters. Exchanged for another size and still didn't fit. You have to have a real narrow foot for these shoes
1.0,"strange style, looks like from 70s, very old fashioned"
1.0,I bought this for my mom. She only used it for few times and it stopped working. We changed battery... worked few days and stopped working again! The money we wasted for batteries... could buy a good brand watch. Buying this is a waste of money.
1.0,I don't like how it's not as Pictured. It's supposed to be Dark Grey but it was not it was a light grey  so the brand is faults advertising.
1.0,The dress itself is fine and a good price. But what I don't appreciate here is the return process. I needed to return this dress for the time being because it was a size to small for me. I intended on reordering the dress closer to the date I needed it for. But its going be hard to do that seeing as I have not gotten my refund for the dress. I've been trying to settle this for over 2 months now going on three. I've sent the package to the address they provided and paid for the shipping myself.<br />So exactly when will I get my refund who knows certainly not I.
1.0,The black portion of the dress is too short. You can see my underwear. Not enough material. It is my size
1.0,"These earrings would be beautiful, however the back of them is designed in a way that makes them un-wearable. The spoke is so large around, anyone with a normal piercing cannot wear it. It also has a back that literally screws on and is is so small and delicate it's near impossible to get back on once you take it off out of of the packaging. And again, because the spoke is so large around, a normal earring back does not work, so no easy substitution option. Very disappointing."
1.0,"They have change the quality of this item since NOV2017.  No longer a heavy jersey knit.  It is light weight and almost see through, and smaller than they used to be for the same size.  I have tried twice in a month, and I tired of return shipping.  DONE!"
1.0,These fit really funny to my head.  I have never had this problem .
1.0,Do not buy this keychain. It’s very cheap. I’ve had it less than a month and the color has already started to fade and the chain broke. Don’t waste your money
1.0,"Cheap quality, don’t waste your money. I’ve been eyeing this blazer on Sheins website for a couple of months, so I was excited to see it on their Amazon store. The quality is cheap and the print looks like a brown dirt color in person. I made the decision to send it back within 30 seconds of opening the package."
1.0,Unfortunately this product barely fits adults and definitely not kids
1.0,"Didn’t look nice on me. I ordered a medium<br />I’m 5’6. Wt:128 36C. It was tight, and the sweater is too thick, it made me look round around the stomach."
1.0,They are socks.  Nothing special about them. Why they are $4 a pair I do not understand.  Not exceptionally soft or comfortable.  Very thin. I dont get it.
1.0,Cheaply made. Not even 24 hrs and 2 belt loops have already broken
1.0,This jacket was thinner than paper and wayyyy to small.
1.0,"The socks do not stretch, very unfortable!"
1.0,"When it says, &#34;runs small&#34;... you like lilliputians and munchkins... this product in a large would fit a skinny 12-year-old."
1.0,"very flimsy, nearly see through dress, that was more like a shirt on me. did not like at all."
1.0,I haven’t tried theses on as of yet but they are not decompression at all so if you want something to hold you in I would not recommend theses.
1.0,"Very cute shoes unfortunately they are uncomfortable!  Rubbed a huge blister on the back of my heel.  The material is horribly rough in the back where the zipper is located, at the top is wear it goes horribly wrong.  These went into the garbage, sad as they are super cute!"
1.0,I purchased a 3x but this 3x was way small. It was even too small for my Daughter that wore a 2x now but she continues to lose weight.  I was very disappointed in it being so small.
1.0,"This has to be the cheapest product I have ever bought online!  The elastic in the waist has no elasticity to it if you pull on it, it rips the threading! PURE JUNK!"
1.0,The watch isn't it working properly it the same t function isn't working therefor I can't even set the time on the watch.
1.0,"If I could give it less than one star I would. It was a colossal disappointment. The bag was soooo stiff and the leather felt cheap. You can barely get your hand in the pockets, let alone items. The sections are separated by thin material that would easily puncture with regular use. You would likely end up with one big open pocket. I wish I would have known, but live and learn. Hope my review helps someone."
1.0,sized up one size still way too tight material is stretchy and semi see though returned mine
1.0,This stRap is too short..even with the adjustment it is still short
1.0,They were super cool but two of the backs/batteries didn’t work right out of the box! Hoping the others will last thru the night at least :/
1.0,No. No. No.  Thought this was gonna be so much better I listened to the reviews and ordered one size up and it was still terrible I couldn't even fit it around my waist.
1.0,"This is a kids size, not a adult size."
1.0,The skirt is completely see through!!! Would work as a swimsuit coverup but not as an actual skirt.
1.0,"Very cute design, but not comfortable or adjustable. They are flat to your ear and not plush. Since they are too big they rub up against my coat collar and make a noise that I hate (sensory issues). I should have trusted the other reviews that said similiar things."
1.0,"Unless you're an A or B cup, you're not going to fit into these cups! I bought a 3X and assumed the cups would've been in proportion. NOT EVEN CLOSE!! I'm so disappointed because the suit is adorable."
1.0,Fell apart within 2 weeks. Save your money
1.0,Liked the sandles at first- they are comfortable. But it only took a day of wear for the pleather sides to start to tear and the seams to start fraying and breaking. Won't last long.
1.0,"Box - the shirt is too large ,no shape whatsoever ever, meanwhile the bottom are okay a little large , horrible uncomfortable band for a nighty"
1.0,Definitely not wind proof. Not good for winter if you live in a place that gets cold. I bought them for riding my bicycle to and from work. The coldest it's been so far is ~40­° and my hands were not warm.
1.0,"The stone that was supposed to be a November Birth Stone.  The stone that was in the necklace we received was clearly not the November Birth Stone.  It is a light yellow color vs. the vibrant orange which is the standard for the November Birth stone.  I would not recommend this product.  I would return and ask for a refund but it would be more hassle than it's worth.  Unfortunately, this POTENTIAL Christmas present for my daughter, will simply occupy a drawer in a box and collect dust.<br /><br />Very Disappointed."
1.0,"Nice dress, just too small"
1.0,If I could give zero stars I would! This fell apart as soon as I opened the packaging. The pedals literally came off and dropped on the floor. I’m glad a friend had a back up for me or I would have had nothing to wear to the party.
1.0,"If your face is larger than a business card, this mask is not for you."
1.0,Not working
1.0,My son was so upset  . The bracelet came broken and very cheaply made.  My husband worked on it for about 35 minutes and fixed it. Would not order from again should have sent it back .
1.0,These shirts are bootleg and don't support NJPW or the Bullet Club
1.0,Waist of money. Cheap crap.
1.0,"The fit is wonderful ... love the stretch in the fabric ... It's really really cute ... The PROBLEM: The fabric has a terrible odor that even after numerous launderings,  the pungent smell still has not dissipated ... I DO NOT recommend"
1.0,Size was wayyyy inaccurate so had to return
1.0,Flem.  Zee
1.0,Awful don’t even spend your money the little charms got black right away :( but it’s beautiful though !
1.0,Had to return this item.  VERY small.
1.0,Bought this to wear for halloween and it fits HORRIBLE! the top was huge and it's an awkward length and is made of a very cheap material-looks cheap and feels cheap.  I am returning it immediately.
1.0,Can't use them unless you change out the frame around the face too.
1.0,"These mask make your glasses fog more than regular mask!!! These are cheaply made and a waste of money.<br />The thin little flap inside, that is supposed to help to keep your glasses from fogging, is so annoying. It tickles your nose, makes you sweat even more on the bridge of your nose. After wearing this mask more than a few hours, that little flap rides up your nose, in between your glasses and it bunches up!! OMG!! ITS SO AWFUL AND IRRITATING!!"
1.0,Dress came defective . Unable to return due deadline had passed.
1.0,"Only bought this mask for the logo but the company stitched the crease for the mask and folded the logo over itself lol. Can’t even see 70% of the logo making it not only ugly, but hilariously useless."
1.0,This is not a hoodie sweatshirt.  It is a long-sleeved hooded shirt.  Sweatshirt involves being sweatshirt material.  This is not. Had it not had a hood and had a normal shirt neckline this would be wearable as an every day shirt for me.  But I ONLY wear hoodies to keep warm when its cold out.  This is too light weight for that
1.0,really disappointed as I bought this as a gift.
1.0,The stones are held to the base with very cheap glue. They fall off almost immediately
1.0,Very bad quality. The tag label at the back could be seen from the outside of the shirt.  Quality further degraded after one wash
1.0,These did not look anything like the picture. They were not dancing Grateful Dead bears.
1.0,They came in with rust on a pair of the earrings!
1.0,Very cute product but falling apart after 1 wash. The bottom seam is coming apart and there’s a hole at the head. See attached picture.
1.0,"Weird fit.  Too small? Yes. Too large? Yup<br /><br />Top part is tight, bottom like a maternity top.  NOT like photo. I think they have the shirt pinned together in the back for the photo."
1.0,Didn’t even try it on. Says it’s an official licensed ford product but is not. The print on the hoodie is just awfully done. Looks terrible.
1.0,I got a 2X and it’s to narrow on the sides which doesn’t closes for me all my clothing are 2 X I will have to exchange it for a bigger size 😞
1.0,It was stained when I got it.It did not come with postage to send it back so I had to pay for it to be sent back.
1.0,This is not a good fit and made with very thin material which is not good. Invest in some better clothe
1.0,Horrible.  These pearls are a ridiculously low quality and very horribly strung.
1.0,"Looks cheap, sending back. Color not as shown."
1.0,"odd fit, short waisted"

1.0,fell apart after only a few weeks
1.0,Fell apart after 4weeks of wear.
1.0,"The first belt I had lasted about a year, but then started splitting (black separated from brown). I received a second one as a gift, went to put in on for the first time, and the buckle just snapped off. Out of town, on a business trip, and no belt to wear to my appointment."
1.0,Looks ke a night gown thin
1.0,Quality isn't good
1.0,I bought l and xl and they are too small from the waist to the chest. And the ladies are size 12 and 14.<br />Really disappointing.
1.0,So these was suppose to be polycarbonate lens but if you look in the photo! That can’t be true! Polycarbonate is compress layer together to make a whole. In the corner those look like a peel layer of some sort of film wrap! The frame is from really cheap plastic.
1.0,Need to have a size cause one size doesnt fit everyone i will be sending it back. Not worth it...
1.0,The arms are too large.
1.0,"Paper thin, not even wearable. May I please have my money back, even if it's in the form of a gift card."
1.0,"I purchased this for my elderly mother. It was way to hugh for most women, especially a smaller one.  Also, it was extremely hard to set and still is on the wrong time zone.  I put together many things and I could not figure out how to set this. Think twice before buying something so complicated, especially for someone who can't see."
1.0,I liked the look hated the quality
1.0,"Needed no-tie laces for my sons sneakers but they were not only too big but man, I couldn't even get them into the holes it was so difficult I gave up.  *begins shoe tying lessons*"
1.0,These glasses were too small for my face
1.0,The necklace is difficult to handle as it is stiff.  The earring are flimsy.  Should have known better for the cost.
1.0,Not a fan.. Not really “so breathable”.
1.0,The sweatshirt quality is good however the graphic printing is terrible. The fabric looks different around the image where it was pressed. Purchased as a gift- very disappointed.
1.0,I did not like
1.0,"I ordered a small and it was too big, the pickets has holes and looked cheaper in person."
1.0,Material and arms not as pictured
1.0,The size on this was way off and didn’t fit my son at all. You also have to pay to ship the item back.
1.0,Wasn’t impressed
1.0,When it arrived I loved it. However after only 4 short months wearing and washing about 1 every 2 weeks it fell apart...highly disappointed since it was comfortable but completely tore up under the arms and at the bottom seam
1.0,Very poor quality. its cheap but not worth it.I used it for less than a month before the strap started coming apart.
1.0,I called to order 1 zoomies for $10 and get the second pair free. The representative was trying to sell all kinds of offers. What arrived was 4 zoomies and a $36.90 credit card charge. Zoomies does bring the view closer but the image is not clear and therefore not useful.
1.0,"Toxic, And Dangerous. I Throw it out, it is disgusting!"
1.0,Bottom of card sleeve tore after 6 weeks of use. Not made to last.
1.0,I’m 5’2 and this thing came half way up my body.
1.0,"I read other reviews about the quality of this dress, but for the price I thought I'd try it. I should've known better. I received the dress and the neck line isn't even sewn together. I will not be ordering from this company again."
1.0,Broke the first time I wore it. Didn't even make it to the water.
1.0,It isn't  as big as it looks in the picture so there for I was disappointed but I still excepted it
1.0,All the charms fell off!
1.0,"so small, it would be tight on a newborn"
1.0,You get what you pay for. Cheaply made. I Returned it. I’m a large. I ordered xxl and still couldn’t zip.
1.0,"So I really wanted to love this, but it ended up being super, super short and beyond wrinkled.  Even a trip to the dry cleaner didn't improve the wrinkles.  :(. Color was more pastel than I expected."
1.0,"Very ugly, to many defect no matter the price you don't  want to paid for something you are not goin to use"
1.0,"This shirt is beautiful. But that's all it has going for it,  the material is very thin you can easily see through it  and has no stretch. I ordered an XL ( I normally wear a medium) and this short was still to small. I am so disappointed."
1.0,"At least with the one I received, some middle pocket were either completely sealed or completely open. Since this is a portfolio that does not allow for addition of more sheets, this is a huge blunder. Will not waste my time again. If you are lucky and all pockets are well laminated on the bottom, then its worth buying. As long as you don't tip it upside down because the bills will slide out. And the pockets are far bigger than the bills."
1.0,Looked good but they broke after an hour of wearing them. Pretty much walking on boards. No comfort and very hard.
1.0,Broke before I got to even use.
1.0,"Made no difference at all compared to any old rag, even on very lightly tarnished silver-nickel. Use Never Dull instead."
1.0,Hair covering
1.0,It was only one ring...so disappointed
1.0,Returned because the body of the top was faded beige not white like the sleeves
1.0,Would not buy again.  Threads loose everywhere
1.0,Not made for people with larger biceps
1.0,Poor quality and terrible return policy
1.0,Love this looks of the hat but it came all smashed up. Not repairable.
1.0,Not what the picture looks like at all.
1.0,"This devil costume is truly dollar store quality and NO WAY should it have cost $12. The pitchfork received was NOT the same hard plastic one that is pictured - it is a thin, cheapo, flexible cardboard-type one with sequins. It broke within mere moments of handing it to my toddler. She wore the costume to a Halloween party a week beforehand and the costume did not survive long enough to wear trick or treating on actual Halloween.  The wings are pantyhose material over wire which will soon rip and it is also covered in a ridiculous amount of glitter which will shed all over your home, car, and child and stay there forever more.  The tail and horns are also floppity woppity, held together with shoddy hot glue.<br /><br />This is barely even a single use item.  I would have returned it because of the poor quality and deceptive product photos, but I did not have time before our Halloween party. Buyer beware."
1.0,Received my skirt... a little disappointed. .. the length was as it appears however the ruffle effect that you see in the model picture of the skirt... is not what the skirt look like AT ALL... Was expecting the material to be a &#34;little&#34; thicker than what it is as well... Although not happy- I'll make it work to my advantage...😔
1.0,"Instead of warming, they made my hands tingle from the electricity."
1.0,"No matter how long they were on the charger, they never charged and two days later I finally gave up and just used them like regular socks. Disappointing because there was never any ""heat"" from the socks except my own body heat."
1.0,"The product looks beautiful. However, with that being said they are all different sizes they are labeled the same, but some are so small u can’t pull them up, some are so big, and a couple fit.<br />Update the stitching is terrible for The ones that do fit they come u stitched."
1.0,Crap! Very flimsy and the balls are stripped!
1.0,Received this watch for Christmas and put it in rotation with my other watches. After only two wears the button that activates the light up display fell off
1.0,"Didn't hold up well. Cheap metal, band unraveled shortly after purchase. It was just overall not worth what I paid for it. Never again."
1.0,Very cheap looking and made! It broke when I put it on
1.0,"Ugliest fit, too thin yet completely unbreathable. Wouldn’t even sleep in this."
1.0,"The smooth, shiny surface became extremely pilled on the first day of use.  Now it looks like every old, worn out dress.  It did not even survive the first wear~"
1.0,This hat is for an infant. It is not adjustable or for anyone over one years old. It evens says one size. Very disappointed!
1.0,Looks like a shiny trash bag.... sorry but this is not cute at all. Horribly sewn together and cheap looking. You definitely get what you pay for.
1.0,Fits the size for a child
1.0,This was way to short and I'm 5'6. You would have to be very very short for this to fit you comfortably
1.0,"fell apart within a couple weeks...i ordered one thinking it was a fluke, but then the second one did the same thing....its too bad because i love the way it looks..."
1.0,I waited 2 months to get this and when I did it tarnish in 2 days. Waste of money.
1.0,The arm broke right away
1.0,I loved the look. Ordered to take on a trip and got it just before I left. Wore it once and my neck broke out so bad it took me two weeks to get better. When I returned from traveling it was too late to return.
1.0,"Unruly loose knit looks like someones first project. No size, content, washing instructions. One star as the color is as shown."
1.0,Bait and switch. Not the dress pictured at all. See through and huge. What the heck?
1.0,I got the black set and this is what they did to my white sheets after 2 nights! Disgusting.
1.0,"The necklace is very pretty, but there are no earrings as shown in the photo. Shame on Amazon for not having a place to indicate that I want the earrings too."
1.0,I ordered the 4 piece set in a size medium (8). 3 items were the correct size one shirt I a medium size 5 ! I should’ve opened the items up prior to wrapping. :(.
1.0,"I loved the look of this bracelet on my wrist, but it broke within first few hours of wearing it and is now lost forever. Not very sturdy at all."
1.0,Too Small! I DO NOT Recommend This!
1.0,Fell apart before I was even able to wear it.
1.0,The earrings are cute however horribly mispackaged! It came in missing one earring. I am very disappointed in this order.
1.0,Very cheap material..not like picture
1.0,ALREADY WROTE ONE!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,Broke never buy again
1.0,It’s too long for short people. The length weird. You basically need to be 5’8” or above for this to look cute
1.0,Very cheap material. The zipper appears to be broken right out of the package. Buy at your own risk!
1.0,Thi as charm is cloudy and poorly made. Very dissatisfied.
1.0,The product was good just the wrong size
1.0,Not of the quality I expected.
1.0,GARBAGE !!!!<br />Gave 1 star cause I had to in order to leave a comment
1.0,"I bought these for my 13 year old and returned them the day they came. It’s one long strap from the toe up to the ankle. When he loosened up the ankle part to put his foot in, the toe part was too small to put his toe in. It took a lot of effort just to get it on his foot. And then, there wasn’t enough strap left to secure it down. It was really odd."
1.0,"I always take a size 6.5,  I read description before ordering,  the description said true to size,  I’d say these particular boot runs small.  I really like how they look, I’m disappointed I can’t wear them , I will return for a size 7."
1.0,Not worth its price for its indecent shape
1.0,Very nice jeans but too large for me.
1.0,"The dress in the picture as well as the description is NOT what you get. I was looking for the ribbed body con sk*ms-like type dress and this was not it. The material is incredibly thin, and the color is not what was advertised at all. It's not worth going through returning but I will have to find another option for my anniversary dinner. Really disappointed. I wanted to love this dress so much, but it's a No for me."
1.0,"Item not as pictured. Poor quality/see-through fabric, measurements completely off. Ties too short and did not have metal fasteners in the advertised photos. Bait and switch product."
1.0,"Too small, pinch nose, have to clean every day and only received one pair instead of two.  Have been very sick so had a chance to return, but now it's too late. What a waste of money."
1.0,"This is a cute piece, however the proportions on it are so odd, I couldn't wear it comfortably. It's very short in the back (I'm only 5'5&#34; and it comes to my lower back) and the sleeves are far too long. It hung on me like a wadded up rag.  I actually took my lunch break to go home and change because it was so uncomfortable. The other reviews are correct, it runs very small (except in sleeve length apparently)"
1.0,dress fit my hips too snug XL size ordered.
1.0,The picture is beautiful but the merchandise is light n somewhat cheap looking
1.0,Ordered and was charged for a red one received a blackish one…
1.0,Beautiful  but too small have to return  it
1.0,"Runs small, purchased for my 8 year old to wear while in school. Unfortunately I have to return it."
1.0,Not what I was ordering doesn’t look anything like what is advertised
1.0,Locket will not stay closed.  It's also very thin.  This is my second one as the first one fell off necklace.  I would not waste money on this!!
1.0,The flannel is too thin and not the winter weight I expected. If I had seen this product in a store I would not buy it.
1.0,"Super cute but awful quality. A huge hole after about three times wearing. Not worth the price at all, should be like $3 bucks tbh"
1.0,I thought these would be thin as were the anklets.  But these are too thick for my style.
1.0,La tela es muy fina y las mangas demasiado desahogadas
1.0,"I didn't even tried it on, the skirt had a circle tag to label the skirt by size and of course at the time to remove the tag it lifted the material of the skirt. That tells you the quality. DON'T buy is thin like a balloon and low quality. It is all wrinkled (chew like)  due to thin material."
1.0,"I cannot believe that you think these will keep your feet warm below zero.  I had cold feet at 14 above, I tried adding another sock layer, but no improvement.  I cannot believe you are stating that these will go to 35 below."
1.0,Way toocsmall
1.0,Very very small size to fit a kid
1.0,I didn't like the fact that it was the wrong jump suit. Now I have to go threw the trouble of sending it back. The jumpsuit should of been long leg fitted and it was short.<br /><br />It was supposed to be long leg fitted and it was short leg fitted. Really upset me. I
1.0,"Ok so the quality WBA’s good but it’s extremely heavy, short, and very small. Had to return it."
1.0,"The flip flops were adorable, but there was not size chart listed with this item... I ordered my granddaughter's current size.  When the arrived they were way too small.  Now to return them I have to pay for shipping, not happy.  Was going to order a replacement but due to the sizing issues and charge to return I have decided to look elsewhere.  What a shame because they were really cute."
1.0,"This was such a disappointment! Purchased for Halloween and it arrived day of but didn’t do anything but turn on once but before I could put on shorted out or just junked out so no cool mask for my kid to trick or treat, pass on this"
1.0,"Ordered the top and bottom, my usual size, just know that the style runs about two sizes small."
1.0,Looks cheap. There are 3 chains that go around neck that can't t be separated. Knot is glued. Too much of a presence. Not at all subtle. The picture looks daintier.
1.0,"Got an XL for the husband, but length was short and width was huge. Most of all, the quote was incorrect and did not match the image of the product."
1.0,"I was blown away when I received this bag and saw that the shoulder strap is not adjustable. I am five eights, 130 pounds and you can see how well it fits. I was looking for a bag that would hold my iPhone, and this will do the trick. Unfortunately if it’s more like a fanny pack tied around your neck"
1.0,Looks and feels cheap returning it.
1.0,"Looks nice, but 1 year old and Broke.  Left side just quit working.  Oh well."
1.0,This dress was very poorly made. The lace around the neck was cut incorrectly and could not be fixed. The hems of the under and over skirt were both very uneven. The gathering of fabric at the waistline were not all sewn in the same direction. Even after alterations it was not wearable as the mother of the Bride! It also is non-refundable. Buyer be ware!!!
1.0,Makes me look puffy and big in tummy area
1.0,This bracelet did not come with the story and charm explanation like shown in the picture. It is also missing the birth of Jesus stone. My daughter was so excited about this item. We really wish it would have came as shown. It came in a small ziplock bag.
1.0,I bought the abalone oval pair. The earrings looked very beautiful but unfortunately they came with three prominent holes and several chipped areas throughout one earring of the pair. I would have loved a replacement since the earrings are gorgeous otherwise but there was no choice to replace them when I tried to return these. I'd be happy to buy a new pair but I'm worried I'm going to get another damaged one.
1.0,I loved this necklace but it broke the first day I wore it.
1.0,"These are nothing like the picture, where the socks look plush & cozy.  And the color isn't even close...the background is a light grey  They are no way worth $13.  What a rip off, and what a disappointment.  It's purchases like this that make me not want to buy on-line."
1.0,This has no Memory Foam/ not even a little. Very disappointing
1.0,Not cotton as described.  Polka dotted outfit.
1.0,Pretty ring but fell apart two seconds after opening
1.0,Made for a child not a man.
1.0,cups way too big
1.0,"I bought these for my 8 year old who loves boots.  They were very cute and fit perfectly.  On the first day she wore them they got wet.  I was a bit disappointed that they were already dirty, but so it goes with kids footwear!<br /><br />I tossed the boots in the dryer (I wasn't going to bother cleaning them).  When they were done drying we were left with a nasty mess of shredded cardboard in our dryer.  Apparently that is what these shoes are made of.<br /><br />Needles to say I don't recommend these boots!"
1.0,"The metal in the holes falls out almost immediately, not a great belt"
1.0,Cheaply made and looing
1.0,they broke when I unscrewed the dice one was fine but the other one broke in little pieces very upset :(
1.0,Fast shipping terrible product saggy at bust area too revealing and poorly sewn. I the size is correct I have never been able to wear it. Would not give it one star if possible .
1.0,I am giving a 1 star because after 6 months of use the belt is separating from the tip of the belt and it is not a reliable product.
1.0,Not very good quality..cheap cloth
1.0,"The glasses seemed well made but did not improve night driving at all. I spent an hour driving last night and tried the glasses comparing them to no glasses in various nighttime driving situations from city to zero ambient light in the country. In every condition they reduced my visible distance by about 20%. The naked eye was always more effective and allowed me to see farther with clarity.  This is my second pair of ""night driving"" glasses. Lost my first pair. The first pair worked far better than these."
1.0,"Way to flimsy for most masks. Kind of works okay for the disposable surgical masks, but even then the elastic some still pops off the grips."
1.0,"First the seller is A+ but that suit should not be on the market. Nothing about it was good. The material was  awful, it was so thin you would think it was a shirt. The seller was good in terms of working with me. It’s gone to goodwill."
1.0,Slipper socks were too narrow! Came with one stitch out of toe! Never used!☹️
1.0,Very cheap and awkward looking.  I gave it away as soon as I got it.
1.0,"This dress definitely isn't true to size and the construction is poor, material see through and horrible. I would recommend you keep your money not worth more than a $3.00 night gown.😡😡😡"
1.0,I can’t keep them on. My feet slide all over in them. They are so cheaply made and not at all what I expected
1.0,"This item was not fleece lined. It’s just a thin artificial fabric and does not appear water resistant either. Very cheap item, certainly not worth $22"
1.0,It is xsmall
1.0,Poor workmanship (i.e. pockets were sewn shut and were just sewn on separately to the inside liner); and color was not as expected.
1.0,Band does not secure correctly.  The watch broke free and dropped to the ground.  It cracked the entire watch face and the iwatch had to be replaced.  NOT worth the money or the headache of buying a new iwatch.
1.0,The pin is beautiful but it has a manufacturing defect with a piece of flat metal on top of the head. It's very noticeable and a bit sharp.
1.0,to cover mouth and nose plastic uncomfortable
1.0,Frames broke when lenes where installed. Cheaply made.
1.0,"the size is good, but the quility is terrible it sticks to itself and when you unstuck it gets holes"
1.0,"I ordered two skirts from this collection. I ordered XL on both of them. They have 26 inch waists with some bunchy elastic that is super uncomfortable, and doesn't make it flare at all. It is a blob at the waist, not an A-line. They're sizing is totally off, and the quality of the products are SUPER LOW. They are very cheap material, poorly constructed, and definitely not worth the price. I almost never go to the effort of returning items, especially during a pandemic, but these are unwearable. What a waste."
1.0,Terribly made and won’t fit properly with all my 7 pairs of glasses. The quality looks quite cheap as well. I will not recommend them to anyone.
1.0,Waaay to large. I followed advice to purchase larger and that was a mistake.
1.0,"I had a similar pair by a different brand that was extraordinarily comfy - made of lightweight foam, similar to Crocs. But they broke, and I can't find them elsewhere - hence trying this brand. The soles are completely stiff and a bit heavy, with no flex at all, making them really awkward to walk in. I will be returning these for that reason. The bumps are also inferior to my old pair - shorter and less flexible, which gives less of a massaging effect."
1.0,"I never write reviews but this was a HUGE disappointment! The fabric is REALLY thin, it had thread strings hanging from the seams (at least 10) and the neck area looks so cheap. It's super clingy, though true to size, it's not flattering at all. I'll be returning it. Makes me wonder about all the 5 star reviews being fake."
1.0,Pretty but cracked when accidentally dropped
1.0,"Save your money and purchase M&D items.  I bought this to assist with healing from a BBL with aggressive lipo.  This did nothing but irritate me.  DO NOT WASTE YIUR MONEY.  tried to return but they won’t refund you and it has to go through USPS which has never been the case with other Amazon items.  Also, supposedly the actual “seller” will refund you, not Amazon.  A total waste."
1.0,Can see right through it
1.0,Bag definetly not as advertised. Also it says USB port and there isn't one! What?! Very disappointing...
1.0,Cheap washes poorly for
1.0,"I wish I could say that I like these leggings, but I really don't.  There's no tummy compression, but there's loads of compression in the too short legs.  The result is that the legs creep up, and pull the torso down, so that I constantly have to adjust them, along with my underwear, whether I’m sitting, standing, or active.<br /><br />Thank you very much for reading my review.  I hope you found it helpful."
1.0,My opinion is that the were not made well. They were sent back some time ago.
1.0,"Purchased 4 of these tops and returned all of them. Ordered according to size chart (xl - my normal size) and all were way too small.  Would have had to order 2 sizes larger. Also the fabric was strange. They were like a silky, shiny Jersey material. Not my style at all."
1.0,Warped while using them in the sun at the beach. Low quality plastic lenses.
1.0,Lens fall out very easy. Not happy
1.0,"I though these would be a great deal. After the first wash (following the washing instructions) these shrunk, and have shrunk with each subsequent washing.<br /><br />Do not waste your time, move on to another product."
1.0,I am very disappointed by how tiny this pendant is. The “blue tear drop stone” is about half size of a soy bean.
1.0,"8 yr old grandson can wear them, not me"
1.0,This are cheaply made and too big. They did absolutely nothing for me. Regardless of their size I still tried them out but they didn’t help with anything.
1.0,The bracelets are very poor quality!!! My wife has had them less than 2 months and two of the bracelets are already broken just from normal wear. Repeat: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!
1.0,Was very large for being a size small.
1.0,"I tried these for night driving and I felt like I could see less, not more clearly. Did not help with brightness of oncoming traffic at all."
1.0,Extremely small.  Ordered a large and it was more like a small.  The torso was short also.  Definitely size up at least 2 sizes.
1.0,Producto de muy mala calidad no recomendada ni para dormir
1.0,Cheaply made crotch ripped after 5 mins of wear i sized up my daughter wears a 10-12 i ordered 12-13 fit perfectly colors were bright and beautiful were both pretty disappointed 😭<br />-update my daughter wore another pair to school the seam in the back busted i had one embarrassed 7 year old wearing lost and found pants home
1.0,"I wanted to like this but it is both too dorky and too complicated to use. You have to really work to get everything you need on the grid and it looks messy if anything is “off” meaning crooked or not spaced evenly. It made me feel less organized, not more. However, love that small items wouldn’t spill everywhere if you dropped your tote bag."
1.0,very thin and cheaply made !! trash
1.0,"the images shown all show hoodies without pockets, but mine came with very large pockets that look silly on a cropped jacket."
1.0,The blue came off in two weeks
1.0,My mistake.  Ordered too small
1.0,"The picture represents the glasses as is.  i.e. The Bifocal piece is just that, a glued on bifocal.  Too small.  The sunglasses were very light and flimsy.  Would not recommend."
1.0,"Per image and description, I thought they would be coral colored.  When I got them they are hot pink! Not what I wanted.  Just beware of the colors."
1.0,There are no information on how to adjust! The metal on the belt stabs you when wearing
1.0,"Very disappointed. Bought 4 of these for myself, sister and 2 daughters. They look nothing like the picture. What a waste."
1.0,Definitely doesnt look like the picture. I would not buy this again. It is clearly not the same material.
1.0,They did fit really well at first but after wearing them for a few hours they start to loosen up a lot and ride up on me. Not comfortable at all.
1.0,One of the jewel fell out the 2nd day of wearing them.
1.0,This product does not look like the picture. The print is half the size and looks like a cheap Tshirt transfer instead of professional. I could have made this with transfer iron one and a printer. The dimensions of the graphic on the shirt don’t match what was delivered as you can see.
1.0,This item is cheaply made would not buy again from this company!!!! Very disappointed in this product!
1.0,Poorly put together. Lots of lumps. Looked terrible under the dress. Took LOTS of work to make it look acceptable.
1.0,It didn't do what I wanted .  Sent it back
1.0,Too tight around cafs
1.0,Ordered the largest size for my 12 yr old daughter who is thin & of avg height for her age & it was way too short. Not as pictured at all. It was even short for my 9 yr old.
1.0,"I normally don't submit a negative review but In this case, I felt it was necessary. First of all, it had an intense and fowl odor that reeked of rotting fish. When I opened the package, I thought I was going to vomit. The smell permeated my whole house. It was horrible! If that wasn't bad enough, the fabric felt like sand paper! It was extremely scratchy and stiff. I even tried washing it to see if it would take away the smell and maybe make it softer but it did no good!  This product went straight to the trash! I couldn't keep it in my house any longer. I'm just glad it wasn't too expensive. I guess you get what you pay for....Very disappointed!"
1.0,"First of all, I did not receive the same dress as pictured. It was similar in design but not the same. The front was pleated and the back was lace up much different than this. The color was what I expected. The weight of the fabric was thicker than expected but not bad. The skirt was too much fabric which made me look too bulky. I considered keeping the dress but it that was the deal breaker. I wanted something more light and airy."
1.0,This is how they came into the mail today! Very disappointing! I bought these for my special needs cousin who adores butterflies as a Christmas gift. While they are beautiful they serve no purpose now and will go into the trash!
1.0,1 of the clips does not snap close<br />The mesh part of the bag is ripped<br />The part connect to the clip is coming apart from the bag. Very disappointed on quality of bag.  Will return items
1.0,"After 1 month of barely use, an after forgething 2 days inside the car this happend to the shoes"
1.0,I was very disappointed in these goggles. I ordered 3 different pairs and this one fell apart after the first use. I brought it home in pieces wanting to send it back. Even tried to reassemble but with no luck. Not worth it
1.0,"Very disappointed,  these all look better in the picture than what they are and 3 of the rings from my order came in with the ring to hang them by broken off.  Very poor quality."
1.0,Horrible fake
1.0,"Returned. The package came with two right-lobe earrings (there is one flat side, so R/L does matter). I exchanged, hoping for a R/L pair, because they are so cute! Unfortunately I received another two right-lobed earrings. They do look sturdy, like they would have held up well had I been able to wear them."
1.0,Pearls fell off before I even wore it
1.0,It’s total garbage! They left glue on and around the plastic stone. It just looks like crap!
1.0,"The earrings were  pretty but very light in weight, which was fine but, the clasp behind would not attach to the earring to close."
1.0,The shirt had a snag in the front of the shirt. I sent it right back.
1.0,I love the dress but to open the dress
1.0,Sunglasses showed up with the box ripped open. The lenses were scratched and have finger prints all over them.
1.0,"Top is too baggy, dress is too short, material is cheap, colors are off. Disappointed."
1.0,Not very pink. Cheap looking
1.0,"I ordered Mens XL, these are kids sizes.  Don't order they are false advertising."
1.0,Ordered a small fits good.  Love the shirt but wore one time and it tore open.  I did not snag or anything just the stiching.
1.0,"Amazon bought, would not recommend or buy again. That is what you get when you go cheap. It was cheap & I got what I paid for."
1.0,Ordered xl...fit like a medium...very unhappy.. Is a yellow tinted white. Looks cheap. Not. Happy at all....complety disappointed..
1.0,Bad quality and bad material
1.0,Way smaller then what they was suppose to be
1.0,Size is too small! Can't use it and there is no response from Customer service when requested for a return!
1.0,I love the decorative frames
1.0,"These are going back ASAP. The picture does not show it, but these backs have a plastic disc on them. I got this set because I can't wear the ones with the disc. The biggest iss I have is that these DO NOT lock onto the earring, nor are they as secure as regular earring backs. For the price, these are not good and don't work!"
1.0,Fake shearling and leather. It did not have the weight of leather or texture. The craftsmanship is really nice but unfortunately the materials are too questionable.
1.0,"Avoid this poor quality garbage at all cost.<br />Received them today, and tried them on. Sizing is way off and these are easily 4 sizes too small. Then stick my hand into one of the thigh pockets, and my fingers come out the side. The pocket is not completely sewn, so items can easily fall out the side. Then I tried to open one of the zippered pockets, and it is so stiff it actually begins to bend the pull tab. The material these are made out of is paper thin, and while I did not bother to try running in them (they are sold as jogging pants), there is no doubt they would rip instantly if you exert any real force to any of the seams. Only took 4.5 seconds to decide to return them."
1.0,Just not flattering at all. If you are very thin with nothing to hide this would look great! My biggest issue was the middle block of white was pretty sheer and just did not look good.
1.0,It was suppose to be a childs size 10 and it was more like a womens size 10 didnt fit at all thankfully it fit my other niece that is 15yrs old and I have to get a different dress for my flower girl who is 10yrs old!!!! I will not be ordering from here again.
1.0,"The foot part are too small.  Even purchased a larger size.  Same issue, foot part too small."
1.0,Made cheap. Fit is very small. Wouldn’t recommend
1.0,This is awful. If you want a trash bag just wear that.
1.0,Did not screw all way in not happy
1.0,They are way to small and I bought them as a charms which these you can't attach to anything unless your glue them on don't waste your money
1.0,If I could put 0 stars you bet your bottom dollar I would gurl! This has got to be some serious Ashton Kutcher Pranked BS because I ordered an XL ADULT SIZE “”SWEATSHIRT” and I’ve recieved an infant size T-shirt with lettering on it! I could barely fit my head through through the neck hole! DONT BUY THIS SWEATER! It is a fugly piece of crud!
1.0,Zipper broke immediately when I sat down. I tried to use safety pins and it just looked so stupid. It was my perfect size too. Very disappointing.
1.0,"I was excited to get this shirt, but was disappointed it didn't live up to its description.<br /><br />1) It is 100% polyester even though the material listed says &#34;cotton.&#34;<br />2) It is not long at all.<br />3) In one pic, the shirt says &#34;Good Vibe,&#34; in the other it says &#34;Good Vibes.&#34; Which is it?"
1.0,Cheap material not a good item don’t buy this
1.0,"This was a VERY VERY SAD PURCHASE- the idea, the vision was there but really POOR EXECUTION 😢"
1.0,Too small does not run true to size
1.0,Orange not tan or brown
1.0,See through and really tight around the boobs. I didn’t think I would have a problem because I had bought from this brand in the past but I had to send it back.
1.0,"Assembly required, fin doesn't fit together snugly will need to be glued into place. Paint cracked and scuffed. ""Welds"" look like they were done by a child with Parkinson's. Helmet itself is concave in the cheeks. No chin strap but snug fit. At the base of the fin is the company logo which is massively out of place. I am returning this we'll see if that goes any smoother than the ""welds""!"
1.0,I bought these in December and haven’t worn them to much. The “mirror” reflecting part is fading away like it’s beeb scratched up but they have been sitting in the case with an occasional wear. Very disappointed. Will be growing them in the trash and buying a new pair not from this company!
1.0,Thought I was getting three hats but only got one.  Very deceptive add
1.0,The hat we received looks nothing like the one pictured and described. It is a cheap-looking hat with a screen-printed shield logo on the front. The back is blank. It is also not a fitted hat.
1.0,NOT AS DESCRIBED IN DESCRIPTION
1.0,"Should’ve just listened to the reviews, but even the pink one looks & feels like you’re putting on a scrub top.<br />Absolutely, in no way form or fashion, do I, nor would I ever, recommend buying this top.<br />I know it looks cute in the pics, but just DON’T DO IT!!"
1.0,The color is completely different than the photo. The photo shows a bright blue and what I received is muted. It fits way bigger than the measurements.
1.0,I had to force them through the holes in my earlobs didn't fit as expected smh
1.0,They sent me wrong color and poor quality product
1.0,This is our 6th pair and the quality he seemingly gone downhill with each order. I have two boys and both used to love these shades but now they dread wearing them because flakes of greyish black material gets all over their noses. I’ll attach pics. I’m trying to contact the seller - but we’ll see if anything happens.
1.0,Not  durable
1.0,The product was shipped as depicted (palms inward) with a piece of paper separating the two gloves. Please note that the palm facing surfaces contain gripping surfaces.  The paper was bonded to the each surface. After tearing the gloves apart I had to pick paper  off of each individual surface. It didn't work.  After about 4 minutes I simply threw them away.  This product is a waste of time and money. Given the price - it is an extreme waste of time and money.
1.0,Not what I thoughts it would be. It's made for a child to wear not adult size very disappointed🙁
1.0,"Def not a size 7.5 ring, more like a 7. disappointed."
1.0,Very disappointed. My Mom opened this gift for Christmas and it was missing an eye. Photo attached.
1.0,"These are NOT authentic Crease Preventers or Sneaker Shields. They are cheaply made, an outdated design and will ruin the inside of your shoes. Don’t buy!!<br />Made in China out of sub standard materials and could bring you bad health due to possible contamination."
1.0,Product description indicates all accessories necessary to install.  Light doesn't come with a wiring harness that requires a special connector.  No installation instructions to indicate what wires are positive or negative or ground.
1.0,Siempre pidan una talla menos
1.0,"I'm a medium but i ordered a small to have it fit my curves. It fits snug around my legs and thighs and somewhat around my butt, but there is this ugly pouch in the crotch area that is very unflattering and there's a pouch above my butt. I'm already skinny, i this makes my body look ugly. Disappointed!!"
1.0,Wrong size😕
1.0,It broke in the front before I even put it on and I wasn't being heavy-handed. It just snapped in a place I can't fix so had to hold it together with a safety pin. Not very well-made but still very pretty.
1.0,be aware of the thing falling apart. very disappointed. And not refundable. Waste of money.
1.0,Do not purchase these capris.  Ripped while I was at work down the seam.
1.0,"I was so looking forward to giving these to my granddaughter. She's an average sized 9-yr-old -- 69# and 4'4"" tall so I thought the L was safer (she's in med now). The legs on these were so narrow that she could barely get them on and my husband had a heck of a time trying to get them off her. I wish I had filmed it, it was so ridiculous."
1.0,Initially I thought this was a nice watch that was clearly worth what I paid for it.<br /><br />In total it lasted six months before the chrome covering started peeling off showing the copper colored underlying metal alloy.<br /><br />Initially it had the look of a fairly good quality watch but with the peeling metal flakes it looks like garbage and is an embarrassment.<br /><br />I’m glad I didn’t pay much for this
1.0,Seams fell apart. But you get what you pay for.
1.0,One of the straps broke I would not recommend this product to anyone
1.0,"Really pretty piece and i love the elastic so you dont have to fiddle with a clasp.  Unfortunately its a piece of junk that falls apart.  The dangles fall right off.  Also, the dangles do not go all the way around - only half way , so the picture is an illusion"
1.0,"Photos taken same day. My mother ordered this for me for Christmas and it broke after a week. She got me a replacement and again after about four days it broke right off my hand. I'm very upset I loved this ring it's very cute and sweet my mother picked it out for me and it has broke not once,  BIT TWICE!!! I don't want to replace it again and just have it break off my hand once more. I would like a full refund for both purchases."
1.0,"I was looking forward to wearing this but it came broken. I didn't get a chance to return, kind of a waste 😕"
1.0,"*I am a size 12/13 in pants and I fit the size small in these panties!<br />I bought these panties a while back and the gray pair of panties were a total different kind of material and size than the other ones, plus the gray ones doesn’t cover my butt well and fits more like cheeky panties. The other panties were comfortable and fit me well, and covered my whole back. The only bad thing about the other ones is that they tend to fall apart after many washing/drying cycles. (I suggest using a mesh zipper lingerie bag for washing). That saved the other panties from falling apart, although is a pain in the *ss. The panties also stretch a lot during the day so I also suggest getting a smaller size.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon and they refunded my money back and told me that they noticed other buyers complaining about the same thing, so they took the seller off of Amazon. That was a few months ago, but I see that the same seller is back selling these the same way again.<br /><br />**Note to seller if you read this…… we want to buy these panties but only one kind and size!"
1.0,"Waist to small, baggy in rear and legs"
1.0,Not my style and no ankle support
1.0,"I have had good luck with other apparel from amazon but this shirt was SO cheap. The fabric is the cheapest polyester on the market and it shows. From a distance it appears flowy and airy but up close it is a scratchy, extremely low end fabric that looks and feels truly awful"
1.0,The color was more of a bright yellow and not a mustard color and ripped when I wore it
1.0,"Cheap quality!  I have washed once, and it has lost the original color, so the dark colorl shows  white threads now.  Waisted my money."
1.0,The metal pieces that clips into the watch is to large.
1.0,After one day of use the nozzles wit working twice.  Trying to use with essential oils which the description says you can.  Had to send back for a refund.  Do not buy if you are going to use with essential oils.
1.0,Pictures of the item made me think they were larger. One of the smallest earrings I have ever seen. One 10th of the pictures. Avoid.
1.0,"Received a crumpled up, used dress. Gross"
1.0,Very unhappy with the size of the apron.  It is for a child not an adult.
1.0,Extremely poor quality fabric.
1.0,I washed these before wearing and they came out of the dryer completely coming apart. Disappointing!
1.0,Very disappointed!  Quality is poor & cheaply made.  Shipped to me from Cina in a small envelope & flattened to fit envelope with no tissue paper & no packing slip & no return information.  It looks like something from a dollar store!!
1.0,ABSOLUTELY THE WORST. it's like a bra with sleeves. Big or small girl. Sleeves are to short and kinda disappointed in the product. Seen so many good reviews wish it woulda been as pictured.
1.0,Es juvenil casi para niños
1.0,Cheap quality. I should have returned it
1.0,I never received this item. I'm sure I would have loved it.
1.0,DO NOT BUY!  These are so poorly made... the ankle straps did not even go around far enough to reach the buckle!!!  I too was told to gift them to a friend... they wouldn't even fit around the ankle of my daughter.  JUNK - TOTAL JUNK.  They do not offer a full refund which is unbelievable since the PRODUCT ARRIVES DEFECTIVE!!  DO NOT BUY - DO NOT BUY - DO NOT BUY!
1.0,Loved the look but actually putting them together requires a masters degree in patience and muscle contortions. I’m a very capable adult and ending up throwing them across the room and going to party city.
1.0,Nose rings that arrived look NOTHING  like the picture advertised. They look like they were bought out of a quarter machine. Very disappointed. Colors are dull and rhinestone is cheap and smaller than the hole they go in.
1.0,As soon as I took it out of package it broke!!! Very disappointed!
1.0,"Very bad quality. Bought a size 3-6months for my 5month old, 15lbs baby and it was tooo big"
1.0,My friend ordered a pair of these and I liked the look and fit of them so I ordered the exact same size and color. The pair I received are a completely different brand than the one she has and the construction and quality is way worse. The strap holes on the front are sewn very poorly and the fit is really off. They are baggy in the wrong areas so it doesn’t look oversized it just looks bad. Will be returning these unfortunately.
1.0,"Horrible, cheap"
1.0,"Out of 40 pieces, only 24 lights actually worked. Order twice as many as you need if you decide to purchase anyway."
1.0,Very cheap looking!
1.0,Bought S/M based on the sizing chart of women’s shoe size 7.5. The socks are too long with the toe of the socks being baggy and bunching up. Unusable.
1.0,"3/4 has to be 20Mm not 19 MM. Incorrect size, waste of money."
1.0,Received the t shirt  and it has stains on it
1.0,As soon as I took it out the package the flower fell out. Another bad purchase.
1.0,"My girl has got a LONG torso and these itty bitty Capezio’s don’t work for my little dancer. Also, the shape of the item is exactly as pictured, which might be great for older girls, but my little preschooler is definitely not hourglass shaped so it’s a little snug and cinched in places it doesn’t need to be."
1.0,I bought a 2xl.  All of my shirts are 2xl.  This has to be about a size small.  Very disappointed! I hate wasting my money like that!
1.0,It's impossible to walk a few steps without the socks slipping off. Thank goodness I have an office job.
1.0,The belt buckle came broken.
1.0,"short waisted, ugly material, comes from China"
1.0,"It fell apart easily, and looks very cheap - It went into the trash."
1.0,Band faded within 1 week and they charge a return fee.
1.0,No give in fabric very disappointed
1.0,"Actually in the process of returning this item. This shirt runs very small. I would have to have gone up at least two sizes for it to have fit normally. Also, the material was weird and slinky and clingy."
1.0,"I can’t see close or far, totally worthless to me"
1.0,The blouse is pretty but it’s missing the button in back. I waited too long to return it.
1.0,It was nothing like it was shown. It was too large so I returned it.
1.0,Cheap made and poor quality! You can’t return product and should be sold at a dollar store for a dollar! Very Disappointed!
1.0,"Too thin, and of poor quality; came in green color, not blue; very disappointing"
1.0,Broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:40e1f592df9a5ba904c43cc7af6aab44]] They are cute However not like the pictures. 1pair doesn't close, 1pair doesn't open. Very cute but unless you have tiny earlobes don't get, would be okay for preteen, prom or like maybe 8-9yr old. The top of my ears are not pierced, they would work for that, but were smaller than the tip of my pinky"
1.0,Mhm
1.0,Gauge is way too big for a nose ring. Very disappointed. It did arrive a lot sooner than I thought. Good quality. Seems sturdy enough but will never know BECAUSE IT DONT FIT!!!
1.0,Sizea posted are Asian sizes....I ordered mens XL didnt fit me...my wife wears a womans large...didnt fit her either!!
1.0,Item clasp broke after second day. It was really cute for the one and a 1/2 days that it lasted .
1.0,This dress is disappointing. The description states that this dress has some stretch. I found that this dress has absolutely no give to it whatsoever. I have a 34C chest and the size medium was baggy and way too sloppy on top. The waist is cut high and fits tight.
1.0,"Thin, cheap and came with damage."
1.0,"Material was thin and cheap. Also, runs small."
1.0,No me agrado nada. Y no lo use.
1.0,STONE CAME OUT WHILE MY GIRLFRIEND WAS DANCING.I WAS SO EMBARRASSED
1.0,"The first time I wore it, it broke."
1.0,The dress is too sheer. Completely see-through. Wish I had returned it in time.
1.0,The bracelet broke the moment I took it out of the plastic bag. Can’t seem to find three of the beads they might of rolled into the gutter.
1.0,The balls either fell apart (broke) or wouldn’t stay on the ring.
1.0,While it’s a cute romper fits poorly I suggest going a size or two up because the top is loose but the the shorts part of you are a curvy person will fit tight I have thighs and a butt and this fit so snugged in the bottom and loose at the top 😕 the material isn’t so bad I wish it was a more stretchy material would have been better since the size doesn’t add up
1.0,We returned the crown because I didn't even get it out of the package and I could see there was a jewel missing.
1.0,Very pletty but the flower fell out as my wife took them out of the package
1.0,Wasted money
1.0,"It's a nice watch but it's the second one I bought. The first I bought in March and it fell off my fiancé wrist and broke. They gave me a refund and ordered another one and April. The same thing happened again, the clasps came loose and it fell off his wrist and broke. This time the 30 day window has closed and now I can't get a refund. Make sure you pay attention to your refund window when making this purchase."
1.0,Nice product but way way to small about 3 sizes to small they be nice trunks if they were actually fit to size I went up 3 sizes it’s about a small order a xxxl
1.0,"This shirt runs at least 3x smaller, it old fit a 0 side person"
1.0,"My husband is an xxl. Loved the style, color of the sweater. The material was so scratchy that he could not stand to touch it. When he tried it on, it was so tight and form fitting. It looked terrible. Very disappointed, this was a Christmas present.:("
1.0,The chart size is too small .... very small for an XL
1.0,Cheap....Hate I purchased
1.0,Way to small for even one average mens size shoe. Had to return

1.0,Was so disappointed.  It looked like i had a robe on.  Sent back
1.0,Shows no ears & to much neck on picture
1.0,Totally fell apart the day after it arrived
1.0,"Beautiful, exquisite, and fits perfectly as expected.  If you're petite and wear an Extra Small Size, it's an incredible dress.  It doesn't need and altering at all!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  I'm very happy and pleased with my purchase!!!Unfortunately, the second time that this dress was worn, the lace across the entire top of the backside tore apart, and hung down the back looking like something grabbed it and rent it apart from side seam across to the other side seam.  My daughter is heartbroken that her ""dreamy wedding dress"" was ruined!  I'm also heartbroken for her!  This dress was gently handled, but the lace tore like tissue paper!!! I had to drop the satisfaction rating from five stars to one star...how disappointing!!!"
1.0,"I hate to write this but, this shirt was too small for the size I chose, it looked nothing like posted picture and it smelled so bad. The seller wanted to give me half og my money back, while I keep the shirt. No thank you!!! I had to let the seller know, that I wanted all of my money and no parts of the shirt AND I was going to write a review and call Amazon about this product."
1.0,Ordered 2xl says 2xl but fits like a large
1.0,Demasiado grande y de una tela ordinaria y delgada
1.0,The description said 90% cotton...this made in china crap was 95% polyester and was shiny nasty fabric. DONT BUY!!
1.0,"I ended up returning this necklace because it is so cheaply made and it's super noisy when you wear it! I know that sounds weird, but it's true, lol!! The different pieces clang against each other and makes it an extremely UNclassy piece to wear out."
1.0,These bows are so bug and have a metal edge on the clip. Very easy to scrap the head or poke the eye. Do not buy for less than a 4 year old
1.0,"What I dislike about this item is that the entire item IT IS NOT 925 STERLING SILVER, my magnet jump on the connecting chain and closure right away. I AM a jewelry maker, so I will disconnect the base metal and use TRUE 925 STERLING SILVER to finish it to full 925 Sterling Silver<br />BUT...... I won't complain too much I got what I pay for. YEP, too good to be true. CUTE THOUGH"
1.0,It is MUCH SMALLER than said. Otherwise it is very nice.
1.0,Horrible!  The laces busted out of the elastic the first day my kids wore them; so glad I saved the laces I was replacing them with.  I'd say maybe it was just a bad pair but I bought two and had the same problem with both of them.
1.0,The dress color is beautiful. However it is about 2 sizes too large!!!!
1.0,pls don't waste your time or money material is horrible will only fit a toddler and seller is not very helpful in resolving this matter
1.0,Described as leather -- RUBBER!!
1.0,Item received with missing stones!

1.0,very cheaply made not worth the money
1.0,"Cheaply made, souls started falling off on the second day"
1.0,"What shows in the photo is NOT what I got! Several of the beads don't even look polished. Only one of the six has any design at all. They look horrible! These beads are garbage, beware. They will be going back tomorrow."
1.0,"Material is soft, fit is flattering on top, color is a nice, flattering shade. Unfortunately the shirt is way too short and my stomach shows unless I wear high waist jeans. I chose the medium length based on how it looked on the model. I might try again and pick the longer length, even though the images showed it much longer than I wanted it to fit."
1.0,Half of the items arrived broken (or unassambled but with missing parts) I won’t be able to use more than half of these.
1.0,Ended up returning as the material and construction Is very cheap. Does not look anything like the Pictures.
1.0,"I got this bag just over a year ago and LOVED IT. Then yesterday, the entire duffel bag strap snapped off (the part sewn onto the bag) and then, an hour later, the zipper broke."
1.0,"Because of the popularity of Jeremy Lin Nike allowed people to create with their NIKEID program a hyperfuse(not hyperdunk) with orange and blue colors and Lin's name on the tongue of the shoe.  If you don't believe what I say about the shoe then feel free to look it up online.  There are plenty of articles explaining that Nike didn't make an actual shoe for him, and the shoe they made available to be created was only for the hyperfuse style(which is popular amongst NBA players)."
1.0,Super cheap quality. Fell apart after the 1st wash.
1.0,Lens keep g popping out

1.0,I ordered an xl and it fit like a small..
1.0,I doubt that the wires are 14 K gold because they are turning the skin around my ears black. It is very disappointing.
1.0,Almost all the pieces were broken within minutes of opening the package from the cheap plastic used on the product.  My daughter was excited about her necklace and I ended up having to return it because the amulet kept falling off the necklace.  The tiara broke immediately.  The crystals broke off the wand.  Don’t buy it
1.0,"The red fabric of these umbrellas faded after one season of use, the LEDs stopped working on both of them and the crank mechanism no longer works to raise one of the umbrellas."
1.0,Broke 2 days after I got it for my fiancé. Really disappointed....
1.0,"I liked the different colors and patterns, but the material is not 100% cotton. The panties were very thin and cheaply made."
1.0,"This item arrived 2 sizes too large and completely shapeless. This dress looks absolutely nothing like depicted, rather a large shapeless striped sack. I have no use for this listless fabric so I contacted the seller. The seller refused to accept my return and offered me a discount instead. Absolutely awful and I will not be purchasing from this seller again."
1.0,"Glasses were way too small (and I have a pretty small head).  They dig into the side of your head and immediately give you a headache.  Also, these can't be returned.  I didn't realize that when I bought them - if I had I definitely wouldn't have bought them."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:bd11d166dae6d84294ee66ade2b66a30]] They seem nice however way too big. And one pair are the wrong color.

1.0,Extremely thin. Offers very little protection.
1.0,looks good but deceived by cheap price- buyers remorse and ended up commando
1.0,"This fits awkward for anyone who has a bust above an A cup. I would not recommend this for anyone. I tried it on and I am busty and it fit horrible. My sister, who has a much smaller chest and Is smaller than I, still looked awkward with the bubbling at the stitch and could not wear it."
1.0,Was not the shirt i had ordered as the back was blank
1.0,Very tight around the foot.
1.0,Suggestion was to order down.  I normally wear a lg an ordered a med and returned it.  I need a lg. stick to your reg size

1.0,Cheap quality. Sole detached after 1 month.
1.0,This is really small for groceries. The material also seems very thin and not resistant. Also difficult to roll back  in although is possible
1.0,Cheaply made plastic.
1.0,if you want to  stretch slippers they would be fine
1.0,Dumb! Wont work for long they are cheap and tray is crooked!! Exactly what you would expect from China!
1.0,"This is a thin wind breaker. It popped up with a search for a rain coat, and when I wore it in the rain it soaked right through and I was completely drenched in minutes"
1.0,"Didn't last one week. Both eyelets tore at the same time. These were used on an older pair of Oakley Blades, and the eyelets were stretched a bit, but because of the 90 degree offset design, they had to be placed at the ends of glasses frames for comfort."
1.0,I have bought several different bifocals sunglasses.  This was first purchase from this company.  The bifocals are always in way.  With other brands I never noticed bifocals unless I needed them.  These are always a distraction.  I have had 2 ear pieces break off.  Just really disappointed.
1.0,.the noses came in a very small box and where crushed
1.0,"The only thing that was good was the fact that it looks nice. Otherwise, the top is see- through which will make it difficult to find something to wear under it. Also, the inside skirt is so short. And the torso is too big- i can pull the fabric a few inches by the back. So I couldnt get it smaller because then the inner dress wouldn't even cover my butt (it hardly does now!). But I cant get it bigger because it's already so big in the back!"
1.0,"Very, very cheaply made.  Got this for my son for Christmas.  I was so disappointed.  The graphics looks like peel and stick, and not meant to last long."
1.0,"Dress didn’t fit right, tried to get a refund. Paid for shipping just to ship the dress back to the seller and they still didn’t refund me."
1.0,Ordered item 3 weeks ago still haven't received it.<br />Poor customer service. No response from company regarding replacement or refund. 🙁
1.0,"Too bad have to rewrite.  Got replacement after first broke after a couple days.  Well the second only lasted 4 days and it broke in the same spot.<br /><br />No worth it, got my money back<br /><br />((ORIGINAL REVIEW....super nice, totally worth it sturdy clasp (hate the new Fitbit connect pins) so just make sure it’s tight otherwise it’s feels sturdy on the wrist.))<br /><br />Broke... they are sending an exchange so keep you posted... yet second one broke too"
1.0,It fall downs from the knee. It does not fit tightly around the knee or calf.
1.0,Large is like XXL
1.0,It broke the second time wearing it
1.0,The material is cheap. Not denim at all. Disappointed.Great for a house dress.
1.0,Item was too big. Tried to return but am having trouble getting seller to accept package.
1.0,This thing barely reaches my waist and I’m only 5ft 4in. It’s thin also but I wasn’t expecting nice material for the price. I’m just sad it’s not truly full length.
1.0,"Purchased 3xl they fit like leggins not for American men, if you select a size double it, plus direct from china so it's too expensive to return I gave them to my daughter."
1.0,Ordered 3 and never received one. Don’t waste your time or money
1.0,Not what it seems
1.0,"Have had only for a few days, but first glass keeps dropping into My view,I will send Back. Will  not stay out of my view as I drive."
1.0,Too big. Not a good fit
1.0,Cheap and nothing like the real deal trash “
1.0,Disappointed of my purchase.
1.0,"This item does not look like the picture leads you to believe.  Color is way off and looks awful.  I have been ordering from Amazon for years, this is my first review. Very unhappy"
1.0,I actually like that they are light weight. They are flimsy and hard to put in your glasses. They fit my glasses well. They look good on my glasses. The absolute worst thing about these glasses are the glare you have while wearing this. It's bad enough to make me return this item.
1.0,I understand for the price paid you can't get too much value out BUT the earrings look nothing like above picture plus clasp would not hold them in place
1.0,While the color is very pretty I gave 1 star because it would never fully tighten as if it was stripped. Within one week the prongs came open and the stone fell out. Very disappointed.
1.0,Came apart after few weeks. No response after sending message to Spediel
1.0,Did not like the top part (clear part) was not sticky at all.
1.0,"I received the package today and as I opened the  package I realized the bra was torn. Almost as if this bra was already worn. No product information sheet, no product title, just a transparent plastic pouch and a torn used bra. I feel ripped off and I want my money back!"
1.0,Item did not fit as expected.
1.0,"This took over a month to get, too small and I'm normally a small.<br />Return is not free, and not worth the $ or Hassel. Don't order"
1.0,Very poor quality. Not at all the same product that I ordered. Very disappointed
1.0,"These don’t fit in a toddler size croc, and they broke really easily. I do not recommend them."
1.0,I do not understand how you get the largest size and it is still TINY. I got xxxxl and it fits my sister that wears a US M.
1.0,"I want to love this coat so much!! It really is cute, and pretty warm.  Although I haven't had it in the dead of winter. But kept me warm in 30 degree weather. However..ALL of the front buttons are falling off! Keep in mind, I've only had it for less than a week, and only wore it the past 3 days. Very upsetting, as $78 is a lot of money for such cheap work. I noticed strings of the actual coat seams coming out right away, too. As i pulled it out of the bag. Im so upset this is already happening bc it really is a cute coat. Wish it was better made is all, but i doubt this coat will last through 1 full winter at this point. Maybe i got a dud?  For reference on those who do want to purchase, I am 5'3--- 130lbs. Small size fit perfectly. I love that it covers my butt, but still has a little bit of shape to it."
1.0,It broke after a week
1.0,It's torn in a month.
1.0,Broke the handle on first use
1.0,not what i thought it would look like and too small
1.0,Pretty color. Cheaply made. Would not buy again. Already returned. Cheap for a reason.
1.0,Disappointed. The stitchers pulled apart across the Velcro strap.
1.0,"One of those types of items that looked cute in store but not when it arrived. I tried it on and wasn't really impressed. It felt okay, it wasn't entirely uncomfortable but also wasn't that great either. Maybe I juylst picked the wrong color but either way I wasn't a fan."
1.0,I was so excited this was beautiful and comfortable. Less than a week and I've lost it. It did not stay clasped and worked out.
1.0,"Doubtful this material has been tested against droplet precautions and very unlikely that it provides much if any protection from covid, it is like a mesh lingerie. I'm not really sure why you would bother putting it on your face, unless to filter light debris and particles (wildfire smoke?), dress up like mortal kombat?"
1.0,Pros: several different earrings sizes that are nice size. The largest size isn’t obnoxious and the smallest size is still perfect.<br /><br />Cons: these earrings infected my ears. They are NOT hypoallergenic. The reaction was quick. I won’t be wearing these earrings anymore.<br /><br />I also felt the earrings themselves didn’t have much sparkle to them. Pretty dull even right out of the package.
1.0,"When I ordered I thought it might be big… nope, it barely fits on my pinky, and I usually wear a size 6 ring."
1.0,These were so cute and i got them on sale! I couldn't wait to get them and wear them. Unfortunately they were way to small. I wear an 11 and these fit me like a 9 1/2 - 10. They were too short! They seemed like they would be super comfy if I were able to wear them. I gave them to my daughter. She wears a 10 and her foot hangs off the bag just a smidge. She likes them and wears them daily.
1.0,I really like the bands but the inside of the band that goes through the hole is rusting out and it's causing a rash. The pins are always slipping out and the watch comes off
1.0,Great fit and comfortable but poorly made. It ripped after the first wear and now they want me to send back a ripped sweater to receive a new one
1.0,Too small for me so gave it as a gift
1.0,Broke after first time worn.
1.0,It was poorly put together. I just want to return it was very dissatisfied with this product.
1.0,The year broke immediately. Poor quality too delicate
1.0,"Really hard to put on, it’s really cute though !"
1.0,This shirt is so thin you can see right thru it. Not good for a little boy who loves JoJo. I tried to send it back took awhile to get the address but when I went to UPS it cost $73 to send it back. So I just kept it and use as a dust rag.
1.0,Blouse fits ok. But color is way different. Way brighter.
1.0,Garbage and came defective!
1.0,they break very easy
1.0,"The tie is NOT gold, it's tan."
1.0,Waste of money!
1.0,Cheap fabric. Hated it.
1.0,The picture doesn’t show it online but this item has a big ugly brown label smack in the front that says mato.  If this was shown in the pictures I would not have purchased this bag
1.0,These run so small I threw them out.
1.0,Broke before ever worn!
1.0,I bought a small for my 1uear old daughter who barely has a chest and this is wayyyyyy too small for a 10 year old girl. Dont buy or buy large.
1.0,See thru poor quality
1.0,1 stone fell out on day 1. threw in garbage
1.0,Poorly made and the  material is cheap.
1.0,"The ring for the watch face fell off within a month.  Emailed Sopoix,no reply.☹☹"
1.0,"I wish zero stars were an option. The first day my husband wore one of these it ended up snagging, and not just in one spot but all over. Guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,"Many reviews saying they received the wrong name.  The seller promised they had their system ""glitch"" fixed and it wouldn't happen anymore.  Well, it did to me, and I suspect it is still happening to others.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this seller."
1.0,Not a good fit too small tight around the neck.
1.0,the large is more of a small. any other skirt like this I can get in a large and it will fit me. and this one I couldn't even get up passed my thighs and that unsipped.
1.0,This will be going back.  No way it would fit a man with long arms.  The shoulders are broad but the waist is about a size 28.
1.0,WAY too bright.  My husband won't wear it.
1.0,Didn't like  material. Runs smal. In my cloths to be donated bag
1.0,👎🏽
1.0,Way too big! Had to re-sew.
1.0,Why are you marking it as prime when that is not an option? So frustrating.
1.0,I have several bracelets with the magnetic lock.  This one was not not secure.  Notice I said WAS.  It fell off and was lost the 2nd time I wore it.<br /><br />😠
1.0,One broke already
1.0,"The color and texture are wrong, what you actually get has nothing to do with the pictures or the description."
1.0,"Washed on cold 3 times.  Bled color so bad it all 3 times the color catchers were darker than the fabric.  If you want to be able to wash with other clothing, do not buy"
1.0,The stone is mostly white.  Not at all as pictured with brilliant blue.  I would return it if I didn't need it for Christmas.
1.0,"Since this was so popular, I gave it a try.  I ordered a black tunic and it was awful.  The fabric was sheer and completely see through.  It was cheap and not at all what I anticipated.  I would have given it zero stars if I could."
1.0,The material is very cheap. It looks like plastic and it smells like plastic. I am returning this product.
1.0,Will not order again- very poor quality  and much too small for me
1.0,Caused hives breakout. Makes my hands sweat.
1.0,Too small . Poor cuality.
1.0,I bought it for my husband.. few days later the metal please broke
1.0,"I'm a 36C and it gave a lot of side b. I can't wear this with a bra either, it would show like a quarter of the cup."
1.0,Do not fit. Do not buy. These are a waste of money.
1.0,The XL looks like an M. Sorry.
1.0,I thought this product would be of a better quality. It started at 32 and it was still to big and stretchy
1.0,"I tried to use it, but the hat isn’t glued to the barrettes very well and it fell apart 10 minutes after I put it on."
1.0,Ordered XL like I do everything else and these weren't even close to XL more like Sm.
1.0,"The fabric was not soft, felt like plastic. Not slouchy, was stiff and uncomfortable."
1.0,The fabric was too thin.
1.0,Apparently “one size” means youth size! Doesn’t fit at all. Clothing orders from Amazon have been disappointing
1.0,My daughter is 3 and wears earring 24/7. I bought these because she loves Minnie Mouse and of course she loved them but after 2 weeks I had noticed that the back was bent and to my surprise the backing of the earring had actually embedded into the back of my daughters ears causing an infection and lots of bleeding when we took the earring out. They are very cute but if you decide to buy them please do not let your kiddos sleep in them!
1.0,Crappy and the cup all bend up and no way to flatten
1.0,The Arabic Number Quartz Men Pocket Finger Watch is not worth the time to order.  It never worked properly from the time I opened the package until the time I threw it in the trash.
1.0,I ordered a large and is more like a size small! Material is super thin. Took forever to get here!
1.0,"They don't stick and fit oddly, they don't ever lay flat."
1.0,"First of all, I received one earring. This wouldn’t have been a big deal since I know mistakes can happen with orders, but it’s COPPER-colored as if it’s only plated with steel and some of the plating came off. Stainless steel doesn’t turn this color, period. Don’t get this if you want a solid steel piece. Returning and definitely not exchanging."
1.0,The set is cute but the size is for a 12yr old without butt and bust. Just too small
1.0,This bag is so terrible I wouldn't give it one star. The suede looks like it is made of paper instead of fabric. Don't waste your money!
1.0,Does not look like the photo.
1.0,"I had the bag for approximately 2 weeks and the handle broke.  I would like a replacement is possible.  I liked the design, perhaps this was just a defect in the product."
1.0,Very big they look huge in your nose
1.0,It had too many hooks. I button 1 and another would cone undone. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ARTHRITIS
1.0,"I can't use this as the magnet that closes the case draws everything in my handbag, wallet, mints, closure on the purse.  A very poor design"
1.0,Very disappointed....seriously I tried it on then put it back on this morning and this is what I get....ripped horrible quality. Sad because it's so cute but the bra doesn't fit small chested girls and I ordered a small had to tie the top instead of just tightening it. Now I get to sew my own swimsuit that should have been sewn right in the first place! Fix this!
1.0,Turned green 1 week after wearing it
1.0,"The clasp is not very strong, I had to tighten it with a pliers so they would stay in my ears"
1.0,"Too small for my ankle, almost broke it!"
1.0,Does not look like the picture.  The short side is way shorter than what is pictured.  Thumbs down
1.0,P.o.s This is not a winter sweater very cheesy not what I expected at all
1.0,It broke within couple of weeks useless product.
1.0,Very cheap material dont buy
1.0,"I purchased this dress because it was cute and had decent reviews. I received the dress and as soon as I opened it, the buttons started falling off. This is probably the worst Amazon clothing purchase I've made. It's being returned today."
1.0,Wore it to bed.  Woke up in morning.  Whole right side ripped open.  Cheap junk.  DO  NOT.BUY THIS
1.0,Great design.  Been using this style for years.  HATE the untucked look!  But this particular version...stitching came undone the first day I used them.  Crap assembly job.
1.0,"I have had several Star Fish pants from Lands End and really liked them for comfort. This pair was so small, stretchy and the legs so tight. Nothing like the picture. Why do these companies have so much stretch. Older women don’t like that. I like some stretch but these were ridiculous."
1.0,The skirt is completely see through. It also runs very small.
1.0,"ONE WHEEL OUT OF THE 4 ON THE LARGE BAG IS STUCK AND DOES NOT ROLL.<br />OTHERWISE, we love all three bags. They are beautiful, easy to spot, strongly built, and are tough enough to survive our recent trip to Europe.<br />OK...second usage of this suitcase we went to Cancun.....the wheel just broke off.....no real reason, we were just rolling through airport"
1.0,"Very thin, see through. Lots of loose yarn. I was hoping to wear it outside the house but since it’s see through, I can inly wear it at home."
1.0,Fabric sleazy. Run a little small thru the hips.
1.0,I used these earrings on my daughter and myself.... turned colors and broke us out. They are cut but not good for long-term use.
1.0,"If you have a larger chest I would not recommend this shirt. There is a weird lining inside the ""v"" of the shirt that doesn't sit flat and can be seen. If it didnt have that liner the shirt would probably be fine, but,extremely disappointed I wasted my money on a shirt I will never wear!"
1.0,"While the colors were wonderful, and you have the capability to wear them on either side (although one side does definitely look like the backside of the ribbon) the clasp and chains are very cheaply made. Every color was only worn once or twice before they broke. It’s fixable, you can bend the metal pretty easily, but it’s not really worth it."
1.0,Not as it appeared
1.0,very see through and small 2xl was like a medium in teen sizing
1.0,"These are made from cheap material and poor construction, loose threads. I have this same style purchased from a store and I love them these I did not like at all."
1.0,Don't get taken..these are nothing but pure junk.
1.0,Looks nice but after few weeks you see not durable for everyday use.
1.0,The watch was gift and the case looks like ugly... I didn't like... The picture looks nice but wasn't .
1.0,"Quality inferior, it doesn't look durable and way too small ."
1.0,I ordered an XL. I am 5’4 and 200. It was more like a 3xl. Sending it back.
1.0,"I was very disappointed in this item.  I re-ordered it because I have nearly worn out the one I bought previously and I love the organization of it.  However, this one did not have the detachable strap as it is pictured, which is important to my needs.  I think it is of utmost importance to accurately show the product that you will actually receive in the world of online retail."
1.0,This crap sucks!! I only had it for 3 weeks and the crap decides to brake loose inside a compactor. So there went $250 for my watch + whatever BS money I spent on this. Don't buy this product. It is not worth loosing your MORE valuable product that it's supposed to hold.
1.0,"This shirt is very thin! It is also rather large but so soft it is shapeless, and takes on my form. It arrived &#34;poorly printed&#34; so the entire lower quarter of the shirt is totally faded and does not match the rest of the shirt. Due to this I cannot recommend purchasing."
1.0,"Dress is beautiful, came to us used, stained and dirty."
1.0,Don’t look nothing like the picture
1.0,Not only the wrong sweater but its full of stains. It's the first time it's happened to me so now I'm worried about ordering again. I love this line and the different sweater would be one thing but to send a clearly used one is unreal. No tags and not in a pattyboutik bag.
1.0,"I ordered a 6 x because according to the measurements that's my size. However the top area towards the bust is about 2in too big. So when I put it on it looks ridiculous, all of the ribbon in the back is a hot mess and just from trying it on it started to unravel."
1.0,"I love the bright. Colours of these shoes, however the quality is poor. Threads immediately started pulling and the laces frayed and snapped after one wear"
1.0,Doesn't feel like full grain leather. The inside especially feels like bonded leather.
1.0,these measure 1 1/2 inches- I was very disappointed they are so small- very light weight-
1.0,Beautiful but to big the length was great
1.0,"Made of very thin material. If it wasn’t blue color, it would be see through. Very cheap."
1.0,The handle broke off as soon as it was removed from the packaging.
1.0,These arrived damaged with the post completely seperated from the flower and the other one was bent to a ~30 degree angle and without taking them out of the package I found a short hair a completely different color than my own. I also have very long hair. Not sanitary and not worth the effort. They were returned within minutes of opening them.
1.0,"Thin, poor quality. The leather has inadequate stiffness. Wimpy belt."
1.0,The jacket was ridiculously small. Instead of 2XL it was more like a Medium size. I don't know how they get away with it!
1.0,"This was a thin item(kinda like a pair of pantyhose without the legs- which is ok, but unfortunately, it already had a small, round hole in it when I received it. It was obviously manufactured that way, and it made me think that this vendor is probably just getting the slightly damaged or irregularly made goods from the manufacturer, and just selling them here as undamaged/regular goods. Just avoid this product altogether, and save yourself the money you would have wasted on this cheaply made item."
1.0,They're cute but made really cheap.
1.0,It was beautiful on the outside but I had trouble with the ear pads on the clips.<br /> They kept falling out and the clips were very loose. I returned the item.
1.0,Lost color after one wash. Looks like I’ve worn it for a year instead of twice.
1.0,"When I received them i was expecting to have the 40"" waist and they were about three sizes too small. I should have sent back but they fit my child who also is not a fan of their construction."
1.0,was petite made for child  returned
1.0,Sturdy but it twists when you put it on
1.0,Don't stay on your feet
1.0,Jacket missing a  snap and it looked like it was already worn!
1.0,The Magnets fell out of bands as soon as we opened the package
1.0,Size smaller than expected
1.0,Does not stay up! I washed them once and they totally came apart. Super cheap!
1.0,No Stars!!!What a scam. I ordered a large. I'm a size 8-10.  The suit would be small on my 60lbs eight year old.
1.0,"These shoes got great reviews so I was hopeful. Unfortunately they didn't last long for my son. We got these on December 10th. Now mid February they have holes and have fallen apart. My son likes to run and play sports so wear and tear is expected, but I would like more than 2 months of use. I would find something more durable if your child is active."
1.0,Bought these for my 5-year-old daughter. Velcro is coming off of inside of strap within first two weeks of wear. Cheaply made.
1.0,its very short cute fit
1.0,Terribly small. It arrives flat as a pancake. I have a smaller adult size head. The hat fit like a child sized hat. The back criss cross feature was great but the rest was terrible. I returned it
1.0,"Product arrived packaged in plastic and the pajamas smelled like chemicals.<br />The plastic says &#34;printed on recycled paper&#34; despite clearly being printed on plastic.<br />The pajamas were soft but the amount of thick puffy ink on them made them too synthetic for us to use. They are not printed in with dye in the fabric, they are printed with an almost puffy style paint on top of the fabric."
1.0,It ripped along the seam the first time I put it on.
1.0,Its a piece of crab! Not wearable.
1.0,"I am PISSED! I paid a lot of money to receive exactly what was pictured. Instead, I got the cheapo version that everyone else is selling for $14.99. It’s not the same color, the skirt is short instead of being longer (my child is 5’2 so it’s not due to her height), and the grass skirt is a tiny one with flowers on it like the ones at the dollar tree. The only thing that looks the same is the top. I am EXTREMELY unhappy!!"
1.0,"This product was not what was advertised, it came broken when I opened the package and the whiskers were falling off. They are not clip in like advertised and I would not recommend this seller."
1.0,I didn’t like this at all. I usually love all her products!
1.0,They fit like I was a grandma
1.0,Broke insantly
1.0,Chain broke within 5 seconds of trying to put it on. Very cheaply made. Will be Returning.
1.0,"Extremely poor fit, frame would most likely break if I was to force the lenses into the frame."
1.0,Not what I expected. Opened the box and yelled &#34;GROSS!&#34; It's super gliterry and super gold. Doesn't look like a straw hat. Looks like I'm a 4 year old in a dance recital.
1.0,The waist band was too tight. i ordered an x- small thinking it would fit. The fabric and the shorts were comfortable.... except the waist band. it was so tight it left a red mark around my waist. I returned them because it hurt. i suggest going up a size.
1.0,"Low quality, image becomes feint as soon as the sock stretches when you put it on"
1.0,The band around the waist is NOT what it looks like in the photo. Much cheaper.
1.0,"returned these by return post.  lots of negatives: not progressive as advertised but bifocal. the bifocal was so high up on the lens as to interfere with straight ahead vision. the optics were odd, unlike any bifocal I've ever used.<br />one positive: the frames were light weight but sturdy. sorry the lens did not live up to the advertisement."
1.0,They were plastic not glass
1.0,It’s ok but a little girl wants Pom poms not a flat fan looking Pom Pom. Also had to cut off the zip ties that are a hazard. Surprisingly lots of reviews don’t mention this.
1.0,"I love the way the mask is supposed to look, but it has the piece that goes over the nose on the bottom.  If I wear it that way, the lion is upside down."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:2b42c746e754612c4f92e1ea2e095aaa]] Ordered pants on April 13th got it in time on Saturday April 15th that’s fine but when I tried on the pants zipper wasn’t working and the button came off.
1.0,They looked nice and everything. But I went to the beach and I wear them once and because of the water ( I Guess) they literally got broken.
1.0,"I don't know how this shirt fit because I did not even try it on!!  My first time purchasing from this seller and it will be my last! I opened the package as soon as I received it. The packaging was not sealed. The shirt haphazardly folded in a ziploc bag, which was my first suspicion that this shirt was not brand new. The shirt did not have a tag, which was my second suspicion that the shirt was not brand new. Then, when I took the shirt out of the ziploc bag, a piece of dark hair strand fell out from the shirt. It gets better... I examined the shirt to make sure there were no holes, etc, and I ound a red stain on the back of the shirt as well as foundation marks around the elastic rim of the shirt. This shirt was previously worn and the seller had no qualms about re-selling this shirt as brand new. GROSS! SheIn has a lot of cute designs and I was really hoping to purchase more clothes from them, but I will NOT be a returning customer."
1.0,Poor quality.  Many flaws and will not hold up.  Wouldn’t waste your money.
1.0,Just got item in the mail today.. doesn't work! Tried replacing the battery and it still doesn't work! Very disappointed as I bought it to use for the upcoming week
1.0,The clasps on these bands will not close.  I am most disappointed and do not recommend this product.
1.0,Does not working
1.0,Awful color! AWFUL!! Not even close to what I thought it would be. Like a dirty neon yellow. AWFUL
1.0,"It looked cute online, but was terribly unflattering. Runs small. Returned."
1.0,Runs very small and non returnable
1.0,"This belt was entirely too small, I have a 38"" waist but this belt is entirely too small  It would be small for any waist bigger than 30"".<br />I'm returning it I think"
1.0,I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend considering there wasn't many complaints and she is very careful with jewelry but it broke with in a few days of wearing it... we fixed it multiple times and it continued to break
1.0,It looks terrible in the back
1.0,This size was clearly mislabeled. I know this because I have the SAME dress by the SAME company in the SAME SIZE but different color (navy blue). I put them side by side to compare and this one was clearly much smaller. Unfortunately I didn't realize it until the &#34;return window closed.&#34; Frustrating. I am hoping seller reads this and offers an exchange.
1.0,The pattern is not as in the picture. I got this blurry pattern that is HUGE. Look at pictures for details. I’m so upset. Not the same product!
1.0,The dress is navy and I ordered black. The quality and make is great. Not returning because I have a family photoshoot. Just disappointed that it's the wrong dress.
1.0,"Ugh, gross! It's just a regular shirt. It isn't the cute oversize style in the photo. It looks like a 5 dollar graphic shirt from Walmart or smth. Don't let this company trick you too! Now I get a to take time out of my busy schedule to return this garbage because they decided to lie. Booooooo"
1.0,"Can’t even rate this, I received it cracked and the lights never worked even when I changed batteries. Horrible customer service because you can’t even speak to anyone about the issue. I will not buy from them again, again it could be that I was just misfortunate with receiving this product."
1.0,Not happy it’s  way to small it needs to be Refunded !!!!
1.0,Cheaply made from China . Cheap cheap fabric .
1.0,It is a crop top. It didn’t even come to my belly button. Would not buy again.
1.0,Not what I expected. Will be returning
1.0,This was a size or 2 too big.  It's supposed to be a large but it fits like an XXL
1.0,No goods
1.0,"I got this for my first family of 3 Christmas, so proud and excited to have a mama keychain and all that. Within a week my charm fell off my keyring! Made me so sad and disappointed! My husband's lasted a little longer, I think by 2 months it had fallen off ( his happen to fall off in the house so we could retrieve it unlike mine *sigh*)  my little is still too small to actually wear it so no news there. Hope this helps. It's honestly great just the link is weak, so reinforce it, keep in car for looks or move on and find another set ."
1.0,The size was a 0. It was marked 4X. The waist was maybe 20 inches!
1.0,"I got this for a xmas cocktail it was WAY too large I am 5 ""2 118 lbs and was swimming in a small"
1.0,This is supposed to be a size 3 X this shirt is definitely a size small I couldn't even get it on to see how it fits.
1.0,These broke before I could wear them once!
1.0,"Returning clip does not work.  It arrived unclasped.  Perhaps they should clasp it before shipping.  Had the same problem with another one recently ordered and returned, also."
1.0,Had only a few days not as sturdy as i hoped for it broke. The pins that hold leather strap in fell out.
1.0,Not true to size. If you have a big butt and a small waist like me order 2 sizes up.
1.0,Cheap and baggy I sent it back. I am 5’1 and 130 pounds
1.0,this garbage screaming &#34;made in china&#34; !! Damn..
1.0,I ordered this was brushing my hair and the necklace broke. Very disappointed in the necklace. Only got to wear it a couple of days before it broke in the middle.
1.0,Did not like it all all. It has no support for the breast and just looks horrible once its on. IF you have big breast and you like your breat in place in place this top may not work for you. The fabric is just to thin.
1.0,I was expecting a 4 way stretch type of fabric- this feels like cotton and wayy too flimsy and see through. Not made for athletic wear in my opinion
1.0,"Cheap sheer material. Does not fit properly on the body. Item was ordered to be a bridesmaid dress... and every size was a bad fit on all the girls. Like the waist Hit too low, it was long, and the boobs were in awkward places... and again, not just my order, but for all the girls in the bridal party: sizes small, medium, and large. Have to return, bummer bc in the picture it looks nice :/"
1.0,Only because I needed to send it back I got the wrong one.
1.0,Work in health care and band does not hold whatsoever. Watch was falling off all day. Wrist has to be still to hold.
1.0,"Sweater Cardigan was a “Chenille” shedding mess...right when trying it on I was covered in lint and thread.  Would never be able to wear it anywhere, not even as a robe or indoor sweater."
1.0,If I could give less than one star I would- took if right out of the package and put it on- broke TWICE before I even left the house. Rigged it to stay on and broke two hours into being out. Wish I could get my money back!
1.0,It says Glass beaded bracelet fits any size wrist (stretches as it rolls on) but they are not stretching.
1.0,"The shirts appear to be quality made, but I ordered white shirts. They arrived with a pink/purple hue. Really strange. Too bad because they appeared to be what I was looking for."
1.0,Way too small for the size advertized.
1.0,It dosnt look as nice I person
1.0,"Waste of money! I bought this purse and in just 3 weeks of using it, the straps are hanging on by threads on BOTH sides. Not just one side, but BOTH. I don’t know they have bad batches of bags made or what, but 3 weeks is ridiculous for it to be falling apart like this. I really liked the look of this bag and the storage, but really let down to see it fall apart so quickly and it was a watch of money for me."
1.0,Size is irregular
1.0,I bought three of these for gifts.  One of them fell apart almost immediately after I opened it.  The chain is flimsy.  It is not shiny at all (as it appears in the photo).  Very cheaply made item.
1.0,"Not even close to fitting. It comes from China and is there sizes I think. It's very cute but I gave it to my 12 year old niece and it barely fit her. Costs to much to send back and maybe get the right size next, no guarantees it will fit they are willing to send what they think will fit."
1.0,Tarnished after a couple weeks of wearing it
1.0,The picture looks a lot better than actual product. I bought for a Christmas party and im going to have to return this and get something else
1.0,I'm sending it back.  It fits like a maternity dress.
1.0,Picture doesn't look like what I received
1.0,This was given to my son for his birthday today. They fell off his head and onto our floor and broke.  He got to love them for less than 30 minutes.  Find something more durable and save your kid the heartbreak.
1.0,The overall is cute but the quality where you connect with the botton  is horrible. Why would they put a plastic botton? It doesn’t make since the clip comes off . It would had been better if it was metal like it should had been!
1.0,"Item was one size fits all. However, it did not fit me."
1.0,Horrible smell even after I washed it
1.0,I only received a pack of 5 earnings
1.0,It suppose to be 3 it’s only 2 I might send them back…
1.0,this belt seems like it is vinyl although claiming to be real leather. It is split and cracked already.
1.0,Only one specific lights up - this should have been $20 NOT $87. WTF. Total rip off.
1.0,Was worn by my husband for all one hour before it stopped lighting up.
1.0,"Super cheap.  I buy inexpensive jewelry all the time, and this is the only piece I really hate.  It is made of painted plastic.  You can see the seams from the mould.  Also, mine is missing a black piece, so it's lopsided and looks ridiculous."
1.0,"I got a wrong color, I do not know what to say. Very unhappy."
1.0,very small amount of material and does not cover the area under a coat. Just cheap. I went to return and the return date had expired so I'm stuck with it... not happy
1.0,It was terrible...had no pattern at all.. It was wadded up and wrinkled worse than a cabbage patch &#34;granny&#34; dolls face !!!  Horrible is a good  word !!!
1.0,I puchased this bracelet through Harley Davidson. I sent it back. The clasp is defective.
1.0,The lock on this thing is soooooo cheap. It broke on the first day.<br />Will be sending back and be looking for something else.
1.0,"Not only was there a design flaw, but it also ran so small that I could hardly get it on. My daughter tried it on and it didn't even fit her."
1.0,"I ordered the gray color in a Medium and I liked the way they fit and how they complement your shape. I'm 5'4 and 165pounds. However, I did experience a lot of rolling and what looked like menstrual staining. maybe I should have ordered a Large and a different color.  Unfortunately,  this will have to be a return. I wanted to like them because they have a great thickness and waist band compression.  Maybe i just got a bad pair of leggings.<br /><br />I contacted the seller. I told them my measurements,  and my experience with the menstrual staining. Customer service replied back to say that it was the warehouse not checking. However a replacement pair was not offered. Legging are great quality,  just disappointing customer service could be better."
1.0,"I ordered my size after reading reviews expecting these to fit.  The shoe length is fine but the straps are not. We even tried to add another hole into the straps where they fasten with the buckle and both shoes still shake around on my feet and the straps around the back of my ankles slide down under the heels of my feet. For the price, I am very unhappy."
1.0,Didn’t fit properly.
1.0,"It doesn't even look like the picture, poorly made."
1.0,"Very piercing!  Colorful rainbow finish matches the hardware on my Minkoff &#34;Mini MAC&#34; with oil slick finish.<br /><br />Edit:  2 weeks later (after hanging on my keychain) most of the colorful has worn off and now it's a dull matte grey, looks like lead.  I threw it away."
1.0,It is canvas and I like the color scheme but I give them one star for false advertising. I suspected this wasn't waxed by the look and feel but to test I splashed some water and it sucked it right up (unlike waxed canvas that would have repelled and water beaded off)
1.0,The second to the top snap pulled through the fabric on the second wearing. Garbage
1.0,Awful smell and poor quality / buyer beware
1.0,"This is NOT .925 Sterling silver... Two rings turned brownish green... Very disappointing to be lied to! However, Amazon issued a full refund."
1.0,"The tracking on these was terrible. It never updated from Package Shipped.<br /> When I asked for information on when they would be received they couldn't give me anything. When I put in for a refund they all of a sudden had specific information and they had gotten delivered that day. Great, got them, only a bit irritating.<br />Out of the 10 there are 2 that the black filter piece has not fallen out of. They have not even been used! Two were off when I took them out of the package, and the others came off in the first washing. Can't say I am happy with spending $37 to get two usable masks that I imagine will also come apart in very little time. I would not suggest buying these at all."
1.0,The material of the jacket hugs your body in the worst ways possible. It accentuates the curves we all try too hide and when it stretches the pattern becomes obscured. I ordered a XXL and it fits like a Large! Also it took OVER TWO MONTHS to arrive! I waited a very long time for this product to suffer disappointment.
1.0,"Thinking this was a misprint by the manufacturer. Sloth with a ""llamastay"" seems wrong. Nama-stay with a sloth good, llamastay with a llama good. Just sayin."
1.0,"there was a screw on the pole that wouldn't let the umbrella come down, because i couldn't get it all the way down the wind broke the pole in half"
1.0,Won't be buying from this company again.<br />I wear 99.9% XXL.<br />This shirt was very nice but HUGE.<br />No free return on this item.<br />Guess I will donate to goodwill.<br />Not worth the cost of the shirt and return shipping........
1.0,The coat looked real warm but end up being super thin. It looks nice but is more of a fall jacket.
1.0,This dress it completely white. I was hoping it was a bit beige like on the pictures. I will be sending back
1.0,Couldn't get them on!
1.0,is not what I expected very small
1.0,"This swimsuit is adorable but did not fit my body type at all.  The fit is more of a ""teen"" fit and not ""woman's"" fit.  Unfortunately, I returned.  Return went very smoothly."
1.0,This item was cheap and broke 10 mins into<br />Wearing it
1.0,Turned colors and earrings didn't stay hooked.
1.0,This bracelet is horrible. The band is not in a shape to fit a wrist. It may fit a small child but not an adult. Very disappointed. Really looking forward to wearing this bracelet.
1.0,4 sizes too small
1.0,"THESE DO NOT WORK WITH OAKLEY HALF JACKET... the Lenses are rounded and dont sit in the curves.. ...... DONT BUY!! ..The Lenses dont work with Oakley half jacket frames, the only thing that does work is the nose pieces, the whole  thing is horrible and they have no customer service at all."
1.0,Nunca se recibió
1.0,I was looking for some black stud earrings that were subtle yet nice. These however are so small that they do not show your wearing earrings. I was very disappointed in them for the money I could have gotten much better stud earrings.
1.0,Looked like it would fit but sizing was wrong.wayyyy offf!
1.0,The earrings where bigger and heavier than what I assumed they would be. Returned them.
1.0,Looks good but the bracelet fell apart within month of purchase. Not good at all
1.0,Turned black after wearing them a few days. Not real silver obviously.
1.0,I am shocked at the product I received ! These shoes do not match the description AT ALL . Plus they are USED ! And they STINK !!!<br />So disappointed in this order .
1.0,this outfit is bull crap dont waste your money its poorly made and the stitching where coming out  the color is a lime green and not olive green .... very disappointed
1.0,"fell apart , first could not open , then nobb off , hard to wind ."
1.0,"I am frustrated as the leggings are supposed to fit up to a size 10. I am a size 6 at 5'7&#34; and 145lbs and I can see right thru these. Also there is a run from the crotch up the backside of one pair. I was going to keep if they were to thin to give my sis, a size 10 one pair. I would have like to add them as just a little extra in her Christmas gift but that won't be happening.  I realized that most often you get what you pay for, and I knew it was taking a chance on these. I will not be sending them back merely bc the manpower and resources that it takes to get them back to the warehouse is irresponsible."
1.0,This nose ring is very dainty and that part looks good HOWEVER the clicker does not securely clicks. It opens without very much pressure. It will pop open while wearing. I can’t recommend this product
1.0,Cheaply made and smelled really bad.
1.0,"Seriously dangerous.  The metal clasp that holds the plastic straps together has sharp, rasp-like teeth.  It's like wearing the strips of metal that cut aluminum foil or waxed paper on your wrist.  Cuts your skin, snags on clothing and furniture.  The only good thing is the full refund they offered me."
1.0,Didn’t like the way it fit me
1.0,Not worth it I’m 5’6 and my butt was hanging out the back! Extremely short! And small extra large more like a medium not worth it returning it ASAP
1.0,Too tight. Can't get them on
1.0,"This vest is not as described. It is not fleece, nor is it thermal. Very disappointed."
1.0,Poor quality Ordered larger because made in China but fits and looks like a USA small
1.0,"We were really disappointed. This is more for a 3 year old, as the shoes were too small for my going on 5 year old . Everything is really cheaply made  ( dollar store quality) and i can't see them lasting more than a few weeks or a month. Also, the case is super small. Once you unpackage the stuff and assemble the tiaras it no longer fits in the case for storage unless you keep the shoes out. We were hoping everything could be stored in the case easily. Overall a huge disappointment, especially given the ridiculous price of it."
1.0,I bought two pair of these and one earring has broken already.
1.0,This top was very low quality and did not fit correctly. The material is very cheap and I would not recommend at all.
1.0,Not for my body type. I think women with a firm shape would kill this.
1.0,Doesn't work.
1.0,Extra Small
1.0,"Extremely inaccurate sizing, got a size bigger than usually and still extremely small"
1.0,Craziest thing I have every ordered. Got a refund it was a mess..  Sad was looking for something like this but other things I have gotten from this vendor have been great
1.0,Complete GARBAGE. I tried it on and the arm ripped. I STILL HAVE THE TAGS ON!!!! Do NOT buy!!!!
1.0,These run very small and shrink upon washing to be even smaller. Would not buy again.
1.0,THIS ISN'T WHAT I HAD BEFORE.  THESE ARE FOR KIDS AND THEY SHOULD MAKE THAT CLEAR!  THE STRAPS ARE REALLY THIN AND OVERALL THE PRODUCT IS SMALL.  ITS NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL!  THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING!<br />AMAZON NEEDS TO CHECK THIS COMOANY AND MAKE THEM BE TRUTHFUL!
1.0,"Got the bag today and was very disappointed. The bag is roomy and big which is what I wanted but an inside zipper was broke, the arm hole is very small, you cannot get it over your shoulder.  It is not a firm bag, very flimsy, even with it full to the brim! It was a waste of money. May I add that it was not worth the price they are asking. Real bummer!!  I threw it away. 👎🏻"
1.0,Not at all what I expected the material not cotton something shiny and cheap took a long time to arrive
1.0,"Gage size is slightly bigger than 16, did not fit"
1.0,I wore it about  8 times and this morning I noticed the tip of the hook was not &#34;right &#34;. It was brass colored and wouldn't stay in the hole I put it in. I'm not sure but I think the tip came  off the post. I'm afraid to wear it now thinking it will not stay on.
1.0,Looks like a long dishcloth. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Looks like a white paper bag. Very cheap unlike what’s depicted in the picture. Will return.
1.0,Item is shrunken sizing. Way too short and way too small. Child size chart is not accurate and should be be banned from marketplace!<br />Very deceiving! Causing a purchase that you have to PAY TO RETURN!!! Useless item!
1.0,I would recommend this shirt to anyone the image on the shirt is blurry and of poor quality. I ordered a kids medium and it was way to big. This item is not a good buy
1.0,Did not like this shield nose piece broke after only using it once. Will not buy again
1.0,"I am returning these and ordering another brand.  these were very light weigh, too long, and the clip on the elastic doesn't hold the very thin elastic in place.  Sorry, waste of money."
1.0,"Only received 1, ordered 2x<br /><br />UPDATE:  RE-ORDERED, same as before. Only received 1 of 3 items.<br /><br />Ordered D cup, need longer tie, does not fit otherwise. Would fit a B."
1.0,Socks are not warm .They suck do not buy
1.0,Is not good at all.. The glue in the edge of the bra make a blister in my breast😳 OMG!
1.0,The shirt is a silky material jot t-shirt it came with a tear all the way across in the back of the shirt.
1.0,I didn't try this item. I returned it without opening it.
1.0,Stiff and unnatural under a woman's smaller collar. May work fine for men.
1.0,"Wanted a pear of light weight glasses for my husband.  We don't like to spend much on these readers as we have them all over and tend to lose them.  While I didn't expect to use them forever I was disappointed when they broke 2 days after getting them.  while some reviews said they are tough, we found the smallest pressure broke them.<br />Waste of money"
1.0,I sent it back after 1 use the strap that snaps broke.
1.0,"Do not purchase if you have a larger bust.  Gave the product to a coworker, as I threw away the return envelope.  No stretch in the fabric."
1.0,"Terrible, broke within 4 hours"
1.0,Head band is very small and made of plastic causing it to dig into the side of your head. If you have a larger head this will be very painful for any period of wearing past 5 minutes.
1.0,"I ordered two casual jackets for a conference I was working. Good thing as this one was too small even though I ordered a large and normally wear a medium or a large.  or a 12.  it was very restricting but still looked too tight and I couldn't wear it. I wish I had returned it but it was a last minute purchase and didn't have the time before I went away. so now I am stuck with it.  The other one, a different brand but pretty much similar material and style, fit perfectly so I was not left without a complete outfit."
1.0,"It's not shaped to properly fit face, material too stiff.  For me, I was not pleased with this purchase."
1.0,The product was waaaaay too large
1.0,Very disappointed in this scarf; the reviews I read sounded like this would be a nice scarf. But the one I received was very poor quality. It arrived much sooner then expected. I would not recommend this scarf.  =(
1.0,"These gloves are not wired: it is a pair of gloves with warming pads that you can put inside them.  The gloves are the worst quality I have ever seen, coming apart before I even put them on; they separate at the stripes as if they were made separately and then loosely hand-sewn together.  These gloves are barely worth 50 cents, if that.<br /><br />The warming pads are near-useless because they are not shaped to fit properly inside the glove. On one end of the pad is the outlet and on the other a flap of the pad with no warming wires increases the distance between the warmth and your fingers so that the only part of your hand it warms is a 2-inch square on the back of your palm.  The pads are not wearable inside or outside the glove, because although they have an elastic strap, that strap would be tight on a child's hand and cuts off circulation in an adult hand."
1.0,"I ordered these boot stretchers with excitement. I really had high hopes for them. Today after receiving my order, I went straight to work on utilizing these. Within ten minutes I was completely disappointed! The bar broke off of one of the stretchers!!!!"
1.0,"they wouldn,t clip in the back"
1.0,"Very cheaply made!!! Not as dark as the picture, the print on the shirt was even faded!!!! Not to mention the shirt was way smaller than expected, it was suppose to be a 3x and fit like a large. The material that they were made from was super see through and looked like kids pajama material! Will not be ordering from them again!"
1.0,"Cute but wayyyy too big... I’m a 32 A. The straps that go across aren’t even. And the cups are a little too far apart. Also the tag attached said small, but the tag sewn on said large. Unsatisfactory.. returning.."
1.0,THEY WERE TOO SMALL - NO STRETCH IN THE FABRIC.
1.0,Extremely cheap quality. Broke within hours.
1.0,Product not as advertised. One layer and way to thin and flimsy. One ear strap broken out of the package. Cannot return. Seller offered 3% refund.
1.0,What a scam. I ordered it because it’s claimed to be 100% cotton. Arrived and found out it’s only 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Will return it. Waste of time
1.0,You can't shove a 0g flare through a 2g stretch...
1.0,I couldn’t fit my head through the neck hole. Never had an issue and the size was big so what’s up with the hole?
1.0,"It took almost 2 weeks to arrived and the picture on the coin purse is faded meaning I cannot see the woman's face, it almost looks photoshopped and then placed on the coin purse.  This item does ship from China.  I am just into Vintage items lately and so I was very disappointed in the quality.  This is a smaller coin purse from the other 2 coin purses I had also received from them."
1.0,"The link pins are very difficult to remove. If this item did not have to be sent to China for a refund, I would send it back"
1.0,I was really looking forward to receiving these boots but when I got them... turns out that the size was a UK 8 and not a US 8.... huge size difference ..about 3 sizes up. It was really disappointing that the sizing was not made obvious at the top in the description at the time I made this purchase... It's not unreasonable that I assumed it was US sizing since I'm shopping on US Amazon... I have also shopped for other Fly London shoes on US Amazon without any sizing issues in the past... Now I realize that I'll have to ship this return to the UK and it would cost $76 out of pocket to do so.... which is half the cost of these boots...I don't want to do that and am really annoyed.... Please do better and make clearer descriptions of size conversions of your products if you are going to sell on a site outside of your country.
1.0,"These nose rings have such a sharp, pointed right angle on them that they are impossible (and very painful) to insert."
1.0,Not what I expected.  Material was to light weight.  Wanted something more on line of seer-sucker material.
1.0,"Not very sturdy, cheaply made"
1.0,Cute top but wayyyyyy too small. Sizing is really off.
1.0,Was broken and very cheap when arrived. Jewels missing. Price not worth the trouble of a return. Do not recommend
1.0,I really wanted to love this mask. I swim 3-4 miles a week. The suction is awesome never leaked. The comfort was great. The problems are.... I see double under water. I sent back the first pair bc of this problem but same thing with the second pair. Then after trying them the second mask they got a “permanent “ fog. I couldn’t wipe them as per the instructions. Back to raccoon eyes with goggles.
1.0,One of the three was already dead when the package arrived.
1.0,While this item looks nice and arrived very quick. It is nothing like the size chart listed. It is labeled as an XL and it fits like a S/M. Extremely disappointed that it's not sized right.
1.0,Adorable which is why we were so disappointed that it's quality is so terrible we aren't sure if it came with holes along the seams or ripped as she was putting it on.
1.0,Way to orange
1.0,"Worst thing I have ever bought. Came out of the cheap plastic wrap smelling of rotting fish and put them on to find that the stitches inside the glove werent even in one piece. Sure they look nice, but turning them inside out just to TRY and fix the stitches inside is such a waste of time."
1.0,"Wallet seems to be made well, but when all slots are full, the wallet will not close. The photos I attached show the wallet forced shut  - I attempted to zip the wallet and though it was almost possible (would not zip all the way around) it put an incredible amount of strain on the zipper....  the reason I purchased the wallet was to hold all of my cards.. so it's kind of worthless if they won't all fit in the wallet! There are still three slots empty ...  This may work for those who want to use the wallet for photos or fewer cards.. but it doesn't work for me."
1.0,They are a waste of money they came apart when I took they back off
1.0,These are very cheap looking.
1.0,Too Short. I'm 5'6
1.0,Missing some stones. I used pieces of chrystals that I had to glue into the blank spots
1.0,The bathing suit fit fine. However it arrived COVERED in pet hair. I thought I was buying something new. I was so disgusted that I’m returning it.
1.0,This is extremely small and material is extremely hard
1.0,"I bought this item believing it was a &#34;romper&#34;, as the description says. However, once the gift recipient received it, they informed me that is was a swimsuit. Needless to say, I was very dissapointed. Also, if you read further on, in the description area, it says &#34;if you have a fat baby, get a bigger size&#34;! Who says that?! It is so offensive!"
1.0,"After only 4 months and hardly used (because it was on slacks I rarely wear), the ratchet unit came apart from the rest of the buckle. This is in contrast to their statement: ""Scratch resistant buckles made to last"". When I tried to snap it back into place, a piece of metal that holds it in place broke off rendering it useless and a waste of money.<br />So now I have a ""HIGHLY FASHIONABLE stylish, buckle that is elegantly designed with class"" but broken, useless buckle and belt. It definitely was an ""Easy removable buckle"" as it removed a part of itself from the rest of itself. Yes, it did indeed "" Make a big impression! Enclosed in a lovely, attractive gift box"" but it was not a positive impression and lovely, attractive boxes don't hold up slacks very well."
1.0,Not nearly as long as they portray. Cheaply made is what I think about these du rags!
1.0,If I could I would give no stars. It definitely didn’t come with hoe much it said or any of that jewelry. It came with completely different jewelry! Never buying again
1.0,These chains are so short. It looks like they are made for someone the size of a preschooler.
1.0,Had for one day and they broke. Not sure how. Went to put them on and one of the lens fell out. The plastic frame on the bottom was broke.
1.0,The masks sent are not what is shown in the photos. Once again a scam from China. This is like something you would get from Wish.com
1.0,El símbolo no está grabado. Es pintado y se quita con el uso.
1.0,I liked the look of the dress online. However I did not like the actual dress.  I ordered a size larger than my usual but the dress was still TOO small.  A bit disappointed but I have another week or so to shop for the right dress. Thanks!
1.0,"This dress fell apart the first time I wore it. I put it on and tried to tie the straps. A strap fell off when I picked it up to tie. I didn’t even have to tug on it or anything. Plus, the dress is a bit see-through. I would have returned it, but I didn’t get to try it on right away, so now it’s just a disappointment."
1.0,I am not sure where your body parts are suppose to go. The top portion was way to small and the bottom bikini is cut so slim everything is exposed.
1.0,I returned them right upon opening. I ordered a large for my dad but they were very small. I did like the look and style though. I wish they had something like that in a woman's cut.
1.0,"These start out fine, but shrink like crazy in the wash.  I have small feet, and can barely get them on now.  I wish it weren't too late to return them."
1.0,Very cheap! The clasp does not stay!
1.0,Small I bought 2 one had very good quality material.  The other same price was very thin and the color was faded with a lighter blue color
1.0,Ahhh wasting money
1.0,"I just could not get it to wrap the way I wanted it. I don't have a long torsos, but I still had difficulty getting it wrapped and the back after a while will fold.<br />After using it twice I tossed somewhere. It was a waste of money for me, it may work for others, but did nothing for me."
1.0,I leave the glasses in my car so that when i go places i can use it and it cracked due to the heat.
1.0,The photo for these was the xmas one and i didnt see that the written description said otherwise.i wouldnt have ordered it if I knew.
1.0,This is made of very elastic cloth no shape or compression.. returning mine not at all what I expected
1.0,Silver on the band was very thin. ring looked different from the picture.The band was thinner towards the top than the picture. returned
1.0,It was to small my granddaughter is a 4t so I got a 5t and it was to small
1.0,Would not buy. Again
1.0,"Cute, but the zipper broke the second time I used one of them."
1.0,"The material in the picture is lighter and appears to be a heavier canvas material. The coat looks significantly thicker than what arrived. The jacket we got was made of a thin slick material, an olive green color, with a thin layer of fuzz inside.<br />We did not get the coat we ordered."
1.0,"cheap, cheap, cheap. Lasted about a week before the clip broke."
1.0,"So cute. I put my badge on it (it's not very thick/heavy), I walked out of the house and before I got into my car the clip had already broken! Poor quality. I am sad because it would be so cute."
1.0,The suit is advertised as BLACK.  The suit is not BLACK !!!
1.0,Very cute dress but the arms were way to small! I am not very large. I have a small chest and the arms were way to tight. I couldn’t even get my arms all the way in the sleeves.
1.0,Inferior product quality
1.0,At the time I got these I was about 145lbs 5’5 I got a large. Super tight I mean not comfy at all. I did have a lot of butt maybe that’s why but they were so right on my thighs also. Didn’t like the material either.
1.0,"These are designed for someone less than 5’7”. The ratio is off on the plus size overalls. Also, all the holes on the sides were sewn shut.  In addition, beware they have only about a 2” inseam."
1.0,Very unflattering fit. Does not look like what is advertised on top of it it had a hole in the shirt! And item is apparently non returnable which is stupid. But I called amazon and they refunded my money and apolgized for the inconvience which was very nice of them. I would not buy this again at all
1.0,"Poor quality dress, looks nothing like the picture and is very small and tight."
1.0,I received this today and it didn't look right at all. Purchased an XL and it fit like small. If you have a booty thighs and a chest this is not for you. ☹️
1.0,Arrived with a very cheap finish. Larger than described and had bubbles all over it. Very cheaply made.
1.0,Product looks nothing like what was advertised and did not even come with the stitched tag on it.<br />Will never purchase from them again.
1.0,after wash machine it to be smaller than before.
1.0,"It looks very nice and keeps time, only needing to be wound about once a week.  But after one year of use, it just died completely.  All of a sudden one day, the minute hand just flops freely."
1.0,Shiny heavy weight material. Looks very cheap. Skirt is not made well as the pleating is not consistent and there shorts to be too much material for the skirt. This skirt was also much longer than expected. I thought it would hit at the knee but it hits at my calves. Disappointing BC the pattern is lovely.
1.0,The front zipper has broken and the front opening just flops open the window for return closed one month after purchase! His other regular book bags far out lasted this book bag!!!!<br />Disappointed!!
1.0,"I waited 3weeks for this , it fits like a mask, the reason I do not wear this ,it rides up your face, you have to keep pulling down,"
1.0,Appeared to be size 30 or 32 at most.
1.0,"I do not like it at all. But for its price I should not expect too high, I do know that. But I do not think I would wear it later, since it looks much bigger and the thick chain too."
1.0,"China product, Did not come as pictured very cheaply made, very thin. Tried to return it and I got no response from the seller do not buy this product. A lot of Amazon clothing does come and shipped from China"
1.0,Just a strange jacket
1.0,Ordered Navy but received Black.  Not very happy as I'm leaving for the beach in 3 days!
1.0,Color faded really fast
1.0,Come broken
1.0,"The sizing chart on this one is completely absurd. I purchased the ""right"" size for my body and it was at least two sizes too small. They didn't take into account the size of the fans pressing against the body at all.<br /><br />In addition, the noisiness of the fans, even at the lowest setting, is quite annoying.<br /><br />To wear this vest, you need to not care about noise, or people staring at you, at all.<br /><br />A very disappointing product.<br /><br />p.s. To be fair, the circulation of the air by the fan is cooling, but be sure to get two sizes up."
1.0,Bought these for our Granddaughter.  She wore them one day and the top bow came off.  I would have at least expected them to last longer than one day!
1.0,"Ordered a medium because I'm a 36D, but the top was too large with no way to adjust the size unless you cut the halter to tie it. Material is cheap, thin, and see through. This was not worth the money."
1.0,"this is not even the real dress, what I received was super cheap fabric with not the same design it was a waste of money and time to even try it on.."
1.0,One of the pearls badly mis-shaped.  I would be ashamed to wear it.
1.0,"Don't fall onto the ""Tag XL/fits like US Small"" because it really fits like a XL. I expected to be actually size/fits small but it fits like L or XL. My powerbank is 100% compatible with it but somehow it doesn't stay on charge as I expected to be. My powerbank always works well with my phone. I had to charge it on the charger outlet instead. The instructions are confusing. It doesn't say how long you can charge the vest. While charging, I noticed that the only thing that is heating up is the neck part, not the back part at all. Maybe it takes time but I don't know.. I returned it right away to Kohl's and got my refund the same day because I chose the option of refunding it as an Amazon gift card. I didn't expect it to be that fast and that's the only thing I'm satisfied about all of this."
1.0,Earrings were way to large  q
1.0,It’s poor quality that is overly priced because Descendants is on it.
1.0,The one earring won’t close properly.
1.0,"It has a blue tint, not white at all and def a weird shape. Does not fit at all."
1.0,Nunca llego
1.0,"So small. Wonder if by some fluke it got sized wrong bought XX large I like a roomy jacket, I can’t begin to get this jacket on it’s so small!!"
1.0,"I was so excited for these...<br />they are HUGE.<br />It took forever to get the top on correctly too.<br />They are extremely cute, just way too big.<br />If I didn’t try them on and it wasn’t such a hassle to return, I’d return them."
1.0,These are very uncomfortable flip flops I'm a flip flop addict and these are probably the most uncomfortable and hard on your feet of any I've ever bought. I could only stand them for an hour had to take them off. Their is no cushion they are rock hard so very hard on your feet.  I don't recommend at all unfortunately
1.0,"Just garbage...Tamished as it's been used for months....I know it's not silver, but come on!, this some kind of joke? Wasted money..."
1.0,The material seems like an imposter linen.  I really enjoy linen material and this miss the mark entirely . It was a boxy fit—not appealing at all.  I returned it.
1.0,Ugly material not as pictured.
1.0,Its just a very unpleasant experience with this piece of jewelry..nothing good with it...
1.0,Quality not as expected.
1.0,"Love to support the comeback kid - the Champion Brand story. Unfortunately, the construction of the pair of sweatpants that I received was poor. The stitching on the front waist was ""pleated on one side"" and flat on the other. Obvious as day when I tried them on. Flip side, I was impressed with the quality of the fabric. The fabric was heavy and the fit was very nice. For sizing purposes, I am 5'2 and 128 lbs. I ordered a M. The M fit me to a T. However, if you like a looser fit, than size up. I cannot speak to whether they will shrink or not."
1.0,"As soon as this ring arrived, I wore it recklessly, despite Galdalf's stern admonitions not to.<br /><br />Yet despite the manufacturer's brochure, I never began to ""fade.""  It's true that the ring was able to render me invisible, but even that wasn't as useful as I had been hoping:  as it turns out, all my friends, family, and colleagues have already joined the forces of Sauron, so they're able to see me just fine whenever I put the ring on.  The net effect, therefore, is that things just became dark and blurry whenever I wear it."
1.0,"Not pleased, shoulder pads were ridiculously tiny and thin. Large fit like a medium."
1.0,"cheap, the back keeps falling off, probably will turn my ear green if i keep the one that stays in actually in but it was like a buck sooooo"
1.0,Did not like at all! It was more like a dress than gown. I end up throwing it in the trash!
1.0,Strange material. Clip seems to be on the wrong side because the flap closes on the same side is the clip attaches.  This item confuses me. It was offered Prime so I thought I would give it a try and return if i didn’t like how it worked but.... then the return cost was more than the credit was going to be.  Hummm I thought Prime items were free returns... oh well.  Live and learn.
1.0,wayyyyyyyyyyy to large. My husband said it looked like I was wearing a moo moo.
1.0,"I bought my usual size, M and the writing was somewhat under my bust. Awkward. Returned."
1.0,Poor fit...TOO big with tight small arm holes. Weird incongruent fit!
1.0,I didn’t like the material or the dress
1.0,I received the package on time and in excellent condition. The clasp broke at the hinge when tightening the strap for the first time. The clasp is held on to the hinge by friction alone (No riveting). The hinge itself is a tiny piece of soft steel roughly the width of a small needle and it failed immediately when one of the size adjustment... holes... caught on the clasp itself when I was putting the watch on. Was nice to look at for the 3 minutes I had it.
1.0,The stones were attached with thread and came with one earring broken. Package was left where it was rained one
1.0,"Not made for people with a butt. I’m not the skinniest person in the world, but also not ready to shop in plus size departments. These shorts are completely flat in the back so that if you’re a human being with a gluteus Maximus, you will be lucky if they cover your crack when you’re in a standing position. High waist?? Nope."
1.0,Very bad quality and change color and turn my nick green
1.0,Bracelet way to big. No way of shortening the clasp
1.0,not comfortable  and the color did not match the description. I returned
1.0,"The triangle was held by a point. It was far too long. It was a cute necklace, but not the one I had thought I was buying."
1.0,"After looking for a pair of lightweight snowpants that would be good for snowshoeing and outdoor winter activities I thought this was the one, but NOOOO!!<br />I am 5' 8"" and 180lbs and ordered the XL and couldn't even get them to button and they were very restrictive, I sent them back and ordered a pair of Jessie Kidden womens insulated pant as a replacement...."
1.0,Absolutely terrible dress. Was almost see through and cardboard for the bra padding. Worse than that I had to pay 25 just to ship back to get it returned. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY
1.0,poor material that stretches out as you wear it and it feels scratchy on the skin.
1.0,This was completely different then the photo and was completely see through
1.0,Nothing like the picture!!! Don't order from this vendor!
1.0,The magnets fell out after one week.
1.0,you can literally buy these on nike.com for only 75$. why would you buy these knock off ones for 100$ more?
1.0,Calendar too small to read
1.0,Inner seam was not stitch properly and had a 6 inch hole
1.0,They’re heavy and itchy when i wear them less than two hours. The design is not like the pictures. Not worth the price.
1.0,Total crap. Nothing like the picture. All products from China. Lashes look nothing like model.<br />Jewels are all individual. Shadows are dull.
1.0,Very cheap and doesn’t at all fit like photo!
1.0,These masks have a really bad chemical order. I can't wear them due to smell.
1.0,Broke immediately after putting it on. Do not recommend.
1.0,"I did not bother to take this skirt out of the package, because I could smell the horrific “chemical” through the plastic packaging.  I, typically, do not have an issue with odor in new clothing, because it is the dye and the odor can be removed with a few washings.  I’m concerned about this skirt, though, because the “chemical” smell is too strong to be only the dye."
1.0,Not a true 2X fit. More like XL so I need to send it back.
1.0,Would not buy again. Did not fit right.
1.0,Santa was missing stone in left eye.
1.0,Had to return. I ordered a 3X. These pants were so small it will fit olive oil (from popeye)
1.0,Looked totally awful on me. Colors weren’t as pretty as picture. Looked like I should’ve been on an episode of Little House on the Prarie.
1.0,"EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE,  THICK SOLES BUT NO PADDING AT ALL.. HAD TO RETURN THEM..  WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT IF THEY WERE SOFTER..  VERY DISAPPOINTED."
1.0,Bad quality!! Don’t buy!
1.0,I ordered a medium as per usual for my size. Thing wouldn't fit my 90lbs cousin.
1.0,To short not long enough or thick enough does not look like picture at all
1.0,I  can’t even begin to describe how terrible this thing is. The cups are fine but the “bra”offers no support whatsoever. It rides up and lands up over my breasts. I am throwing this in the bin.
1.0,"Even fir an extremely reasonable price, it is bulky and cheaply made."
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap.  I was NOT PLEASED and returned it
1.0,"I could not get the belt to fold through the loop multiple times as the instructions stated. When I finally did, the leather was completely stretched and scratched up."
1.0,Sigh this mask string broke upon putting on! Cheap Quality smh
1.0,We had a reindeer dress up day at work and I bought these for staff who didn't bring their own. The foil ends jabbed into their heads causing pain. Nobody wanted to wear them. Several people wore Dollar Tree antlers that were much better quality and had no issues wearing them all day.
1.0,"Did not like this material, and due to this the item was returned."
1.0,like the feel of the material but way to long and way to small.  Will end up throwing it out.
1.0,"The body of the suit was so great, it definitely smoothed my tummy. The boobs were so unflattering. I’m a smaller chested woman, 36B and it shaped my boobs into a squashed wide uniboob WITH excessive side boob and excessive fabric on the outside of the top. Definitely not supportive or flattering. I’m not sure a different size would be the answer. I purchased small. I wear a size six pant. It was on the edge of snug through the body and just way wrong on top. I REALLY wanted to like this. I can’t imagine anyone with real boobs looking good in this."
1.0,Too small and daughter did not like it.
1.0,"Returned product, says ""Fit"" not fix."
1.0,This handbag smells SO bad I cannot use it.  I will not order another purse.  Just wasted my money.
1.0,Very disappointed!! It arrived broken!!!
1.0,This is not a easy off/on product.  This product is very hard to get off more so the the regular sock. Dont be fooled. Its also very tight at the top of the sock on your leg. I would not recommend.
1.0,Too big loose fit
1.0,These are too small for adults.
1.0,CHEAP Falls apart the first time you use them.  Not just one but all 4 split and the beads came out.  Not at the seam but the fabric itself split.
1.0,"The charm is smaller than expected. It is very, very small."
1.0,"Very poor quality , mine do not look like the photo . It’s just a sleeve and would not stay up. I do not recommend try a different one!"
1.0,I ordered an X-Large and it was way too small and super tight.
1.0,Ehhh.. I know sometimes I don’t understand fashion. But I don’t see how anyone could like how these glasses fit. No wonder they were on the cheaper side.
1.0,ES MUY PESADA Y SE CAEN LAS PIEDRAS EL PRESIO DEBIERA SER $19.99 ES PURO ACERO NO TIENE ORO
1.0,"Too big, cheap material not happy with purchase. Waste of money."
1.0,Didn’t heat. But was excellent return - very easy to return.
1.0,Have had this product for aproximately 2 weeks.  Already has severe wear and tear.  &#34;Leather&#34; rubbing off in the corners.  Assuming this is most likely a fake
1.0,I have had these lens for about 2 months and now they are really unusable. The polarized film on the inside is starting to bubble on the outsides and I'm sure it will progressively get worse. DO NOT BUY
1.0,Le doy 1 estrellas
1.0,HORRIBLE
1.0,Really uncomfortable. Removed from my watch after less than a week.
1.0,Tiny necklace. Had to give to my 8 year old
1.0,Fit like a medium. It had no name tag or washing instructions or kind of materials it is made of. Really disappointed.
1.0,Started pilling after the first wash.  Very disappointed in quality of fabric.
1.0,Están muy grandes mi cara es larga pero queda feo
1.0,Extremely large and I returned them.
1.0,"The stone fell out after 2 hours of wear time.  Very disappointed, for such a pretty ring."
1.0,"Junk!!!, It broke when I took it out of the bag!, stay away!!!"
1.0,It did not fit right and it was a horrible experience for me
1.0,Extremely hard to program. After three days and five calls to tech support. Decided to return.
1.0,The wrist strap is very short. The watch fell off & I've yet to find it.
1.0,"Fell apart about 2 hours after taking it out and using it. I bought it as a cheap accessory, and it performed as such. I was able to use it as a clutch for the rest of the night, but I wanted a hands-free bag that night, which was why I bought this one specifically. It has a nice, long strap. However, the strap must be made out of plastic or something, because the &#34;chain links&#34; broke into pieces very shortly after putting it over my shoulder. It was not being used roughly, or taken on and off the body. It just broke, with almost no use."
1.0,Material and looks is more for a nun costume. I couldn't wear this all day and it does not stretch at all. Tough feeling
1.0,Screwing mechanism totally stripped. Cannot screw other end back on to wear it. Purchased it for a trip to Florida next month but cannot be worn. Cheaply made
1.0,"3 months of use and the line did not resist as well as the sole also took off, I would like to return, change but I don't know if it's possible! I had even praised before for being comfortable 😭"
1.0,Shirt runs small.
1.0,Dress did not fit althoughI got a bigger size too small. It look as though the wrong dress was shipped. Not please.
1.0,I had heard that Travelon cross body bags had a lot of good safety features which it did but I purchased this one as the measurements were plenty big enough to hold my iPad Air2.  It did hold the iPad but I had to remove several things from the center pocket and then it was still very difficult to get the iPad into the purse.  Tried to get used to it but it was just a PAIN.  I had done my search for cross body bags that would hold an iPad Air2 so was very upset that it didn't work well.
1.0,Well made but not symmetrical.  Unfortunately I missed the return window
1.0,Cheap. Broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,Washing it for the 4th time. the smell of this Sweater when it came was really bad. Almost like it was in a fire.  No visual damage. Just bad smell
1.0,"I decided on these because I wanted to try a fun print (I got the green patterned tights). What a mistake. These are flimsy tights that will do nothing to help keep you together during workouts. The cut of these was also so strange. These have a large seam that colorfully runs right up the center of the crotch. It makes the eye go right to that area. If this is what you want, then these will certainly help get that type of attention.<br /><br />These went back quickly. But the seller was great. There were no issues."
1.0,Earrings broke second day of wearing them..
1.0,This was so thin I would do better using a plastic bag.
1.0,The waist was too tight. The rest of it fit ok.
1.0,It fit a little strange
1.0,Shapeless. Cheap cotton.
1.0,They felt very light and flimsy. The color was true to the picture. Just wished they had been more sturdy.
1.0,Material doesn't hang as well as the picture - really makes the hips look big. Ick<br />I purchased a small: I'm 5'6&#34; & weight 128.
1.0,Not that great quality and did not fit mid finger..they were regular gold rings
1.0,The slit in the back went up to my cheeks. Would have been cute other than that.
1.0,If I had received what I ordered my rating would be different. I ordered this duffle bag for my husband. I wrapped it up and gave it to him for Christmas. What he opened was shocking. It was an over the door shoe rack. Not happy. I paid for the duffle bag.
1.0,"Crappy - ended up getting my money back pretty quickly because the second time I put them on, the stitching on one of the fingers came completely undone and the glove ripped. I guess you get what you pay for! They look nice, but definitely aren't great quality."
1.0,"These earrings are thin like paper clips, sharp, horrible quality. Worst thing I’ve purchased on Amazon."
1.0,Crystals slide right out of the clasp. Also no necklace is provided... wich doesn't matter becuz the crystals FALL OUT ANYWAY !!!
1.0,came apart immediatly
1.0,Cheaply made and sleezy-looking. Waste of money!
1.0,"I purchased 4 of these for my daughters.  I used them to label their Easter baskets from the Easter bunny.  They fit perfectly around the stuffed bunny's necks as a necklace.  Only one daughter decided to take it off and wear it as a bracelet (as intended).  The first time she wore it, her initial broke off!  Luckily it fell off in the van, so we were able to find it, but she was still very upset.  Now none of her sisters are willing to wear theirs because they are afraid they will break too.  I cannot recommend these to anyone."
1.0,Not worth the money! Don't stick at the top!
1.0,"Not sewed for a human shape, stay away, ended up fitting my dog"
1.0,please don't waste your money on this.  The dress looks nothing like the pictures and the material is super cheap.
1.0,Oversized.  Skirt of the dress is not stitched together so every time you sit the whole dress opens up and exposes you.  No matter how I adjusted it the slinky material fell open whenever I sat.  Would have returned if I hadn’t tossed the tags.
1.0,this dress was so snug it was uncomfortable.Cheap material. Looked much nicer on the pictures
1.0,This looks NOTHING like the picture. Waste of money
1.0,The mauve is very ugly color gir a mauve very disappointed in pic and actual color
1.0,Came in dull gray color and advertised as pink. Very disappointing
1.0,This leo had a big black/brown stain right on the front of it. Not a good look on a white leo.
1.0,"When I purchased this I was very happy with it. After a few months of  ""LIGHT"" use, it broke. I would not recommend this item."
1.0,cheap quality<br />very small compared to the photo here
1.0,I would like to give it zero star. It broke the first time my daughter used it. Have never purchased any goggle worse than this.....
1.0,They are cheaply made the tassels came bent out of shape not layed flat  returned them
1.0,Terribly small... giving  it away to a person half my size
1.0,Que le cambiaron el color del cordón a los zapatos. Yo quería los zapatos como están en la foto con cordón negro.Y me los enviaron con un cordobés de color rosado.
1.0,This bag is NOT leather as describe!!!!!!<br />It smells like Stinky plastic!!!!! Does not have any stamping of leather. This was treated to feel like leather and is NOT!!!! BUYER BE WEAR!!!<br />This is AWFUL!!!
1.0,"I ordered a couple of watches from Lexell at one time.  They arrived pretty quickly, which was very pleasing.  One of the watches, the crown broke off, contacted via email and to this day I haven't received any information on a return, replacement or how and where it could be repaired.  That was 8 years ago.  Buyer be ware, only purchase if you're good with abysmal customer service."
1.0,Pin was broken when came to house
1.0,"I ordered these for my son in May and by July the stitching on the strap was already coming off, making the sure unwearable. I contacted customer service for a refund or exchange and never heard back."
1.0,this product is plastic! No leather to be found. I returned it right away
1.0,I purchased two pairs of these earrings and they couldn't be opened!  I haven't heard back from Amazon and wish I had never bought them!<br />One pair was supposed to be for my daughter and we are both disappointed because we couldn't get them open so we could wear them!<br />I believe they should have been inspected before being sold.
1.0,This eyeshadow pallet came broken & colors are mixed together!! I definitely want a refund!! Wish I saw the reviews prior to purchasing!!
1.0,"They are warm and good material but unfortunately they have swastikas in the design, it is not nice, I bought it for a Christmas gift, now I have to figure out something else"
1.0,Cheap and out of a quarter machine. Seller was very helpful however.
1.0,I got a 2XL fits like a 1XL
1.0,The shirt is the size for a toddler. There is no size chart to look at but the description clearly states for a adult female. This purchase was a waste of time
1.0,The fit on this product is horrible.
1.0,Jacket is poor quality. One pocket ripped with in a couple months of owning the jacket. Apparently putting gloves in the pocket is too much for it to handle. The other pocket ripped a few months later from keys being placed in it. Jacket looks very nice. But it is absolutely not worth the purchase.
1.0,I'm returning it
1.0,Se rompió el mismo día
1.0,This did not fit my pandora bracelet. The diameter of the inside of this was not wide enough.
1.0,About 2 sizes too small. Sad because I like them.
1.0,"Rough material., which does breath.  Not made for tall individuals.  Looked really comfy in the picture, but was not at all.  I was hoping for something light and comfortable for the summer heat."
1.0,"Literally just received the package and I’m already ready to throw/give it away. The single star is simply because I like the color, I hate everything else about it. For the price, I was definitely expecting a better fabric. You can tell it’s an imitation of something else and it’s honestly poorly done. The fabric is cheap, there was a hole in the pocket, the pockets don’t stay inside the dress very well, the stitching is bad, its too long which means it will get dirty fast. I’m probably going to donate it the the veterans or the goodwill. So disappointed. This should be priced at $10."
1.0,Can you please send a replacement  the elastic around the legs has been ripped or stretched so much it won’t fit and I’m leaving for the beach Saturday!!!!!!!!
1.0,Was not very sturdy came apart very quickly within the first week I felt Like it was a very poor quality will not re-order
1.0,super cute leggings very soft but no compression at all zero
1.0,They are very beautiful!!! But I am 5’2 and 144 pounds with 34 DD and they are just much too tight.
1.0,This isn't a slim fit shirt.  I returned it.  Not good at all.
1.0,"I didn't like these, I returned them. The metal is not polished and was tarnished looking when I received."
1.0,"Cheaply made, broke before I could put it on!!!"
1.0,Not as expected. Thin material. Plasticky printed stripes. Okay to wear around the house but that's about it.
1.0,If you have a butt or hips at all this is very unflattering
1.0,"Too small, washed once and print has almost faded out of sight! Requested refund to no avail! Very disappointing"
1.0,It fadded in 2 days
1.0,Got the wrong order.
1.0,It fell apart
1.0,neck too large
1.0,Plan on returning them I ordered a size bigger and the are to small!
1.0,El material está bien pero está muy mal hecho compré dos lastima
1.0,"The straps are so small, they barely fit. The strap length is so short,that it may not even fit a teenager. What is funny, is the top does not have any label with a size marked on it. I ordered the Large, I assume that is what I received,  but it is so tight on the neck(due to the short strap length), tight at the chest, its ok on the tummy.<br />The only good thing is the top has an inner black lining cloth attached. Not worth all the wait for this purchase."
1.0,I received my set but it had two pairs of the dog ones instead of a pair of poop emoji which are the reason I bought this. :(
1.0,"I ordered these thinking they would be assorted colors like the picture and description said.  I got a package of plain white.  Not happy, but learned a lesson....will not order again."
1.0,"I was really surprised, I'm normally a perfect size medium and the measurements were well spread out for the sizes, it was wayy too small."
1.0,Not what I expect from the brand. I returned.
1.0,Not great fabric and looks cheap. Can't imagine anyone over 14 wearing this.
1.0,This shirt was delivered to me today. It came with no tag on the shirt and no buttons on the neck line. Looked like I was given a product that somebody previously purchased and returned. So irritated with this. Returning asap!
1.0,It was too skimpy and see-through and thin for me
1.0,"So disappointed in the quality.  It says made of cotton, but is not... a very cheap garment, 100% made in China.  I had other clothes ordered and delivered directly from China that I was extremely happy... not this one.  I'm returning it for something else."
1.0,"This dress is completely sheer, and the lining is scratchy."
1.0,I not a real coach bag look at the pictures same bag but very different quality I bought the bag at Kittery outlet order same thing on amazon because it was cheaper so not a coach different color and quality don’t bother real coach bag for 40.00 more absolutely better quality
1.0,"Had 3 holes in it! The whole top, that is ""supposed"" to be off the shoulder came apart due to the holes. In general it doesn't match the advertised picture. Sizing is about the only thing that was accurate."
1.0,when i receive it was broke i didn't even got a change to wear it. i want refund for it  [...]
1.0,It's SO small and slippery - doesn't work if you plan to really workout
1.0,The sleeves are so wide and very tied to the robe.
1.0,You sent me three crystal beads but they weren't the ones in the picture and I was very disappointed. Michelle padon
1.0,3 days bof in-house use and they're fallong apart. Cheaply
1.0,Broke within 3 days
1.0,"I did not like this at all.  It didn't fit my phone and there is not much room for anything else.  It was advertised as real leather.  I really don't think it was.  It looked like colored cardboard.  Also,  I think it wasn't the size that stated.  It was a little short.  I sent it back!"
1.0,It fits really weird especially in the breasts and I have large breast so usually things look great it is cut weird. I wish i could return it but I waited to long to return it.
1.0,Do not order this ring it is cheaply plated and honestly looks terrible in person. The person I purchased this ring for has worn it for less than 2 hours so far today and his finger is already green from it. The plating on any piece of jewelry should never ever wear off that fast. Save your money and skip this piece of crap
1.0,"Pro: Cute print<br /><br />Cons: way too short and legs are so boxy/baggy. I am 5' 9"" and these pants were high water on me. Not flowy as fabric clung and felt cheap. Sent back. Do not recommend."
1.0,They were awful. I gave them to my granddaughters.
1.0,"stitches are very weak, stitching threads are not cut properly. very poor material"
1.0,Hat looks nothing like pictured item. It is also very cheaply made. Has cheap sticker for the word dive at about 1/4 of the size it shows in pictures. Should have been embroidered word not a sticker.
1.0,"Besides the fact that I could not get the voice to work, the knobs you press to make it talk  were uncomfortable for sensitive fingers to press.  Especially since this sort of thing would be handy for the elderly, one would think the manufacturer would make it more ergonomic."
1.0,They appear to be bigger than they really are on here but they are tiny. I’d send them back but that’s a waste of time.
1.0,What a crappy Wallet - lasted 1 month and the Zipper fell apart.<br />I would not advice anyone to buy this
1.0,Turned my piercings green and black.
1.0,"Don’t waste your money. Material feels cheap, and these leggings are definitely not squat proof as advertised."
1.0,"It keeps freezing and the numbers keep blinking back and forth. I don't know why it keeps doing that.<br />The one I got from Walgreens was better and lasted me 5 years.<br />This one, ... 2 month in and it's acting up! =/<br /><br />It's too late to return! Waste of $10! &#62;_&#60;"
1.0,"Couldn’t, too difficult"
1.0,I have only washed these 2 times and both times cold water on gentle cycle and every single seam has fraying (for lack of a better word) I can't wear these to my job which is a professional office setting.
1.0,"Lol, didn't look like the photo at all, don't waste your money."
1.0,I must've not read the description properky because I thought those were small polka dots and not actual holes in the shirt. That and the sucker was super small for a big boy 5X. The 5X was more like a 3X
1.0,low quality.  use as earrings only
1.0,It is too hard to Zip up and was way too small!
1.0,I ordered a large in one color and an XL in another. The XL I would say is a small. Awful!
1.0,Love the shirt but I ordered a 2x<br />I was sent a s<br />Now how does that work.<br />Really completely disapointed.
1.0,"These was a waste of money spent. Material is nothing like the picture represented, put it straight in the goodwill pile. Wouldn't recommend."
1.0,The back is broken off one earring :(
1.0,These things rusted and infected my ears.  Clearly not stainless steel.  I’d love my money back but it’s been past the 30 day mark.
1.0,"No style, bad quality, came all wet"
1.0,I used this for my wedding day and it did not work at all
1.0,"Cheaply made, no returns, company will not respond (China ) do not order from this company"
1.0,"This slip is sold as a LONG slip, but it's TOO SHORT!! I got what I paid for....what a sucker!!"
1.0,Flimsy...cheaply made.
1.0,Wasn't the material I was expecting.
1.0,Wasn't navy blue. It was black and orange. Square neck droops
1.0,It was a gift for my mother in law. She said the size was like a tent and can't wear it.
1.0,"They were initially very cute and the telescoping handle was really nice until...my 4 yo got his hands on it. About 3 minutes after giving it to him, he broke it like a twig. The other 2 held up against my almost 2 yo twins until the next day when another one broke on the handle."
1.0,Dont waste your money. Rolls down
1.0,"They broke after the third use, water goes in it all the time!"
1.0,Cheaply made. Reminds me more like my 3 year old’s costume jewelry.
1.0,This is for little girls too small for women. It does not fit.
1.0,This dress fit like a tent. And the lace was cheaply made. Not at all like the picture
1.0,"NOT AMOZONITE<br />These plugs are GREEN AVENTURINE.<br /><br />Incorrect description. Watch out.<br />The label on the bag even says ""gre"" which means they knew this was green aventurine and not amazonite."
1.0,In the picture these pants appeared to be yellow.  But instead they were more orange.
1.0,The hat is open on both ends and if you're bald it's see through like a scrunched up doily. They did not offer to replace it either!
1.0,Can see white underside of fabric through print. Such a shame bc it’s a pretty dress.
1.0,They break real easily so no extreme sports or swim in them
1.0,"Did not like the fit, waist tight and skirt made hips look to large."
1.0,"The colors I really liked<br />The material, especially the lining, feels cheap and will not unwrinklr"
1.0,This was nothing like the picture. This dress is very ugly and long in person and I even tried to have it altered to help fix it. Don’t even waste your time or money
1.0,I (husband) bought ) 4 pairs of these cargo sweatpants xlt and the first seemed ok maybe a little small .Made in Pakistan . Second we’re labeled and sized correctly . Made in Mtaylasia. Last order recd had one correct size and labeled correctly. Also from Malaysia The second pr were labeled xlt but were more like 3 or 4 xlarge<br />I returned to KIZE SIZE and now they are denying receiving and putting me off on Amazon<br />Basically you can’t be assured of a proper size when ordering these sweatpants!!!
1.0,"Had to return item. Product description & photo indicated that they were ""paddle back"", they were not. Very disappointing."
1.0,Absolutely gorgeous but I have tiny wrist so even with shortening it still was not a comfortable fit...clasp is not secure...almost lost my brand new fit bit several times THE CLASP IS NOT SECURE...decided to change bands for fear of losing it so sad because it was beautiful
1.0,Don’t waste the money in this product!
1.0,These rings were cute for about 2 days after only wearing them for a few hours each day they tarnished.  Again you get what you pay for.
1.0,"Material is thin, not real polar fleece, more like nightgown fabric. It doesn’t stand up on its own. The drawstring doesn’t stay tight, it’s totally useless and weighs the thin material down.  How hard is it to make a polar fleece red plaid gaiter? Can’t find one."
1.0,one of the earrings broke after wearing it only once
1.0,I got this for a gift. There is no charm!
1.0,"Striped pink dress is nothing like the photos. The fabric is odd and see through. My stitching and buttons were off centered. It was just terrible, I would not recommend to be purchased"
1.0,"Not at all as picture shows. Picture shows long , yet dress I recieved has a short front long back and the front has a v cut on the bottom. Sides have a v cut on each side . NOT same dress on Amazon picture . Do disappointing"
1.0,"Didn’t see in the pictures that this glasses have a tiny print in the glass that is not removable. I Have no  idea, how you are supposed to use it with it. So uncomfortable and it feels like you don’t see clear."
1.0,I’m a sausage in a casing. The material is just crappy and it’s tight. Returned. I’m size 12.
1.0,Used for 4 months
1.0,This belt doesn't even look like leather.  It looks more like plastic.  I'm very disappointed.  I will certainly be returning it.
1.0,I love the look and sentiment  of the ring but it turned two of my daughters finger green.  I bought three and I don’t think the other daughter wears hers.  I was not allowed to return but it took a month to see the quality.  I would not recommend this ring.
1.0,The package (which was a brown envelope) & earrings were mangled & ruined when I received them. I took the earrings to a jeweler to see if they could put the stone in another setting. The jeweler told me they weren't real garnet even though that's what they were advertised as.
1.0,"This mask is not long enough-I wish the dimensions would be published for these things. The wire on the nasal bridge is insufficient to hold the mask against the face-as with others, exhalation fogs glasses. There is NO stretch in the mask, only the ear loops. The ear loops have adjustment locks though"
1.0,Piece of crap came late came broken worked 1 time and hasn't since dont waist your time
1.0,Wish it was of a better quality
1.0,Waste of time and money. This doesn’t rack the ball right . There’s gap in the middle.
1.0,This shoe literally fell apart while my daughter had it on at dinner. She doesn’t even crawl or walk so its no reason this shoe should have been able to fall apart so quickly. Waste of money and embarrassing moment.
1.0,Runs small and cheaply made
1.0,Too small and quality is cheap. Pleas post your size chart . Very displeased with the product.
1.0,Way to short!
1.0,Broke as I opened the plastic wrapping. The clasp is far too small for the earlobe
1.0,Up a size as these come small. My daughter was so excited to wear these today for the first time but after 2 hours they are falling apart. Very sad how poorly made these are.
1.0,Ordered two pairs. Both came apart within a week.
1.0,Very pourly made!!!! It looks like a child cut them for them to be made. Doesn't look right or fit right either
1.0,The picture is very misleading I expected the item to be how the photo is and the crystal look.as if they were all added In at one time like confetti not color by color. They look ugly in person. The packaging was good .
1.0,Attached to watch just fine but after an hour of wearing it one link fell off.  Price was cheap and quality demonstrated why.
1.0,Horrible product!
1.0,"It’s a normal kids cape, but the Velcro on the neck is for an adult size neck & doesn’t adjust down."
1.0,Poor quality in fabric. I could bet after the first wash it will be garbage. Returned.
1.0,TOO SMALL...XL! I am upset that this Jacket Size is a XL for a Jr. TEEN...NOT A WOMAN SIZE XL!!! I gave it to my Daughter!
1.0,Not for everyday wear.
1.0,That was siE so incorrectly it was actually a XS.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:5a1565a504afac544ddf2313598e9acd]] The sewing and seam allowances are uneven and then there's a ripple on 1/4 of the hats trim. Not typical quality for under the nile products. Returning.
1.0,This is NOT a wrsp around. I didn't notice they had sewn the waist area shut! I will be returning without trying it on. EXTREMELY disappointed!!
1.0,I was so excited to get my hoodie. When it arrived I was very disappointed in the overall look. The material on the outer edge was curled and the sewing was poor. When I tried it on it did not wear or look like the picture.
1.0,My husband bought this for me. I loved it until I noticed the small metal embellishments were disappearing and then the straps across the sides broke. I did not carry anything large or heavy but bag lasted about two months. Now too late to return.
1.0,"These shoes broke the first time i wore them. The heel literally broke off..... while i was out in public. I never write reviews, but this one was necessary. Do not buy."
1.0,It fell apart as soon as I tried to put it on for the first time it's junk
1.0,Shirt came with a bleach stain.
1.0,Do not buy
1.0,"Bought one of these things nearly a decade ago, decent and definitely got a sturdy pocket watch.  Only problem?  The battery that powers this thing is apparently only found in China (haven't found one in the US, UK, or EU in over 9 years of searching).  So enjoy your pocket watch while it retains charge because once the battery depletes it's just a fancy paperweight.<br /><br />Necklace was nice, ended up swapping the chain for something classier.  Ring is ""1 size fits some.  Doesn't fit you?  Too bad."""
1.0,White trim came stained. Runs a little small. I’m 5’1 140 and medium is pretty form fitting. Also s trying inside to tie the robe together from the inside would be nice. It’s cute enough.
1.0,Clean off the part that goes in your ear I got an infection from them
1.0,Much larger than appears and its heavy. Returned.
1.0,Head hole was too small or my brain is way too big!
1.0,Broke when trying to remove it had to super glue it back together just so I could wear it. Bought another one and the SAME thing happened! It’s super cute but not worth it.
1.0,The picture is not the exact item o received. The fabric not flowy at all. The return process is horrible! I contacted them last Monday! Still no return label. They just keep asking me irrelevant questions.
1.0,I ordered an XL (I typically fit a large) to be safe.  The XL size is the equivalent of a small. Fail !!
1.0,received broke. They were so cute.
1.0,The white is completely see through.
1.0,No as expected...very small size n very uncomfortable
1.0,"The buckle looks nice, but just doesn't hold the belt.  It is constantly loosening and requires tightening.  Terrible product.<br /><br />NOT recommended."
1.0,Broke within a couple months. This belt is not of good material.
1.0,Too small for a 12yr old boy.
1.0,Turned my neck green 👎🏽
1.0,They did not fit at all.
1.0,The way it looked on the page.
1.0,Very small lot smaller than pictures
1.0,Unfortunately only a few strands of my BABY hair ! was caught in the chain and broke immediately.. beutiful but not worth the money ..  also chain started to changed  colors after only wearing it for three day’s.. really liked it 😭 sorry could post a photo be used I got mad
1.0,"What in the actual heck is this ""sweater"" made for? It sure isn't humans... The shape doesn't fit anyone I've had try it on, the sleeves point in two entirely wrong directions, the neck is horrible. What would've been wrong with just making a sweater with a wide neck, LIKE THE PHOTOS SHOW? Utterly terrible. Will never buy this brand again."
1.0,Son muy demasiado anchos sinceramente no son de mi agrado no los recomiendo
1.0,"A link in one broke after wearing ONE day, and started catching on everything."
1.0,One sock was shorter than the other by almost 2in. The sock that was longer fit great.
1.0,Chain broke after wearing once and you can not use it for real! Wish I would have bought from another company
1.0,item runs very small.  I purchased a size larger than I would normally wear based on other reviews however size was still a least 2 sizes to small.
1.0,Did not want an art project.  Online looked put together.  Was not put together.
1.0,Not very clear lenses
1.0,I order this item and all I got was a small ring not any of the necklaces I am beyond pissed.
1.0,Returned this. I could not get it to wrap around without cutting into my arm pits.
1.0,"This is one of the hardest things I have ever used for chnaging. The fact that it uses microfiber makes it even harder to use, it sticks to the skin and there are no pockets to manipulate the clothes underneath the robe leaving to do everything outside of the robe or sort of lift it and kinda revealing everything underneath. If it was made with the same material as a towel it would be a lot easier to use"
1.0,"As other reviewers stated, it was too large. I am 5' 2&#34; and approx. 128 lbs and it was huge. It came down mid-calf on me, though on the model, it is mid-thigh. All that made it look frumpy. I returned it today."
1.0,Horrible!!!
1.0,These are itchy and aren't the same thing as the ones on TT the fit is mediocre at best. It actually made my butt look flat... I have a pretty big/round butt! Waste of $$
1.0,"Muy pequeño y con un olor terrible, muy fuerte, lo devolvi."
1.0,"it does not stay wound up well, I think I may return it"
1.0,The item arrived and very wrinkled and not at all like it was pictured.  Fabric was way too thin and obviously wrinkled easily.  Didn't even wear it and promptly returned it.
1.0,Worst product
1.0,These will not stay up on face. They slide right down
1.0,"Disappointed, the shirt looked nothing like the picture. It fit more like a t-shirt than a tunic styled shirt."
1.0,I n ever got this. I did  get 2 white suede belts they are great. Iam in nj not florida I just got 3 pairs of shoes from florida which I just sent back they were all to large. thank you
1.0,Incredibly fragile and the size is too small even for my 8 year old sister.
1.0,"Could not get the screws out to adjust the band.  Also, the band did not engage the fitbit properly and I was afraid it fall off."
1.0,I had to get it repaired...be aware!
1.0,Literally my second one to break within a week. Bad construction. Leaving a review for the inconvenience caused. Looked cute for the three days they each lasted. Very disappointed
1.0,The fabric and sizing is not what I expected. I will be sending this back
1.0,I really should have made sure that I looked at the description of the material before ordering. I don't know why Amazon even allows these WISH vendors to sell clothes on their site. I ordered from this vendor in an XL and another vendor in a L. Now the fit is not that bad but the material makes it seem more like costume and you CAN NOT wear any type of shapewear at all. I'm 5'6 and 182 pounds. I like wearing shapewear to smooth things out as I have cellulite in my thighs but you can see every lump and bump in this dress. I wish the material was cotton/spandex then it would have been perfect!!! PLEASE STOP ALLOWING VENDORS TO SELL NIGHTGOWN/BATHING SUIT MATERIAL IN CLOTHING!!!!
1.0,The sizing is misrepresented.
1.0,Screw that hold the Ford F-150 came out and lost it. This was after only having it on my keys for about 2 weeks. Now I just have the ring with no f150. I'm not hard on my keys so I expected more from this.
1.0,"Tight across the shoulder blades and arms, no stretch in material."
1.0,"Even though this bag was bigger than it appeared, I was willing to re-purpose it to use as a mini bookbag...that is until I noticed what appeared to be mold on the handle of the bag.  It also smelled like it had mold on it as well.  It appears as though it was wet at some point.  Too bad, very disappointed!!"
1.0,way too small.  I am a large and I bought a 3x and it barely fit a toe
1.0,"Was really excited for these, ordered my usual leggings size and the VERY first squat they ripped right on the seam. Super cute though and they feel like nice quality."
1.0,Very expensive for such cheap cheap everything. Like dollars store toys not worth anything
1.0,It was dull and quickly lost all of luster and is now more of a brownish pewter.
1.0,I was sent the wrong size.  They took so long to ship the shorts that my return window was closed.  Even though they sent a size I didn’t order.  It’s way to big.  Material is very CHEAP.  I would NOT RECOMMEND.
1.0,SCRATCHED WHEN RECEIVED. BADLY MADE. NOTH WORTH IT.<br />  DONT UNDERSTAND WHERE THESE REVIEWS COME FROM. THEY ARE NOT ACCURATE.
1.0,"It was really cute, but I would have needed to order up 2 sizes. It is also made of the shiny polyester material"
1.0,"It also broke easily - but it fell from it's wall hanger. It's cute, just tiny"
1.0,"The frame broke at the top, and I didn't even drop them."
1.0,Broke within 10minutes of wearing it. Do not buy
1.0,"Do not buy this item...it looks NOTHING like the item pictured except for the color!  It is cheaply made and though they offer different sizes, it comes &#34;one size fits all&#34; if you're a size &#34;0&#34;!  I will never purchase ANY clothing on Amazon that comes from CHINA!"
1.0,Flower jibbitz fell apart on day 1 of installation.  Poor quality!
1.0,do not purchase this product dirty trash
1.0,Doesnt so anything.  Cheap and works like dollar store sunglasses
1.0,"Material very thin, so much so that when I put it on for the first time, the strap broke."
1.0,"Dress is poorly made and much longer than depicted, not mini at all!!!. It is very matronly, not striking at all as shown on model. I would attempt to return it but it took very long and many emails to receive it and I tried returning  an out of the country product before and it was very unsuccessful. I will no longer purchase products such as these."
1.0,"Wore two ties, broke two ties. I literally don’t even know how."
1.0,Horrible.
1.0,"These are so weird. In an effort to shape the butt, these are tight around the upper thigh making it look like I’m wearing old lady panties that give me panty lines. I’m relatively thin but like to wear shapewear to smooth things out in dresses and slacks. These don’t do that for me at all. Disappointed!!"
1.0,La durabilidad que menciona no es buena
1.0,"STINK! STINK! Eyes watering bad STINK of chemical from manufacturing.  Don't know if wearing these will melt my legs off, its' so strong!"
1.0,"I received this item today, the holder is broken where clip is inserted. I can take a photo of crack if you like."
1.0,this product did not fit  yo small no way to return  will not order again
1.0,bad they faded in just 2days
1.0,"An amazingly comfortable shirt.  It was the perfect length for what I needed.  The fabric felt silky smooth and soft on my skin.  The fit was perfect.  Why only a one star review?  Because I, like other reviewers, was unlucky enough to receive a shirt with large hole at the seems on both hips.  There were also a few holes scattered in parts of the seams.  I really liked the tunic.  But I am very hestitant to try another one."
1.0,Horribles
1.0,Super cute...while they lasted. Broke after only wearing 4 times. The back snapped in half and now they're in the trash.
1.0,"I didn't expect much, given the price point. However, I wore these to work yesterday, and again today and one of the bracelets has already fallen apart. I have a desk job, nothing crazy going on here."
1.0,Too small... color isn't as vibrant as the picture... as well as the bottom is completely see through.
1.0,This dress is purple not gray
1.0,Horrible. Crown arrived broken.
1.0,It did not fit properly on me.  It was not flattering.
1.0,"This bracelet broke after the first time I wore it.  Terrible purchase, not happy with the idea that any product would be sold that was so poorly made."
1.0,I didn't like it very much
1.0,way too small one or two fit kinda but most of the pack was too small. doesn’t really stretch either
1.0,"Really small sized ,"
1.0,Material was not what I expected.  It gave me itching.
1.0,This hat did not come with any of the accessories as described. Only the hat came. No candy or anything else. Not as described
1.0,Do not expect anything that looks like the photo.  Looks more like a piece of concrete with green paint chipping off.
1.0,Terrible quality. It was scratched and the color is inconsistent.  It looks like something that has been laying around unanswered drawer for about a decade.
1.0,"This is a short caftan, don't waist your money. Not as pictured."
1.0,Terrible! I know these weren’t that expensive but I would’ve liked my daughter to get more than I use out of them. All of the top front of the shoe wore off in less than two hours while she was at preschool. I understand kids are hard on things but Geeze.
1.0,"I normally wear xl to 1x tops, but I bought xxl to make sure it fit.  NOT!  Too small."
1.0,Would not recommend these sock front stitching hurts my toes too thick.
1.0,Did not match photo in size or design
1.0,Very disappointing all the stones fell out and I’m 4 days over doing my return
1.0,"I was related for this shirt, it arrived too late for my event. Wouldnt have worn it anyway.  Very shoddy and overpriced"
1.0,Not of good quality. Easily broken. Can't be handled by kids.
1.0,Wrong description they send me the wrong image of the saint I got the Virgin Mary instead of the saint described.
1.0,"I would not suggest anyone purchase this product.  Upon arrival, the product had an odor that wouldn't go away even after washing.  Bad. Bad."
1.0,Very verybvery small
1.0,Just fair warning what you see is not what you get and item may be wrong size ordered these for the green plugs and it did not come with also ordered 8mm and they were packaged as such but not the were around 4mm did like the white but useless because of the size not worth the headache
1.0,If you are plus size do not buy if they had it in 5x it may have fit but as someone who wears a 3x loosely it was a huge nope pissed away money on this bc they didnt even get with me on returning it at all so I gave it away :(
1.0,"This comes in two parts - the fabric and the chain. When I eventually got it on, I felt like I was basically wearing a fabric napkin. Cheap material that is thin. I did love the chain but the rest of the dress is pointless."
1.0,I looked at the sizing chart and ordered what i thought would fit me. Wayyyyy to small and the fabric was very thin.
1.0,Super disappointed....Broke 1 hour after I put it on...Very cute but cheaply made :/
1.0,"the product I received is made from a different fabric the pictures. Also, it has a banded cuff, and is way shorter than pictured. Not at all satisfied. in top of all that, it took a long time to get."
1.0,"i don't know if this mask is either too small, not proportioned for a normal face, or both.<br />when i put this mask on, the eye holes want to be on my forehead and the nose strip kept riding up and digging into my eyes. i could barely pull this mask down into it's intended position. I have a smaller than average head size, too.  this mask definitely will not fit the average adult."
1.0,I have not used this product due to the zipper be defective.
1.0,like the design but way to small. I ordered a XXL and it fits like a medium
1.0,POORLY CONSTRUCTED.
1.0,"Tension bar/wire very thin and bends real easy.  Once bent it leaves a space between it and the show bar.  With the tension bar bent, leaving NO tension, Collar Pin Tie Clip is useless.  First attempt to use, tension bar bent.  Poorly made.  Cheap quality.  Absolute JUNK!  Didn't even bother sending back because of the low amount paid.  Not worth my time and effort.  I highly recommend buying in local mens department or men's store where you can look, handle and feel what you intend to buy.  Tension bar needs to be thick metal that puts out tension against the opposing bar.  Don't waste your time and money on this poorly constructed item!!!"
1.0,"Took all four on vacation and barely got home with the last one not falling apart.  Very flimsy, adjustment doesn't hold, plastic fasteners broke.  Would not purchase again."
1.0,when I received this it was torn can I get my money back for this.
1.0,"Cute although the quality of the fabric was like a cheap windbreaker. Didn’t use it because the strap attached to the handle was useless. When held by the strap loop, the umbrella handle extended making it NOT compact for carrying around. Returned. Design inside was cute and vibrant. So if you’re going to just throw in a bag and not carry around by the strap, AND you don’t mind paying $18 for something that should cost $6. Then you might be happy."
1.0,I received this watch which is the color and by looking is awesome but one of the needle is broken and moving freely. I would like to ask for refund or exchange.
1.0,"This bracelet (even tho it's 'stretch)"" is too small even for a child's hand!  I'd return it but it'd cost more than what I paid for the bracelet to pay for postage fees - what of waste of $11.99"
1.0,"While the material is OK, it’s NOT as described.<br />I read reviews as I usually do to be sure before ordering something so I felt like I might be ok ordering this…. Here’s a list of why I give it one star.<br /><br />- It is not made from cotton material. at. all.<br />- Does not look like the picture (aside from what the text is supposed to say) - the color, text format and size.<br />- although the description says ‘oversized’ and I even ordered an XXL specifically, this shirt fits more like a medium. A rather tight and very stretchy medium.<br />- I don’t hate this shirt and it was not expensive, but I do hate that I didn’t get even close to what I was expecting (PAID FOR).<br />- And to add the cherry to this already mediocre cake, when I clicked the link to see if I could at least exchange it, the shirt is no longer listed at all. Womp womp"
1.0,"I give this negative star. As soon as my son tried it on he started crying. I thought he just didnt want anything on his feet. But he was really crying like he was hurting. I took it off, turns out there was a pin inside the shoe that was pricking his foot. Oh his feet was gray because of the coloring residue. Very crappy. I guess you get your money's worth. Cheaply made. Im just going to shell out $60 and buy the one made in U S A. This one was made and shipped from China."
1.0,This is way too small. The sizes are not accurate!
1.0,Didn’t fit as advertised. Much too small
1.0,"My nose ring is 20g, these definitely aren't. They are very thin and flimsy. Will be returning them."
1.0,"I wouldn't buy this again.. It's larger that my wrist, therefore it will not lay correctly and bends..<br />There are other better choices to buy than this one.. Looks appealing but does not lay right on the wrist, like the picture.."
1.0,"Save yourself some money and go buy some Elmer’s glue, mix it with a little water and use it to seal your cork. That is all this product is!"
1.0,Super cute but description says it’s a 2 piece set and I only received the top.
1.0,Wayyyy too small! Not true to size
1.0,I will never prefer this again. The color rubbed off within the first 24 hours I wore it. To show the white band underneath. Not happy whatsoever.
1.0,Super Uncomfortable!!!
1.0,The quality of the fabric is so terrible I wouldn't even use it for doll clothes. I'm returning this.
1.0,Didn't get to use them... they ripped when I was putting them on. I wouldn't recommend.
1.0,"Stones where missing, not happy with the quality"
1.0,Falling apart after taking out of the package.
1.0,The size is an XXL. I am a size 4 and it fits me way ok snug. Very misleading on the size. Skip it not worth it
1.0,"Foggy, clammy, creepy, slightly suffocating.  Disappointed!  I had hoped they would be a great choice for teaching, allowing young children to see my face.  The fit is comfortable, quality is fine.  But the effect of the plastic is not what I had hoped."
1.0,DO NOT BUY!!!<br /><br />This is cheap plastic. Piece sent to me is not the same as the picture description.
1.0,The bottom of the diamond pokes the bottom of the belly button and is uncomfortable
1.0,Necklace was missing and earrings were broken
1.0,Cheap and don’t stay in. Don’t waste your $$$
1.0,Very sad to give this product one star. I've had VERY VERY few problems with any of my purchases here on Amazon. I was ONE day passed the 30 day return policy and I look down to see I'm missing 3 stones. I had contemplated returning the moment I received this ring because it did appear to have some cloudy and unstable stones. My bad...should not have hesitated. ***No fault of Amazon***...truly the manufacturer and/or craftsmanship it's just plain poor quality!!!!
1.0,Not made for long torso 😡
1.0,really it is the cutest necklace. however the chain broke when i took it out of the package. very dissapointed.
1.0,They look old. The material is not soft at all. Do not buy this.
1.0,Not true to size !! Ugh !!
1.0,"This product had such faint numbers, I had to return it. They claimed it a was a feature (""soft lit""), but it was unreadable."
1.0,"El vestido es espantoso, parece más bien una túnica de presidiario, los detalles en blanco son pintados, la tela es de un hilo grueso, no me lo pondré jamás ."
1.0,"I lost one blue stone within the first month. Then lost a second a few months after that. I only wear it during the day, and dont wear it into the shower. Otherwise it is a nice bracelet."
1.0,Smaller than expected and besides that itchy and uncomfortable material content.
1.0,The price was great. The color beautiful. The fit was great. I have never ever washed satin and it fade onto my other items in the washer with it.
1.0,Fell apart the first time I wore it.
1.0,Polarization stinks.  They do not stop night time glare at all they just change it the color to yellow.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,This watch has no real features. No Bluetooth no wifi. I should have read more reviews. My daughter played with it once!!
1.0,"I ordered my usual size and they were so small that I sent them back.  I guess I should learn my lesson and not order clothes or shoes from Chinese manufacturers.  Everything has been too small, even when I ordered a larger size than I usually wear."
1.0,Cardigan arrived with holes in the sleeve. Buyers beware
1.0,I will no longer purchase bags from BHFO the seller is selling 2nd quality bags at low prices & they won't hold up to normal use. They do not like to replace their defective items and want you to contact the manufacturer. Not good business practices.
1.0,I bought this hat for my mom but the band was really tight around her head.
1.0,Cheap. Returned.
1.0,Looks so cheap and the edges are not smooth so it's uncomfortable to wear.
1.0,Paper thin...ok for a swimsuit coverup
1.0,Extremely thin and shorter than expected
1.0,the wind comes along and my hat blows off!  gave it as a gift and my friend wont wear it !  the so called flex hat is marginal.  its hard for a person who gets the hat as gift to send it back!
1.0,Dont even bother.
1.0,This dress is huge.....i am returning It! Bought a large and I'm 5'8 190lbs.....
1.0,"Buye Beware.  Product received was not the same as pictured.  I received an obviously lower quality product.  Could barely read the lettering,  fabric appeared completely different from pictured,  and sleeves were not shaped the same way."
1.0,bigger than you’d expect
1.0,These might be a medium.
1.0,"I'm 5'11 and curvy with a large chest, I normally wear a size 14 dress size. I ordered an XL (as recommended based on past purchases). The top was tight and ended up being MUCH shorter than depicted, and the openings of the bottoms were tight as well but the fabric itself was thin and loose. This accentuated bulges that otherwise don't exist on me."
1.0,Rusted in a week.
1.0,I have washed it but it still makes my skin itch. It's super soft and looks good but it's itchy.
1.0,"I bought two of these. The ones I bought for my son seem to fit, but the ones I bought for my daughter are too large, even after checking the sizing chart and ordering accordingly. And be warned, they have an AWFUL chemical smell. It made me literally sick. I washed the shoes to try to get the smell out, but it didn’t help much. I ended up having to put the shoes outside because of how bad they smelled. I’ll update if/when I finally get the smell out and the kids can try out the shoes."
1.0,The imagery is correct but the color is not the same. They obviously obtained a bunch of Walmart tshirts and just sewed them short. The sleeves are not as pictured and it doesn’t have a rough cut. Anyone can just take a long sleeve and hem it. Thanks for nothing. Returned product.
1.0,Elastic is too tight and I’m 100 lbs.  this is an issue with too many pj bottoms.
1.0,Too small and way too flimsy. Too small for a four year old head
1.0,The shirt is not all cotton.  The sleeves are made with a different material.  Not what I expected.
1.0,I will be returning this product as soon as I get the information to how to do that..
1.0,"Product came damaged. They ziptied the Water Bottle into the side pocket where the water bottle is supposed to go, which caused a hole. You could tell that the bag was cheaply made. Will be returning."
1.0,Huge. Looks like kids dress up earrings.
1.0,Not able to write a review at this time.
1.0,"One of the most important considerations is the quality of the seams.  After no more than three washings, the pants split at the back seam.  Shoddy workmanship.  There are hundreds of shorts to chose from.  I would not buy these again.  Try Hanes, I bought a pair and they are well made."
1.0,"It might be a good quality T-shirt, but I'll never buy it because St.Petersburg is misspelled.<br />It should be СТ. ПЕТЕРБУРГ.<br /><br />I see where the confusion comes from - the lower case P in Russian looks exactly the same as lower case N in English.<br /><br />Guys, you could at least Google it first!"
1.0,"didn, t work', not your fault."
1.0,These were like microscopic...waited FOREVER for them to come and they were so tiny they couldn't even be used almost looked like fake lip ring for a doll...I threw them in the garbage immediately
1.0,"I was disappointed with this purchase because it claims it fits small. I purchased a size up at their recommendation and have an outfit that is too big. BUT THE WORST part of the purchase is that this material, claimed to be &#34;thin cotton linen&#34; is actually 100% polyester according to the manufacturer tag on the inside of the pants. DO NOT BUT. It is polyester made in China. Shame on this company/reseller."
1.0,The belt came damage and wasn't as easy to use as I thought.
1.0,Not for kids. They are adult size.
1.0,They broke after I used them once.
1.0,Too short terrible quaility
1.0,Say's it has Saftey carbon filter's. Nope no filter's. Don't waste your time
1.0,You can see 100 percent through the white leggings.
1.0,"Don't waste your money I hate this product.. You don't get what you see in the picture and the beans in the sock is all over the place and only your heel gets warm because the beans settle at the bottom, your toes remain cold.. Don't waste your money."
1.0,"I bought a larger size because I read that sizes run small.  I usually wear a medium but purchased a large. It fit but shrunk with the first washing, thus it is now too tight across the back.  The dress faded terribly as well.  The photo is after one washing.  I did not wash the bonnet, just the dress."
1.0,The waist down of this dress fits very well. The color is beautiful. It's a gorgeous dress made of great material but...<br /><br />The top half is crazy. The shoulders are crazy wide and the underarm scoops into the body of the dress in a really weird way. The gathering at the left shoulder shown in the picture is much less distinct than it appears. If the top half of the dress was sized down two or three times it would fit very nicely. Will definitely be returning.
1.0,I tried to place them in the shoelace holes and it was impossible. Two of them broke while I was trying to pull them through the hole. Will never buy these again
1.0,Fit was horrible. Quality was horrible. Wrinkle like waves on a ocean
1.0,"The driving factor were the pockets. However, this skirt looks like it was made from a sofa. The color does not match any of my blazers & vests. The sizing is a bit large as well. I’m still in shock . Was expecting a business skirt not a .......I really don’t know what to call it."
1.0,"Paper thin, not nice to the touch, ok looking but omg over priced, $10 should be a fair price."
1.0,"Bought these for my daughter for Christmas. She’s an athletic build, quite active in sports. The fabric used on the arms has ZERO stretch and has an acrylic-type plastic feeling to it. The top was also way too small - her arms barely fit in the sleeves. She wore the pajamas for about an hour (I think just as a thank you to me) but then had to change. Definitely size up for a fitted look, do two or three sizes up if you want them to be loose fitting."
1.0,Order smaller size the dress runs big
1.0,"I’ve tried two pairs of these, and the second pair I went a size larger. No matter what, they started tearing at the crotch very quickly.<br /><br />Which sucks because the material feels good, they look great, and they stretch nicely. They just don’t stretch enough, I guess.<br /><br />It’s weird because most of this brand’s other jeans are real sturdy and stretchy."
1.0,Smelled weird. Can't wear it.
1.0,"A bit of a waste of money.  A bit tight and roll down, don’t bother....just put pants on your lil one and save some bucks."
1.0,Not comfortable for my feet. Have arthritis in toes and these shoes really hurt my second toes. May be fine for people with normal feet.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY! There is no way that anyone will convince me that this necklace or pendant is sterling silver! The entire necklace arrived black! I have tried using liquid jewelry cleaner, a jewelry cleaning/polishing cloth, and even a mild soap, and it is still black! Plus, the clasp actually sticks to a magnet! I am so disappointed and upset! I purchased this necklace for a ""turtle lover"" for a Christmas gift, and now it's too late to purchase anything else! SHAME ON YOU!!"
1.0,Stupid.  Waste of money
1.0,I got the gold color and the champagne color looking to match my bridesmaids dresses. The gold one turned out dark orange! It was not gold to me at all. And the champagne one was more tan than champagne but still pretty if you're looking for something more tan. Returned both as they did not match the colors I was looking for. I wish the description said that the gold was dark orange. Wouldn't have even wasted my time buying then.
1.0,"Did not receive polished stainless steel, received some kind of weird matte silver marked s. steel. Very unhappy. My husband wanted the shiny set that's in the picture."
1.0,The design rubs right off of the swim suit after one wear.
1.0,Didnt even cover half my Boob ordered my size just way to small.
1.0,This product is cheaply made. It only lasted a month and fell apart.
1.0,Total junk stones fell out in two days
1.0,Way too small. I wear small to medium top and this was way too small I mean I didn't even fit through
1.0,"Not 18oz, more like 16oz. And the sides are thin and rather flimsy."
1.0,These would work best for a child under 12. There’s no way these are an adult mitten.
1.0,Bought a 3xl I ware a xl fits like a medium the arms fit like a xs the material is very thin. Very unhappy was planning on this for my cruise coming up.
1.0,The product is not very good its disappointing. the clip wont hold it
1.0,"Zipper for the boy was ripped, quality is so bad it ruined my gender reveal 😪"
1.0,En la descripción del artículo dice que los lentes son de marca Guess pero cuando lo recibí me di cuenta que no fue así los lentes son G by Guess. No lo describieron bien y no me quedó contento con eso
1.0,"The one star goes for comfort I will give it that but everything else about it is trash. The material is poorly stitched together, it also runs very small, also the order was the wine color and it came to be a very ugly pink color with visuals of the red fabric inside. Although this product looks comfy and elegant, don't waist your money it definitely not worth it."
1.0,Somewhat small and definitely too clingy. Every unflattering spot is broadcasted in this shirt
1.0,"I ordered these sandals with high hopes!  When they arrived,  I was surprised by all the little rubber things on the sole, which looked comfortable.  But it's crucial my shoes have arch support & these have literally none.  So I sent them back.  These are advertised as having arch support,  but as a warning to those in my boat.. it is  completely flat where your arch is."
1.0,The white part came off and the backs were too loose for small children.
1.0,Nice pattern but shows too much bottom cheek.
1.0,"Broke first day, in less than 8 hrs."
1.0,It turned black the next day
1.0,Very hard to adjust
1.0,watch always falls off. Hook is flawed
1.0,speechless
1.0,I would not purchase again. The colour of the jean is not as advertised in the vibrant blue image on amazon. The actual product has a more faded or washed out look. The fabric is highly stretch material. Lacks the typical quality of Just USA jeans - which I've had before. Very disappointinting purchase.
1.0,As a pandora replacement you get what you pay for. It would not stay clamped and the silver finish wore off and turned brass within two months of my wife wearing it. If you want pandora quality spend pandora money LESSON LEARNED!
1.0,Returned as all 3 handles were scratched since they are painted silver...
1.0,Nothing like the picture did not like the style
1.0,VERY LONG...almost like a dress and very thin fabric.  I returned it.
1.0,"If you touch the band at the right angle, you will loose your watch.  I have tried to like this band as it looks great but the watch will come off easily."
1.0,"Loved it for it's unique design, material, but the sizes run small."
1.0,This is a child's pant.
1.0,Once you wash it the fabric gets messed up.
1.0,"Sizing is terrible, almost child sized. It is not a t-shirt. It’s a terrible stretchy kind of material. Hated it."
1.0,This band is not expensive but also not good quality . Not for everyday used. Get something else
1.0,they should have different sizes
1.0,"Lens started to peel? Very bad quality, never got them wet and my son only used them a handful of times."
1.0,"TOO SMALL. PLEASE MAKE/OFFER EXTENDED SIZES. yes, it stretches to fit over your hand but in order for it to not cut off circulation, you have to have a tiny wrist."
1.0,My son never got to wear them. The goggles broke before we unpacked them.
1.0,"Trash. I hope you read the comments unlike I did. It’s made out of shiny polyester, and if you look closer to the details, I should have noticed. It’s not a t-shirt type of material that it appears to be in the picture. It’s shiny, it’s see-through and you have to pay to send it back unless its damaged. It’s false advertising at its finest. They snatch you in with a generic picture, but it’s all in the fine print.<br /><br />Do not order this thing, you will be disappointed."
1.0,"Color online is misleading. The blue that looks like periwinkle blue online, actually looks like a much more saturated sky blue. Pills quickly after one wash. But is comfortable"
1.0,"Way too small on me, it fit like a kid's shirt. I ended up returning."
1.0,I want my money back
1.0,Waste of money. Too dark compared to my own teeth—looked crazy and too costume-like.
1.0,"Demoro mucho tiempo después de la fecha estimada para recibirlo y, además demasiado grande. A pesar de no poderlo usar cuando lo necesitaba ni siquiera me sirvió."
1.0,DOES NOT fit jeans 👖.
1.0,I like the style of this purse especially the handle. The problem is that it's difficult to open it because the twist lock is not long enough to grasp it in order to turn it.
1.0,Began to lose its shiny finish and now it looks tarnished. Have only worn it for a month or two and already ruined.
1.0,Look beautiful BUT wore them 5 times and they broke.
1.0,Too small. I bought this for me and it was too too small.<br />I gave it to my 5 year old brother and he liked it so I won't return it.
1.0,"It's a very tight fit so keep in mind that it runs small. It's also a very weird texture and makes a lot of noise when you walk. Not sure what &#34;Pima Cotton&#34; is but based on these pants it's terrible, especially for $80. The pants were returned."
1.0,The dress is huge I ordered a small. It’s baggy and not tight like the photos and it’s super long. Terrible material quality and I am going to return it and want my money back. Thank you!
1.0,"They're sized for a child and don't seem like they'd be very warm. The inside is a thin material lining and the ""knit"" isn't very thick... I wouldn't recommend purchasing these unless they're for a costume."
1.0,Cheap looking and tiny.  Not made for woman as described.  For children only.
1.0,got the jacket in and took it out of the bag and the red from the hood bled onto the white on the arm's and back. So pink spots all over it.<br />Waiting on a reply from seller but its been two days and no word on a return or refund.
1.0,Too small. I ordered 2x...got a medium
1.0,Led lights failed after two weeks. My daughter doesn’t want to wear them because the lights are broken. Waste of money.
1.0,It broke the first time I wore it. Very cheap material
1.0,It doesn’t fit true to size I know for a fact that I am not bigger than a 2X I should’ve got a 4X because they run small I normally wear a large  it was too small at the top so I’m going to send a bag and I’ll probably be order a bigger size it’s cute tho .
1.0,"cute, but the 5x fits like a Large, not even 1X"
1.0,Don't buy it.  Waste of money.  Material scratches skin.  1 wash and it lost its form.....shrinks
1.0,It's says XL but it's not
1.0,These were too short even on the little 4 year old
1.0,"These are so small, I bought them for a grown man, big guy and they barely fit my 13 year old with a size 7 shoe size."
1.0,I bought the watch 6 months ago and used it few times. Now it has stopped working. I cannot even return the product. Not a good buy.
1.0,They make you pay for returns not real visible in there listing. Emailed them with my concern and they did nothing- NOT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE. Also very rare on Amazon !!
1.0,Product is misleading. It is not solid .925 silver because it has lost its plating. Also it has had 3 cz stones fall out. It dulls fast and loses its luster.
1.0,I sent back so I could get bigger size they sent same size back
1.0,ah no picture
1.0,Very poor quality...very
1.0,"The fit is horrible. There’s not enough length in the crotch area. Therefore, the pants just fall down in the back."
1.0,Shoes did not appear to be new and the box was in pieces when it arrived.
1.0,Fue un regalo y quede mal su mano quedo totalmente manchada con  la pintura azul el mismo día que lo usó.
1.0,The pack came with shortage quantity (not 100 pcs). Super thin and so poor quality that I rather do my work without wearing this gloves on
1.0,Not at all distressed. And it was not a relaxed fit.
1.0,I received a jewelry box but there were NO earrings. Empty box.
1.0,So much for family pictures this weekend. This is advertised as red plaid. It is a burnt orange color and poorly made.
1.0,This dress was not new. It was used. It had no tags and smelled faintly like smoke. I would not recommend buying this dress. It had a used kleenex in the pocket. Gross.
1.0,"I ordered and extra large. I’m a size 10-12 in women’s, it wouldn’t even go over a centimeter of my butt lol"
1.0,The hat is very small and did not fit my husband’s head.  The company only offered me a 20% refund.  I will not buy from this company again.  Very disappointing.
1.0,"I had a feeling it would be tiny and cheap looking, but was still hopeful. It is basically invisible on my neck and the chain feels like it would rip after one wear. Returning."
1.0,NOT AS EXPECTED - CHEAP AND BADLY PUT TOGETHER
1.0,"Doesn't glow in the dark. Held it up to a flashlight for several minutes, no glow. A cute bracelet that doesn't do as advertised."
1.0,"I bought a 2xl for my son who is 5'10"" and 210lbs.  He normally wears a xl so I was being safe by sizing up.  It is ridiculously small and fits more like a medium.  Super disappointing."
1.0,I was disappointed when I tried on the hoodie and pants because the material is very very thin and is certainly over priced. Will not even do for around the house in winter months. Save your money on this one.
1.0,Do not buy these!!! My Apple Watch fell off my wrist two different times with these bands
1.0,"I tried getting this bathing suit TWICE because of the nice style. However, I first ordered a medium(blue) which didn’t fit and then went on to order a large which fit my top perfectly however it still didn’t fit my bottoms. I’m 5’4 135lbs. I’ve had to return both bathing suits 😞"
1.0,I returned it. I found it too itchy. I have skin sensitivity.
1.0,the cactuses are upside down on the front of the kimono otherwise it was really cute and decent quality
1.0,"Way way to big a medium fits my mom and shes an xl and they are big on her, a medium is like xxl.<br />Very thin but comfy. Im a med. And id buy xtra small"
1.0,"the sleepwear is made of a very ship material, plus I got size large for my girlfriend and it is so small that it looks like a T shirt. I will never buy another item from this site again."
1.0,"So I had this bag and LOVED IT. Perfect color perfect size. I have only had it since December 2017 and today the strap snapped while I was wearing it. It was not yanked or pulled, it just broke. Sad :("
1.0,They send you bigger earrings not the ones in the add
1.0,"They run small and all of the end yarns at each finger came loose. And because they are acrylic, I get static electricity shocks getting out of my car with them. Much happier now that I've replaced them with better quality wool gloves."
1.0,"I have a 7 5/8 hat size.  This hat seemed like a good bet because it was said to accommodate that size with its velcro fastener in the back.  For me, it does not work.  The band with the velcro fastener is large enough but the hat itself will not come down on my head.  The top of the hat is just too small.  Fortunately my wife likes it for speed walking."
1.0,"I am extremely disappointed because I though I had found something to fit size, I am 5'11 and weigh 250 pounds, I have very broad arms and a bit of a gut, as well as long arms and broad shoulders, so I ordered a XXL since I would not really care if it was a bit baggy because I could just tuck it into the pants, since almost everything i wear is extra 1-2 sizes, this felt like i was trying to put on medium to large shirt, it literally didnt have enough cloth to even let me put down my arms in the shoulder lenth, i definitely would not even close. The pants were ok but they didnt loom quite as baggy as they should have looked. Like all an all its a good well made cosplay and anyone in the large to below range will look amazing in it, its just not big people friendly and since this is going to an American audience it should properly size up to those expectations."
1.0,I returned this shirt it was huge and  it could not work for yoga at all nice fabric well made though
1.0,My son is 6 years old but a very tall boy. He uses 8-10. So I ordered 10-12. The long was fine but could not button the waist
1.0,"runs extremely small. I typically wear XS, got a small and top could fit a small child. definitely not for those with boobs. no stretch at all for top or bottom."
1.0,The material wasn’t the best and it wasn’t done well
1.0,Runs Way too small.  I had to give this to my mom who is 118lbs.  I couldn't even get it on.
1.0,"This shirt is really short.  Basically, it is a cropped shirt.  That would have been ok, because I could put a tank underneath, however, it is boxy looks like a mu-mu.  Very unattractive!  For the record, I bought a small"
1.0,"Terrible fabric, late delivery, now they are asking me to mail it back to China.  Any ideas how  much that costs?  Lots.....more than item worth.  Very surprised Amazon has vendors like this......Very disappointed."
1.0,This picture leads you to believe it is a longer tank. It is not. It is quite short and I am disappointed in that.
1.0,Just too cheap looking
1.0,Dont waste your time ladies on this one. this bra wont even zip up.  just a bad product. Wore it once and not again.
1.0,I’m 5’3 the size should’ve been medium of 69 inches should’ve been fine but the zipper was short and made it very hard to put the Costume on. Not sure if they gave me a child’s size and not an adult but literally the shoulder pieces do not go on.  Goin to reorder in effort to see if it’s just a mistake but this is ridiculous lol
1.0,"Went for my typical 40 mile ride today - the padding on these seems to be more in the crotch area, not the buttocks, and after riding for awhile it almost seems like the padding scrunches forward, thus eliminating much of the padding for the rear end.  I even double checked to make sure I did not have them on backwards, as the placement of the padding seems in the wrong spot.  Would not purchase again."
1.0,Absolute garbage. Literally fell apart the first time I attempted to unfold them.
1.0,"These are about what I expected for the price, but wearing them I'm not at all convinced each one in the pack is the same size, even though they're all labeled the same.  At least one or two barely fit, others are fine, all have the same size label."
1.0,Be very careful if ordering these!  They are much brighter than the photo would indicate!
1.0,Runs very small. I ordered these based on the fact that in the picture the fabric looked matte. What I received was super shiny 1980's spandex. Very cheap halloween costume quality material. Not flattering at all. Thumbs down.
1.0,Couldn’t even get my toe in the socks. Super cheap quality.  Avoid at all costs. I returned the product
1.0,Glued on numbers that will soon be completely off so basically it will become a black t shirt
1.0,Very cheap sunglasses.  I wouldn't recommend these to anybody.  I'm pretty sure they are made mostly of plastic.  I ended up getting a refund for them.  They do not close properly and fit lopsidedly on my face.  The lenses are way too dark and I would not recommend driving with them on.  They do look the same in the picture but I thought they would have been a much better quality based on reviews I had read before purchasing.
1.0,Very cheap looking and very heavy. Very large also will be returning as I cannot wear poor description of the ring!
1.0,Neave got it.
1.0,"Unfortunately my ring arrived with a missing stone.  I tried reaching the seller several times, they never got back to me.  This has been the worse customer service experience I ever had.  Too bad, cute ring, just very cheap, and no luck ever hearing back from the seller.  I would never purchase from this seller again."
1.0,Very see through and the butt ripped out in my first workout.
1.0,I loved them and they weren’t too small. I got a size M I’m a size 7 jeans. I wore it one day and that evening it ripped down the back. The stitching came completely undone. I’m just glad I was home and not doing squats at the gym.
1.0,These socks were different than the reviews. Not warm and fuzzy. Feels like spandex socks. Returning.
1.0,Must have been sized in a foreign country!
1.0,The shirt is made of very poor quality material. Along with that the heming of the shirt isn't even. It looks and feels terrible. Im upset I wasted my money on it. I put a red background under the heming so you could see how poorly the shirt was made and how bad it looks.
1.0,The thread around ALL OF THE BUTTON HOLES was unraveled and hanging down front of shirt.  The buttons were falling off - not enough thread  was used to sew them on.  REALLY???to
1.0,The arms are cut funny. Very big and the underarms flair  away from the body lime wings.  It's kinda large for Mudpie. I wear a large in this brand because I like loose fit. Normally a 12 petite. This dress was just oddly cut. Returned
1.0,Material of the shirt is super cheap and the shirt feels as thin as a piece of tissue paper and feels very rough. The shirt is also very see through.
1.0,TOO GAPPY WANT MY MONEY BACK !!!!!
1.0,"While it did state that it runs small,  I ordered 2 sizes larger & it was very clingy. I have it to my daughter. I was extremely disappointed"
1.0,Very flimsy. I guess I got what I paid for.
1.0,Picture does not match product.
1.0,Bought it as a gift and gave it 4 weeks after purchase. It tangled and chain broke in less than a week. I cannot return it since it is passed the 1 month return policy. Don't buy it.
1.0,Disappointed. Fits strange and was too late to get refund
1.0,"I am 5'8 140 lbs athlete.  My build is pretty normal and typically clothing fits as expected. However, this dress was proportioned in a really strange and unflattering way. I ordered the grey and orange but returned both."
1.0,They broke the fist day not happy
1.0,very loose for my female head.
1.0,It is cute but way to small for size that i order.
1.0,I ordered  an x lg and can't even get it on
1.0,Buyer beware. Fake nose bridges are garbage for use on a face mask which is what is pictured.  Just more people getting to take advantage of people in this crisis.  Tin foil would be a better option
1.0,Horrible material and very deceiving from the actual picture!!
1.0,"I ordered the size of my blouse; it was way too small. I sent an email to request how to do an exchange. I received a rude email telling me I'd have to pay to return them (which I was going to do anyway) and that I had already been sent the next size up. (I was going to request a couple sizes bigger as it was too tight to close but didn't get the chance). When I got the next set, they also were too tight. I tried to wear one to break it in, but it got more uncomfortable as the day progressed. When I finally took it off, 4 of the 5 snaps had come undone. I think this bra would be comfortable if I could get one that fits, but didn't want to return a second set as I'd already paid for the bras and postage to send them back once."
1.0,Do Not Buy...The 2nd time I wore these the seam busted open and I’m a thin person. I tried to return & the seller didn’t ask why I wanted to return or let me return. All I wanted was to try a replacement.
1.0,"These were great looking. Very comfortable, lightweight and fit as expected.... Until it came time to wash them.<br /><br />All three pairs came completely apart in the wash."
1.0,Came broken in the box.<br />And the once that do work are so weak that they break while putting them info your shoes.<br />This is some very cheap Chinese stuff.
1.0,"Very small, not in length but look. It was a gift for a friend"
1.0,"This thing runs at least two sizes to small. I'm 5'10 180 pounds and the XL suit didn't even reach my breasts. Oh and a word of warning since its not in the description, they don't accept returns."
1.0,"I ordered these in a 10/12 for my daughter. They fit like a 7/8 after washing, and are super thin."
1.0,Seams tore under the arms 1 month after purchase.
1.0,I hand washed in cold water and let air dry and the dress shrank - I never got to wear it
1.0,They fell apart and had holes after an hour of wearing them.
1.0,I am 120 pounds 5’2 I got a small and it was huge pants baggy and way too long sweater baggy as well
1.0,"Poor fabric quality, looked very cheap. Returned."
1.0,"Very tiny, could not open the hoop earrings, seemed odd, unsure what the problem was"
1.0,Cheap shiny fabric.  Too small. Print seems faded.  Worst part ordered a skirt but received a dress.  Returned item.
1.0,Slippery material makes it impossible to secure to head.
1.0,The water bladder leeks at the hose connection
1.0,These stopped working after ONE use.
1.0,"At least 1 size smaller than what was ordered. Colors are so faded, you can hardly make out what is on the shirt."
1.0,"I'd be ashamed to wear this coat in public,  so I'm just going to use it over top my clothes to take the garbage out if it's raining.<br />I really thought the material would have some weight to it."
1.0,"Not a good choice for anyone with a larger chest. The armholes gape weirdly and show off half your bra, and not in a good way. The slit is also the type where they cut out a wedge of fabric, instead of just cutting a line and serging the edges, which means it stays open - not a bad thing necessarily but not what I wanted. Had the same weird smell that other reviews mentioned, too. Going to return it, and I never bother returning anything."
1.0,Cute shirt. Uncomfortable fabric. Bizarre sizing/fit. Not for me. Donated to Goodwill. Order at your own risk.
1.0,Tremendo robo
1.0,"Only one side is smooth and nice, the other side is untreated and just shreds everywhere. Don’t buy it :/"
1.0,Terrible buy. Waistline flips over. Doesn’t lay nice.

1.0,One of the cheapest shades I've seen or bought.
1.0,Terrible. Took forever to come in and were torn when they finally arrived. Will be sending back for a refund
1.0,"I am 5'2, 95 lbs and can fit in a large to x-large in children's. This in x-large was WAY TOO SMALL. Too tight and at least 4 inches too short from shoulder to base of foot. Very disappointed as I love footed pj's and unicorns and I can't find anything with feet like this elsewhere. Oh well"
1.0,"I've had this watch band for approximately three months.  If you remove a link in the band, the watch is more difficult to manage the locking snap as it's located under the band.  Unfortunately, the watch band broke which revealed the poor quality of material when the hinge was revealed.  Not worth the money for the quality."
1.0,The exterior scratches really easy. After owning the ring for 2 years it looks terrible.
1.0,It doesn’t stay latched and falls off.
1.0,"Faded after 3 days and leaving green crap on the finger , very displeased."
1.0,"I order this dress, but it runs too big, I usually were a xs size"
1.0,asian sizing
1.0,"Do NOT bother with this.  Nothing like the pic, was not even folded in the package, came horribly wrinkled and when I steamed it , saw it was clearly poorly made.  Crooked seems nothing is straight or even and there is threads and strangly cut material all over inside.  Terrible!"
1.0,my romper arrived with now waist tie!  it just had a hole in the midd section.  I'm so confused!  runs big.  I need a small and not a medium.  I will be returning. and I will not be reordering.
1.0,No this supposed to be a 44 mm it’s like barely 40 😡
1.0,"This dress is SO CUTE, yet SO HORRIBLE. I’m not sure what the fabric is, but I can tell you that it is full of static cling and stuck to everything. The sizing is way off."
1.0,Stitching was unraveling
1.0,I bought several from your store.<br />When they arrived they were soft and looked nice.<br />After a couple of washes they faded so bad they looked 10 yrs old.  And they felt terrible they are full of fuzz balls that feel terrible on the skin.<br />I can’t ware them they are so ruff to my skin.  I want my money back I have to buy all new gowns now to replace these.<br />Please send me a label and I will will send products  back.<br />I am disgusted with these gowns.  I spent a lot of money and these gowns are horrible after a couple of washes.<br />I do NOT a recommend anyone buy these.
1.0,I bought it for my mom it didn't even last a week before it broke.
1.0,"I was running out of time to find a hat for a tea party and ended up buying this on Amazon, it’s probably a one use item for me."

1.0,Horrible material. Size was way too small. Did not look like the picture

1.0,run very big does not look or fit like the picture

1.0,"Not a very good product, came in broken.<br />So much for unbreakable"
1.0,"Bought them for my sons birthday in November and they broke the second time he used them. I couldn’t find the manufacturer contact to try to fix them, don’t waste your money."
1.0,this fell apart on my daughter the first time she used it. The pearls fell out and the strap broke. I would return it but its not worth the effort based on the price. Will not buy anything like this again.
1.0,can even wear ir
1.0,Like the picture- fabric is cheap- no zipper- tvOS is a pull on dress. The fabric is super thin and stretchy.  Will only look acceptable in a picture.  I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,"Crap product, it says to brush in the solution and wipe clean with cloth. Well the black cloth turned my whit Nike prestos a brown color. Do not use this cleaner it's crap cloth unless you want to ruin expensive shoes."
1.0,The material is so see through it's sheer.
1.0,"Very disappointed. 3 of 6 the bands had pins that were too short. Thank goodness they are silicone. After some quick surgery and effort, I build my own straps. Buyer beware."
1.0,Cheap.  Ugly.  I returned it.
1.0,They break very easily. I have had the little balls on them come out on two of them.
1.0,The picture depicts a much larger bag like a messenger but it's very narrow and short. Sent it back immediately
1.0,I asked for a size 4 1/2 and the shoe was so small it belonged on a doll

1.0,"Cute sports bra, but it was so small that I couldn’t even get it over my shoulders and I normally wear small or sometimes extra small sizes. Very disappointing."
1.0,I wear a medium so I ordered a large and I still couldn't wear a thick sweatshirt under it. The zipper was so hard to zip and I almost had to step out of it because it wouldn't un zip at the bottom.  I returned it.
1.0,"I can't get them to even stay up, it's like they have nothing in them to fit a real person lol."
1.0,Unfortunately this item runs very small on the sides.  I'm not able to wear it at all which isnsad since it's so pretty.
1.0,"It arrived with no card slot insert, which makes it totally useless."
1.0,Ordered my normal size but way too small!
1.0,Pants too small and short for a kid instead for men's. Then on top of that slot of Dog hair on it..
1.0,Didn't fit. Wrong color. Cheap material. It's just awful! The only good thing about all of this was it arrived faster than expected.
1.0,"This was the ugliest piece of clothing I have ever seen.  Not only did the color look like poop, but the quality was also poop.  You couldn't give it to me free to wear...shame on you."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:5c1fba23d550e5c9c0eda71c3550006e]] It came in a not and when I tried to unRavel it it would not unravel so I was not able to use it
1.0,But they were just regular straight pants not crinkly as in photo. Also material is thin
1.0,Horrible made shoe can't walk in them
1.0,"Do not buy unless small boned.  Even with  contortions and stretching, unable to get over fingers on wrist.  Probably fine if your wrist is 5 inches or under."
1.0,"The bikini top  is made so confusing, you don’t know where to start of how to figure it out to put on.  Please do no invest your money in this not worth it. I’ve been trying to do a refund on it since I’ve gotten it and couldn’t get one cause the transaction was not in my orders, but all of a sudden it pops up after expiration to return back to seller 🤔"
1.0,extremely cheap fabric. its going back! p
1.0,Cheap thin nasty fabric. Don’t waste your money. You can see right through it
1.0,I hate this umbrella. The wiring is so flimsy for the price I was expecting something sturdy. The button to open and close the umbrella stopped working after my first time opening it.
1.0,Material very thin can toally see through it
1.0,"I was deceived. When I saw this dress it look so beautiful on the model. When I received my order it didn't look like the one in the picture. The material was different, it look cheap not formal at all. I give the dress to my sister for her everyday wearing."
1.0,I purchased this watch for my husband for Christmas. This morning he dropped the watch in the house on our floor. The face cracked and several of the numbers came of. I am 61 and have had many watches in my life and dropped all of them numerous time but never had one to break or even stop keeping time.....
1.0,I bought it because it looked exactly like my Mar Hoffman tiger swimwear. This product however is poorly made and and looks awful on the body
1.0,Very pretty but almost impossible to put on yourself.<br />Clasp broke the first time I tried it on.
1.0,"To small, had to return."
1.0,Very small and not really denim. It's like a jegging material.
1.0,"This dress felt like placing an itchy, thick poorly designed huge throw blanket on. Misleading. I wouldn't even call it a dress!"

1.0,"As expected, cheap price for cheap item."
1.0,"DO NOT PURCHASE ANY OF THE ZODIAC SIGNS. I purchased 3 Zodiac Sign charms, and they all came looking like this. The charm with the hearts is the same manufacturer and it has no issues."
1.0,I was expecting the same green one.
1.0,"The colors were not at all what they looked like in the photos. not blue just straight up gray. It runs wayyyy too small, I sized up and you could still see my entire butt."

1.0,Took forever to get here and came broken
1.0,"I like the the style and patterns, but it's not for woman with boobs"
1.0,I ordered the pink dress and it was not lined at all and very see through. You would need to wear a full slip under this dress. Very disappointed that you can not wear the dress as it comes. Returned!
1.0,Lousy<br />Material
1.0,No stars it’s awful
1.0,"Not  as I expected, looks cheap"
1.0,"I bought this to help relieve muscle soreness due to one shoulder surgery and one dislocated shoulder. It was so small and tight I could not get both arms in the shirt,  much less fasten the front snaps."
1.0,"2 x 15 it’s a good deal, however they are almost made out of paper towels material, one single use and that’s it, they fall apart after one time wearing it."
1.0,Zipper broke as I was zipping it to use for the 1st time. Complete waste of my money.
1.0,Nothing oversized about this product. More like a crop top. I'm 5'10 average built... bought because it looked like a cute oversized sweatshirt. I was wrong.. it barley even touched my belly button.
1.0,"Looks complete different in person, very deceiving"

1.0,I want to return this dress back. It’s  tight on my daughter.
1.0,So incredibly disappointed. I got music ones that say LIFE. Life is a balance if holding on & letting go. You just need to know I’ve been with you all the time.<br />Not appropriate for the gift I needed.  So disap.
1.0,This toy sword is so cheap made and not worth the $19.99 I spent on it. I am very disappointed with this power ranger toy!!!!!<br />I would like my money back…

1.0,The product I received doesn't match the pictured item.  It has only 3 clips. I will return it.
1.0,Inside just used double side type to stick on...poor quality
1.0,Muy Mal Las medidas
1.0,"I bought these as faux septum rings since I lost my other one (bought from a different company but same concept). Cannot seem to ""pinch"" these enough to get them to fit without them falling out so I just moved them to the side so they work as a faux nose ring but I still check ever so often to make sure its still in place. Whatever these are made of is super strong!"
1.0,It's okay as described but too small. Not my expectation.
1.0,"I bought this Black Nike Drifit shirt in Medium. It was to big/long. I'm 5'2 129lbs 34C. This shirt I think is Fake, not Nike. It is so thin, nothing like my other black Drifit longsleeve hooded Nike shirt I have. Don't buy it, you'll end up Returning it, I did. Poor Quality."
1.0,I have a pair of these in the gray camo and I love them. They're super soft and comfortable. I just got the green pair today and it's a totally different material. Its not comfortable and it's itchy. Really disappointed that it's not the same as the other color.
1.0,NEVER GOT IT. HAD TO WAIT A MONTH FOR A REFUND.<br />BAD PLACE DONT ORDER
1.0,"This coat failed on all counts. It came with Chinese only writing on the tags... There was no filling, fiberfill, down, whatever it was to stay warm. I ordered an XL... The tag said it was an XXL... But it clearly was about the size of a medium. So incredibly disappointing."
1.0,The cost is not water proof or repellant
1.0,"Definitely should of read the reviews before purchasing. This is more for a kid then adult, and it’s very cheap. I was expecting more like a helmet then a string mask."
1.0,This felt and looked like a paper bag.
1.0,"this is the worst example of screen printing I've ever seen. so, so, so bad. the logo is blurry and lines are not crisp. loops like a photo copy of a copy."
1.0,The elastic didn't hold very long
1.0,Heavy weight
1.0,Used! Describe as new but used!
1.0,The dress is made for someone with a totally flat chest!  I would have loved the dress otherwise.
1.0,My feet slip out of these CONSTANTLY even though they are the right size and a smaller size would pinch. Would give zero stars if I could!
1.0,I received my package with only one of the two necklaces working. Only the blue one glowed while the purple necklace remained dull and shone no light. I noticed that the one which shone no light had indents on the stone.
1.0,"This by no means is a plus size suit. I was lucky to put one leg in.  My daughter is 5'5"" tall and 140 pounds and small busted.  This fit her perfectly in the chest but was to tight in the abdomen.<br />The pattern is very bizarre as well, women in different swimming or diving positions, I think anyways.<br />If this suit were orange leopard I could see Wilma Flintstone wearing it."
1.0,This was like a child size.
1.0,my gotcha fell out
1.0,Terrible way to small
1.0,"The belt was what I ordered, but the buckle wouldn't unlock.  I tried it, my husband tried it, neither could figure it out.  It should be simple, but it wasn't.  So I returned it."
1.0,There are several clothing sites online that sell these beautiful dresses and shoes plus jackets. I ordered 4 things in a plus size. I got only one of the garments. The one I did get was really cheap see-through fabric and would have fit a 7-year-old girl. They can do this as long as they send 1 garment to the buyer then just keep saying others on their way. Amazon should shut them down but legally I don't think they can. But Amazon should respect its clientele more.
1.0,Was unable to stretch in order to try them on z k though J order a size L-XL therefore could not try them on  as advertised easy on easy iff
1.0,"It looked like something a kid would make in home EC. The hat didn't sit straight and the brim looked awful! Very poor quality stitching. And then when I tried to return it, they sent me around in circles and ended up not taking it back. Huge waste of time and money!"
1.0,Hat is small and received the wrong style.
1.0,Item was not adequately made !!
1.0,These are the worst thing I ever bought from Amazon.
1.0,"The colors were way too bright and brash , not like the photo.  Dress is very adorable and material soft, just didn't like the colors for me."
1.0,"Loved this tutu skirt as it was adorable at first.  But, the first time we washed it it lost like half the glitter stars.  And now they fall off all day long.  Would not recommend."
1.0,The absolute worst purchase.
1.0,I had to return glasses they did not fit as described.
1.0,The product took a long to arrive. The package was intact without any sign of damage.<br />The frame seems to be made of cheap plastic. The whole eyeglass is very light and feels fragile. The adjustment does not work well. I am surprisingly disappointed. It is quite puzzling and suspicious to me why so many flattering positive ratings of a product of such quality. I'll return it and ask for a refund.
1.0,I thought this dress was cotton and it’s made from slip material .. the dress is see through. Not at all what was expecting. I was so excited too because I’ve been look for a black maxi dress that I could get through prime. Without having to wait a month for it. Not happy at all
1.0,"I purchased this to wear with a fancy outfit but had to return it immediately.  It looks like a small handkerchief with 2 loops on the side.  The fabric and lace are nice, but this cannot be used as a face mask.  It just hangs off the face and has no contour to make it fit the face snugly.  The packaging says ""upgrade version"" with a drawing of a well fitting mask but that is not what was sent.  I do not recommend this face mask unless you are planning on using it as a handkerchief"
1.0,You need to be short and short waisted to wear this dress correctly. I’m 5’4 and 155lbs and the small fit but The waist line seemed to be too high making the dress super short. Ordered a medium and same problem. Too bad bc it’s cute with a nice fabric.
1.0,Junky item
1.0,The xxl fit my skinny tall 12 year old!
1.0,The entire device is too small to easily position and turn the screws.  Don't waste you money.
1.0,The item looks nice on the model. However the material is very thin & cheap. I paid extra for shipping & did received the blouse on time. Please do not buy from Florens. The tag was also missing from the blouse. Therefore I do not know if this blouse is a medium or large. Not worth it. It’s rag. Shane
1.0,Losey !!waste of my money !!
1.0,"Runs very big, rough material. Ended up returning"
1.0,It’s not what the picture looks like at all. It’s not fixed and is dangling. It’ll make your piercing hole larger over time as its heavy.  I don’t recommend it for everyday wear. Not as flattering as I expected it to be
1.0,Very disappointed. This hat came completely open and undone at the top!!
1.0,way too big. unwearable. so disappointed.
1.0,"The fabric is entirely too heavy. It felt like I was wearing a ful length weighted vest. Which throws off the style this dress was supposed to have. Maybe change the fabric to a cotton blend? Sizing is too large. If you’re a medium, get the small. I would like information on how to return this product. Do not recommend."
1.0,"This shirt is good quality, nice and thick -However, the shirt in the photo is not what I received. The split is not in the center. Instead it is off to the side, which gives it a very awkward opening. Anyone that has a larger chest than a B cup, this will not look flattering on you whatsoever. So disappointed :("
1.0,much smaller than I imagined.
1.0,So beautiful. But the sequins just pop off the skirt. It is cheaply made. Not sturdy material.
1.0,"This would fit a skinny-armed woman with a belly to hide.  Not for me.  Super thin, too tight in the arms, and made me look like a fat cow.  Returned."
1.0,I've bought two pairs of earrings from this seller and they are junk. The stones fell out of the settings. The backs are way too small. And forget tying to get a refund. I will never buy from again.
1.0,Bad product left sterling silver jewelry more tarnished then what it was before use of the product. Literally had to use a different sterling silver cleaner to clean my jewelry after this garbage was used
1.0,"Was disappointed, the picture on this item showed a more hour shape v neck Tshirt that supposed to be well fitted, not on this case! Shirt looks loose like a men’s shaped v neck t shirt with cheap print. Will not order again"
1.0,Returned this dress. It looked terrible! I'm curvy and this dress still looked like a bag.
1.0,This is absolutely not a singers mask. There’s nothing holding it away from mouth.
1.0,very poor quality. links broke and stones fell within 5 minutes of opening the package
1.0,"Great back support, not lift."
1.0,Received damaged.  Will review again if replacement is received in good order.
1.0,Started to come apart after a week.  Now a month later I need new show laces.  Save your money.
1.0,Nothing like in the picture
1.0,"What is shown in picture is a new clean, unworn dress. I received a stained dresses that smelled of body odor.  That is not what I ordered."
1.0,"Bought as a gift, however it had a black and white photo, but distorted, not the best quality"
1.0,"Stone looks very cloudy, fake, cheap. Not a sparkling stone like pic."
1.0,It’s ok not what we expected could be better quality
1.0,it is uneven sewing. fits weird
1.0,The lace did not have a finished look running up the straps. And it was too tight in the bust area. Fit more like a 8-10 instead of a 12. Bought a large.
1.0,Read the reviews before I ordered. When I got them the pants you can cleary see that they run EXTREMELY SMALL. I ordered an XXL and they are seriously more like a m/l.<br />I missed my window to return so gifting them to a friend. I was super disappointed.
1.0,I went to wear them today an my wife notice one has a slight tear
1.0,"It’s a terrible matetial, smells like a melted rubber . The the black color bled onto the white during a few minutes under rain. Overall it's horrible. Don't buy ."
1.0,"This product is a Fraud! I want t return it, it’s straight water! I don’t hav money to give away !"
1.0,Ordered large  and so small I ga e it to my granddaughter. No give. Bad purchase
1.0,"Not meant for cis women, perhaps"
1.0,Fits like a child mask. I had to return and order plain adult masks and take them to a vinyl shop to get them made.
1.0,"I ordered this here, then I returned here and purchased through pavlok so I could do the challenge… which was a JOKE! First, I had to return two watches before getting one that worked. Then I paid the monthly fee for the “challenge”  A Facebook group chat and “which is your favorite podcast” or “favorite pet and why” conversations. I cancelled the challenge and paid the fee to keep the watch. SIX MONTHS they continued to charge me $30 per month. I finally got them to look into it and see I paid my invoice. So they refunded it and cancelled me. Now a month later I am being charged again!! I can’t get away from these people !!! I couldn’t use the watch the way I wanted. Starting a habit doesn’t work with this. Breaking one kinda worked but the app is a mess and not helpful at all. My phone was blowing up with notifications and not allowing me to track things well at all. It’s uncomfortable and can’t wear with Apple Watch unless you buy a $40 clip. Half the time it doesn’t do what it is supposed to anyhow. A waste of time and money."
1.0,"Do not order, they are VERY short and the diamonds are not aligned well at all they are crooked"
1.0,Can’t read the words and one side it’s not sewed . HUGE waste
1.0,"Returning because of the horrible shape to the top. If you have boobs, this will look awful on you."
1.0,Need a skirt under it for it to remotely look good. Poorly made and cheap looking.
1.0,Medium? More like extra small!
1.0,Heavy and VERY shiny! Just too much to keep
1.0,It was way to big and showed my underwear lining. Horrible purchase.
1.0,The short were good cotton . But the color is not white . I had to send them back.
1.0,"I waited 3 months to get this product for $20.  And when it finally can it didn’t even fit an 11 years old regular sized boy.  On top of that when I went to return it I noticed I had to pay to return it.  Yikes bad on me for not realizing that this would have been a disaster no matter what!  Do not order from here.  They have lost 2/3 shipments, product is meant for people less than 70lbs and taller than 5’6”, and you pay more than the cost of the product to return."
1.0,Missing three gems- one being the main middle piece. I did contact seller-hopefully they'll make it right.
1.0,"This thing is a mess ..... It's beautiful in the picture but one arm was too long, the other too short.  It was just a mumble jumble messy piece of yarn fabric -----"
1.0,Dislikes my account balance
1.0,Was not what I expected material is very thin and they run small.
1.0,"I ordered XL, but ran extremely small. It was more of a small/ medium. When it came in it stank terribly and felt like it had a greasy coating on it. I guess you get what you pay for, but this was gross."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:ed9e1a0904fa0075f9bd2fce1a4d28f5]] I wish it would've lasted a lil longer than a few weeks
1.0,Too small. Smaller than the same kind I’ve already bought. Only chose this one for the slightly lower price and it was not worth it because I can’t even use them
1.0,They were great but after 1 wash they ripped across one leg. Love the way they fit but will not buy again after tear occurred in wash before I even could wear them
1.0,Too small. Too thin. Waste of money.
1.0,Compre XL y son pequeñas me apretar demasiado
1.0,I don't think the first picture is appropriate. It should be removed.
1.0,Sadly I was very very upset when I received this product because it was broken. It was not even a necklace anymore. What a waste!
1.0,I wear a 10-12 and ordered an x-large. I was not able to pull up the bottoms or put on top.
1.0,"It came on time, but when I opened an envelope, this piece was broken. This is not worth to send it back to China. I am very dissapointed."
1.0,"the visor and the cloth area on the hat dont match, this isn't something you notice from looking at the photos or by reading the fake reviews on here I guess... to get to the point because the cloth area is smaller than the visor, you can see part of my forehead which when worn in direct sunlight would make me look awful stupid"
1.0,Strongly dislike. It is too narrow and it looks nothing like advertised. Not only was the product over a week late...it is poor quality and it does not have a loop only a thick velcro. If your a thicker girl this will not cover your belly. It's trash!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,"This order was not as it should be. The fabric content label read &#34;5% Polyester 95% Cotton.&#34; If this garment is not100% polyester, I'll take up sky diving. This fabric stretches more than the fabric combination claimed on the label would. It is also somewhat rough to the touch.<br /><br />It will not be used for the planned activities on a winter vacation. I will keep it in the car as part of an emergency change of clothing. In other words, I will not be wearing this racer-back T-shirt as a regular part of my wardrobe."
1.0,looks cheap do not buy
1.0,They are small and cut off circulation of arms
1.0,Packaging was good and everything looked fine! I was exited for my sunglasses until I saw they came with a crack around the frame :( I was so disappointed because I love the shape :((()
1.0,Size up!!!
1.0,"The dress I received is not what you see in the picture. The color is brown, the print is different and the fit is terrible. It's a no name knock-off from China. Don't waste your money. The material is terrible, 95%polyester & 5 % spandex...it feels gross and doesn't stretch. Straps are not adjustable like you see in the photo. No size on the dress, I ordered a small. Not close to a small at all unless you have boobs the size of small watermelons. I'm returning this, asap."
1.0,These are NOT LED and do not light up ... they are just a print of LED blue light bulbs ... You can buy a less expensive pair of black and blue design socks at Wal_Mart or the Dollar Store!!!
1.0,DID NOT FIT!!!
1.0,The colors of this dress are ugly. No nice way to say it. The contrasting color looks very odd and unnatural in design. The fabric is very scratchy. I’m returning it.
1.0,If those shirts are XL I'd hate to see a small !
1.0,What in the actual H**L is this garbage?! It looks absolutely nothing like the picture. This is the absolute smallest print I have EVER seen on a hat. You can’t see it from more than 5 feet away with perfect vision. BUY THIS SOMEWHERE ELSE.
1.0,Not happy with the fact that the bags are different sizes and a couple of them appear to have come out from under the bed and are covered in animal hair. Not quite as advertised.
1.0,"Like them at FIRST, but very quickly the &#34;gold&#34; tarnished to black.  Looks cheap, which of course they are."
1.0,"La máscara no es para adorno, y esta no cubre nada,  es demasiado fina. Se pega mucho a la piel. No las devolví porque mi nieta las usó para vestir las muñecas. No las recomiendo."
1.0,"The Color was Bright Orange and 3 sizes too big!!!! Im 5'7 and weigh 170 lbs and this dress was so huge, the size was not even in the dress!!!! Gave it away!!!!"
1.0,Sent them straight back. Not adjustable at all and didn’t stay up on anybody’s face.
1.0,Beautiful designer but I used it one time and it open totally daw of my arm...ship material
1.0,"These would be 5 star shoe trees, but they are missing a brass knob, making it unusable. Have reached out to seller and didn’t even receive a response. Buyer beware."
1.0,Not what e expected and wish it had better quality material
1.0,The plastic eye shield was scratched and seemed that it would crack.
1.0,Pull tab of the zipper broke after one week on a two week vacation. Makes me feel like the rest of them won’t last very long if it can’t survive just one vacation.
1.0,There was only 42 charms in my package. I ordered a 50 pack
1.0,"Never in my life have i bought pants that are loose everywhere but the waist, especially not sweatpants. It's like they started making size XL and then sewed on a the smaller waist elastic they could. I feel like my organs are getting squished."
1.0,I have headgear with same power .<br />Vision is clear and relaxed .<br /><br />This pair purchased with same power produces headaches and eye strain.<br />This may have to do with pupil distance vs close proximity to eyes .<br />I can not confirm .<br />Head gear distance creates about 1.25 distance from pupil<br />I tried pulling down my nose to create distance = to headgear.<br />The result was eye strain .
1.0,Broken clip on delivery. Badly designed pin holder on the clip. It shall come out easily as it is not designed to drill into holes
1.0,these are not made for small people. come up to your armpits. also not footed. bunch up at top of the foot.
1.0,I’m so distracted seeing the shape of the skirt!
1.0,"Way too small and thin, did not fit my body well. However it could work for other people. Cute style just didn’t fit me well."
1.0,My husband wore these for about a week or two and one of the eyelets came off. I had to return them.
1.0,"I generally refrain from writing bad reviews as I like to give the benefit of doubt but this product is absolutely unacceptable! Cheaply made. Crystals fallen off. You are probably paying for the box and not the product itself which doesn't even begin to justify the price. I bought it as a small gift for a family member, but will be definitely returning it ASAP. Save your money and time."
1.0,half of these flash light didn't work. i think they burnt out during the shipping process. many of the flashlights were turned on when I opened the package
1.0,I order it July and after 6 month I receive it. it was another type I wanted matte and it was Smooth<br />I don't like this item
1.0,They were super tiny and The elastic was super weak
1.0,Love the style but water has condensed under the glass. Never been in the water or in shower. Washed dishes and hands. To late to return. This is 9/1 and window closed 8/30 :(
1.0,Hope you don’t plan on wearing them in the summer or anywhere that gets remotely warm because if you even perspire a tiny bit these don’t stick at all!!! I really had high hopes based on other reviews.
1.0,The fit didn't work for me.
1.0,I accidentally ordered the wrong size and wasnt aware of how easy it would be to return so.money wasted
1.0,"This is a unique and very nice looking watch which my wife received many compliments on. BUT, within a week of use the bamboo broke where the pin connects to the band. Not acceptable at any price. Won't buy again."
1.0,"Seller would not accept return<br />Instructions so small need a magnifying glass to read, cheap construction..."
1.0,"The shirt in he picture is not the shirt I received. The flowers are a bright hot pink and the leaves are bright blue. I was liked this shirt for its soft spring colors, very disappointed."
1.0,"This dress had incredibly weird proportions.  The arm holes are huge, and the skirt is very short.  The flowers also all fold in on themselves and would have to be ironed open.  I sent it back."
1.0,Cheap. Underwire seams broke exposing wire after one wash
1.0,Ring arrived discolored and severely tarnished. The engraving is not legible and the stones are micro and hard to distinguish each color. I have never been so disappointed with a purchase. And the seller won't even make it right by sending one that is not tarnished and discolored.
1.0,"I didn't get what's pictured here. The batteries I received were not specifically 357A, and they did not quite fit the application properly (too small). Thus, useless to me, and promptly returned."
1.0,Sadly this was returned. This was way to small for my daith. I has very small ears but this was impossible to fit. It was super cute though.
1.0,Not what is represented. Much different fabric and a fit than what appears.
1.0,"Cute dress for young girls, will not fit anyone with any sort of curves and it’s very very short and I’m only 5’ 4”!  We had a good laugh when I tried this on and then it was immediately returned!"
1.0,"For some reason both packs of the shirts are extremely stretched out at the bottom seam. We thought washing them would suffice this issue unfortunately they did not, the still remain extremely stretched out and large at the bottom seam of the shirt. We are not satisfied and will not be purchasing this brand in the future."
1.0,Broke in 5 days
1.0,Ridiculous!  Cut for a VERY SMALL 50LB CHILD!  I bought for a gift and now too late to return.  I just blew $20
1.0,Bad material - did not even try on!
1.0,Why would you ever write “enjoy myself” in toddlers panties? So weird. Who approved this?
1.0,"Okay the shirt is cute. But upon it’s arrival, I open the package and the shirt smelt like someone wore it. Perfume mixed with a musty smell. I will definitely be returning it. I don’t know wasn’t Amazon return policy with clothing, but I really hope they inspect them before finalizing the return. What a disappointment.  The fabric is thin, which would be perfect for the spring or fall seasons."
1.0,This is not real pearl
1.0,I couldn't adjust this watch for the life of me. I almost needed to get a vice and a jackhammer.
1.0,"Looks great in the advertised photo but when the product comes, it is untied and it just looks like a strip of fabric. The material itself is not soft nor comfortable. I tried styling it but it does not look as great as the marketing photo."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:343dafd9b001e9ee3a3060b4b4ac42d3]] Really excited for this band, because I can't wear my charge 5 at work due to working with food. Unfortunately when I got it out of the packaging and tried to connect it to my watch only one side would latch correctly.(with a bit of fiddling, nothing like my other strap that simply clicks on), the other side as you can see will not latch at all. I thought about contacting the seller to see if they could possibly send me a new one but I'm not sure how to do that on Amazon."
1.0,1st day wearing this and heart part fell off and is lost now. Cheaply made?? Can I return or refund it's only been 1 week
1.0,"Cheap, cheap product. Looks like they got a dollar store hat and threw a sticker on it. The image was already starting to peel off the hat upon arrival. Find yourself a different hat, trust me."
1.0,I was really disappointed  .the dress is too sm.&tight I'm returning it
1.0,Absolute junk! Don’t waste the money!
1.0,"I purchased this diaper bag well before the birth of my daughter because it was being offered with a great sale.  I like the size and compartments, but within a few days of use, the thermal lining in the side pocket was ripped from the side of the bag.  Within a few weeks of use, the large front compartment seam started to rip from the bag.  It is incredibly disappointing and I have chosen to use a different bag."
1.0,These rings are very poor quality. The eye popped off and the foot broke off the one with red eyes
1.0,it doesnt look like on the photo its like turnished silver
1.0,"Horrible...they should be ashame of themselves,the fur is not like the pics,and they are Too small...not to mention the fact that they are very uncomfortable,also took a mouth to arrive"
1.0,Bad and ugly
1.0,Material is too thin.  Color is lighter than picture and faded in some places.  Looks so junk and cheap. I will return it tomorrow.
1.0,"I ordered a 5x which should be way too big for me, I was just barely able to squeeze into it but it was too small to keep wearing. Gave it away as a gift to someone who normally wears an XL, fits them a little bit loose."
1.0,"It is either shipped without a battery, or mine hasn't worked from the start."
1.0,The strap ripped after four months of light use. Extremely dissatisfied. Do not recommend.
1.0,Second time I've order this watch band and both times they break from the screw where the band connects to the watch. Watch out for this money pit.
1.0,"love it. my Timex Weekender is blk face, wht numerals and this just POPS! quality is great too. i've a 8 1/4"" circumference wrist and i've 3 holes left on the strap so it fits under both keepers. i recommend.<br /><br />UPDATE- the prong is a mm short. if you don't make sure it is fully seated through the strap onto the buckle frame you  find your watch on the floor. luckily this always happened on the carpet of my bedroom. it is still the only strap in the style, long length i desired i could find. i'm thinking of reworking the prong over with my jeweler's pliers. looks like there is plenty of open wrap on the buckle pin.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/1/14- now with normal slight stretching of the nylon band, that had been pressing against the oversized eyelet of the prong, there is now enough loose play that if there is slight sideways pressure on the buckle the prong slips off. i've almost lost my watch about once a week for the last month. going to email the provider. i've relegated this to one star. no matter how cheap your watch is, a lost watch is just that. really is sad because this was affordable and long. hard to find."
1.0,Cheaply made and runs way too small. I returned both shirts and won’t be reordering.
1.0,"The FIRST thing I had to do was replace the battery. It still works occasionally. Although inexpensive, it ultimately was not worth the money."
1.0,Not good!!! Smelled so bad I had to take it outside. Material is cheap and stiff.
1.0,I bought both a medium and a large.  They both felt like I had a tourniquet around my arm.  I am not a big person so I was surprised when the large was so tight too.  Had to send them back.  I found another brand that was one size fits all and they work great.
1.0,"The dress is of a very poor quality.  It’s supposed to be an elegant dress, however it leaves much to be desired.  The embroidery is not even done by the dress, it is an appliqué with bad sewing. Do not recommend it at all."
1.0,"I'm 4'10&#34; and 170 lbs, a little chubby, but I've been losing weight so I figured getting a dress a tad snug wouldn't be an issue, I bought an XL.  But this dress is no where near big enough. Maybe if I get back down to 90lbs like I was in high school it will fit.... maybe. Also, even after washing, it has a horrendous smell."
1.0,"Do not sit-up on the ear lobe, droopy and cheap looking."
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture it strange like shirt material. It’s way to big and not very cute
1.0,By size I should have been a 1X but sleeves are way too tight and fit is terrible.
1.0,"The makeup didn’t cover well, and it did not come with a cover so it could be kept for using again. Also it was labeled with a price that was much cheaper than what I paid, so I felt like I got scammed."
1.0,"The belt received is marked Medium.  It is far too small for my husband...we were expecting a larger one.  So we went online to the vendor you used, Belt Outlet, and ordered two belts that fit him, and he is very satisfied with them.  We are returning the one sent to us by Amazon."
1.0,"Was not the material I expected and zippers I feel were skimped on, could have went with a better design.  Looks and feels like they would be hard to open and get into, let alone looks like they would tear or catch on short material.  Was hoping I’d like these, but was let down."
1.0,It says to order your usual size. I ordered a medium... it fit like an extra small! Could barely pull it over my but I didn't even try the top on because the bottom started to tare and well this product is cheaply made and not made true to size.
1.0,"I bought this bra to wear after I had a surgery on the left side of my chest, but it offered very little coverage & absolutely no support on my left side, so I couldn’t even wear it.  Don’t waste your money on this!"
1.0,I final returned mine because the jumping jack feature to shut the sleep alarm off stopped working. It finally got to the point I uninstalled the app and the system was still going off even when I dropped the unit off at the amazon hub store.
1.0,You get what you pay for. Cheap !
1.0,Reject!
1.0,Product stopped working
1.0,Made my earlobe sore for a week.
1.0,Way to small. Definitely not a large. It's about two sizes too small.
1.0,My product came without case and screen protector
1.0,Wish I didnt miss return wīndow
1.0,"Slim fit, too short and the neckline is almost too small. The fabric is polyester but was described as a cotton blend when I bought it. This has been updated in the description. The stitching is the biggest problem. The seams aren’t straight which causes the shirt to lay weird. There is fabric bunching at the neckline which looks bad and very visible. Ultimately, it looks and feels cheap. Disappointing, as I was very excited about the pattern."
1.0,I only had it a week and it broke... so sad..
1.0,Not well made masks.  They don’t shape my daughters face well on top of that they are not very thick.
1.0,No tempered glass like it says. My phone rattles inside. Its not a snug fit
1.0,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!!! This hat is not what I expected at all. My son was very upset and said he could of made the hat himself. Doesn’t look like the picture at all. I wouldn’t have given them one star but amazon made me😒 Don’t waste your MONEY ON POOR QUALITY material...
1.0,"This is not an accurate depiction of the product.  Please note, item is not of sweatshirt material, and the gnomes are screen-printed on versus charactures.  Totally disappointed!  False advertising..."
1.0,These were suppose to be necklace and bracelets sets. I only received the bracelets and one was broken.  No return contact
1.0,The dress makes you look fatter than you are.
1.0,I love the feel but not happy that they literally only laster two weeks. The earlier ones were better. Can't believe amazon will make me pay 8 dollars to ship back.
1.0,"This dress looked adorable,  but is very cheaply made,  and tore after one wear! Im very disappointed and returning! Do not buy."
1.0,this bracelet has a magnetic clasp but doesn’t work. don’t buy.
1.0,This dress is so weird and ugly I wasted my money 🤡
1.0,The shorts had strange sizing listed on the label.<br />The sizing on Amazon had US site.  The shorts were way too small.
1.0,"It’s not even made properly, don’t waste your money"
1.0,Dont light at all
1.0,The &#34;Wine&#34; is a Bright Red.
1.0,"Material is very misleading in photo. The material is more of a shinny satin looking, not at all what I was looking for"
1.0,Literally whole sole came off!!!<br />Absolutely ridiculous!!<br />Cheap cheap..and I dont mean the price!!
1.0,I didn't like the band it keep coming apart.
1.0,I didn't like this kit very much as I recieved 2 of these & the brass kit was left out.
1.0,I have never had any problems with compression socks. These ones did not do their job. They slid down my calves and bunched up at my ankles. By the end of the day they had done more harm than good by creating wrinkles around the ankles and thus becoming very uncomfortable. Would not recommend.
1.0,So full of threads inside of sock can't get foot in sock
1.0,What I got in the mail was completely different from the picture! It is just a long really big ugly shirt! Very disappointed!The sides or the bottom do not look like the picture. Why would they post a picture different than their product and waste the customer's time?
1.0,This dress looks as though it came from a yard sale. No tags. Don’t even specify if I have to correct size. I ordered a size up to be sure I could fit it and this is not correct. Could’ve been cute because the quality isn’t that bad.
1.0,"Very disappointed in this. We have some very large freezers we have employees working in and we wanted to keep hem warm while they are. We bought this as a test piece to see if it works and to our disappointment it does not. The light flashes green, blue and red but nothing happens. Hold the power button and nothing. Left a question for the seller asking for assistance and also got no response. Buy something a little more expensive and save yourself the hassle."
1.0,Gems were missing when I took it out of package.<br />Blue color is more green/blue. Still pretty color just thought it'd be more blue blue.
1.0,"It's pretty once you get it on.....other then that, you can't get off to pee...lol.."
1.0,Bottoms are VERY short!
1.0,A LARGE RAN LIKE AN XXL ... WAY TOO BIG.
1.0,Came squished in a bag. The blinky lights only work if I physically hold the connecting wires. Absolutely not worth $25. Am returning.
1.0,Very cheap material. Poorly constructed.
1.0,"Fast Delivery, Great Product!!  Don't shop too often on-line, especially for shoes..but this makes me a believer!!"
1.0,Cheep quality
1.0,Item arrived damaged.  Plastic detached from black seam for 5 inches.  Too much of a hassle to return for the price of the item.
1.0,"I don't leave a whole lot of reviews.  But, after receiving this pack of t-shirts.  I was excited because it was cheap being a 3 pack and wsaw that the material was somewhat comfortable.<br /><br />BUT, I ordered 2xl because I saw another review talking about the item fitting small.  I tried mine on and a 2xl fits like large.  I wear large in every other brand of t-shirts.  Already ripped some tags off, so I can't return.  I'll be stuck with these I guess.  Don't buy!"
1.0,Feels more like foam than &#34;leather&#34;.
1.0,Easy to install (for an Apple Watch band). But after 4 months I got a rash. I tried to clean it and it ended up getting green. I put tape over it but my rash still got worse by month 6. Haven’t used my watch since
1.0,Excited to receive my white colored band and wore it 3 times before the metal metal  nod fell off. Can’t return it  since it’s been worn. 😞
1.0,This is nothing like the picture at all. The material is not warm and it’s thin and cheap.
1.0,Not same as they detailed it for regular watch I can’t use it at all
1.0,No! No noooooo
1.0,This dress ran very large.
1.0,I wear a size 10 and the large are to small so I can't get them on.
1.0,"Arrived broken, cheaply made"
1.0,"very cheap looking, not what I hoped for."
1.0,Product fell apart with first use.  Don’t waste your money.
1.0,The cut is waaaaay too small. Bout it for my son in a size that’s usually a little big to have room to grow and it was TOO SMALL! Perfect cut for a slim/skinny build. Length was good though.
1.0,Horrible the time is ALWAYS WRONG
1.0,Not as depicted! Very fake looking! Poor workmanship. Cheap looking
1.0,No tengo mi pedido queria saber si lo dejaron en otra direccion gracias
1.0,Item was not true to size. Way to small
1.0,Ordered a medium but when it arrived it was more like an x-small. Couldn't get it over my head because it was so tight & no give in the material. Very disappointed because I really like it
1.0,This dress was large it was too small
1.0,I ordered this tank top for my upcoming Disney 1/2 marathon in 2 weeks.  It took 3 weeks to arrive and is a horrible fit.  I’m 5’3” and approximately 140 (muscular) pounds.  It fits but it is too snug for my comfort level.  Lesson learned - I should have just ordered something from a local screen printer (which I’m forced to do now anyway).  I even ordered an XL after reading other reviews.  Super disappointed.<br />I am attaching a photo.  The adidas ultimate t on the right is (that I am adding for comparison) a ladies medium.  The tank I received is labelled XL.
1.0,Did not like the the material. Made from a cheap scratcie synthetic material that doesn't breath. The buttons are gorgeous. Decided to keep for winter and maybe later with a cotton T and pair of boots.
1.0,"Bought a XXL, fit like a medium. Cheap material. Save your money!"
1.0,The press in the felt hat is at about 5:00 instead of directly pointing forward. Looks like someone had a few too many to drink when they made this hat.
1.0,They are okay glasses and blocks some of the light but my eyes are still tired after I take them off. The glasses themselves are kind of flimsy and my nose piece kept falling off so I emailed the seller and told him my problem and mind you my glasses was still under warranty and he replied back saying I need to ship the glasses to him which meant I would have to pay for shipping also. I asked him why and the seller never replied back so I had to go through Amazon support to get my glasses fixed and Amazon did not charge me shipping and sent me a new pair.
1.0,I bought it for me size large  and fits to my daughter that she is size xsmall
1.0,"The pants does not stretch, if you have big glutes and big thighs  i do not recommended."
1.0,"This what photo and description is deceiving, extremely small. I would have not imagined, this might just be for a toddler ! And the chain connecting it is not sturdy ! Very disappointed in my purchase I don’t even wear it *Sighs* the color is nice though"
1.0,Faster broke within the first hour of wearing. We returned the first one for the same reason.
1.0,"I've purchased and enjoyed other Biadani knit open front cardigans, so I looked forward to adding a green and a blue to my fall wardrobe. These are a completely different fabric that feels, well, *crunchy* and not soft and silky like my other cardigans. Hand washing made the problem worse. They are unwearable."
1.0,Poor quality broke within a week save ur miney
1.0,Looks very cheap.  Not at all what was pictured when I bought it.
1.0,FAKE SUNGLASSES - I have these from Tom Ford and they broke.  bought a replacement and they are as FAKE as the day is long.
1.0,Didn't stick
1.0,"Terrible job at sizing for the skull prints (both the plain black/white, and the female skull/butterfly).  Very thin and poor quality.  Virtually unusable.  Our kids tried them on as tube tops as a joke. The laugh was more valuable than the product.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"These are really nice glasses but they are being delivered with stones missing and I replacements , this is my 30th pair and 14 out of 30 has been delivered like this"
1.0,This is cute on but cheaply made. I would not advise buying this. The threading on the sides came loose and I had two HUGE holes in the pants where the stitching was by the end of the day. So disappointed because I got a lot of compliments on it for the style and color but it's not seen well at ALL.
1.0,Worst thing ever order from here
1.0,The pockets ripped after the first wash I am extremely disappointed. Very cheaply made apparently.
1.0,"i have a 34-35 inch waist and a 34 inch inseam.  these were 6-8 inches too short and too big up top offering zero compression and were a bit loose around the waist.  they did have good compression in the calves, but not really in the thighs.  i really enjoy the fit and quality of the regular Tesla compression pants, but these were not in the same league.  the stitching was also snagged or coming loose in one place on the leg.  i had tried to purchase a pair of these size medium from a different seller in past and couldn't even get them on.  so i guess never trust the thermal pants from tesla.  i love the regular compression though.  also i got a thermal shirt and it's great."
1.0,"Awful - very cheap, poorly made, too short and too small (and I ordered one 2 sizes larger to it would be roomy).  They offered me a refund if I would pay the shipping back to ENGLAND which would cost double what I paid for it. BE WARNED... DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AS THEY ARE NOT IN THE UNITED STATES!"
1.0,"The wire itself is plenty strong enough, but the clasp which is used to secure both ends is not.  All of the tags were torn from my luggage as I traveled.  One of them fell off as it was being loaded by the very first baggage handler.<br /><br />A good idea but very cheaply made and poorly executed."
1.0,I’m very sad that Cleo is discontinuing the Marcie style in favor of this new style. The top does not fit well at all. Very loose and the small mesh section between the embroidery and lower cup sticks out weirdly. Booo. Bring back Lily and Marcie.
1.0,It is not the same one pictured.<br />The material is much thinner.<br />The shape isnt very flattering after the first wash.
1.0,Bought these for my husband and within a week they’re already falling apart at the seams
1.0,"The watch is very cute and my 5yo daughter loved it. Unfortunately, it broke exactly one week to the day we received it. The belt broke and the buckle came off. She didn’t wear it at night or during bath time, and only wore it a few hours during the day. I wasn’t expecting it to last forever, but considering it cost $15 I expected a lot longer than one week."
1.0,"Ordered a small bc people said it runs large. But holy wow even in a small it doesn't fit at all. I'm not a super small skinny person either. I know this year, baggy sweaters are popular. But this is ridiculous.  As soon as the holidays are over I'm going to request a return."
1.0,I ordered a 3X to wear as a dress and it came so small i cant even put it on. The design on the shirt looks like someone colored it with markers. The design is all over the place and a very poor quality.
1.0,Band broke in two weeks it’s cute but not strong! Waste of money!
1.0,love the look but got a run and the crostch ripped within the first couple of hours. These are very thin!
1.0,This isn't really black - it's kind of gold/brown - and it definitely isn't 100% cotton...feels like pure polyester.  I gave it one star only because they offered 50% off when I tried to send it back.
1.0,"Item is way too small and gets really hot.  I was reasonably happy with it when I tried it on initially.  It kept my mask off of my mouth while I was breathing which is what I was looking for.  However, after about 15 minutes I had a sweat ring where the silicone piece was.  Also, as I talked it kept slipping below my nose and caused the mask to move as well.  I wasted money on this because I was willing to try anything to get the mask off my face.  Now I have ten of them that will all likely go to the landfill.  My wife and even my young children all think the same thing about these.  Too small even for my children."
1.0,"Broke after the first use. The Bridge cracked. This is not the first pair I have had, no issues with the others that lasted 6 months until I broke them when they fell off my head and I ran over them. Not sure if they went with a cheaper plastic, but these were junk."
1.0,The material and quality are perfect but unfortunately I received it with a stuck zipper so I can't trying it on properly.
1.0,Very disappointed....way to small and tiny
1.0,TARNISHED. UGLY.
1.0,Junk junk junk
1.0,It's small and came with 2 holes in the sleeve. The material seems very thin. Looks pretty so I'm gonna fix the holes and keep it.
1.0,I was not wide leg like the picture and was a stretchy bodycon fabric not the cotton it looks like. I returned it the same day I received it.
1.0,"After 2 months it stopped working. I knew it wasn't going to last long for the cheap price, but really, that was short."
1.0,Will only fit a size 28&#34;-35&#34; waist. Bad odor and poor material
1.0,This necklace is cheaply made. You get what you pay for. It should cost more like .99 cents. I dont recommend it at all. Its not worth the price. The tear drops are actually really small and they crunch up. Total disappointment!!!
1.0,READDY FOR REFUND.
1.0,Not good quality. Chain is uneven - one side is longer than the other - so necklace doesn’t hang properly. Color of chain is too dark. Wouldn’t recommend this item.
1.0,Band falls off and won’t keep time. Glitches and resets time. Wouldn’t recommend 0/10
1.0,Lens keeps popping out!
1.0,No longer needed the item and when i went to return it i had to pay 6$ shippping. So i just threw them in the trash.
1.0,Beautiful and comfortable unfortunately the rose gold color on the tree is completely gone after 4 days
1.0,Poor quality material. The dress was clingy in a bad way and see through.
1.0,I wore this at a birthday party and I was dancing and next thing you know my necklace was on the floor. This was cheaply made I didn’t expect it to fall off my neck while I was dancing. Only wore it once.
1.0,This fabric got little balls on it and became very scratchy.  Happened to the grey pair but not the black.
1.0,Very bad quality for the prices. The watch is fuel of humidity.
1.0,Not fitted. Oversized and sleeves are flappy. Not attractive fit.
1.0,So angry! These are super cute ut I just put them on to wear for the very first time and one fell completely apart!!! So frustrating!!
1.0,I don't know who invented the messed up plastic clips that hold them on to the glasses but they should have to try and put these on while driving !!!  it AIN'T gonna happen !!
1.0,"These are a child's boxers, not an adult.  I ordered a medium for my husband and they may fit a 10 year old boy"
1.0,Buckel is too wide .....won't fit through belt hoops on pants ...
1.0,The actual product looks nothing like the photo. There is way less to the solid colored portion of the dress. Had to return it. There's a reason it's so cheap!
1.0,My little gymnast wore this once and the seam busted!
1.0,"I thought this was a nice bag, and the straps are actually kind of cushy and stretchy, so more comfortable, but the bag barely lasted before both sets of straps ripped off."
1.0,the swim suit is very nice however it doesnt last more than two months i used it once a week to do exercise class in a pool for about 30 min. after about 2 months it was very faded and got a hole by the zipper so it not wearable any more
1.0,Recieved the wrong item. And the item I did receive looked cheap
1.0,This item deserves no stars.<br /><br />So paper thin. Not fit to sale at no fee.<br /><br />This scarf has slight holes in it when received.
1.0,It changed color in one week
1.0,I got my swim suit home and tried it on and I wear a size 14 in jeans so I ordered a xxl and it fits everywhere but the length of the strad area. everything about it was comfy and very pretty but on the side without the strap kept falling down and exposing the goods lol so  if ordering this order it way bigger
1.0,"Wanted to love these because they SEEM so sturdy and good for outdoors, but our lace loops broken off from the shoes within 3 weeks. In multiple places. Such a disappointment given the price, not very durable for children old enough to put on their own shoes."
1.0,Comfortable but low quality construction came apart at the seams in 2 weeks
1.0,Product didn’t have what I needed
1.0,"I hate wearing bras, so I bought these thinking they would be a good replacement. They stick straight on and stay all day, but as soon as I remove them, my skin that contacted the adhesive was red, scaly, and itchy. Will not be buying again. Ow."
1.0,This is mesh fabric and not a quality mask. There are two giant holes in the mask. It doesn’t filter out dust. Forget using it for the pandemic.
1.0,It didn't stay on shoes not recommend
1.0,The size chart lies. They're too small. Also itchy and uncomfortable.
1.0,This shirt would be good for casual wear but CAP members should be aware that this does NOT meet uniform regulations per CAPR 39-1.  Also not sure it doesn't violate copyright laws. Just an FYI
1.0,Do not hold onto shirt.  It was very bad purchase
1.0,I ordered one size 30x30 it was great!! Perfect for me Inlove the pants so I ordered 5 more (different colors) same size all of them arrived super small I couldnt even close the button which was weird because it's same size as previous. So I returned them. Now I ordered new one size 32x31 and guess what?? It's even smaller then the others. So I don't know what to say I am very disappointed. On the tag they put a sticker of the size 32 on a S size.
1.0,Cheaply made. A snap came out immediately upon first try on.
1.0,The gaps in the shoulders are too small and the material is very flimsy. Don’t buy
1.0,"Very cheap. It works to add fluff to a dress, but I doubt it will last. Not great quality in the least."
1.0,Hat is not a winner folks. Very floppy and extremely large. Probably best to avoid this one.
1.0,They fit really weird.
1.0,Does not lay well and poorly shaped. Not what picture shows at all. Disappointed.
1.0,The necklace was broken into three pieces when I received it! I would have loved it had it not been broken!
1.0,the hat came out of the box broken... never order again...
1.0,Poorly made. Got holes within hours. Threads cut cut. Sloppy sewing/serging job. Complete waste of money. Do yourself a favor and do not purchase these.
1.0,"These are really small.  If are a normal sized US male that is half-way athletically fit, these sleeves are short and tight,  I can't pull them up to my elbows."
1.0,"This is so small,bought one 6 years ago was great big like a rodeo buckle this one is about 1/3 the size.😟"
1.0,"Picture is not at all accurate, dont care for the glasses that arrived."
1.0,"Putting new watch band on there is a small knob to push to get pin to move in to slide it in place. I barely pushed it, not even enough to get the pin pushed in and the little knob just popped out of the hole in the pin. It just broke! On my first attempt to gently push pin in! I got the band on using a pin I poked  into the hole where the little knob came out of but what a pain! Don't want to bother exchanging it."
1.0,These earrings are pretty heavy and weigh my ears down so unfortunately I can’t wear them.
1.0,"When the package arrived, I was very disappointed with this product. The shirt was too small, the sleeve ruffles fit nothing like pictured, and there was a giant hole in the side from it not being sown correctly. Huge disappointment."
1.0,Complete rubbish. Ordered 4 pairs. Like flimsy toys. Could not be focused. The focusing cheap plastic scew just fell out releasing the  lenses.<br />NOT MERCHANTABLENQUALITY - RIP OFF
1.0,"The foam inside the sealing ring is very shallow.  As a result, the foam presses against my ear when I wear these.  this causes pain within about 15 minutes and they are unwearable.  They need a much deeper ring around the outside of the ear to seal properly.  I returned these."
1.0,"The shirt fit as expected, but it just didnt lay right. Something was off about the shirt. I'm returning it. I wouldn't purchase."
1.0,I should have returned these immediately.  One lens doesn't stay up.  I have to hold it in place which isn't exactly what I was hoping for.  I now have the lens taped to the frame so it's always in the upright position.  Total disappointment
1.0,I never received it so no I can't review the item.  I demand a refund and will not order from this manufacturer again.
1.0,I loved the look of this band but it broke at the bending point of the buckle after wearing 5 times.  I would return but it is 7 days after the return date. Very unhappy!
1.0,Terrible quality. The stone fell out less than an hour after I put it on.
1.0,It is a cute dress but the holes in the front are not sewn around for reinforcement.  I felt it would not wash well or last long. I returned mine.
1.0,"Bought shirt from the lowest priced seller. It was NOT a deluxe shirt  I think I received an inexpensive &#34;knock off&#34; of the original. It was not the color illustrated and that I ordered. The printing was centered on the front not down the left side as pictured. The material was extremely light weight. I can literally see through the back in normal room lighting. I wrote to tate seller and did not receive a response. They appear to no longer be selling on Amazon. Do not buy solely based on price, I did, and got burned."
1.0,returned it  Didn&#34;t like it at all
1.0,I ordered a large then an XL they were both way to small..
1.0,"The material is so cheap and the sewing on the sleeves looks uneven and bunches up. The photo they use is not the same photo as what they send me. The color of the product is very bright, and again, not what the photo shows."
1.0,These were listed as one size fits all (which I am assuming they meant would stretch to fit a considerable number of sizes...) but I couldn't wear them as they were incredibly tight around my waist - which I don't consider to be huge - I'm about a size 6.  Too bad because I think they would have been really cute.  I'll just have to find a smaller friend to give them to.
1.0,Bad bad bad.
1.0,For it to be a romper the neck part should be a little bit more stretchy
1.0,Missing ‘I’m a f#%^!’ I’m so annoyed I have to waste my time to return these for refund !
1.0,These pants are so lightweight and cute. However they run very small. I will be sending them back.
1.0,"Each one was cut different, three out of four fit uncomfortably tight."
1.0,"The only positive thing about these earrings is the color.  The post arrived crooked or bent.  I had to straighten the post and because they were so thin and pliable I was afraid I would break it.  The post was also too short.  The long dangle did not fit properly on the post and no matter what I did I could not get the earrings to hang right.  Also I tried putting on just the earring without the dangle part and because the post was so thin, the earring also did not fit.  I am not sure what else to say about them.  I returned them the same day that I got them.  The concept or idea for these earrings was good, but the execution was terrible.  These earrings were inexpensive, but they were not even worth the amount that they cost."
1.0,"First of all, what I received is not the brand advertised on Amazon. Secondly, it fits smaller than the listed sizing. The sleeves are about an inch too short.<br /><br />If your build is anything but &#34;bean pole&#34; don't buy this shirt.<br /><br />If you have any sort of bicep muscle at all, I mean *any* muscle, don't buy this shirt. You won't be able to fit your arms in the sleeves.<br /><br />If you have any sort of shoulder muscle at all, and I mean *any* muscle, don't buy this shirt. You'll bust the seams.<br /><br />If you have any sort of flesh between your rib cage and your skin, whether that's pectoral muscle, man boob, latissimus dorsi muscle, back rack, whatever... don't buy this shirt. You'll feel like you've been stuffed in a sausage casing.<br /><br />If you have any spare pounds around your midsection, *any*, don't buy this shirt. You'll pop the bottom button when you sit down.<br /><br />I am a regular guy with a few extra pounds who works out a few times a week. I'm neither the Incredible Hulk nor the Incredible Bulk. I've got other brands of slim fit shirts that fit great, and according to measurement.<br /><br />This shirt will not work.<br /><br />All that being said, the shirt looks good. I imagine it'd look great on someone escaping Auschwitz and starvation rations.<br /><br />I'm starting the return process now."
1.0,I received the item minus the extension (&#34;T&#34;). After reading about how many have had this problem it makes you wonder why this has not been corrected.
1.0,"I enjoy the new sliding trend in belts, and decided to try an off-brand from the usual, as it was on sale. The belt is stylish, the buckle is cool, and it functioned as necessary. For roughly a month.<br /><br />Now, the latch part of the buckle will let loose if I stretch the wrong way, lean the wrong way, or a strong enough gust of breeze blows around me. While it never completely unhooks the belt, it is awkward to have it pop loose while wandering around.<br /><br />It's a decent product, looks good, mine might just be defective or broken from when I use it to beat neighborhood crooks.<br /><br />Update: It's now October, and the latch pops loose 100% of the time unless I tighten the belt to almost maximum. Verdict: failure."
1.0,Broke the 1st time I wore it
1.0,outside front screw cover came off as soon as I put them on.  had to superglue so the frame would not slide up or down. horrible.
1.0,"Fades redish really bad within a couple of months. Love the design, wish it would last longer"
1.0,"The product is adorable by wouldn't fit even a child. Very sad with this purchase, complete waste of money since it took so long to arrive and can't return it now."
1.0,"Feels cold, unfriendly and thin and certainly offers no compression. Will be returning it and never ever buying it again. The &#34;Jiao Miao Mens Waist Body Shaper T-Shirt Vest Tank Tops&#34; is so much better in every way."
1.0,This watch looks very nice but I ordered one and it didn’t work so I exchanged it and new one also doesn’t work!! Very unimpressed!!
1.0,The elastic in the waist band constantly twists making them fit awkwardly. I returned them.
1.0,I paid for a plastic necklace!! This was a wast of money!!
1.0,This toe ring was Cheap to say the least and so I suppose I got what I paid for.  Wouldn't buy it or recommend to a friend.
1.0,i wore this ONCE and washed it by hand. The material is coming apart at the seams and where the arms join the body of the blouse. I have sent several reports to the seller regarding this and have no response..
1.0,Color heavily misrepresented! Not as pictured at all but good size & material though
1.0,This dress was unflattering and completely shapeless.  I had to return it.
1.0,The color is not at all as pictured. It looks like a pastel pretty blue on the product photo but it is actually very bright and cheep looking. Also it arrived smelling horrible and it was damp. Would NOT recommend!!
1.0,Quality is way worse than I expected.  The lining in one of the sleeves was sewn in twisted - so twisted I could barely get my arm through (I thought it was sewn shut at first).  The entire coat hung on an angle - I feel like the whole thing was sewn skewed.  And the worst?  The buttons are too big for the button holes...I don't even know why Amazon is carrying this product.
1.0,"Cheaply made. Will probably give as a gift to my 1 year old grandson. Not for a 6 foot 2, 290 pound man what so ever. Not worth the price simply because of the popularity of the Mandalorian series."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:28c55505369ef98fe2d5e603cc1e021c]] Ordered an XL cuz these costumes usually run small. The dress itself was indeed XL and was even loose on me, but nothing else is. The straps around the neck are only a single layer of faux leather cut into shape, very easy to break, and not shaped correctly to lay on the neck properly. The stockings don't have the extra dip for your heel so the back of them is always pulled down further than the front. The stockings aren't XL and aren't long enough to actually reach the thigh. Theres nothing to keep them up so they fall down your leg as you walk. The gloves aren't large at all, can't even fit your thumb all the way through the hole and restricts hand movement. Also the dress arrived with a rip in the side. You'd have a much better cosplay just making it yourself. I'm thinking about keeping the dress but fixing all the straps and getting new stockings."
1.0,Ordered to fit size 0-6 Months and the shoes came in looking like they were big enough for a 3 year old. DISAPPOINTED!
1.0,Terrible… magnets not strong. Thought that by paying a little more I would get a better product but that was not the case. Would not recommend.
1.0,"This is cheaply made, ugly fitting,  unflattering, ridiculous shipping fees. All around save your only and time"
1.0,Tag is sewn into the outside of the sweater. How stupid can you be to do this.
1.0,Sizing runs very small
1.0,"Despite the item description, this DOES NOT fit the Huawei Watch 2 whatsoever. The band is too narrow and the pins are too small to fit into the watch and actually be able to remain in place. It's a shame because it's an otherwise nice looking band. Unfortunately, no matter how nice it looks, if it can't fit the watch it claims to be for, it doesn't serve any purpose."
1.0,The bracelet broke after three uses and the black was peeling.  Dam shame cause it's very nice looking
1.0,Ordered XXL even tho I typically wear XL but still WAY too tight.
1.0,Was supposed to be for anti glare hd night vision driving but were only sunglasses
1.0,"Pretty color, but much too short for a tongue piercing. You can put it in, but it's so tight that you will be in a lot of pain the next day from it pinching your tongue"
1.0,Item showed up missing one earring. Poor packaging. Cellophane was opened. Bummed:[
1.0,"1st vest fit like a 3T, a 3 year old would have a hard time squeezing into it.  After requesting a refund, they denied but sent me a larger vest...it wouldn't hold a charge.  horrible product."
1.0,"Very pretty but very low quality. I bought these for my 9.5 month old daughter and started using them this week. All three fell apart during the first day of use. Not thrilled, especially as these weren't particularly inexpensive."
1.0,"Los colores que llegaron estan invertidos, y el foto denpublicidad estan correctos, porneso lo compre. Pero como Dominicana no puedo usar algo que la distribución de los colores estan colocados de forma erronea. Colocar el rojo el la parte superior izquierda de la bandera dominicana significa que estamos en guerra, lo cual no es cierto. Es una falta de respeto a la bandera de una nacion libre, independiente y soberana.<br />Muy molesta"
1.0,"It is way to small. I am 5'2"" and 125 lbs, I got a large and it mabey it would fit a 8 yr old girl at best!"
1.0,It’s way too short from the back. You can’t really wear a tank top:spaghetti strap shirt unless you still want all your back to be showing. Just not flattering at all.0
1.0,Very thin material. Not what the picture showed at all. Poor quality and not very appealing. Sent back
1.0,Super cheap material. Product is WAY overpriced.
1.0,THIS IS NOT .925 STERLING SILVER! There is no stamp anywhere on this ring!
1.0,La verdad la tela es muy corriente y se trasparenta todo no me gusto la verdad
1.0,"Did not work from get go, beautiful item but now I have to find someone to repair a new watch"
1.0,It is a cheap dress. I won’t even wear it at home. Don’t waste your money. It is very short even though I ordered on size bigger and also the material is terrible
1.0,"Stuck one time. And not even for the entire night! We own other sticky bras and thought the shape of this one was better for the dress. Much too expensive for one time use, specially since it didn't last all night!  SOOOOOOO disappointed!!! Save your money."
1.0,See through thin tights! Don't waste the money!
1.0,I ordered this for a present and got a frigging musical note necklace instead. WHAT???? I don't think one remotely looks like the other.
1.0,Definitely not true to size. WAY TOO SMALL
1.0,"Much too small, unless you are a small teenager."
1.0,The material is not what I expected. I don't like it.
1.0,"I thought the jacket looked great in the ad. I was totally disappointed after i got it .it didn't seem like linen at all. In fact, it looked like a black smock."
1.0,"Ordered an XL for a person that normally wears a large, it was too small. Sizing chart is not accurate :(.  Especially bummed as this was a gift, also paid overnight shipping for no reason"
1.0,"I'm not usually someone who likes to write reviews but this time I was so pissed. The moment I got those jeggins, I didn't like it. Unfortunately, I was unaware that I couldn't return it. I had no choice but wear it.<br />To my luck, I found a big whole in the back!! I would not recommend it whatsoever.<br />Sorry for the bad review"
1.0,I dont believe this is authentic Philip Stein.  It is very difficult to get the watch band to stay on the watch itself.
1.0,I bought this hat to wear Outdoors while cutting grass. What sold me on this hat was it had shown a picture of a chin strap in case the wind blows It Off. Mine came with no chin strap!
1.0,This shirt was HUGE! I had to tie up both straps just to keep it from drying past my chest and even then is huge. I now use it to sleep in
1.0,The size of this top is mean for a level lower than petite.
1.0,Pensé que era diferente no me gusta no la recomiendo
1.0,The product is cheaply made not worth the money. I am very disappointed the first time I had to return it because it was so small it wouldn't even fit my 6 year old daughter. I reorder the biggest size and am still not happy with it. The material is so thin do not use this company.
1.0,I wish I could give negative stars for an item. This was horrible!!!!! We took it out of the package and the chemical smell was overwhelming. I had to use alcohol on my hand to get the smell and feel off my hands. The product was obviously way too small and I don't know what it was made of. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS---IT IS TERRIBLE.
1.0,"I wore this belt four days and the plastic material has split full width. There is a second split getting ready to break apart.  I've never written a review where I wanted to leave a zero star, but now I wish I could"
1.0,"Nada que ver con la imagen, es feo y demasiado caro para su diseño y calidad."
1.0,"Arrived with broken ""arms"".."
1.0,Not true to size very small a 2 xlg fits like a child small
1.0,Way to heavy! Unless you have super thick ear lobes you probably don't want these. They are super cute but will fall forward and eventually out of your ear.
1.0,Clearly Asian sizing and American sizing is very different! The material was paper thin and flimsy. Returned immediately. Total waste of time and money.
1.0,El color de base es terrible… es como un rosado muy muy feo../
1.0,"I was actually looking forward to receiving these. We have a wood burning stove we use often.  But I was opening the door with the gloves on and it got Hot on the finger...And it only takes a second to open the door,, I never expected that.  Even using the gloves I already had didn't do that...and they weren't made for use with a fire. It kind of bummed me out because I assumed I wouldn't have to worry about burning myself.  But just opening the door!!?  Very disappointing.  I could open the door with  Regular thick garden gloves and not worry. So basically I have to be extra careful each time I do a fire.  😞"
1.0,"Overpriced and when received the sizes where completly wrong, returning items."
1.0,When a received the package the crucifix was separated. Apparently it was glued.
1.0,"This was a waste of money, pinched finger, would not open or set to open. I was so made I through it in the trash."
1.0,Its super small on the waist.
1.0,Very frumpy looking... disappointing.
1.0,Thin see thru wrinkled ugly
1.0,I ordered a white gold with black mesh band and got a solid gold one with a gold link band. It is definitely not ultra thin. Very disappointed and sent it back.
1.0,Was WAY too thin and small
1.0,"the dress is not cotton, its polyester, fits clingy and it doesnt hang off the shoulders"
1.0,It's cheap so if you wanna buy it go right ahead.
1.0,Returning! Too small! Bought a 3XL and it’s more like. L/XL. Quality of the print I can just tell that in one wash it would come off. Also the Bumblebee and flowers don’t match. Definitely not what I was expecting.
1.0,Just opened it to use it snd the steaks to the bag are broken.  😟definitely renders this unusable for<br />Today.
1.0,"Not for dd women. I'm 36DD and these held for about 15 seconds before slowly peeling off lol also, I realize the cup part isn't supposed to cup the whole breast but it covered such a small portion of tata that it actually made my chest an odd shape. When I put my shirt on, the girls looked a little lumpy. Then the pasties peeled off lol I took a risk on the cheaper ones but I dont think I'll be attempting anymore gravity defying booby pasties in the future."
1.0,I gave them to my Wife and two daughters 14 months ago. Very expensive and none of them no longer work.
1.0,"Ordered size larger as I like loose fit.  It's not flowing as shown, but straight and tight.  I will donate it.  Thick fabric."
1.0,"Do not buy these. Bought for my husband and two weeks later, the polarized layer is peeling off.  Normal wear and tear and they are already messed up."
1.0,"NPS emblem is phony, cheap-looking iron- on, not a sewn on patch. Also, color of the hat is not as pictured, it is actually a chocolate brown. Not worth the money."
1.0,These pants are hugeeee! Size large fits like a 3x
1.0,"I bought this watch for my guy it stopped working within one week of the first time he wore it. He loved the look and sleep design of the watch, however he prefers to wear one that works"
1.0,"I put these on for a run and it took me about 5 minutes to utterly regret it.  I had to turn around and go back.  The problem is that the waist elastic is completely flabby and useless.  For one, it's a thin string of elastic instead of an all-over thick and responsive elastic fabric.  For two, the waistband is huge in proportion to the legs, so while I got a comfortable fit around the calves and thighs, the waist sagged awfully.<br /><br />Don't even think about putting your phone in the pocket, they'll fall straight to your ankles.<br /><br />For reference, I'm 150 lbs and was wearing a medium, so it's not like I got a size too large."
1.0,"Awful :'(<br />Compleatly see through! Not just the lace, ALL of it.<br />Seam is falling apart on zipper.<br />Stained on arrival.<br />Worst part is the hemline.  It is all different lengths!<br /><br />Now i have to go and have it lined, zipper fixed and hemmed to one length.  Such a headache!"
1.0,"I thought this would replace the pads on my glasses, but they were way too big."
1.0,"Extremely disappointed! It was advertised as 95% cotton 5% spandex. I was so excited to receive it but completely let down as I pulled it out and feeling/seeing it’s 100% polyester.<br />I did however like how it fit, I’m 5ft and it fell just below my knee; I’m normally a size large but decided to go with the medium and it did fit perfectly. Still returning as this is not the material I wanted."
1.0,"The picture is misleading, I only got 2 of the colors, 4 blue and 4 tan."
1.0,I don't like the watch at all because the light is not bright And it the letter you know the numbers on there are 2 small it's just not for me I don't like the way it is and I wish that the light black light would be brighter
1.0,"Horrible material. Threads hanging out around the sleeves, graphic looks very low resolution. Picture in front and back for some weird reason. This is all around strange. I would not recommend at all."
1.0,I didn't like it to much:( it could of been better but it was not......I don't recommend it it's a fail..
1.0,"They basically disintegrate when you put them on.  I thought they would be cheap, but IF you actually get them on without them falling apart, they’re still only 1 time use. I own other fishnet stockings that don’t fall apart, so it’s not like I’m being aggressive when I put them on, and I’m a size 6.5 narrow shoe so I’m not asking for a lot of stretch here"
1.0,"The measurements were a bit off for me.  The waist hit my long torso too high.  After one wash the material is all pilled up and ruined.  It is getting thrown away.  I’m so tired of all these items that do not hold up.  Also the slit on this dress comes all the way up to the waist. If you are sitting it is hard to keep your legs covered. If the wind blows, everything shows."
1.0,"Not at all what was pictured.  Light grey, ribbed cotton, poorly made. Returning."
1.0,"Made very cheap and because of that. It looked like a 12 year old did it. It fit small, it took 2 sizes up.  It's not jean fabric and it's not fleece. The picture is very misleading."
1.0,"False advertisement stainless steel is inexpensive jewelry and should last a lifetime. I purchased this September 9th and I do wear it everyday the charm is the only part that has not turned color. It’s a shame because I AM proud to wear it. However, it’s gett to that point where you don’t wear discolored jewelry at my age (50) or any other age. Too bad I couldn’t give this bracelet a better rating, but like I said stainless steel is inexpensive so why cheat the customer."
1.0,"I really wanted to like this suit but it was just too weird fitting. The torso was too small - almost like it was child size. The straps were angled so they would sit on my shoulders, they just kept sliding off. Since the torso was small the cups sat below where they were supposed to be. It was just a funky fitting suit."
1.0,"My granddaughter wears a 2t normally . I ordered a 3t hoping she can wear it in the spring . When i opened the package the item looked more like a size 12 months . The tag clearly said 3t on it . Although this was cute and i would have liked to order a size or three up , i did not because the sizing just can’t be trusted . Sent it back."
1.0,"The idea is great and it’s super cute. However, the problem lies in the quality. I noticed that the strip of material that has the bow material bound together was not completely sewn. After one usage, the material of the bow started slipping out of the middle strap. Because I can see this myself, I can fix this. However I’m not happy that I have to fix a new item myself. Shipping is also very long. By the time I received the item I forgot I ordered it."
1.0,The tank is really cute but the quality really bad. All the edges around the V neck and arms are uneven. I will have to fix it myself
1.0,"Fits awful.  Rolls down, pinches me on the sides.  Not a good fit at all and I don't have a big cup size.<br /><br />Bra falls off my boob, maybe too big, but then pinches me on the sides, just uncomfortable."
1.0,"The colors are great! The quality is good, but they don't tie. The slip and you can't knot them."
1.0,"The large fits like a small. It ripped behind the arm the second time I wore it. :(<br />I’m 5’8 athletic lady, the arms are too short, and it’s way too tight across the back when I’m driving or skiing. It’s too baggy around the waist. And is not as long as shown. Want to return it . Disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,was beautiful but don't buy. Sent back. sizes won't fit Americans.
1.0,Broke in 2 pieces second day I wore it. Made and looked cheap. I wouldn't buy it.
1.0,"I bought this for my sister, but returned it once i took it out of the package because of its size. It would have been way too large for her. Too bad, it looks very elegant. I didn't want to replace with another so I went and found stuff in person."
1.0,Pass
1.0,So small your size chart is off or something because I got the 6 which you show it fits in the nose perfect it does not I have bought 3 times now all wrong
1.0,Purchased a 3X not even a 2X also very thin<br />The reply email from the company said they were measured in Asia standards but don’t notice in the advertisement<br />Very sad material poor quality
1.0,The quality is not good. Within few minutes the powder disappears like a clean sweep and you have to add it again and again
1.0,cute bathing suit but runs very small
1.0,Not pleased with the way I got my band. It had been used before. The tool to take links out was broken and out of the package. One section of the band had been put on or back on backwards. There wasn't any paperwork with it. It was just tossed in the box. After some work I got it to work with my gear s2 but I will not be buying from this company again.
1.0,The product came wet and used! The cover was dry but the clothes inside were wet! I’m not even touching it!
1.0,Broke after one day
1.0,"Gave these to the better half as a stocking-stuffer 3 days ago. Monday she wore the amethyst and after a few minutes both stones came loose from their settings. Switched out to the pink quartz and one stone came loose as she was putting them in. Switched out to the Tiger Eye and made it thru the day with them. When removing them that evening, one stone came loose from its setting, and the other as she set it down on the dresser. This morning she attempted to wear the black agate/onyx and didn't make it out of the bedroom before both stones came loose. Obviously there is an issue with the bonding adhesive that is being used.<br />We had the &#34;As Seen on TV&#34; UV glue on hand and all earrings have been repaired. The few that did not fail, failed with the slightest pressure and were also repaired.<br />She loves them, so we are not returning them.<br />IF you buy these, also buy the As Seen On TV UV glue, you will need it."
1.0,This dress is made of very flimsy and rough material - I do not recommend it. Size was about right though.
1.0,The hat is cute.  But it was all folded up in a mailing envelope. I have been steaming it to get its shape back. That's why I gave it 1 star.<br />.
1.0,the material was a little itchy.  and exchange costed $
1.0,Willie's face is distorted.
1.0,My key chain broke less than 30 days. Not worth the price.
1.0,I received this item with a stain in the front.  Very visible.  Not a happy about that!
1.0,"The image makes it seem like a long sleep shirt type garment, even a mini dress. In reality… It is short, up to the belt area for the large.<br />But product unavailable so no exchanges can be made."
1.0,Very sad they way this looks. Not at all what the picture look like. :(
1.0,"Breaks easily. If your heads not narrow enough, it will hurt."
1.0,Too part too sheer too long and thin material
1.0,These earrings were junk. Tiny little pieces of junk. Ridiculously small
1.0,Its too shirt needs be longer and ti wear as base layer is to hot these shirts arent good unless wore as single layer
1.0,Crappy item
1.0,Did not like.  Poor quality and it looks ugly. Disappointed. I want my money back.
1.0,It arrived broken. I fixed it. Then had to go it again. I will keep it but would not get it again.
1.0,"Cut small and very see through, even with dark color/ black under garments . The material is very thin"
1.0,Very cheap feeling and looking. You can't even remove links so if it's too big or too small it won't fit. Spend the money for a better watch. I returned this and bought an Apple Watch Sport.
1.0,"Don't waste your time! The bar is too short to even go thru all the way, plus the ball screws on the back so it's dang near impossible to get it on (if you're lucky enough to even get it thru your peircing) The anchor is also a lot larger than it appears in the picture."
1.0,Material was super thin. And not what i expected for the price i paid. I returned immediately.
1.0,"This is foolishness,don't waste you're money buying it,change color in 2 days"
1.0,Quality not as expected. Very plastic and awful.
1.0,Very small. It's like I was sent a small shirt with a 2X tag
1.0,"I bought this to use as a protective sleeve at my job, the sleeve was too small and way too tight. Do not recommend"
1.0,Did not appear as advertised. The brim fell down in front of my face. Cheaply made. Returned item for credit.
1.0,"The overall length of these is 2.5'', not 2&#34; as in the description. The stones on the outer edge are dark blue, but the large stone is more purplish so they don't quite match. They arrived a day later than my other Prime items, packed in a HUGE envelope, like 9 X 12 sz., just bouncing around loose inside. The hook latch that goes in the ear was MISSING from one of the earrings, and was nowhere in the pkg..The earrings seemed almost bent...the large stones stuck out at a weird angle on both earrings that you can't see in the photo. I was very disappointed, as I had planned to wear them to my granddaughter's wedding. Returned them for a refund."
1.0,Worst fabric
1.0,Sizing completely wrong. Sizes are about 3 sizes smaller than advertised
1.0,Ordered a size 6 and received a size 10/12
1.0,Not for keloid bad stuff wire.
1.0,The plastic on these the is supposed to protect your eyes is really  flimsy and I wouldn’t have gotten them if I known that
1.0,I would have preferred the band come in sm/med lg/xlg.
1.0,"I’m wearing the pants that I was trying to replace. Soft touch grey and black spiderweb pants. These are white and black and not soft at all and are see through. Just One failed miserably with the new pants. I’m sending these back and ordering the last pair of the grey. The ones that showed up are just disappointing. Also, the delivery driver took a picture of a different package on my doorstep and they are trying to say these were delivered yesterday when they didn’t show up until today."
1.0,"I'm a female and got these bands.. it never specified it was a bigger band for bigger wrists.<br />Took every link out that i could and it is still too big, so now I have 2 bands wasted with no use for them. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Too big, heavy and difficult to adjust."
1.0,"can I please give a zero? This came with scratches everywhere, the edges were all scuffed up. Very disappointed."
1.0,I ordered two different colors. What I got was one purple with no ribbons to close the corset in the back. And one that is totally different dress as shown on the picture.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Definitely cannot get these wet whatsoever. You get what you pay for with these.
1.0,"Got this belt in December and it's already falling apart.  Paid decent money for this, didn't expect to be sewing it back together due to shoddy craftsmanship. I was weary of it before then due to the overall cheap feel and appearance, but I gave it a chance. Would never buy a product from these guys again. I'm back to wearing my 10 year old Levi's belt, it's old but hasn't busted a thread once."
1.0,Shoes are already coming apart was purchased on the 9th of June and it is now 22.. 14 days!! Don't waste your money!!
1.0,"Cannot fit buckle through belt loops on Carhartt or Levis jeans. You have too take buckle off, thread through loops and put and adjust buckle back on. pain in the ass!  Would not recomend"
1.0,Only had the shoes for a week and the threading is coming off as well as the leather in the back part of both shoes is peeling off.
1.0,It's like I got shipped all the flawed product. Patterns are all off they're stringy and falling apart.
1.0,"There are holes throughout the shirt part and a tag that I am unable to remove. Poor quality. Very thin and cheap looking. Very disappointed. On top of that, the pants look like they were made for a 10 year old, while the shirt part fits my 4 year old. The hat is way too small it barley fits my 4 month olds head. Dont waste your money on this."
1.0,"The logo is blurry and it took months to arrive, the worst purchase I’ve made on Amazon!  I ordered a large but it’s more like a medium that runs small..."
1.0,"This so called bracelet is plastic, ugly, looks and feels cheap,arrived worn and mispainted, and is NOT even CLOSE to the image the seller have of the 'product'. No one can actually like this, I would be embarrassed to wear this out in public, and I'm just 25. For shame, steer clear of this seller!!"
1.0,was to small
1.0,Tarnish with only one wear! Seller would not let me return.
1.0,Wear for one day and the cloth literally rips apart. Terrible quality!
1.0,"The underwear are advertised for women who’ve just had a C section, however they’re not comfortable to wear after you’ve just had one ! They’re very uncomfortable and the top rolls down !"
1.0,When they came they were already snagged.  Material is very thin and delicate.  I was ok with that but where they were snagged they ripped the rest of the way as soon as my wife tried them on.  I have contacted seller and i will post what happens after they respond and if its made right i will give a 5 star review for they are thin but very sexy.
1.0,"The fit was great, however my daughter wore these one time and the metal piece that holds the shoe string in came out and will not go back in. She’s so disappointed these didn’t last."
1.0,The shoe is beautiful and fits great. It broke on my third wear and the straps were rotted. Waste of money.
1.0,Poorly sized large fit like xs
1.0,"First, the description is wrong.<br />Second, the ""clasp"" is upside down and doesn't work<br />the neck is elastic and its one giant size, theres no way to adjust for each client"
1.0,was oxide
1.0,"received watch and did not work at all, I had to return it."
1.0,Fell apart do not even look good
1.0,"It might be hard to see in the pic, but it looks like I have a butt on my front. There is wayyyy too much material in the front. Ordered a medium and the waist is too tight."
1.0,It was supposed to appear like rhinestones but it looked like cheap pearls.
1.0,"THE CHEAPES PRODUCT I HAVE EVER BOUGHT!! I bought this product for my wife, and she wore it for two days before it fell apart. The materials are very cheap, and the packaging was horrible. I ordered two different types the other one was broken when I opened it because of the packaging. I do not recommend this product at all. I have given this review with the up most honesty, and integrity.<br />Thank you.<br />@THEHONESTTRUTH"
1.0,The bust area is a weird fit
1.0,This claims to be Yak 405D.  As you can see in the photo it is a Yak 255.  The shoes were too small.  I am returning them.
1.0,"Update: daughter wore these shoes for 30 minutes for an indoor photo shoot. By the end of the shoot all the jewels were gone!!!! What a waste of money.<br />Original: Upon pulling this out of the box I noticed that it is missing some of the little jewels. Also comparing it to other shoes, noticed how they are a bit smaller than all of the other size 10 shoes that we have."
1.0,This product runs way to small!
1.0,"I ordered it for 9.y.o.boy. He liked the style online. However it was nearly impossible to put them on. When he finally managed to put one on, it was a struggle to take it off. I had a feeling I was going to break his leg when helping him to take the boot off. It was simply ridiculous.  Just a side note-we never, never( !) had such problems before.<br />On top of it there is no fur/insulation on the top of the foot. Only in the shaft and wool sole. I can never understand it. The foot are is the most vulnerable part, why not to put insulation there?"
1.0,Is this a babies face mask they wrote Women and Men LOL are you kidding me I have a small face and wear the kids masks but oh these are for a baby !
1.0,I bought this for my 2yr old. It looks like part of it is coming apart on one side of it. The whole thing is unfinished as if someone just cut a piece of fabric & glued it together. My little boy loved the shark pattern but I’m very disappointed in the way this was made as this is not how it was pictured.
1.0,Ordered them first on Wish.com for $2.00 I was hoping these would be different. NOPE same exact trash
1.0,Bought for grandkids and way to big for an adult. Very disappointed
1.0,The hoodie instead of being black and white with black lining  came In Brown and tans as though their dies ran low and they just kept going making them anyways. The lining came in White not as pictured in black either.<br />I feel as though i just got cast offs or left overs. Something else to hang in  the closet and gather dust now.
1.0,Should be able to give ZERO stars. The suit case busted on first trip. It’s still locked tho.
1.0,"In this case, the low price was not a good value. The belt would not fasten at all until I used pliers to reshape the buckle. Who knows how long it will hold its shape?"
1.0,"I was very excited about this bag. It looked just like the picture and is very light with comfortable handles. However, it wasn't until I took it with me to a beach vacation when I discovered that the inner picket has a giant hole in it so anything I put in it disappears into the space between the bag and the inner lining. Very disappointing and can't return since I discovered the issue while using the bag."
1.0,This is a cute ring and I love that the butterfly spins but it will turn your finger green. Would never buy again.
1.0,I order a 2 XL but it was the size of a small. I have to give it away
1.0,the insole was thinner than the ones that came with the shoe.  they were the exact same brand.
1.0,"Very narrow, not what was expected for a adult tie. Had to order a different one."
1.0,"Terrible, fell apart immediately"
1.0,Very cheap material. Extremely see-through. Fit was 1 or 2 sizes smaller than normal.
1.0,Really big and very thin.  Wouldn't recommend.
1.0,Broke pretty quick :(
1.0,It fits with a case but it dont stick for long.. it now has a crack in the middle from being in and out of pockets since it dont stick it makes it come up sometimes
1.0,"Even though it fits in the waist, way too small in the croch."
1.0,Runs small and not good material
1.0,This tracking sea turtle bracelet was to come with information card to be able to track the sea turtle. They did not include any tracking information card with this bracelet.
1.0,"I wear in between a large and a 2X in shirts so I listened to reviews and ordered a 3X, I cant even zip the darn thing up. Its too tight."
1.0,"I ordered an XL size thinking my size 12 body would fit it loosely.  However, this is is so small, it wouldn't fit either of my tiny daughters.  Definitely do not recommend this shirt."
1.0,Tarnished within a week. Definitely not 14k gold filled.
1.0,"I got  this pair of boots on January 31st 2020 and in 6 months of not extensive wear ( we live in Florida) this pair looks completely worn out and causing knee pain. My husband really liked it when it was new and we thought we found boots for long time and we were planning to buy only this boots BUT 140$ for every 5-6 months it’s pricey. I contacted seller but NO answer so I fed we are on our own. Boots size 9,5. Hope you find my review helpful."
1.0,These earrings were not comfortable or flattering on my ear. I didn't realize the biggest stone would be at the top of your ear and the smallest stone would be at the bottom (you would think it would be the other way around).
1.0,I like the frames for my face. But I can only see infinite the middle of the lens. I can't see to either side or looking down. Everything is  complete blur. I'd  broke my old glasses.  So I have no choice. Until I get more. I strongly don't recommend.
1.0,Leaves a discoloration on your earlobe
1.0,Cheap made . They didnt ship my earings
1.0,It says girls but the size is more appropriate for an older teen/ woman.  It was soft but way too big.
1.0,Far too big
1.0,"They are very comfortable, I truly love wearing them except after the first week of wearing them I noticed the bottom coming apart and peeling up. Very disappointed."
1.0,I actually really liked the t shirt but after 1 wear and wash the letting began peeling off. Very disappointed in the quality.
1.0,"I ordered a 12 month old dress and got a large adults dress, which isn’t even an option to buy."
1.0,The rings were broken when they arrived. Return was smooth
1.0,Terrible fabric. Doesnt fit right at all.
1.0,Poor quality. The Velcro was so weak the strap didn’t stay closed.
1.0,The item showed up looking like a blonde afro and was completely useless. Gave it to my son for Halloween. He won craziest costume.
1.0,Advertised to fit the Vivoactive 4s…it doesn’t so I returned it.
1.0,Just a white pantyhose for the arm. No sun blocking effect.
1.0,Broke the first time I used it.<br /><br />Edit: the company contacted me after seeing my review and gave me a refund. I thought it was very thoughtful of them. I really appreciated it. I will try another item in the future.
1.0,The robe clung to me and  was too small. I threw it away cause I  can't return it. I am so disappointed.
1.0,Scratch easy
1.0,"I have ordered many baseball caps from Amazon and normally very pleased.  This one was the worst.<br />It looked like a little boy's hat when I put it on and the emblem was a iron-on patch which was not very nice looking.  I was going to send it back when I realized that they wanted me to pay for the postage back to China of all places!<br />I just decided to throw it away instead of spending another dime on it.  In the add it showed frontal support inside the hat which was not there when it came in.  Just an over all bad buy to have had so many goods ones previously.<br />If made outside the US, don't buy it!"
1.0,Shorts under are super loose and see through kind of voiding the use of the skirt short combo.
1.0,"I needed cotton. While the secondary line says the correct 95% polyester, there should not be any ""cotton"" word in this description. Disappointing that when I ordered it, the polyester did not show up in the first order.<br />Fit: not very true to size unless you have small bust and teensy hips."
1.0,Does not look anything like the material shown in the picture.
1.0,very poor quality and they made the neck part to small my daughter feels choking she used just for her party i do not recommend it.
1.0,came in as described I should of paid more attention ... these cufflinks are super narrow and small
1.0,"These are NOT LATEX FREE GLOVES!!!  They are latex powder free gloves, it says right on the side there is a warning label that people with a latex allergy shouldn’t use them! DO NOT BUY!!! I have a latex allergy and bought them because they were falsely listed!!!"
1.0,They shipped me only 19 pieces. The package was incomplete. The material is too strong for being a press earring. Is not easy to put and take off.
1.0,The outfit looks very nice on picture but the material quality is poor.  Nowhere close to the display.
1.0,"Not at all a 3/4 length sleeve dress.<br />The Gray color is very pale, not at all of the dark charcoal gray color that the photos portray!<br />The material is very, very thin, with absolutely no body.<br />It just hangs and all I can say is &quot; My Compliments To The Photographer &quot;, because the actual dress looks nothing like it's sample pictures!"
1.0,Absolute garbage. Not worth 1/5th of the cost. This is a blatant ripoff
1.0,Mediana calidad
1.0,SUPER SUPER short
1.0,"Not sure where this product went wrong hardest.  The Daisy logo tattooed on the lens? Funny... never mentioned it was a Daisy toy riffle product. The lens ..? Yeah. Two different shades.  That’s right.  Two.  Different.  Lenses.  I think if I got it at the “as seen on tv” section at the pharmacy, I could let it go."
1.0,broke After a couple days.
1.0,These had a strong smell when unpacked and made my chin break out when worn. I threw the rest away.
1.0,Very cheap. Uncomfortable metal ear
1.0,"This dress instantly started falling apart, before I had even put it on there was loose thread. Super cheaply put together; feels like a Halloween costume."
1.0,It didn’t fit I didn’t get to wear it. I am big body so I don’t blame nobody. But I would of thought it fit with the size I got but it didn’t
1.0,"The keychain is all rusty and ugly! The pom pom is not even round, it's a weird shape and it's a bit rough... thought it would be a better mimic of the other real ones but not at all. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Beautiful pendant, but chain sadly turned color within 3 days. I was highly disappointed when it’s advertised as 24k gold plated."
1.0,Studied the sizing guide. Read the reviews. Ordered accordingly. Couldn’t even get it over my head. Garage sale next Fall.
1.0,Way too small. Sleeves were absurdly short.  I've already given it to Goodwill. 😕
1.0,Cheaper almost costume like material.  Not really as expected.
1.0,Quality extremely low. Pin came off. Worthless.<br />Nice&#34;paint&#34; finish will deteriorate quickly. Would stay away from it.
1.0,"terrible quality, but price says it all."
1.0,way too small to fit in my piercing
1.0,Received and the top is totally tangled. Received as a secret Santa gift.
1.0,"I aired them out, washed them, they still stink really bad!"
1.0,"These are not a bad pair of sunglasses for the money,except,that's not a sticker in the upper left lens And the pair I got were in used cellophane and a stab wound in the lens."
1.0,Had to return front is for &#34;small&#34; men
1.0,Button fell off a month after purchase
1.0,Impossible to keep on our lo's hands.  Oh well...
1.0,"This item literally lasted 3 minutes. I put it on, zipped it up, and it fell apart. So I threw it away."
1.0,"Jeans look nothing like the picture, not the style or the cut nor the color even down to the pockets total false advertising"
1.0,"These flip flops were way to small for me. They fit my wife just fine, so I gave them to her. No muss, no fuss."
1.0,Pants are too small for me
1.0,zipper broke and ive only worn the skirt once
1.0,Cheap junk!!! It was delivered broke and took over a month to be delivered
1.0,"I received the purse today and am returning it for a refund. Luckily, it is eligible for free return shipping so no harm/no foul.  The zippers and hardware on the purse are cheap and garish. The faux leather material is not of high quality and the whole thing screams cheap.  I ordered it to replace a very favorite faux leather purse that actually looks like real leather. The side by side comparison makes this one even more hideous.<br /><br />Purses are tricky, a true &#34;to each their own&#34; deal. So someone else might love it or perhaps another color would look better. I ordered the black."
1.0,Sizing is way off.  XL ordered for someone that fits perfectly into an XL.  Needed at least 8 more inches around in order to even close it.
1.0,Ug! I felt like I was putting on a prairie dress. Heavy fabric. No flow.
1.0,"Once again as happens so often, way too often with any similar products purchased online, they RARELY ship a product that resembles the product in the photos. The shirt I received was nowhere near as long as the one in the photo. The shirt in the photo is more than twice as long as it is wide, but the shirt I received is nearly square. The length is no longer than the width, a totally different shirt. Of course the material is so paper thin one scan see through it... they always are. It appears to be a mid-thigh length shirt in the video, but in real life the shirt I received barely covers the waist line. And no! It has nothing to do with who is wearing the shirt, just laid out on the table, the distorted dimensions are obvious. I would never suggest anyone purchase this DECEPTIVE product. You will not get the product shown in the photo."
1.0,was all too small. not what expected.
1.0,"These glasses are junk. I dropped my pair once on carpet (not even a hard surface) and one of the arms snapped right off. The plastic was also somewhat yellowed when I got them, and I worry it would have gotten worse if I had them longer. It’s a shame, they’re cute, but cheap and poorly made."
1.0,"This suit was so very cute out of the bag, a touch too big but still cute in a baby Elvis kind of way (the collar I guess?). We were pleased and happily went to the pool to splash in the baby pool. Fast forward 25 minutes and the suit was was bleached to tan, powder blue and pastel orange... I couldn't believe that this fabric touted to be chlorine resistant, destroyed in 25 minutes. This has been returned and I will not be buying any thing else from this brand. Disappointing!"
1.0,Not enough beads in the string! Has a 4 bead empty space on the string!
1.0,Too big for 20mm lug tag heuer aquaracer and the included spring bars is in poor quality..
1.0,I don't know where these came from but they are like children's toys. I  threw them away
1.0,"I received this item as a gift. Within 6 weeks, I only wore it a few times and it has already turned colors!!! Unfortunately this was a waste of money for the person who bought this for me!"
1.0,"Lights burnt out in 30 minutes and snowman's eye was off, had to glue back on for my Christmas party. Total fail purchase."
1.0,I bought this is 3 colors and I had to return the lighter ones because it just wasn’t very flattering on me. I would say it does fit true to size and the length is good.
1.0,This fabric is not chiffon atp all. It’s similar to something you’d wear when you work out. Returned because it is not soft or flattering.
1.0,Too loose and o way to tighten the waist. It needed a drawstring.
1.0,Don't buy this
1.0,"I ordered blue first and liked them. They were soft, lightweight, and had a slimmer, tapered fit. I decided to order gray and I received a pair of heavyweight fruit of the loom sweats. The fruit of the loom tag is still inside and these are basic sweats. Very disappointed and will be returning the expensive fruit of loom sweats."
1.0,"The backpack is beautiful, but it has a “San Antonio Zoo” printed on the front.  I am returning this."
1.0,Runs very small. Giving to my aunt.
1.0,"I thought I had a good umbrella until yesterday it was raining and let the umbrella out and it totally broke.  Something snapped in it, it enabled the umbrella to stay up I had to hold it open.  I got tired, lucky I wore a hooded jacket."
1.0,"This top shrinks a lot. I'm petite (5'2"", 120 lb.) but after 1 washing, a size small was too short to be tucked in (as shown in the photos). It was basically a crop top. I donated it to Good Will."
1.0,These pants are smaller than the sizing listed. I went to return these pants and the seller - Golden calf - wants to charge a restocking fee and make you pay for shipping. Do not buy from them if you do not know these will fit you perfectly. Amazon will not hold them accountable.
1.0,"Didn't fit as expected,  to short.."
1.0,Size is off A LOT!  Need to triple size to fit
1.0,"Material is really rough, thin, and cheap looking. You get what you pay for, I guess - this shirt just looks cheap. It was also tight in the chest and shoulders, order a size up. Returning."
1.0,"Don’t waste your money, very cheaply made and won’t move on any type of carpet."
1.0,I wore it for 3 hours yesterday and half of the flowers came unglued and fell off. It looked beautiful until it looked cheap. Would not purchase again.
1.0,"Not very happy with this jumper. The zipper was cheaply made.  After struggling to get the zipper to work, it came apart. Also, the length of the jumper is too short. Im 5'4 and weigh 188. I normally wear size 12 and I ordered a large. The jumper does fits nicely."
1.0,"I am normally a size small.  I ordered a size large, based on the reviews.  It is TINY.  It would fit a small girl, maybe."
1.0,"I love the look of the watch, but I can’t wear it because the holes that hold the pin on the band aren’t drilled deeply enough and the band keeps coming off when I try to wear it."
1.0,Goodness this too is like a tent! I ordered a small and it was HUGE! Don't waste your money.
1.0,"I really do love this bag. The bohemian style is perfect for life in Southern California.  I prefer a larger bag and the hobo slouchy style. I don't carry a lot but if I need to I can. I've been throwing my yoga/running cloths in here too instead of taking a separate bag. This thing can hold everything imaginable. Along with my phone, keys, kindle, infinity scarf and makeup bag I was still able to throw in a extra set of cloths for the next day when I planned to stay the night at a friends house after work last week. Totally worth twenty dollars. Has a cross body strap also.  I bought the Dark Tan one (since it was the cheapest) to test it out, and its ended up being a lovely color. Perfect if I need to take it to the beach too. Now I'm going to buy the charcoal one as a travel weekender bag. I go to the desert most weekends for weekend get a ways and this bag is ideal for that. Its not very heavy so not sure how well made it is but good enough to spend twenty dollars on. There is a middle zipper section which I find slightly annoying. Just one big open pouch is perfect for me and easier to find things, so I may try to simple cut it out. Otherwise a very, very cute, hobo style bag with casual  European looking too.<br /><br />Update (03/10/17) So about three days ago the shoulder strap broke on both ends. I tried emailing the seller but I never heard back from the seller. If the shoulder strap is not an issue for you then its fine but I rely on it on a daily basis since I ride my bike around locally on a daily basis. I guess you get what you pay for one way or another,  poor customer service. Still like my bag but it would be nice to buy from a more professional  seller. Just a heads up if you run into any issues within the first thirty day.<br /><br />Update (03/18/17) While out shopping over the weekend, one of the shoulder straps just randomly broke. I was so embarrassed, I had my hands full with groceries then this happens while I'm waiting in this super long line. I'd much rather pay more and have something that is a lot more reliable than this bag. I really liked the idea of it but honestly its just not made well enough to use on a daily basis. I could have my husband fix it but that's not the point. I'm going to have to send this one back."
1.0,Flimsy junk
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:2ae2f45475fbf7724a6449ceb568fc76]] Save your money. Cute but pops out of the wearable I’ve had it 3 days and tried several pin lengths, and it still happens. Not worth it to send back."
1.0,Dingy and looks used. Not pleased at all.
1.0,"Looks cute, but EXTREMELY disappointed in the quality...please AMAZON..tell me how to return...<br />Jacket just put in bag with no packing slip or return information or return label!!!"
1.0,It is NOT aqua it is turquoise and I will be returning it.
1.0,"Beware, it came unglued shortly after purchase.  Cheaply made"
1.0,I cannot open the clasp.
1.0,Legging I received were not the same as the picture. They don't look as anatomically correct as the picture. Disappointed
1.0,Baaaaad quality as trash
1.0,Cute but a bit thin
1.0,"Nice looking, on the outside but not good quality on the inside."
1.0,Way wrong with size
1.0,Not a quality product
1.0,"I bought it in feb of 18 and the clasp broke feb of 19.. :( it’s too bad, it was lovely while it lasted"
1.0,I decided to keep the outfit because I can wear it around the house but it’s nothing like the picture.
1.0,Sizing is bad.  A large is an extra small.  Have to give away.
1.0,Hat DID NOT look like the picture! Mesh was shorter and the whole thing was very misshapen and creased.
1.0,Loved it until the red stripe started coming off. It would have been 5 stars if this had not happened.
1.0,Does not look as nice as the picture probably won’t order a dress from here again. Tried to get it for a homecoming dress and didn’t fit at all. It sucked to have to hurry and find another dress
1.0,"I will never again trust this product. It was absolutely uncomfortable, too small, I am looked terrible"
1.0,"****UPDATE 9/20/19**** I took away even more stars for this belt, because it bleeds! After wearing for a couple weeks the black color has been transferring onto my husbands pants. It ruined a pair of khakis. The belt is poor quality, not worth the price, and not worth ruining your clothing.<br /><br />I'm not overly impressed with this belt. Even for a basic belt the stitching and construction are not very good. They describe the buckle as ""antique finish"" but it mostly just looks worn, like it's an old belt buckle. The leather is very soft and pliable which is nice but the softness makes me pretty sure that this belt isn't going to stand the test of time very long with daily use. The softness and thickness  of the leather does provide a less bulkier belt however. Lastly there is red and white stitching that appears to be the only thing holding the belt together. Again, not sure if this is going to hold up very well as it doesn't seem to have great construction. Overall if your looking for a cheap belt that doesn't add a lot of bulk to your waist, and don't care about replacing it in a couple months this could do the job."
1.0,I order (what I thought was) a brand new money clip for my husband and I got a used one. Spent $15 dollars on this thing for it to look like it has been used for months by someone else. Blue jean stains from being in someone's pocket and worn edges from someone taking pulling it in and out of their pocket probably. Very dissatisfied with the item I received.
1.0,"I am not sure if this can even be called a dress lol. It is more of a pajama, huge and color less. Nothing like it looks on a picture. The seller was nice enough to give me some money back. DONOT BUY THIS EVER!"
1.0,The watch did not work when it arrived. I called the seller and was asked to change the battery provided with the watch. Since I do not know how to change a watch battery I am unable to use this watch.
1.0,Ordered these.for my wife's birthday and now that part is ruined won't fit at all
1.0,I did a search for 'tall woman's pants' and these came up.. I am just over 5'9&#34; and they were too short.<br />The material was thin and easy to winkle.<br />I returned them.
1.0,The collar is so large. I always order from YLA but this one is horrible
1.0,I bought couple different model of this watch and this one and also others are really LESS quality. I'm surprised how come Kenneth Cole having less quality.... I'm regret... Don't waste your money...
1.0,Wore an hour before the finish wore off...pure junk!!
1.0,The buttons at the bottom are cheap and would stay closed. It can’t be that much more expensive to use real snaps. What a shame they took the cheap way out bc it made the whole bodysuit useless and it was cute.
1.0,I’m so upset I wanna cry. I got a VS underwear!!!! instead of my beautiful dress :’(
1.0,"Cute pattern, but absolutely does not stretch, super small for XXL<br />Had to send back"
1.0,They were too small to wear something underneat and they were very thin
1.0,i bought 2 pair and payed more for the S/H than the earrings themselves. and when i received  them both pair were bent.
1.0,The material is not something a chubby girls should wear..... the sizing was off as well
1.0,Hard to wear
1.0,Do not like the material/fabric.
1.0,"Horrible smell, fabric falling apart before I’ve had a chance to even try it on.  The color yellow is more orange. Very unhappy with quality. Makes me question buying things from amazon."
1.0,Too small cheap material not soft or comfortable. This is made  for a woman with no hips or behind.<br />Not worth the money I pay for it.
1.0,First of all it's not small and slim.<br />Second it is hard to pull out the cards specially when the wallet is full.<br />I am using front pocket wallets from 10 years and this is not one of the good ones.
1.0,Doesn't close...
1.0,Idk if it is because I bought the wrong size but these socks sucked. They never stayed on and would constantly slip off.
1.0,"The socks were supposed to be XL and barely went over my foot, not suzed right at all. I g ave them to my nephew who has smaller feet, looked like crew socks on him."
1.0,"HORRIBLE!<br />After this review. They still have yet to contact me about replacement! I have sent emails requesting one as well!<br />Cannot see buying from Amazon, if they cannot confirm legitimate sellers with good ethics for customer service!<br />The quality of this wallet is very cheap. The zipper has some kind of rust or some damaged wear? It doesn't zip open and closed properly. Overall, extremely dissatisfied. This was supposed to be a gift to my husband, but there is no way that I would give this to him..."
1.0,Super super small they must be for kids waste of $$
1.0,shorts were ok top fit weird
1.0,I wish there was a law against these sellers advertise their products with lies upon lies upon lies and we should get credits for the hassle of having to even try it on and send it back
1.0,"I had to return this product. These insoles are extremely thick and calling them uncomfortable is being generous. They hurt my feet. I have flat feet and was looking for support while running. I would not recommend these insoles. If they were half an inch to an inch thinner, then these insoles may have worked. They are true to size length wise, but entirely too thick."
1.0,"These are huge, like too big to wear"
1.0,Doesn’t work. Used both trying. Did exactly as said on paper. Wouldn’t stay in teeth. Fits perfect. Wouldn’t stay.
1.0,"The nose in picture is smaller, the lips in picture are smaller. The nose is huge and so are the lips it’s made well but looks nothing like picture! Disappointed"
1.0,It is not a tree and is only a small stem and will take for ever to grow and produce fruit
1.0,"Looks nothing like the picture, it doesn't conform to your toes at all and it broke after one time of wearing it."
1.0,"Shirt is unwearable because the arm holes are disproportionately too large. It seems that if I ordered a smaller size (I ordered my usual size), the whole shirt would be too short. There is something off about the length and width of openings. It is not at all how it appears on the model."
1.0,the protecter was completely shattered when I received it so I wasn't even able to use it!
1.0,It was too small and it would be a pain to return it I'm afraid
1.0,Can’t get them past my hips and Can’t get them buttoned
1.0,"This has so much potential to be cute but it doesn’t fit or go on at all. I don’t mean it’s too small, I mean the way it’s designed there’s something problematic to where there’s the middle triangle just in the way it looks ridiculous. It didn’t match the picture at all. Unfortunately I have to advise this be avoided."
1.0,I would not buy from here again item arrived with no tags inside. I didn’t know what size it was . I ordered a large and it seemed like a medium. The tags were like torn off. And cheap material
1.0,"Very poor quality material. It's not even cotton / cloth, it's like a thin, satin bandana type shirt. Also the back is lace-up as well, very confusing."
1.0,Nice style but it's way too small for my gyrl.
1.0,Excesivamente grandes. Esperaba otra cosa. No me gustan y la calidad mas o menos
1.0,Beside them look nothing like advertised.
1.0,Color was electric pink and not what I was expecting
1.0,So excited to purchase and it does NOT fit my Versa2! So disappointed.
1.0,Took a month to get here because they cone from China and they run about 4 sizes smaller.
1.0,Returning. It is way too small and I allowed for it being small when ordering because of previous reviews. It was also very stiff and uncomfortable.
1.0,The earpieces have broken so often I now have them supported with popsicle sticks and packing tape.  Cannot recommend.
1.0,These should be advertised as children aprons. Strings are to short to tie. Material is so thin and one pocket is torn already. A never again buy!!!!
1.0,I don’t like the way it looks in person
1.0,"Shipped in bag & was smashed in several places. Too bad, I love the hat. Should be in a box."
1.0,It’s not sturdy and get all twisted up… and the string isn’t durable either.
1.0,It was very pretty.  But it turned my wrist green.
1.0,I purchased this dress for my daughter it was to big and I wanted to send it back. The shipping cost was over $200 dollars!!!
1.0,Looks cheap and ugly
1.0,Horrible fit. I’m so mad I forgot about it and let the window to return it expire. If you are looking for something unflattering... order this
1.0,They arrived vacuumed packed causing damage to the little air balls that you squeeze to make the ears move so they don't work... my daughters were very disappointed
1.0,Very flimsy. Showed up missing stones
1.0,Was SO exited to finally where this last week. It fits bigger than expected. Anddddd it has two weird ties in the back (not up at neck)  like I asked my husband to cut it for me cuz I’m like I can’t Wear it like this. Totally bummed out.
1.0,Way too big with too much fabric. I ordered a small and it was at least 2 sizes too big everywhere.
1.0,This bracelet started breaking in just days. The material the beads go onto literally shred. My husband isn’t a big man however he says pretty large wrist is but average again for most males & it starting breaking within the first few wears. This was very disappointing as the look was exactly what I was looking for but the quality is poor.
1.0,Seams came undone in the washer on first wash.
1.0,Charm broke off within 24 hours
1.0,"Website description completely inaccurate.  Ordered this tanktini/boyshort swimsuit, but received a one piece swimdress in the same pattern/design that is much longer than the picture, with attached bikini brief style bottoms. the top is also completely different with a v neck style and layer of blue under/across it.  Sizing is also off, too small, and only someone much shorter could wear it.  I am average height, 5'5&#34; and felt I needed to be at least 3 inches shorter for this to comfortably fit. Very disappointed with what I received, because overall the swimsuit was cute and quality seemed to be decent."
1.0,Did not look like a cat.
1.0,"I'm a muscular man, the sleeves could not go over my biceps, the body of the shirt fit very good.<br /><br />If the material/ fabric would stretch some than maybe it would ne a great fit."
1.0,"Honestly it looks much better viewing it from my computer screen.  I wasn't pleased with the quality of the product at all.  I ended up regifting these, I should've just returned them.  The person I gave them to as a gift, I hear she did the same thing for the same reason."
1.0,"Can not make smaller, band won’t detach to remove links and unhappy."
1.0,"As with most clothing items bought online, I'm always skeptical about sizes. I'm a busty girl but I'm thin waisted, so I thought this would work for me. Firstly, the picture is backwards. The product I got laces in the front for whatever reason. It's difficult to wear because the gap in the lace for it to fit would be so big, I would have to wear something under it. My point is, I wouldn't buy it based on your waist size, I would buy it based on your chest size."
1.0,these pants were cute in picture but not nearly as cute in real life also rips were coverd with weir material! very very very uncomfortable and very werid scrunches
1.0,The dress was way too small in the arms.
1.0,What I didn’t like is how the stretchy part goes all the way down too low! Also the material is soft shiny polyester. Not what I thought it would be. It’s not terrible. Could’ve been worse. But not what I thought. Good thing I only ordered one to test it first.
1.0,"Take  it out of description. It's false advertisement.<br />Edit: after light use the rubber like material in the arms have started to fall out. These are cheaply made and uncomfortable for long periods of use. I do not recommend them. I know you get what you pay for, but I've paid less for quick throwaways that exceeded the quality of these."
1.0,The print on one side is fine but the other side is completely dark
1.0,Product runs SMALL!!!! I ordered a 6 and received a 5 with a 6 tag. Order a size up at least!!!!
1.0,It's front keeps coming undone and got a bigger size and still to small. It sucks I would give it a zero if I  could. I might just stop buying clothes or anything from Amazon. Which sucks bec I needed this closet before Sunday.
1.0,"The second I open the box, pull out of it's &#34;protective&#34; plastic covering I notice what looks to be some sort of sticky substance on one shoe in the front, and all around both are scratched up in multiple places. For a Bebe product I am very disappointed. They are going on a 2 year old so I will not waste my time or money sending them back at this point, but seriously. Manufacturer fail all around the board!"
1.0,"This dress is completely disproportionate. The bottom fit perfectly the top was slightly too big and the arm holes were unbelievable small. I tried to squeeze my arms into the holes and I could literally feel my blood circulation just come to a stop. The dress itself is very beautiful and true to what is picture but the proportions are all wrong and sadly, to my dismay, the fabric on top has absolutely no give. If I had known the arm holes were that small I would have just gone with the strapless version and saved myself the time and trouble."
1.0,This watch is lightweight. I was expecting something totally different. If you are thinking of buying this watch keep in mind that it is very lightweight. I work in a Correctional Facility and this will be the watch I wear everyday with no concerns regarding the damage I may sustain while wearing it.
1.0,Buckle scratched in First Day of wearing it!<br />I am so disappointed! The worst item I ever ordered from Amazon!
1.0,"Very disappointed with this. Very small, I even measured to get an idea of size.  I feel like Goldilocks...first was large enough for an over night bag this one was not big enough for my wallet and phone....lesson learned ...go to the store and see what I am getting"
1.0,Sorry to say it's way too big and too heavy!
1.0,Broke as soon as I try to put it on .
1.0,Horrible! Wore it once and all the gems fell of. Super cheaply made! Definitely not worth the money!!!
1.0,don’t buy unless if you want your cards and money missing
1.0,The material is cheap and of poor quality. I will be returning this item.
1.0,Cheaply made and wrinkles easy.
1.0,Ordered 28&#34; waist as that's what I wear. The button and buttonhole are at least 4 inches apart from closing when I tried them on. Pants are more see-through than picture leads you to believe. The two front pockets are entirely different lengths and this is noticeable since they are so see through. Will be returning and looking for a different brand of white pants to wear.
1.0,These shoes were the right size but were poorly made and only lasted for a few wearings.  Not very satisfactory.
1.0,"Looks nice, I was polishing it with a cloth and some of the script letters stood up and cut my finger with it, no good."
1.0,"I was really disappointed in this product and will be returning them. First off they can definitely not be worn as sports bras they do not provide nearly enough support. Secondly when it said it came padded the pad is so thin it might as well not be there. Thirdly, I thought they looked cute in the picture, but when I put one on definitely not cute! If I were to keep these it would be to wear around the house but that’s it."
1.0,Color changed within 2 days it us not full 925
1.0,All the gems fell out within a day of wear.
1.0,Size runs really small and took months to receive product
1.0,Dress was beautiful but the zipper was impossible to zip. It eventually broke. We requested a refund which was approved but after sending the dress back we have yet to receive a refund.
1.0,Save your money. Shipping took forever and the quality was terrible. Sent back and only got a partial refund.
1.0,The shirt looks nothing like described. I bought a small and it is huge. I use it as a sleep shirt because it is jus that off.
1.0,Much to big and not what was expected
1.0,These weren’t over the knee. I’m 5’3” and these weren’t even close to above my knees.
1.0,I purchased this purse in July and I loved it. Plenty of pockets and very roomy and just my style. Less than 4 months later and the floral print is wearing and fading fast. It's just not the quality that I would expect for the price. Very disappointed!
1.0,Fit great but way too short.
1.0,"This is clearly a child-size bracelet. I'm going to keep it, but I have to go to a findings supplier to get a sterling extension chain in order to wear it (and I DON'T have big wrists)."
1.0,Does not wash well. Very pilly and old looking after just a few wears. Disappointed.
1.0,"It came tarnished.  Horrible quality, way overpriced, huge ripoff.  My worst amazon purchase to date."
1.0,The heels are weak and will make your feet slide
1.0,Color looks great but they are too thin will not stay in the frame had to return.
1.0,"It doesn't work I need to send it back , wasn't very happy , but it's beautiful, I want another on because I like it"
1.0,"I loved them when I got them, but I accidentally dropped one and it hacked in half. So disappointing."
1.0,I recieved two mismatched greens colors and one looked light green like jade. I would not recommend this product
1.0,I purchased these rings for me and my daughter. One of them broke in half a week later.
1.0,Terrible quality. It’s already pilling all over and it collects every single dust particle. My kids don’t want to wear it anymore because it looks awful. It’s only been washed twice and worn once. Would not recommend. Waste of money.
1.0,The necklace is pretty but poorly made. I put it on for the first time today and it fell apart before I could even leave the house for work. I am returning this item.
1.0,"This shirt came from China 3 weeks after order. It's very small, it has no tags. You will not be able to return it."
1.0,its so cheap-looking its tacky
1.0,"I purchased a small. I’m 5’4, 130 lbs. I was swimming in this sweater, it was too oversized plus it has no shape, just looks like a sack. I returned it."
1.0,Terrible bracelet! Broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,"On my first ride, broke! Not protect anything! Y need my money back!"
1.0,Upon opening my order I saw a shirt that was super light and faded looking. If you want a shirt with any colors filling the entire shirt then go for it.
1.0,"This thing is so incredibly tiny, you cant even see anything on it. Im so upset about it. It was for a gift exchange tomorrrow.. and now I dont have anything."
1.0,"So tight, it gives me a headache. I'll try stretching it."
1.0,Not true to size. Run two sizes down.
1.0,"Does not look good on me. I'm a size 0 to 00, 110lbs,  and 5'2 w/ 32C bra size. Looked bad and bottoms were too big."
1.0,"Cute, but very poor design / quality. Telescoping handle mechanism is basically junk. First it would not stay up, then it would get stuck and not come out at all."
1.0,"Es la peor compra que puedes hacer! La bota NO ES la misma de la foto, es realmente de muuuy mala calidad. NO gasten su dinero en esto! Muy mal servicio tambien porque pedi talla 6 y me llego talla 8."
1.0,Most of these China made hair umbrellas are either too small (for kids) or too big (cannot wrap tightly around neck). Why don't they make sizes that fits the average person?
1.0,"Remember that Cosby episode when Denise made Theo a shirt and it was different styles sewn together?  That's what this dress is like.  It's hard to see in the pic, but the asymmetrical neckline -- which I thought would be a cool twist on a classic shape -- is created by two completely different shoulders.  Then the ruching starts right at the bust, is bisected by the seam at the waist, then re-starts on the pencil skirt part of the bottom half of the dress, all making for an awkward and bunchy mess.  Lastly, this dress ran waaaaay small, even in comparison to other similar dresses I've bought on Amazon.  A disappointment all around."
1.0,"No no no!<br />This this the THINNEST material I have ever seen. The sleeves stopped a quarter of the way down my arms. I’m 5’0, I have VERY SHORT ARMS. It looks ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE THIS PICTURE! I am shipping it back tomorrow. Please don’t waste your money!"
1.0,la tela no es buena y están mal hechas.
1.0,After reading the reviews I decided to buy a size m. I'm 5'2&#34; 134 pounds. The shorts for fine but everywhere else is huge. I went to request a smaller size and now they are all gone from site. I love it but need a smaller size.
1.0,Not happy the size and your chart way off this was too big it was like a dress and it doesn't look like black it looks like brown<br />I'll be sending back for refund
1.0,"Came in smaller than expected, and then shrunk further on the first wash"
1.0,"no case/not tinted yery dark,scratched,not worth enen low price."
1.0,My luck was much better before i bought these.
1.0,Started to bronze
1.0,"They suck - poor fit, poor quality"
1.0,"Needs to be listed as a ""junior"" in sizing.  Too tight overall for a women's Medium.  Not great quality fabric."
1.0,"We paid waaay too much for this flimsy mask.  It's basically a very thin material with a backing on it to make it a little stiff.  You could find this at a Dollar Store, so $10 is ridiculous."
1.0,They ripped at the thumb as soon as my client put them on. I needed them for a photo shoot. What a huge disappointment and waste of money!
1.0,Cute dress if it did not arrive with a hole/rip in it. I noticed on my way out the door for work luckily. Will have to send it back
1.0,See through material. Had to return.
1.0,Material is very thin.<br />I ordered the gray and the fabric looks dull and faded.<br />The fit is fine but I really was expecting something with a little more substance and better colors than what I actually received.<br />Not very happy with this purchase and will be returning for refund.
1.0,"So I ordered this wallet with the hopes of carrying my belongings in the most minimalistic way possible. So I read the ""instructions "" card that's beautifully place in the front of the wallet. It says, ""To avoid demagnatized, pls don't put cards in cash clip"". Ok, great,  I use a key card to get in and out of my home, why all if a sudden my key card stopped working, SMH. I did not place my key card in the cash clip, why doesn't it work?? Returning ASAP!!"
1.0,Definitely did not fit into the XL. I could barely get it on. 5'10 and should have ordered a XXXL!
1.0,"the inside seam rubs against your sides, its uncomfortable.  apart from that its ok. its really not strechable neither"
1.0,Looks like material is good. Skirt is thin. However I was shipped the wrong size. Ordered Small and received a Large! I also ordered green and got it in black. Very disappointing.
1.0,Looks terrible and have no idea what the material is
1.0,"The picture posted is deceiving , the dress is so thin you can hold it up to light, and see through it. I needed it for a wedding, but that won't be happening, just a hot Summer day dress. Disappointed customer"
1.0,"You do not want to waste your money here. This model makes this dress look like a classic 60s style pleated look. But don't be fooled... this dress is a scratchy pleated potato sack with no shape. It looks like a bad curtain from your great grandma's house. I hoped that tying on the belt thing would help. No not at all. It just makes it itch more. Thank goodness I was able to return it. I wanted to add a pic for clarification, but I dreaded trying it on again. It was that bad."
1.0,Looks a lot nicer in the picture.  It looks what you pay for it CHEAP
1.0,Terrible quality and material.
1.0,"0 stars!  I specifically needed 100% polyester as the description advertised, but it’s not, I needed them for work and now have to wait another 4 days or so for another product plus drive to a return drop off location and potentially wait 7 days to be refunded after dropping off returned items, ironic as I was charged the funds to my account as soon as they shipped… defeats the purpose of convenience doesn’t it!"
1.0,returned it.  Too small and didn't like the material.
1.0,"The only way I would buy this product is if I was buying it for a small child under the age of five. It is way too small. I bought this for myself, and in the description it said was for adult man, women and teen boys and girls.  I put it on and barely got it on my head. I was unable to open my mouth.  Look very closely in the description it does not say anywhere if it is refundable or not. You have to go into the re-fund policy on this item. I overlooked this don’t make the same mistake. I have no way to contact the seller and the item is nonrefundable. DO NOT BUY!!!"
1.0,"Did not care for these at all. In my opinion, they fit small"
1.0,Run  small
1.0,Wife refused to wear it due to her size. Made her look like a pregnant dolphin wearing the Stars & Stripes. She made me burn it...
1.0,"I am 5'10 and usually a size 4/6. I ordered a medium and it's still way too tight and the slit in the back starts right at the bottom of my butt! I will have to return this, which is too bad because it is so cute."
1.0,I got a large and it was like a petite small smh
1.0,Size is very small didn't fit my lady only her pinky
1.0,The dress I received just had lace on the top part. It did not have a nice open on the back. Really disappointed
1.0,Es poco practico se sale
1.0,"I liked the thickness, as we were planning on using in Lake Superior for rock hunting. But I wear a size 9 Wide shoe and the XL was super tight trying to get it around my heel,  was even more difficult getting it back off again."
1.0,"The blouse was made of linen or denim, not a simple cotton blouse that I wanted. It’s very heavy and the fabric is rough. I returned it but seller gave me only $10 on $17 purchase price. Avoid this seller."
1.0,"Came without the band. I guess I can wear it under other bras for pushup, but the clear strap that was supposed to come packages was not there at all."
1.0,"I had high hopes for this top, but it was terrible. Looked like I was wearing a garage bag, not comfortable at all."
1.0,This dress looks very cheap. Material of very poor quality. Stitching very untidy. Will not recommend this to anyone
1.0,"I was very excited when I ordered these socks. They’re black, as shown, when they arrive but when stretched to put on your foot is fades to grey and looks worn. I was very disappointed"
1.0,Stretches terribly. Like the print though
1.0,Really cheap product.  They're made out of rubber and plastic.
1.0,"Probably Amazon’s error, not the manufacturer, but it came completely wrinkled and a mess. Was not even wrapped in anything to protect it, just stuck in the shipping box in with other items and knocked around. Have to send it back :("
1.0,Huele horrible que no se quita con nada
1.0,One size does not fit all with this skirt! No room for stretching.
1.0,Comfy but small and short
1.0,Do not buy unless it is for a child.  I am normally a medium and even an xl wouldn't fit.  The top got bigger with each size up but the bottom literally stayed the same size.
1.0,It wasn’t sewn together in the back properly.  The material didn’t match up and it looks terrible!
1.0,"I wanted to really like this shacket. The color was pretty, the outside was soft but the smell was horrible upon arrival and it just wasn’t flattering on me."
1.0,The straps are not equipped for large breasts. 34 F
1.0,Supposed to ship with extra set of longer screws and a screwdriver.  Not...  Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Really isn't worthy to buy, poor quality and blurred words, totally useless"
1.0,Cute dress! Bad sizing.
1.0,I ordered a small size and it was like three times bigger and very low quality
1.0,They aren’t big enough to fit a Tragus.
1.0,Terrible :( the material sucks and the fit is so unflattering..you can get much better shorts of this style for much cheaper if you actually order from Romwe or SHEIN
1.0,"Ordered July 22, 2018, received July 29, 2018. No more then 3 washes and the rivet came lose. I believe I have purchased a pair of WenVen shorts before and no complaints. This pair, the rivet was compromised from the beginning but still solidly attached to the fabric. Today’s wash(September 11, 2018), and the rivet separates. Another issue, seems the inside seam was irritating my thigh, as though it was sewn with fishing line which stabbed into my inner thigh.<br />  Photo explains the primary flaw"
1.0,Very disappointed with these pants. They were too long and too big around the waist (I even purchased one size down than my normal size). The white pants are practically see through and the fabric is very cheap. It is not comfortable and not really cute.
1.0,"Belt works as expected for regular/office wear.  However, I wore the belt playing golf.  The dye on the belt leather leaked out of the belt due to the humid weather conditions.  The dye has now ruined 4 pairs of shorts and 2 golf shirts.  The money saved by buying from this less expensive vendor was lost many times over by the ruined clothing."
1.0,It came so small
1.0,It really doesn't do anything. Get a rouge polishing cloth.
1.0,"The glasses weren't in the box with my other purchases. My app says they were delivered, I just never got them and my security guard says there were no other packages. 😕😕"
1.0,Terrible quality and does not look like the pictures.<br /><br />Very disappointed with the material— VERY thin.
1.0,"The size runs extremely small. I ordered and returned 2 times. The chart is completely off. On the product box, it says that a youth size 26 fits 10-11 year-olds. The size 26 jammer I got doesn’t even fit half the legs of my slender 7-year old boy. It’s really for toddlers. Completely different than the Speedo size chart, so do not compare. Very disappointed!"
1.0,"I am very disappointed with my order. I discarded my shipping information before I realized the briefs have no fly opening. The only resemblance they have to men's underwear is the writing on the waistband.  I am giving your product 0 stars, and would highly recommend to all potential men buyers &#34;to avoid your product by all means.&#34;"
1.0,"This would be perfect if the pearl was smaller.  It is so large, it makes the entire ring look cheap.  I will probably never wear it."
1.0,Very cute but first time putting them on and one is broken. Now it's outside the return window. Ugh
1.0,Cheap & it comes out of the it’s storage container.  Not worth it
1.0,Tried each of the pens on a wine glass. The colors are very light and very faint making them not visible.  Need to have more pigment and darker color to be visible.
1.0,the dress was cute but as a shirt the sides were so short and i'm 5'4 and the fold down wouldn't stay down
1.0,Size chart not correct.  The top US size L fit like a XS or smaller
1.0,Ordered this for the style and because it said it was cotton and linen. This is not accurate; it is 35% cotton and 65% polyester which does not work at all for me. The material does not breathe. I will be returning it. Not happy.
1.0,Al poco tiempo se despinto
1.0,the arms were ridic tight and the fabric was like a scuba suit. i would have sweat myself silly.
1.0,The screw didn't stay on and I lost one somewhere. So my left shoe is without.
1.0,"The material is pretty scratchy and cheap with barely any stretch. The empire seam only came down halfway across my chest and although I'm slightly on the bustier side, I'm still pretty proportionate to the rest of my figure. I have no issues fitting other XL in different brands, so this was disappointing."
1.0,"They give descent support, but they made my feet smell like cheese. Like, cheddar, straight up. I stopped wearing them and the smell went away in two days. I had to find another insole."
1.0,Awful quality. I was going to give this as a gift but I am going to scramble to try to find something else locally. This would be embarrassing. The sizing is way off.
1.0,"These were broken when I received them.  The crystal balls on the ends were both just laying in the box and 2 little crystals were, too.  I would have loved them if they were not broken."
1.0,Piece of crap
1.0,Podrían fabricarlas mejor.
1.0,"Was missing the gold embossment so there were three holes in the leather, the shoulder strap was missing, and the other side without embossment had a black smudge I couldn't remove."
1.0,"I am not someone who struggles with claustrophobia and don’t have any issue wearing cloth or paper masks, but this face shield made me extremely claustrophobic and sweaty. Wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,Ripped the 1st time I tried to put my card in ... worst ..
1.0,"The material was thick and not stretchy and the trim was very bulky. I returned them, but have not heard any response or credit to my account."
1.0,They DO NOT fit on lips as pictures show. Purchased 2 pairs and both people unable to wear.
1.0,It looks cheap=you get what you pay for. I am going to keep the dress & just wear it under a heavy shawl. The fit was as expected.
1.0,These do not fit a baby let alone any child they are even to big for my 5 year old. Although they do fit an adult.... but not what they were purchased for... very disappointing.
1.0,clasp SUCKS...DO NOT BUY...it will fall off your wrist withen 2 minutes
1.0,Cheap quality. The lobster clip broke when I tried to clip it to a plastic boat switch.
1.0,can't turn watch button to set clock time. It runs but you can't set time. I think it is beautiful
1.0,"Very disappointed. Bought this one to replace another. Spent more because I wanted a quality yet simplistic look. 2 weeks after receiving we noticed a fluttering noise, like a moth was stuck inside. We also noticed the watch and internal pillow piece were scratching viewing window. Turned out the wooden piece behind pillow was rotted and broken. We will now try our 3rd brand. Trouble finding one that does not make noise or malfunction"
1.0,I returned it because of poor fittingv
1.0,"Not a good fit, style itself is kind of baggy or too long even if it's the right size. somewhat cheap material. I returned it."
1.0,"Poor product. Stay away. Seam in side shoe was think and probably would have bothered his toes. And the inserts don’t fit and won’t lay flat, probably bc of the seam issue. Returned!!"
1.0,The shirt looks cheap it says it's the wrong color and the letters are faded is the ugliest biggest mistake I've ever made I'll never buy from Amazon again
1.0,This blue isn’t what it shows. The dress was not royal blue:( otherwise I would have kept it. It was a tad bit see thru also
1.0,product is not what i expected disappointed in them you can tell they are cheaply made upset that i suggested others buy before i received my order
1.0,Very disappointed. I do not like the feel of the material. Feels very cheap. I'm returning it.
1.0,Fit was great. Beautiful flowy print.<br />I had to return it because the fabric was coming apart at the armpit seam. Very disappointed.
1.0,Wrist gauges ever looks like just dirty white complete waste of money
1.0,Thus purse feel apart very quickly
1.0,"I wear a size 11 shoe and bought the 11-12. These were a little big. And there is very little backing around the heel, so they easily come off."
1.0,"I was looking for a quality product to wear here in MN for the winter. I found this product on Amazon and I ordered it, upon receiving it about a month after I ordered it,""I didn't realize it was manufactured in China"". I tried adjusting the cap part of it which is simply a baseball hat with a very thin lining, and it still is a very poor fit. The face mask part of the cap is flimsy, and can also not be adjusted, there are two snaps on each side of the baseball hat which are not able to secure the face-mask securely. I would not purchase this item again, and I would not recommend this item to anyone. I am actually going to look at theYooper Chook. Do not buy this item."
1.0,"Basic printing. It was perfect for delivery day!! At $5 including shipping, it was a steal. I'm honestly not sure how they could be making any money but I'm glad i got it. Nice heavyweight material & great quality shirt.<br />Edit: well i should have waited to review the shirt. 1 wash went from a kids Small to a toddler size 3."
1.0,"I got this watch about twenty days after I ordered it, and it doesn't work. When I tap it (many times, with varying fingers), nothing happens, so I think the battery is dead. When I tried taking off the back, it wouldn't come off. Now I have a dead watch, with no way to change the battery. Time to ship it back to China."
1.0,I ordered a large to accommodate a bigger bust. I wear a medium USA made T-shirt.  This would not even cover my busy.  I gave it to my size XS daughter it fit her. Runs very small - forget it if you actually have a bust!
1.0,Changing my review now that I realize my top left button must have been broken for some time. Did not realize I should be able to push it for a light. Daylight savings changed today and I am unable to update my watch because that button won't perform its function. This must have stopped working shortly after I bought it. WIsh I had realized it then so I could return it.
1.0,Heavy and not as nice as picture shows. Color of gems/jewels gets lost in all the goldfish colored metal.
1.0,"Plastic Plastic,  wow! wrong size, misshaped,, very hard process for return."
1.0,Much too small head size for an adult .. no stretch
1.0,Holes appeared in crotch first time I wore them & now there are multiple holes. The product is soft but not worth the money.
1.0,"Be aware that if you are making earrings you must order to sets, there are zero pairs. Should clearly state no repeats in description."
1.0,These are NOT American sizes. The 2x was an American M/LG
1.0,If this was purchased here I would take it back to the store! They used spandex/ tights material to make a blazer! Really!!! I don’t like to one bit!!!! Doesn’t worth the money!!!
1.0,Well if you want everyone to see your bum.... by all means buy these.<br />Waste of money. Tho they offered to take half off for me to give them to someone else. Not sure who wants to show their booty off to the world. I know me and my teen child won’t be doing that!
1.0,The shorts were very see through. They were also poorly made.
1.0,I didn't even try it on. It is a piece of junk. The seams are all on the outside and there is no bottom seam at all. I will never order from this designer again.
1.0,The moment I removed from package I could tell it was going back. Cheaply made the fabric kind of feels like there is a film covering.  The neck had a hole I saw instantly.  The size was true to size however did nothing for shape and is not like the photo. The photo makes it appear a tunic length in the back and it is not. I bought because the same product was out of stock from another seller. Not sure if this is the same or I got unlucky
1.0,"Poorly designed clipping mechanism results in a considerable portion of the lens sticking above my glasses, which also results in the clip-on not extending to the bottom of my glasses, although the clip-on lens should be large enough to do that.  The result is that the clip-on looks ridiculous, sticking a centimeter above my glasses and leaving a centimeter at the bottom of my glasses unprotected.. This is all a result of how they bent the wires that go over my glasses, and where they decided to attach their rivets.  Back to the drawing board for these clip-ons."
1.0,Shoes are too wide and my feet flop in them
1.0,"Chain came tangled out of the box, impossible to get undone. Big waste of money"
1.0,"The adjustable strap does not function properly. Don't know if it's a defect or the way the product is supposed to be, but I can't tighten it without there being a gigantic loop."
1.0,Way way way too small - the torso area is incredibly short! Very flimsy material! Took forever to arrive!<br />Might fit if one is VERY petite. Ended up cutting it up for a craft project.
1.0,"Super skim tight, this shirt was only made for very skinny women with flat stomachs, the material is almost all spandex."
1.0,Way Too Guady!! and way too Big! Did not like these.
1.0,Very thin and a lot smaller than expected.  Would not buy.
1.0,"Made cheap, last pair of these I bought somewhere else and they lasted a decade, I gave them to a homeless person and bought these....big mistake, they are cheaply made and falling apart already.  Pathetic."
1.0,The charms are perfect but the rope is so stiff that it undoes itself and if you try to wear it you have to constantly keep tugging at the rope to stay on the charms. Would not buy this again.
1.0,This dress is horrible and I’m sending it back. It is thin material and has no shape. I wouldn’t even wear it as a nightgown and it looks more like that than a dress.
1.0,Is too short needs more fabric
1.0,Looks like a child took some scissors to cut these. Very poor. Material is fine and pattern is nice but I’m not happy with the quality.
1.0,The zipper broke immediatly it kept getting stuck and the waist tie ripped
1.0,I thought I would try these and loved them when they came in....so i washed them and they SHRANK to a size that my 9 year old niece can wear at 80 pounds!  I purchased 2XL for this reason thinking I would only lose a little size....but NO WAY....shrank all the way down to child size!!
1.0,"I returned! Cut is horribly unflattering with the pockets at the hip and the stripes made me look large as a barn! I’m 5’4” 135# with curvy hips. This is NOT a dress for someone with hips due to the cut and the stripes, just keep looking for another dress!"
1.0,Lousy sewing
1.0,"I was really super excited to receive this package today but very disappointed when i tried to put it on. It was not the size that I had ordered and there was torn thread near the neck line. Like a huge noticeable thread. Very upsetting. It was the same threading that is on the inside of the sweater but its on the outside of the sweater but ONLY on the left side, not the right. Anyway, I would recommend this product had I gotten the right size and that piece of thread not been there."
1.0,Too large at top
1.0,Not what I expected very small
1.0,"This top is falling apart already and I have not even gotten a chance to wear it yet.  Besides that it runs way too big, the yard on the V-neck sections are unravelling and there are multiple lose threads (so I cannot just tie one off to fix it and instead have to make multiple knots all over the edging).  This is such poor quality!"
1.0,"The magnets arent strong enough to hold the outside in place, it just falls off"
1.0,"This earring looks pretty and delicate in the picture.  It real life, it is huge!  It is larger than my ample ear lobe, and looks more fitting for the toy box than the jewelry box."
1.0,"Would not purchase this jacket again. Thin, flimsy and horrible packaging. The picture looks really nice and the quality for the price however I couldn’t figure out what this item was. It looked as though they took a vac and sucked the jacket into a cellophane type of small bag. Was so disappointed and threw it in the garage. Poor quality fabric jacket!!"
1.0,"It's very nice... but doesn't curve at all like the original l, or the winged eagle I got a couple months back... I'll keep it because I suspect they are all like this... but if I got a dud.... wwe, do the right thing!! 👍"
1.0,I agree with other reviews: the picture is really misleading. It looks like it's going to be at least 12&#34; longer than it actually is.
1.0,3x is a medium
1.0,"If I could give this zero stars, I would. The suit pretty much fits me but what makes me so upset about this is that the pattern of the suit looks NOTHING like the pattern I chose. They sent me a cheap like laser printed on patterned top and the bottoms are a totally different pattern. Both are cheap looking patterns..they do not match!! They have similar colors which make them look like they match! Crooks these people are!! The top also has a really unelastic band which does not cling to you as it should..makes it uncomfortable and self-conscious. I didn't read these pattern issue reviews until days after I ordered (I'm a dummy for that, yes, I know) I hoped it wouldn't happen to me but it did. I got a dud.. oh well. At least it was cheap. It came from China so no use bothering to return it.. I have seen it for sale from others so maybe I'll try from another person but I won't be buying from this person ever again. Untruthful crooks."
1.0,Not particularly fond of these masks. They are cheaply made
1.0,It is not like what I see in the picture the material itches like crazy and it just didn’t fit I ordered extra large still did not fit well
1.0,"Just bought this a month ago, wore it 3 times and the threads are starting to crumble inside making it look it’s has been used for ages"
1.0,I didnt find them useful for what I needed them for.
1.0,"The picture of the earrings is great, but in person, not so much.  I could have gone to the fabric store, visited the remnant pile and cut fake leather fabric in the shape of a teardrop for much less than these cheaply made earring imitators.  Fake hammered gold on one side only , black on the reverse.The earrings spin around  wildly on the ear due to lack of weight.  These are cheap, cheap, cheap- stay away.  The only pro would be the gold hammered design- but,only if they were metal. Ugh!"
1.0,NOT A 2-PACK!!!!!  Only received one multi-wrap.
1.0,Not in the box<br />It was folded<br />Not spreading.<br />sad.
1.0,Too card for the feet
1.0,"This is the cutest necklace HOWEVER, buyer be ware. I got this for Christmas wore it 2 days and 2 of the crystals fell out. Amazon is AWESOME so they replaced it. Wore the new one 1 day and a crystal fell out. I gave up on the necklace.  The good news it I'm only out $12 dollars."
1.0,Only way to open is take ball off. Balls dont go back on.
1.0,cheap looking..
1.0,"It is a sheet of 4-way stretchy fabric that has scratchy sleeves/neckline.  It's cheap, underwhelming, and unflattering."
1.0,"I can't believe I spent $19 on this. My $10 pair I got from the gas station are of better quality. These are really cheap and flimsy, and the lenses will come out of the frame very easy. Like they always say you get what you pay for. I will not be cheap and just spend the $$$ on a good quality brand."
1.0,cheap and break so easy
1.0,"Lost one of my expensive diamond earrings because of these junk backs.They are weak, not even worth it for anything. I am out 1/2 carat earring, because these junk backs are NOT solid, will not hold the earring in your ear. DO NOT BUY THESE"
1.0,"I wanted to love this. It was very comfy and light weight. But after wearing it twice, it ripped completely in one side."
1.0,"I must have gotten the defective one. Went to go put it on and one of the stones already fell out.<br /><br />I thought it looked great out of the package, but it didn't even make it on to my ear"
1.0,Terrible.
1.0,"These are okay, but they are hard to get on."
1.0,"These do not fit at all way to small,but the seller gave me a discount  due to the fact they were more money to send them back to China. I gave them to my 9yr old granddaughter"
1.0,Parece piyama la tela mejor lo tire
1.0,Material was weird. Wore once but ended up giving away. Romwe clothes is very hit or miss.
1.0,So unflattering. The material it is made out of is so heavy. I would not recommend especially for the price.
1.0,"I ordered one size larger than my usual because of the other reviews, but I should have ordered two sizes larger.  I'm 5'7"" and 150 lbs. and I ordered the large which was still too small.  The picture showed a zipper on the back of the blouse, but instead of a zipper, there was only 3 small pieces of Velcro.  After I had the blouse on and I reached my arms forward, the entire back of the blouse popped open like a hospital gown!  I'm returning and not bothering with the exchanging this for the X-Large because of the Velcro problem, and how poorly the entire garment was sewn."
1.0,My kid wore them a single day and then was up all night in pain from both his feet hurting. He’s says they hurt his feet they’re so uncomfortable 😣
1.0,"Terrible. Almost see through, and it came with a big hole in it. I have little legs and these are wayyyy tight."
1.0,See through shiny material makes it look super cheap.
1.0,Arrived with two rips in the skirt. Waiting for the replacement and still no word. Will review when/ if we receive it.
1.0,These shoes came in looking like a dog chewed them up! They looked old and worn out and they smelled terrible. Idk how they fit because I would never try them on. What a disappointment.
1.0,"Way too small and tight on the head. The arms arm super stiff to open and close. I'm going to try to stretch them out, hopefully without breaking them because they seem fragile. Not sure how other people give them 5 stars. I understand they're inexpensive but didn't expect them to be like this. No returns allowed so I'm out $10 for useless sunglasses."
1.0,this hat would fit nice if your asian
1.0,"Very unhappy!<br />The swimsuit is cute, but I found it by doing a search for tummy control. The description says it is tummy control. It is not. What's worse though is that it came with only one breast pad. One! Only on the left side! You can totally tell when wearing it the right is hanging and the left isn't. I bought this to got to the lake today. I had to go buy one at the store because of this. How do you only put one breast pad in!? You can see it in the included pics."
1.0,Cheaply made. Not fill grain leather
1.0,"The top fit well and soft however it pulled after one use. The arm holes are a little too big, needed to wear a sports bra or tank under it."
1.0,This item was not as nice looking as it shows and is not real either
1.0,It's broken
1.0,[[VIDEOID:cf8b522afc9e665b884d17e63585b2f1]] This is ridiculous... this is a dress compression sock ... these are not thick whatsoever.<br />1- wrong colors sent to me.  Tagged correctly with wrong colors<br />2-  I could not ever imagine wearing these hiking they are so thin...<br />3 they are a glorified dress sock....<br /><br />Move along if your looking for glorious cotton socks as these feel straight up polyester with some cotton
1.0,I'm 5'8&#34; an weigh 180 and an US large fit perfect.  My only problem was that the buttons did not match the photos.  All my buttons said &#34;fashion&#34; on them.  Twice. In bold letters. Plus the zipper was on the girls side.  I returned this jacket quickly.
1.0,Super cheap and doesn’t work at all.
1.0,"The hinges on the legs are very flimsy. Would not recommend purchasing, bent and broke while wearing on day 1."
1.0,It was defective ! Broke when I open the package! I had to return it!
1.0,"EDITED: The 5 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮sweats that I just purchased (and returned) were made in CHINA. The 5 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟  sweats that I purchased a year ago were made in PAKISTAN. That might explain the difference in the quality. If I could get the ones made in Pakistan, I would purchase them again. The ones made in China? I wouldn't get them again, even if they were free!<br /><br />----------<br /><br />I am EXTREMELY disappointed with these sweats; the quality has gone down HORRIBLY 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮.<br /><br />I purchased a pair of these sweats (dark charcoal heather) a year ago & liked EVERYTHING about them; they were 5 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟.<br /><br />I just purchased another pair (SUPPOSEDLY the same color... dark charcoal heather) & DISLIKED everything about them. These were 5 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮.<br /><br />The main differences:<br /><br />The color: The pair that I purchased a year ago was a TRUE dark charcoal heather. This pair was a VERY DRAB & UGLY brownish gray (NOT heather).<br /><br />The fabric: The pair that I purchased a year ago was VERY soft & comfortable. This pair was very ROUGH, SCRATCHY, STIFF, and VERY uncomfortable... like it was made from some rough sandpaper-ish, drab, ugly brownish-gray twine-like thread, interwoven w/cream-colored, rough twine-like thread, creating cream-colored tiny patches in the fabric).<br /><br />[I also just purchased another pair of these sweats in dark navy heather; the quality was the same as described above. I returned both pairs of these horrible sweats.]<br /><br />I would NOT purchase these again, and DEFINITELY would NOT recommend the current product."
1.0,The size chart says a small is 41 inches in length. I have a 28 inch waist (athletic build) and it barely fit. There is no belt left to hang down like the photos show.
1.0,I did not like these glass's<br />they did fit great but the lens were not crystal clear.<br />I was disappointed after purchase but they were returned without any issue's.
1.0,"There is a quarter sized grease-looking stain on the front, right on the chest. Returning."
1.0,"For the cost the quality of the fabric on this garment was incredibly cheap and uncomfortable. Sizing does not run true to their chart, the dirndl itself was much too big while the sleeves of the crop top were insanely tight, so much so I worried I'd be unable to remove it. I've bought &#34;costume&#34; dirndls that were more flattering and comfortable."
1.0,The size of this item is not what size I chose. This item was false advertisement.
1.0,"Too small, XL is normally a nice comfy fit for me, these are Asian sizes not US, color is NOT red but orange, material if thin stretchy not flannel looking like the picture. Very disappointed."
1.0,Although I expected the fit to be small so I ordered a larger size...not needed.  The size chart was pretty accurate I do believe.  The blazer does not look like the pictures either.  The material is rather flimsy and does not flatter like the pictures appear.
1.0,So many loose threads as soon as I opened & they came apart when I washed them.
1.0,Don't waste your money. Several major issues with this product:<br /><br />> Rounds were numbered incorrectly (WHAT!?!); a 6 was inserted between rounds 9 and 10 (see picture)<br />>Missing both a RB and a WR sheet. We had our first write-in on the SECOND pick of the draft (see picture)<br />>Many of the player stickers peeled off poorly and needed to be taped to the board (see picture)<br />>Hard to read names from more than a few feet away<br /><br />If I could give this product a ZERO I would.
1.0,Esto es de lo peor nada que ver con lo que muestra las imágenes y no es de acero es un material q el primer días se puso negro
1.0,"Unfortunately the distortion in the lenses is so terrible I can’t use them. I had high hopes for these since I bought a different brand that was half the price but pinched my nose bridge. These are stylish but once you gain focus in the tiny center “window” of the lens looking at your computer screen or phone, if you look a few (3-4) inches to the left or right or up or down, it’s terribly distorted. Also if you move your head even slightly left or right, your whole view turns into a slanted rhombus and is badly distorted. There’s no way to work on a computer with these where things can stay in focus.  I’m so sad I’ll have to return these. I think the lenses are poorly made although the frames are nice. The half priced ones are way more clear and I can see left and right through the entire lens."
1.0,This product was cheaply made. My daughter wore it once for a dance class and it has a rip in the seam of her left leg.....very disappointed 😞
1.0,Terrible and will be returning. The fabric is not even the same color as listed! Very disappointed
1.0,The bottom of the sole cracked after my husband wore them for 3 weeks.
1.0,Ive  purchased other Soojun womens overalls that were very very roomy and large. I was extremely dissapointed at how small these were. I had to give them to my little girl.. :(
1.0,SO SMALL. Mini products only. I returned for this reason.
1.0,"I ordered a split top with swim skirt. I received a blouson top with boy shorts. (And the sticker on the bag said Racerback, so it wasn't even what the bag said.) It did appear to be the right size and color/pattern, and looked well made. But I didn't try it on because it was totally not what I wanted. I won't order from Dreamsoar again, because actually getting what I ordered is important!"
1.0,Colors were much different and some faded out spots on a few pairs. Definitely seconds!
1.0,Nice shirt but way tooo small
1.0,They turned my ear black
1.0,Just received today and they are to big. I am almost 40 years old and it would not stay above my nose. I initially purchased these for my kids (10 & 11) but when I tested it on myself I realized very quickly they are not One Size Fits all. I also noticed the stitching was bad. It was not completely sown all the way around.  I’ve already printed the return label to send back. #disappointed
1.0,"This hat was so jacked up, there was no way of wearing it.... won’t ever order  hats online again"
1.0,Wore once tossel already fell off and is fraying on the edges.
1.0,Very clingy.<br /><br />Material looks cheap.
1.0,I do not like matreial...looks cheap.  Looks much nicer on picture....i will return or wear in my house only....disappointed :(
1.0,Worn once wash and literally half the size it was. From adult sock to fitting a toddler in 1 wash.
1.0,"Christmas gift for my step child and she LOVES anime. It fit just perfect on her, however there was no warning that if I were to wash and dry the hoodie that everything would stick together and the anime print would be COMPLETELY ruined along with the sweatshirt itself. Such a waste of money. I wish I would've known that that would have happened and I would have never dried it. I would love to get her another one but its not worth buying it a second time around. Super disappointed."
1.0,"Watch band came without spring rods, which I paid for.  Also, is not the original factory band as claimed.  Feels like hard plastic."
1.0,The gem looks like colored plastic. The wire holding the gem on the necklace broke in a day.
1.0,I do not like the fit.  and I did not get a watch cover protector that is shown in the picture.
1.0,Ordered assorted but they sent me all white. Size is way too big.
1.0,The dress was not the length it stated in the description. I wanted floor length and it was calf length.
1.0,Feet kept sliding to the front.
1.0,They are sold as arch support/leather. The look cheap.
1.0,"These earring are SO small, that even a newborn couldn't wear them."
1.0,"Very flimsy product, would not reccomend. They were too big and would never stay on your face. Plus the sides were bent which didn't help either."
1.0,Kinda cheap looking but it’s not like it was expensive. I don’t like it but someone else may
1.0,"I was very unhappy with this set. Looks cheap, the necklace is so short and I feel like my neck is being poked and pinched. Also the matching earrings, one of them was broken when I recieved them. Poor quality, I would not reccomend these to anyone!"
1.0,I sent back the dress last week and am still waiting for my refund.
1.0,Is not sterling steel
1.0,Be careful when you purchase these ... you cannot return them and the strength is 1.75
1.0,No this product DID NOT meet my expectations. Sizing is misrepresented. I will be returning
1.0,Sized for a five year old...or a large cat.
1.0,Received this ring with missing gems
1.0,There are big ruffles at the top of the collar around the neck that really stick out and on the cuff of the sleeves. It’s not a flattering dress at all. Very satin sheet like material
1.0,Me mandaron una manga largas y roja no la que pedi
1.0,"This item is sold as linen, it's 100% polyester."
1.0,I ordered the smallest it goes and it still just falls right off.
1.0,I purchased this style purse at a store in Dallas.  The rhinestones and embellishments came off.  I took them to friends of mine who did leather work and made jewelry.  I could not simply put the items back into the slots they came out of.  I contacted Montana West regarding extra parts or them repairing or replacing the purse.  They asked for pictures to be emailed to them and I did that.  I contacted them weekly for a month and they did not respond to emails or phone calls.  It wears out fast and easy.
1.0,The quality is not at all as I expected. It looks cheap and poorly made.
1.0,"Had for a month, ripped at seams almost immediately. Pretty disappointed!"
1.0,"Don't waste your money... shirt looked cheap and its extremely small. I bought a 2x just so I can have room to move around,cause i normally ware a Large or XL shirt but dang this shirt was way too small. And the string from ththe buttons were coming out it just wasnt a good product."
1.0,DO NOT PURCHASE THESE. AWFUL!
1.0,"These sandals squeak as you walk. And when I say squeak I actually mean it! Imagine making the sound a dog’s chewing toy makes, now imagine every step you take makes that sound. AWEFUL. Also, the arch support is barely there and they are way to big/tall near the thong toe split. Don’t like the little bumps either and they are longer than supposed to for the size. Wide shouldn’t be also long. Bad all over. Disappointed"
1.0,Very disappointed.  They are larger that actual size
1.0,It’s toy not sunglasses damaged first time I wear them not strong to wear them bad material ever experience
1.0,"It’s a nice looking umbrella but fragile.  Brakes easy, have to be super care to open and close.  Not easy to put back into the caring bag… I purchase the baby blue umbrella and was only able to use it once."
1.0,Looks very cheap and fake. not impressed and embarrassed to wear. Definitely not sterling silver....
1.0,"I received the product - I ordered as a gift and one T-shirt had damaged print. I ordered three different prints but on 2, there was the the same papabird print. I ordered it to match the mummy, daddy and baby. It was super embarrassing when I gave the gift. I didn’t have enough time to return it so I had to give it as is."
1.0,Straps broke within days of using also comes with a bad smell
1.0,"As soon as I opened the packaging, the shoes had this horrible smell (like rotten fish).  Did not even take the sandals out of the packaging due to the smell and returned them."
1.0,The buckle itself is cool and works well for holding the beer. However the metal piece where you attach the buckle to the belt is super thin and cheap. When i was adjusting the belt on my pants it broke off the first time i used it.
1.0,To small. Cant get wrinkles out. Very poor quality.
1.0,"How is this, in any way, size, shape or form... FLEECE-LINED???!!!"
1.0,Cheap and nasty
1.0,Very pretty but broke and rust as the other I ordered with a different seller. . I won't by stuff like that anymore..
1.0,Im so upset after receiving this outfit only good thing i can say is that the colours are vibrant and the material is good but its not true to size ine bit im out of a outfit for the event i got it for
1.0,SO THIN BREAKS VERY EASLY
1.0,A loose sloppy fit. The front and back flaps scrunches up.<br /><br />I don’t think these were made for my petite frame.<br /><br />I’m going to wash them and see if this helps.
1.0,Earring post was broken off. Very disappointing that I will not be able to wear these!!
1.0,"This was way way too small! Ordered it for a ten year old size 14/16, and it fits my 4T year old!!"
1.0,"So small across the shoulders and around arms. Looks like a sack.  Not flattering at all. Tried to return but missed the cut off date by a day due to all illness and things being closed<br />Now,  I will have to trash it, since it has no use but an over priced rag"
1.0,It's so small and tight for me....I couldn't wear..so sad
1.0,It was so bad and I just put it to the trash. It was not for men. It’s for women.
1.0,Shrunk badly upon washing.
1.0,WAY TOO SMALL. XL is actually an XS
1.0,"Nothing like the picture or description.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!  Do not order, safe yourself some $."
1.0,I have ONLY had this charm for two months and already three of the the &#34;designer plates&#34; on the butterfly wings have fallen off. VERY Cheaply made and not even worth the  money!
1.0,Had to return. These are 100% see through. Almost more like tights. Mine also came snagged
1.0,Carrying clip came off the case within first week of use. Almost lost my glasses :(
1.0,"This was not true to size at all, so much bigger"
1.0,The clasp would not stay in a locked position. Both the locking mechanism on the band itself and its ability to click together and stay closed failed. The watch looked nice and I wondered whether I should have ordered a watch with a leather clasp instead of the metal click type. I ordered the blue face with the silver metal clip band. I think bundling a bunch of items into a single category should be forbidden. It is misleading on the star review level.
1.0,They weren’t very fitting to the face and too thin.
1.0,"Fast shipping, but it does not fit my son. Even though we followed the size chart."
1.0,Cheap.... i hated it
1.0,Opened the package and one arm was broken off
1.0,"I love the color print, read reviews so brought a small, the pants seem like an extra large, top fits too small. Returned"
1.0,"This product is not what is shown. My wire is squared on the bottom, and the pads don't protect from the hard plastic inside them. Very painful to wear."
1.0,The posts were bent and the stones didn't match.
1.0,Cute pattern but the fabric hugs my mouth and is incredibly annoying. None of the other masks fir this way. I don't know why these did. Disappointing.
1.0,The sewing on the toes is very uncomfortable
1.0,It’s to tides even it’s the right size
1.0,"Cheaply made, scratchy fabric, don't fit at all. Extremely disappointed."
1.0,Not impressed at all. Very scratchy and rhe built in bra has a huge indent in it lile my boob is broken in half. Would not buy again.
1.0,"It works intermittently. The first one came in a box with the watch's case smushed and the watch thrown out, inside the box. Tried it and it worked intermittently, so I thought it was the packaging; however, I got a replacement and the packaging is fine and the watch still works intermittently.  What kind of watch is this? I don't recommend this for anyone."
1.0,Waste of money and time!  This looks like it was used and returned for a full refund!  I hate that I have to return this to Amazon because the thing should be tossed into the trash can.  The company will probably send it out to the next poor soul who hasn't the foggiest idea what they just bought.
1.0,Ripped within my first 2 weeks of using it.
1.0,too long and it didnt fit me. didnt really look as described . had to return. i initally didnt want to give a feedback but i keep getting tempted by repeated emails to getbmy feedback . so here it is
1.0,Crap! Don’t waste your money!
1.0,RETURN
1.0,Faded without me wearing it once!
1.0,Quality is terrible. Buttons do not match with buttonholes. Appears to have been made with no care.
1.0,none of them worked
1.0,"I got these for my wife for Valentines Day. These are supposed to be 18K gold but they are far from even being anything other than gold colored. I would return them but my window already closed. These are horrible. They are so cheaply made that my wife, who is a fan of costume jewelry and has quite the collection, can't wear them because they turn her ear lobes black. Cannot recommend. Unless the recommendation is to pass this product up."
1.0,"2nd time I wore it - The button broke, came out and my watch fell off. Luckily I was in line and a lady behind me saw it fall, told me, or it would have been lost. Do not buy these and I would not buy frim this company. Deserves NO stars"
1.0,The bracelet fell apart after wearing it just a few times. The elastic broke in several places and the beds fell off while I was at church. It's beautiful though of all three of them were beautiful.
1.0,"Cheap, horrible print and material not at all like the picture. I wish I could return it. Unless you like cheap dollar store clothes, do yourself a favor and do not buy!"
1.0,They were toooo small!!!!
1.0,The size is not what expected
1.0,Ment for men with no legs. Not made of a durable material. Was able to return with no Hassel
1.0,I bought these in black and they are COMPLETELY see-through. Very upsetting because they’re so comfortable :/
1.0,The shaft is so tight I can’t get my foot in them. Very disappointed.
1.0,"wore out real fast inside a month showing signs of wear, don't buy.."
1.0,"I don't know why this dress sells out. For the price, I thought the dress was going to be a heavy jersey. Jersey is fall out the bag and ready to wear. This dress must be dry cleaned first. I don't think you can wash it. The tag says one thing, but the material is like a cheap cotton. I just received it, took it out the bag, and the material has beaded up cotton all over it. It is not stain resistant or has a sheen. The black threading at the arms and bottom hem makes it look cheap. The same black threading was used to attach the interior tags, so if you wear a high ponytail or have short hair it will show. The entire dress is covered in wrinkles. I am returning it. For this price point, the quality is not there."
1.0,It did not look like a dress it looks like a big sheet with the holes in it
1.0,Horrible product was not as pictured just a hard flat piece of plastic waist of money would like a full refund I would not recommend purchasing this item
1.0,"Broke immediately, cute though. Wish it didn't break the first time it was dropped. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Broke the first time o wore it.
1.0,Purse is pretty however strap is broken!  I don’t want to return purse but I need what I paid for
1.0,Diff material than how it looks in the picture. Wish I could return it but it’s a pain. Looks like you can wear it as a night gown. Very disappointed.
1.0,"I knew that, for a $10 wig, I wasn't going to get the best quality, but I was expecting to get what the picture showed.  This was not the case.  I needed a wig with bangs and I got a crappy version with no bangs and horrible hair quality.  With no time to do a return, I worked with what I had.  Once I styled it, it became a Frankenstein fro.  It fit fine, but I wore it for my event and then promptly tossed it in the garbage.  A total disappointment."
1.0,This fit more like a very small medium.  Bought it to be loose over another tank and am returning it to buy a bigger size. Normally I can wear a small to small medium.
1.0,The sewing in the butt crack kept coming apart. Waste of money.
1.0,Sorry for the bad review but its HUGE!  Not the size of a normal wallet and more like a mini purse.. not really made for a guy...<br />Perhaps I should have looked at the dimensions....  Not quite sure where my passport would fit in either?
1.0,Cheap- do not buy.
1.0,This dress is way too big for me. The chart did not apply at all!! I am very disappointed with the quality of the fabric as well.
1.0,Did not fit properly in my K40. Put directly into trash can
1.0,Order a size bigger than you think. They run small!
1.0,Does NOT work
1.0,"These were a comfortable duck boot. The only problem, they DID NOT keep my feet warm AT ALL. They are rated to like -10° or -15° F, and the day I wore them to work it was 35°F and my feet feet were frozen before I even got to my job. I had to have someone bring me a different pair of boots. Sent these back for a refund. WAY too expensive to not do one of their main jobs!"
1.0,One jar came completely shattered and there was glass dust all over the cubes & bag they came in. Says item can’t be refunded.
1.0,"This top is wide and short. Came with a snag and large hole in the front- I need it for a costume party in a few days so I'm not sending it back, I'm am however being forced to cut it up and sew it into something wearable- which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place - for $10 I could've gotten prettier material and did it myself in the first place"
1.0,I received a medium which is way too big. I have ordered medium before twice with great success. So am disappointed  i then received 2 correct sized suits but in the wrong pattern. Please send me the correct order.  Size medium print 12.  Thank you
1.0,Very cheaply made edges and corners were fraying after 1 use as a bandana
1.0,The same day she wore the color changed. It got ugly and wide. Bad quality
1.0,"Slits went up almost to my armpits. Unless you are 4'6&#34;, this dress is not going to fit like it does in the picture. It came to well above my knees at 5'9&#34;."
1.0,This is a kids size hat marketed as an adult one size fits all. Not even close. Returning it now.
1.0,Image fused together in the dryer... Awful... Do not buy...
1.0,Not warm or cozy. They are thin.
1.0,"Didn’t work for me. Could not tighten these enough to make much of a difference. Consequently, did not keep breath from escaping the mask and fogging my glasses. Maybe too long."
1.0,"These shoes are too narrow across the top of my toes.  I have several pairs of coach shoes that I've bought in store, this was my first pair buying through Amazon online and these appear to not be cut right."
1.0,"Falling apart within 24 hours, what a waste."
1.0,"Socks are cool. Bought as a gift she likes them but only good around the house, don't wear in shoes as they are extremely thin and your toe will tear through and make holes."
1.0,Never wore it sent it back but they said I didn't so I have no idea if its too small somewhat small etc.  I sent It back and had to pay for it. Not good.
1.0,not to happy
1.0,"These leggings do not stay up. I like the fabric, but they continuously slide down."
1.0,"Had high hopes for this dress because of the relatively “higher” price for amazon apparel, but should have known better. This is a $15 dollar dress at best. While it resembles the photo, it’s definitely not the quality of the dress in the photo.<br /><br />Totally see-through and weirdly cut with NO FREE RETURNS!<br /><br />If you decide to buy, size up at least once and purchase a quality slip!"
1.0,"I wore this for about a week before I couldn't take it anymore.  The part that 'locks' it onto the watch, was flimsy and kept coming apart.  Any pressure on it, forced it open and my watch would fall off."
1.0,Large for the 7-9 years are really short…like for toddlers. Unfortunate buy!!!
1.0,"This didn’t fit anything like the product photos show. It is basically a poorly constructed blanket/poncho with weird baggy sleeve holes. It isn’t soft, either."
1.0,"Not for big headed women. Sadly, I had to return this because my dome was no home for it."
1.0,I was not pleased with the quality of the product. Everything about the product is made with cheap components.
1.0,"Right size but hard to get on and off.  Very uncomfortable because of binding, especially in the calves.  Apparently made for somebody with extremely skinny legs."
1.0,Tiny watch. Perfect for kids.
1.0,"They are much larger than I thought, so even though YOU a know they aren’t real, everyone else knows they aren’t real. After putting in both of my earrings my second earring backing would not go on. This is the same backing that I took off of the earring mind you, as I put it on or attempted to the piece that went through my ear bent. It is now crumpled and stuck in my ear. It took forever to get out of my ear. Will NOT be making this purchase or anything close to it again."
1.0,"thin, not heavy duty I was expecting"
1.0,"This is not over the knee. I am 5' 1"" and wear a size 5 shoe and it just touches the underside of the knee."
1.0,Runs extremely small and tight. Returning
1.0,faded in a few days
1.0,This is that shiny material not sweat shirt material.  Does not feel soft and comfortable
1.0,I wore it one & washed it. It's a dry clean only shirt but I didn't realize that
1.0,"The don't fit to good, don't work let it say with me I'll try anything."
1.0,"One of the belts arrived broken, the one that wasn't fits pretty loose and my waist isn't tiny - about 30in. Disappointed."
1.0,much smaller than they appear in pictures.  Going right in the trash can.
1.0,This mask is one ply and knit fabric so that you can not breathe through it.  Looks ok but looks are not important if you can not use it. Don't waste your money.
1.0,I never got to wear the  dress the zipper is cheap and ripped the when I put it on. Dress fit perfectly fine otherwise.
1.0,Turned the back of my neck green.
1.0,I wore these yoga socks only once to a pilates class and most of the grippy dots on the heel and ball of the foot fell off.
1.0,Just looks cheap.<br />Kinda neat.<br />Definitely a $10 item though
1.0,Very cheap feeling and not comfortable at all.
1.0,This is what the collar looks like. Unwearable :(
1.0,Very disappointed with this. Looks nothing like the pictures. I ordered the orange which looks more like coral in the picture. What I got was neon orange. The material is very silky and cheap looking. The shorts look like something your child would wear for a YMCA basketball game.
1.0,They run very small. I even bought a size larger...
1.0,"This is just a waffle knit long sleeve top, is not a sweater. Looks cheap, not impressed. Ordered XL fits alright not too loose not too tight."
1.0,These are the most uncomfortable socks I have ever worn don't waste your money
1.0,"Poor quality, looks cheap and zipper is too rough. I was going to return but postage to China cost more then the item itself."
1.0,"I ordered these pants 2 sizes up because I like my clothes loose.  Not only are they way too small, but the fabric is do thin I can see through  them!  No packing slip to return them, so buyer beware,  or better yet,don't  waste your money!"
1.0,The clip is so weak it constantly comes undone. You cannot move a muscle.
1.0,the actual watch does not look as pretty. and i don't see how the tool to shorten the band would work without spending money at a watch shop
1.0,"So sad. I  loved this sweatshirt, but sadly after one wash the design started peeling."
1.0,"strap width tapers, so it is smaller than lug width. feels like fake leather, not soft calf skin. very stiff."
1.0,I understand that game card means this is a reproduction. The box says an expansion pack is included but there is no expansion pack. This is a fraudulent listing that needs to be taken down.
1.0,Cheaply made an way to large
1.0,Mush smaller than normal sizes
1.0,Not at all what i ordered! I ordered a short sleeve jumpsuit and received this ugly jacket. Will never order from Pretty Garden again.
1.0,Not the best quality product and I was disappointed at how they fit. Unfortunately I was not able to return due to washing and wearing however I will not purchase again from this vendor.
1.0,"I have only have this umbrella for about 2 months. I am very disappointed in how badly it is already faded. while it was folded down the outside edges were in the Sun and that is where it faded.  The color is a little off from what I wanted, which is more of a forest green, but I could live with that. The rest of the umbrella seems to be very well made and if it wasn't for the fading I would be happy with it."
1.0,Hhhhhhh for baby
1.0,"Watch stopped working after 1st month.  Looks great, but poorly manufactured, and/or crappy Chinese battery."
1.0,I'm 5'8&#34; tall so it's hard to find dresses that are long enough for me.  That being said this dress was unwearable.  Width wise it fit me but the &#34;waist line&#34; was half way between my bust and my navel.  The pockets were in line with my navel.  It was awkwardly short & I had to return it.
1.0,Too small does not fit. Going to return
1.0,"This is tiny. Like, really, really small. I typically wear a 16/18 or 1x top, so I ordered the XXL based on the measurements, and reviews. It would barely go on, and the boob area is a total joke. So, I ordered a 3XL. Which SHOULD have been too big, if you're going by the measurements listed. It was also too small. I ended up returning both sizes. Also, I get that the one I ordered was red and white checkered, but did it actually have to FEEL like a cheap tablecloth?! Just not happy, overall."
1.0,If I could give this negative stars I would!!! Horrible. The dress had holes in it and the tool is way too long!
1.0,Vey very cheap looking it’s being down the value of my watch how cheap it looks and feels
1.0,Very cheaply made ripped when my grandson wore to school
1.0,Charms are facing wrong way and are no flushed with skin and they turned bronze after 2 days.
1.0,The skirt was too big and came with pen marks on it.
1.0,This was a birthday present for my daughter. Upon un-wrapping it and taking it out of its plastic sleeve a large black stain was found in the middle of shawl fabric. It will be treated and washed. If the stain is not removed it will be sent back for replacement.<br />Otherwise the product is very nice and was happily received until the stain was noticed.<br />I'm very disappointed in the sloppy quality control and care of this product. It will cast doubt upon a future order I was considering.
1.0,ordered a 3X and it's as small as a Med.
1.0,"Well I guess you get what you pay for. 6 T-Shirts for 15 bucks, I should have known better...<br />2 of the shirts stitching was totally screwed up.<br />The other 4 seemed smaller than the other 2. These shirts would be good if you were going to toss them out after one use. I haven't washed them yet, I can only imagine how they will come out in the dryer. I am gearing up for a good laugh!"
1.0,I was embarrassed to give this! I could have made it myself.  Don't spend the $!!! Not a happy Valentine's....I
1.0,This was not as pictured.
1.0,If you baked a potato in foil and then unfurled it and wore it as a Halloween costume it would look better than this paper-y mess
1.0,"I have sensitive ears, and these made my ears pitch like crazy. Cheap, not worth the money."
1.0,I returned this.  Way too large!  Not flattering for a 5'0&#34; frame.
1.0,The shoes smell bad. I'm not sure why but the leather stinks.
1.0,"This dress is awful. The stitching is off, the material is thin and the fit is awkward"
1.0,"This towel is very disappointing! It is thin, hard, scratchy and dingy! It looks like it has been washed many times with dark colors. It is truly the opposite of the words used to describe it in the overview! Undecided if I want to put the energy in repackaging and returning since I threw the mailing envelope away!!"
1.0,I only got part of this product.  I didn't get all of what is in the picture.  Don't purchase this.
1.0,Thin non-structured
1.0,Will fall right off.  I have yet to find a band that fits this watch correctly.  I stuck with the original black.
1.0,The patches on the elbows were not even with each other. The sleeves were way too short and the neck of the material was the only part down together the rest was hanging loose so it had an unfinished look to it. Returned it immediately.
1.0,The picture shows a YELLOW color gold but you will get a ROSE gold color hoop. NOT what I wanted at all!
1.0,A hole during first wear.
1.0,"I was pretty disappointed, you can see right through the fabric and it’s not the right length. I’m 5’9 and ordered a large. I wish I would’ve returned this. I’ll never wear this dress out of the house"
1.0,"Looked cute - but several flaws:<br />Inside the underwear next to your body, the material is not smooth in in the pattern of the chevron coloring. Kind of ragged stitching that itches in the pattern of the chevron. Additionally, these are supposed to be one size fits most. These will only fit small non-athletic gals who do not have any kind of booty. I squat, I have a booty and these were plumbers crack underwear for me. Also, the legs ride up and give you a wedgie."
1.0,Cute design but the color is too bright.
1.0,"horrible product, they fell apart the ;minute the girls had them on, waste of my hard earned money."
1.0,These glasses have zero sun protection. It literally looks like I’m looking out a window with no shade. Do not buy!
1.0,the item was great however the shipping was 5 days late with no explanation from seller after I reached out to them.
1.0,They broke within a week of wearing them. They come unglued.
1.0,"The fit is ok now, but it being all cotton it'll probably shrink. Disappointed"
1.0,This is the cheapest quality sweatshirt I’ve ever seen. It’s like painted polyester/recycled plastic. A total joke. Stay away.
1.0,"I loved this suit when I first got it, but four months later I had to buy a new suit. It is all stretched out. It comes all the way to my knees and the bust well let's just say it looks like I shrunk several cup sizes from its stretching. Sucks after four months I need a new suit."
1.0,Runs very small. Couldn't even get it closed and I ordered two sizes larger due to the comments. I returned the item.
1.0,The product read as if it included the skirt. O only received the turtleneck. Deceptive!
1.0,fits very small.
1.0,Do not buy based on this being ceramic.  The ring is NOT ceramic.  The top edges will wear off very easy.
1.0,In the caption it says that it fits other 16 g jewelry.. and it does not. I cannot find a top to fit to screw on.. WASTE OF MONEY
1.0,"Very big, size L equals to a XL. It did not hug my curves it fit to big and looks very cheap . Nothing like on the picture"
1.0,"Fit is perfect down side is not really warm ,and already splitting at toe ."
1.0,"Very disappointed, it said floor length  but is very short. Wish i got a xxl lrg even though i am a medium. Dont know how to return"
1.0,TERRIBLE! I just got this yesterday and seriously couldn't have been further from the picture OR description! this is the cheapest towel like thing I have ever seen! I would have NEVER spent what I did had I known!
1.0,Terribly quality made with the cheapest material. Tarnished already
1.0,Not like it is broken it came broking
1.0,"Disappointed in the material. I’m so sorry, just being honest."
1.0,"Not exactly what I was expecting. Too small, order an XL but fits like a M."
1.0,Didn't look like the picture the Model displays. Very poor material...
1.0,Part of a costume so It's okay for this purpose only.  Would not wear it otherwise.
1.0,Not high waist and it's see thu. Not recommend
1.0,These hats were horribly made. Very cheese. Do not buy.  Try the Red fashionable one. It was what made me decide to write this review.  Horrible craftsmanship. Inferior materials but I came quick!<br />Now with my red one im an going to return this one.  It is horrible.
1.0,"Not Hyposia! Label says MKAYA; tag, which fell off when I touched it, said “made in Vietnam “; no washing instructions on label or shirt. Bad chemical smell so I had to wash it in Woolite and cool water before even trying it on! Only good thing about it is that it does fit and since I washed it, will keep. I do not recommend."
1.0,the bag it was in was dirty and it arrived broken
1.0,"way to small, it does not look like the picture on Amazon."
1.0,Very hard to open and close
1.0,Too small. Says it is for a toddler but wouldn't be large enough for a 2 year old! Super cute good quality but very misleading size.
1.0,They smell after a few uses. They dont breath well.
1.0,The edge that meets the watch was not cut straight and there was a gap between the two. Returning.
1.0,This is a CLUNKER WATCH.  It is a VERY big Clunker.  There is no information in the shipping box.  The date has to be changed from the GTM to the correct time zone.  There is a very short strap too.<br /><br />Tony
1.0,This shirt would not fit a 8 year girl let along adult.
1.0,I have order a XL and it runs too small
1.0,The colors were completely different. I loved the dark rustic look of the colors in the picture. The shirt is actually bright.
1.0,"Very uncomfortable, not stretching like spandex ."
1.0,I used them one time and they are already ripped I dont know if I got them like that I just realized today on my second night very dissatisfied
1.0,I looked like a purple Flinstone. Definitely will post a picture when I have time. Don’t play yourself!
1.0,First of all I loved the band until it fell off and shattered my watch face... Where it slides into the watch must have been defective because I was shocked that it came off like that...
1.0,"The Keychain I ordered for my niece's graduation took over 2 weeks to get and when it finally arrived, it's not as described. The rose gold color is more gold color and nothing like the description. The Keychain is cheaply made and not worth $11. I spent a lot of time looking for a nice Keychain for my niece with the specific rose gold color and got this. I could have gone to Walmart and bought something like this and probably better if that what was I wanted, but I wanted something nicer. Very disappointing and I'm returning this asap. Don't waste you money."
1.0,broken already.
1.0,If it gives you any idea of sizing...the model is probably wearing a 2x.
1.0,"Instead of getting this, I received peacock feather headband. Did not want to waste time trying to send back."
1.0,"The costume was not wearable.  The blouse’s sleeves were too tight, the jumper was enormous, and cheap material.  Wasn’t worth the expense to have it altered, or returned."
1.0,"This is a very cute shirt.If it fit it would of been a five star,but it is not true to size at all.I ordered a 3xl,biggest they have and it fit more like a medium/large.It has no stretch at all.Wish it would have been fit,because it is actually cute.Hope this helps."
1.0,Buttons fell off sweater when I took it out of package VERY POOR QUALITY
1.0,Weird sleeve. Slim fit. Returned.
1.0,"The material feels like a bathing suit. Where it is double lined on the chest, the fabric stops half way so that it makes a wrinkled shelf across your top. Overly big."
1.0,"very cheap, sending it back"
1.0,The item receivef is nowhere close to the item shown on website. Color is bright red not wine. the design if dress is different
1.0,This is the second time this has happened with these glasses; any repair ideas?  Super glue changes color & is too messy
1.0,"They were two sizes too big. They are shipped out of China so, if you need to replace them it takes a while. You should place order in the fall or winter. Seller did give me a refund."
1.0,Ordered the elite blue v neck and received a navy blue crew neck t shirt.. back it goes
1.0,This too runs really really small! I bought an cal it’s like a medium
1.0,These feel like thin plastic.  They are made of some material that is strange.
1.0,If I could I would give it no stars - I understand you get what you pay for but I got so many duplicates !!!!!  So I emailed the distributer and he basically told me no replacements if I want a refund I can but it would be a dollar or I can mail it back just go somewhere else it's all false advertisement oh and if I'm honest I now have 30 tongue rings with identical patterns just different shades
1.0,My daughter kept getting her feet out of them they were too big around the toes
1.0,"It smelled moldy when I received it. I cleaned it, but it never lost the moldy smell. I have chosen to not wear this item as a result of the smell."
1.0,"The R is not even red, it is a burnt orange color. The material is not sweatshirt material, its that polyester itchy stuff, which I clearly missed in the description, because the title said sweatshirt. Sleeves are super short for an XL.<br />Not true to size at all."
1.0,Muy mala calidad para el precia que se pagó..no es recomendado para q se venda en Amazon hablo en lo personal de mi persona
1.0,Don't waste your money.  One of the metal eyelets on the pant leg tore off within 5 minutes of the package arriving.
1.0,"The elastic in these could not be convinced to stay straight. It would twist around and bunch fabric around right at my waist line. Very unflattering. I got tired of fussing with them, and I eventually donated them. I would say don't bother, they look dumpy because of this. I just ended up spending extra cheddar on some Vuori shorts which are actually flattering (I was hoping these would be sort of a dupe for a Lululemon/Vuori shorts)"
1.0,It was not the part that i need to fix the milestone 2.0 Okley
1.0,"This shirt just doesn't make sense. Hard to explain, but it feels like no matter how you put it on, it's backwards. Obviously a cheaply made shirt. I'm not entirely sure that whoever made this has ever worn a shirt, or knows how they work"
1.0,The shorts I received are not the same as in the picture. The material is stiff and does not fall lose like in the picture and I don’t have a cuff at the bottom of my shorts. The color is the same. I wouldn’t recommend this product.
1.0,"The material feels great, but these are not workout leggings. Sweat shows through almost immediately and they start to slip down when moving around. Horribly disappointed."
1.0,Color shown in the pic is totally different and also for a loose fit jacket it fit small
1.0,Went back the day I received it.
1.0,Love the earrings.  Super cute.  They arrived broken because they were shipped in a paper envelope.
1.0,They look dainty but are huge! Maybe I will try to make a pin out of them.
1.0,"They did look cool and worked relatively well for the first week, but shortly after they broke in my backpack(while all my other sunglasses were fine) You get what you pay for"
1.0,The structure of the dress is completely uneven. Quality of fabric is completely unacceptable for an Amazon product. Too lie if a quantity. Not satisfied with it at all!
1.0,"I'm giving this one star, not because of the product but because of how difficult it was to try and return this. I thought I had ordered a necklace for my fitbit flex and did not realize this was for a flex 2 until it arrived. Not only was I NOT able to return this without having to drive an hour and a half out of my way but I would have to also pay a return fee that was about half the cost of this product. Long story short, if anyone is in Northern Virginia and would like to purchase this from me...let me know!"
1.0,Is that all I got.?
1.0,Horrible. Only worked for 2 days. Charged it fully and it never came back on. My daughter was so sad but I refuse to buy another one.
1.0,"Cute belt, but it smells so bad! The smell is completely overwhelming. I would describe it as somewhere between the smell of a chain-smoker's attic and a dirty litter box I hung it up in my bathroom to air out, but it just ended up making my bathroom smell equally as terrible. I can even smell it from my bedroom. Like I said, very cute in appearance, but I doubt I'll ever be able to wear it because after hanging up for 3 days it has only managed to make everything around it small equally as bad. Very disappointed."
1.0,Their XL fits more like S or M.
1.0,Broken upon arrival!
1.0,I didn’t get any hoops like it shows in the picture I got was a metal hoop with nothing on it
1.0,I received the watch and the batteries are dead. Waste of money.
1.0,They were torn
1.0,"It's huge and very see-through. Other colors may work out better, but you may want to order a size down."
1.0,Not at all thigh high and barely over the knee. Killed my thick thighs that were trying to save lives
1.0,"Not REAL sterling silver! This product faded..""silver"" rubbed off."
1.0,Beyond not true to size.
1.0,This is really nice leather. To bad  it only lasted about a month before screws started falling out of it. It has now been two months and I have had to replace three screws that worked their way loose. Every time my watch fell to the ground. Luckily I had a screen protector or my watch would be really scratched up.
1.0,Terrible. Material was super thin and see through. It took 8 weeks to arrive just to open it and see that it looks nothing like the picture. And you have to pay to return the item.  Waste your money on something else.
1.0,"I ordered a size Large, and the coat was so small that I couldn't get my arm in the sleeve that the back of the coat wasn't wide enough for it to extend across my back.  I normally wear between a size medium or large.  I ordered a large since I wanted to wear this over sweaters.  Not only that, when I returned the item for what is clearly a repeated customer complaint, they charged me for return shipping."
1.0,Too small for size.
1.0,"Hard to get in, and even harder to close! After hours and hours,<br />I finally got the left one closed, the right one just will have to wait<br />until tomorrow! I have no patience left. Plus they are not stamped.<br />Could be silver for all I know. PLEASE do yourself a favor and save<br />yourself the aggravation, time and money."
1.0,"These were awful. About 1/3 were broken so they didn't have the loop needed to use them, it was either cracked off partially or missing entirely. Or other parts of them broke off. And some weren't even in the theme, I got random Russian dolls and Chinese characters."
1.0,"The dress was very tight, may have been sized wrong"
1.0,"I was hopeful that this shirt would be perfect, i've been looking for the color brown and you cannot find them in the stores, no brown tops anywhere, while the material feels nice, the shirt size is proportioned very strange.  I generally wear a 1x and went to a 3x and it's just a horrible fit"
1.0,"Terrible produ t to buy....many parts, several incorrect from a left over model and NO INSTRUCTIONS. Parts like wheels and tires substituted with cheap plastic items."
1.0,I am normally a L but decided just to order a xl to be safe since a lot of the china made things run small. And the xl fits like a M. Very disappointed!!
1.0,The quality is Poor at best.  VERY thin.
1.0,This shirt was much too small.
1.0,Metals are not shiny; three earrings match; fourth different shape
1.0,Had it for a couple of days now and it started to fade not a good feel
1.0,Haven't  opened this pair but my son wore the other pair one time and seam spilt between  legs with an hr of achool
1.0,Coat is a lightweight fleece with no lining.  It is okay for a light spring jacket but definitely not a warm coat.  Keeping it for spring because it is the color I was looking for in a coat.
1.0,It broke within less than 3 months!!
1.0,"I bought this for a beautiful girl that lost her life. I needed when I chose two day, I gave to her the Rosary that I carried when I was confirmed and married. She was 12 years old and gave her organs so that 5 other children could live. I still don't have the rosary, that was 7 days ago. http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Family-Donates-Organs-of-Girl-Struck-Killed-By-Car-347344791.html I have never met her, I don't know the family. SO keep my $12.00."
1.0,DOD not fit. Too short. Want to return.
1.0,NOT TIFFANY BLUE! Can’t return!
1.0,A good amount of pearls had fallen off the bracelet before it was even out of the packaging. Worthless
1.0,I am going to return the 2 I haven't opened. They were so tight they restricted blood flow to my lower legs. They are NOT easy to get on if you are arthritic.
1.0,"They were nice shoes, the colors were bright and the picture was good quality, but unfortunately I was sent a pair of shoes that was two sizes smaller than what I ordered."
1.0,"Extremely large for a &#34;Small&#34;. My wife is a size 5 and the small we ordered are more like a size 8. She cannot wear them. Also, the beige and white pair had blue stains on the material? Very poor quality."
1.0,"The ends are not seen, they are looks and freyed. I washed the mask one time - and the fabric pulled everywhere. It is not comfortable and it is itchy. I also had to wait over a month for it to arrive since it came from China. I would not recommend this mask at all."
1.0,I just received in the mail. Necklace came broken with missing pieces .
1.0,Cheap material and doesn’t hold!  Definitely not compression! Very disappointed!
1.0,Didn’t like the fit at all
1.0,This blouse is cut extremely small. You will need 3 sizes bigger. But the material is good
1.0,"Excited for nothing. couldn't get 1 leg in. XL - 170, I gave it to my sister in law who wears a medium and it fit her just right."
1.0,La tela no es lo que esperaba
1.0,I don’t think this item is true to size
1.0,The outfit is really cute on and the colors are vibrant. The low stars are due to having to send it back because it's torn in 2 places upon arrival. Disappointing!
1.0,Never again..the letters are too tiny
1.0,Cheap and won’t even snap together to stay closed
1.0,"This doesn't even deserve 1 star, it is not at all like the one in the picture and NO WAY TRUE TO SIZE! I am normally a medium but I decided to order and XL just to be on the safe side and it fit more like a small and it does not poof out not even a little, it is skin tight with no give or stretch what so ever! And I'm not talking sexy tight either because where it connects to the black tank it's all bunched and looks so so weird and awful. PLEASE DO NOT ORDER THIS DRESS!!! I wouldn't even pay 50cents for this!!"
1.0,I looked like a Victorian widow in mourning….
1.0,broke the first time i wore it. as did my friends that i bought for her.
1.0,"I bought this as a gift to my husband for Father’s Day. In less than a week, the picture has completely.....dissolved from the front. Definitely a waste of money."
1.0,"I bought this for my daughter for our Christmas Eve pajama tradition.  As most parents know, sometimes when you are wrapping gifts, you have to do it quickly so you don't get caught.  I didnt even notice the huge tear in the shirt before I wrapped it up and put it under the tree, and since it was her Christmas jammies, of course she wanted to wear them, so now I cant even return them.  $30 is a lot of money for jammies to start with, but when they come ripped, it's just disaapointing."
1.0,It did not come with the bracelet.
1.0,Beautiful bracelet but way too big for my wrist. I ended up returning it.
1.0,This coat was way 2 small and on top of that its basicly a windbreaker with a fake fur linning that is 2X smaller than that. Its made horridly i do not recommend it at all!
1.0,This top is NOT 100% cotton as advertised! It’s more like 50% spandex and cotton. It reminds me of something underwear would be made out of...very disappointed!
1.0,The pants don't lie flat at the seam between the waist and pant leg - the gathers are really bunchy. The fabric is almost plastic in feel - it even sounds like plastic when you move it. These went straight back.
1.0,Material too thin and see thru!  got an XL and still too tight!
1.0,Band started cracking after only 2 weeks. Very sad because I liked the look of this band
1.0,There are other reviews saying the same thing. Mine came ripped and feels kind of cheap. The wool insulation is very thin as well
1.0,These shoes only lasted for 2 months with normal wear.  The velcro has failed on both shoes.  I dont recomend these shoes.
1.0,"Definitely not what was expected. Ordered a small and it was way too big, the material was shiny and the overall shorts looked cheap and poorly made. The colour was off, the blue turned out to be a hue closer to lilac. Don't advise purchasing."
1.0,Cheap crap form China....
1.0,Fabric was way too thin and see through.
1.0,This dress is not worth the money. It is cheep looking and doesn't fit right. Also the company plays games and won't let you send it back without going through steps to send it back...
1.0,I received it broken in the mail
1.0,"poor quality, not like the picture."
1.0,"This shirt was such a disaster!  One sleeve way longer than the other, bmcut our area on shoulder huge, knot comes almost above waist line. It was like the shirt was too large on top and too small on bottom!  Returned immediately."
1.0,"Smell like formaldehyde, which make me feel really sick wearing it. Would not recommend for anyone"
1.0,This opinion is not for this exact bag but for Jessica Simpson bags in general. I have never had such a poorly made bag. The trim on both of the inner side pockets split in the first month. The zipper broke within 2 months. Wasted money.
1.0,What I  just received is definitely Not Polartec zero Polartec tags and not Polartec quality. I will be returning.
1.0,Very cheaply made . My son wore them once and they look like they need to be thrown away. I tried to contact the seller and got no response . Will not be ordering from this seller again. Don’t waste your money
1.0,Looked used smelled wierd. Disapointed. Won't use due to the virus scare .
1.0,I received this jacket and it was terrible quality. It literally looks like a trash bag with sleeves. I immediately requested a return but the seller would not authorize or return an attempts at contact. I ended up donating it. Don’t buy this or anything else from this seller.
1.0,The bottoms fit but the shirt is to tight like a size med and I ordered a xxL
1.0,"Poor quality, way smaller than expected."
1.0,Returned. Looked nothing like the picture.
1.0,Very poor quality. Little pictures of cardinals on each side of the earring we're still supposed to be stuck on there but we're actually stuck inside of the package! Send it back for return don't know where it is and have never received a refund
1.0,"I had high hopes for this belt based upon other's reviews. My husband wears belts daily to work and this has not lasted long at all. Within a month it was already falling apart. He has since declared a ban on me purchasing belts online, says you have to hold it in your hands to really get a feel of whether or not it's junk and will last. If you're only going to wear casually and not a daily user I'm sure this is fine. Don't expect it to last though :(."
1.0,I will never buy their watches the band has broken already that's ridiculous.  I want to write this company for selling this cheap product. I actually should get a full refund being a prime member
1.0,"The coat states to be 3X, and I cannot even put it on. The circumference around the chest is 50 inches narrower than a 3X. They don't understand American sizes. Perhaps they don't understand English. This is the second time that one of these companies sells a product grossly smaller than expected, and they also take a very long time to deliver.<br />In fact, both companies did not bother to announce that the products would arrive considerably delayed."
1.0,TOO MUCH OF AN OPEN NECK LINE. TOO LOOSE  AT THE NECK. VERY DISAPPOINTED
1.0,Fake plastic watch.
1.0,These did not stay on the back of my foot. It slipped right into my shoes. The small silicone strip on the back was useless. I am sorry I bought them.
1.0,Does not look like the picture. Not worth your money. Sending back.
1.0,"This item is ridiculous, it was all tangled  up when I open the package and to this day with all my efforts and the attempts of my husband it is still tangled up."
1.0,"See through, cheap fabric, WAYYYY too big"
1.0,The product description and order says pack of 12 umbrellas but only 1 umbrella was delivered and Charged me for 12.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture shown.
1.0,poorly made... Cute idea
1.0,Need to let people no that it run small
1.0,only lasted for about a year before outer lining started to peel off
1.0,looks like a pillow case with sleeves  :(
1.0,Very disappointing. Looks good on paper. But really cheap looking in person  this is truly a case of you get what you pay for
1.0,Fits very boxy.
1.0,"Description says this is cotton/rayon, but as you can see by the  it's mostly rayon with some polyester. I thought it would be more like a sweatshirt. The fabric is just weird with the embroidery on it. Like embroidering performance sports fabric. Also, it's huge. I ordered up because I like things loose and items here tend to run small, but I think this is a men's size shirt. Awful all around."
1.0,The straps were horrible and the fabric that creates the skirt was really cheap and somewhat see through so it didnt cover like it was supposed to
1.0,It was okay shirt was too small pants were too big
1.0,I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE NICE A IT IS HARD TO  FIND CLIP ON EARRINGS NOW A DAYS BUT THEY HARD TO OPEN THE BACKS TO PUT ON.  NOT REALLY WHAT I HAD HOPED FOR
1.0,"Cute, warm but didn’t work with my phone or any phone, the point of getting these gloves was to be able to touch my phone without taking my hand out of the glove, ended up throwing these in my kids glove pile for them to use for playing outside in the snow."
1.0,Cheaply made. Cute tho
1.0,ended up returning.
1.0,Incredibly flimsy fabric. Sleeve was torn open by the end of my first day in it.
1.0,"I usually wear an XL but when I ordered an XL it was too large. I bought 3 hoodies. (Red, green, and pink)  Because the hoodies were too large I had to return them. The shipping was expensive and I was not happy about that.  I will never buy these hoodies again."
1.0,I had to cut the straps to fix a 2x
1.0,This item was broken when I received it! Very dissatisfied!!
1.0,"I thought these were really sturdy when they arrived and was so excited. But lo and behold, less than 2 months or semi regular wear and this happened. Really disappointed in this quality and they were that cheap!"
1.0,Falls apart all over. Total mess.
1.0,Super short. Made for a child. Works better as a bracelet if you wrap it around your wrist twice. SUCK!
1.0,Looked cheaply made
1.0,Ordered an XL and the size of the shirts sent to me were more like a small
1.0,Came broken my Granddaughter is heart broken and I’m angry. Cheap plastic! No wonder they are now out of stock. Save money. Do not buy! Should be minus star not must pick one
1.0,Too small per siae- very disappointed - bought for an event
1.0,Cheaply made. Fits just as expected but bent over to put heels on and thread snapped right at my behind. Turns out the seam runs along the backside and the two sides of fabric are seen together with one seam line. Truly a design flaw. I’d seam was on side and not the back it would be a better dress. I wear an 8/medium in all dresses and I ordered this 8/medium and it was perfect. Just cheaply made.
1.0,Runs EXTREMELY small! Bad Quality! and you cant return!
1.0,Promised they would fit and they did not. Do not believe them when they say it is a direct fit.
1.0,I bought this for my teenager. The images look small online. However when it arrived it had demons on it.  I returns the top and shorts!
1.0,This ring says it’s sterling silver yet it still turns my finger green when I wear it. I wore it for a week and haven’t worn it sense. Waste of my money. Highly disappointed!
1.0,I liked it but it was too small and send it back
1.0,This is not a good earring to put in your ear!  It's made out of plastic!
1.0,After wearing it a couple days.. the &#34;gold&#34; started flaking off. Waste of money since I don't wear them anymore. Really wanted to like them!
1.0,Toddlers or babies these shoes slippers even in a small would fit a grown adult will be sending them back
1.0,The item received looked nothing like the picture. Awkward fit and material was not soft- rather rough and itchy.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:b4a149b757d571a2730b8a5358a148d1]] Terrible Product and very deceptive Advertising!!
1.0,"I've worn silicon rings before with no issue but this brand caused blistering on my finger.<br /><br />The upside is that people still know I'm married because the blistering forms a perfect ring around my finger. Would not recommend. In fact, would recommend anything else.<br /><br />Addition on 28 Jul 17: Finger is still not completely healed and may be scarring over. See second picture."
1.0,"My daughter didn’t even get to WEAR this yet to do an accurate size review. The skirt seeks to be fine, runs large though. I ordered the 4/5 and it’s much closer to a size 5. Definitely wouldn’t recommend given the condition of the shirt."
1.0,Awful new design. I loved my old ones with the stretchy straps. These ones have plain cotton straps with wide set and TINY armholes. Super uncomfortable and fall off your shoulders all day long. Never again.
1.0,"I bought an XS size and it's huge, looks like XL"
1.0,"Tiny, not at all as described. Returned"
1.0,Uh NO
1.0,"These glasses made absolutely no difference. Same amount of glare, etc. with and without them. I wasted money by buying them. The case is nice."
1.0,"they broke as soon as i used them , threw them away"
1.0,I don't know what material this pans was made but I can assured you it wasn't cottons I'm not and expert but I think I know plaste when I see one. This pan should be called the MC Hammer pans. They should be charge for false advertisements.
1.0,We received incorrect bathing suit. It wasn't at all what you see in the picture. Maybe it was just an error. We sent it back. It was totally different and very small.
1.0,The material is thin the item is to short to tuck into pants
1.0,"Looked like a tent on me, not flattering at all!"
1.0,Small and cheap.
1.0,"I am a 38 B.  I ordered a D,  after reading the reviews.  I needed it for a wedding (backless dress).  If I would have coughed that bra would have snapped and I would've been hanging boobies EVERYWHERE!  It's very very very cheaply made and runs extremely small!"
1.0,"The hat was a lot smaller than I expected, while it looks like a shaped Stetson in the picture, it is really a shaped Panama with a short brim.  The picture is a little be deceiving.  The 'one size' is an elastic band on the inside, which I should have expected as 'one size' hat.  This is a great concept for a hat, but cheaply executed."
1.0,Ordered XL and normally I'm a M/L and fit me. The pant looks great but the suspenders are plastic and very cheap quality.<br />Not woven like in the pic and material state denim and cotton. So I naturally expected cotton suspenders.<br />Will be returning these.
1.0,Came with a faulty battery.  Returned for refund.
1.0,Lowest quality I have ever seen
1.0,I’ve bought 3 pair and all of them have broken in a little over a month or less. Cute but horrible quality.
1.0,I bought the largest size to have it lose. It was like an extra small bottom and an xxxxl top. The sizes didn't match up
1.0,"Poor quality, ill fitting"
1.0,these were way too small and useless. i will return them
1.0,Bought this shirt- print was backwards.<br />Bought this shirt a second time-print was backwards.<br />Won't be giving it a third try.
1.0,I didn’t like that it was to small and that the fur was not real and it was to be used as a winter coat
1.0,"Don’t waste your money. They don’t look anything like the photos, they’re completely see through, cheap fabric and came almost a month late. Plus you can’t even return them!"
1.0,I am going to try to return. Kept slipping up over boobs every few minutes when just walking. Very soft material. I really wanted bra to work
1.0,Gem fell out after one day. Waste of money.
1.0,Misleading brand name &#34;Vaunt Extreme&#34;. Better than Oakley Doakley's
1.0,Too bad
1.0,Horrible dress and I’m not even talking about the falling glitter. I was told about the glitter before purchase so that was ok
1.0,"Super thin, doesn’t have an adjustable waist, poor quality."
1.0,"Had my feet hurting so bad, they ran small and were so high arched my feet were extremely pained during a wedding I had to sit the majority out.. As if I was on my toe tips.. Calves will burn and cramp the angle is way too straight up versus slight slant.. Made for small thin high arched feet only. If you can take being on your toes."
1.0,The blue dress has bright pink flowers on it. Not as pictured.
1.0,I ordered a L/XL in Black I received Navy Blue and they are no where near true to size I would expect a pant in this style to be very loose and they are not very tight fitting also very thin material
1.0,This item is Bad Quality!! Do not buy! The zipper is such poor Quality! It is just awful!
1.0,Wheeewwww I sized up and this bad boy was NOT about to fit my boobies in it. Like not even about to happen. One swift breeze and a nipple would pop out.
1.0,It smelled like smoke.Even after washing.2x
1.0,They keep coming off. There is no elastic at the top
1.0,Extremely thin material! I bought a size 8/10 and it fit like at 5/6!
1.0,"Bad seams. Bad QC. L interior chest wall seam is scratching me. I took the shirt off twice to see if I was being bitten by a bug. No bug, bad seams."
1.0,"Dress was beautiful but the traps were too tight on the shoulders and the leg opening was not made correctly. The return was horrible as if they didn't want to return my $. I had to pay for return when it says free returns SMH They tried to say they hadn't received it yet, 7 days after they did. I had a tracking # and verified they did."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY if you’re looking for a mask to use against covid.  This is one layer of fabric only, with no pocket for a filter or insert.  These are for decoration only, they are not useful for the pandemic in any way, other than to look pretty.  Very disappointed m, waste of money"
1.0,WAAAAAAAAAAY to small!! Looked super cute but way smaller fit than I ordered.
1.0,Cheaper than cheap!  Very poor quality.  Don't waste your money on this!
1.0,"Seeing as this is a TIME PIECE, you'd expect it to TELL TIME properly. I would have to reset it multiple times a day because it would always be falling behind the real time. Also, I can hear the second hand ticking away, even if it wasn't dead silent and there were normal day to day sounds happening around me. At night, I would have to hide my watch in a drawer when I took it off so I wouldn't hear it tick and my desk drawer was about 5 feet away from my bed. Ridiculous."
1.0,"I didn't have the highest of expectations, but figured they would suffice for providing a layer of leather (and grip) for my wife's hands and cold steering steering wheel first thing in the morning here in Michigan.  Unfortunately the gloves started coming apart on the first use and now after five days are just wasted.  My first thought was no biggie, put a couple stitches along the seam and back in business - NO CHANCE - it's ridiculous how the &#34;leather&#34; is deteriorating.  They literally have been worn for a few hours total and there's no way to repair them.  The seams between thumb and palm on both hands are open and the leather is shredding.  These are complete junk and a waste of money."
1.0,"They were bent and wouldn't close, a glass stone went missing the first day they were worn."
1.0,Very poor quality - sent it back.
1.0,Extra large is like small or medium.
1.0,I’m not happy
1.0,Broke the first day I had it. Does not look well made.
1.0,Very disappointed. Cheaply made.  Back zipper was crooked. Looked like a &#34;second&#34;. Handle and embellishments show silver in picture but were actually gold and made the purse look cheap. I returned it. Excellent service with the return.
1.0,No slip? Slip!
1.0,"Got this watch for nursing school and the watch is too big for smaller wrists. Also, the 'ticking' sound is extremely loud."
1.0,"Size chart given is pathetic. ordered a small (waist 29), it is big enough to fit a 40 in waist."
1.0,These look and fit like Oakley lenses but they certainly don't perform the same.  The coating on the outside of the lens started coming off after only a few months and now my vision is so distorted through them they're practically useless.
1.0,"This is a cute dress, but I'm disappointed that the maple leaf was upside down and instead of being positioned closer to my chest, it was below my belly button."
1.0,"The jacket is perfect. Just make sure you go sizes up. Sleeves definitely runs small. You will love the jacket but returning this product is a total hassle. (For me it was) I only gave one star not because of jacket but because of service. I ended up paying more trying to return, plus more deducted from my refund, and it seem they didn’t care at ALL."
1.0,It felt cheaper than jeggins.
1.0,"I bought this before the bad reviews were submitted. They are 100% accurate. The sweater recieved is nothing like advertised. Crappy quality, different length arms, even a different color!! Do not buy!! :("
1.0,The stone doesn’t match the product description or the certificate that came with it. The dye came off easily and revealed a regular piece of Quartz.
1.0,Two right shoes showed up not a left and a right. slightly different colors. both in different languages. very disappointed
1.0,"the wais its too small and the legs its too loose fit , very disapointed"
1.0,"The legs are very wide- not bell bottoms, just weirdly wide. I would have exchanged for a smaller size but the waist would have been uncomfortable. The thick fabric felt awkward. Not for me."
1.0,I thought these were very cute and fit well. I did not wear them in the shower or longer than 8 hours. They have stained my ears GREEN. And it won't come off.
1.0,They look cut up and torn.....
1.0,One lens fell out during the first night of use. Cheaply made equal to Dollar Store products.
1.0,I would give these negative stars if I could. Please do not waste your money if you desire cotton camis. These are absolutely not cotton. I buy items to tie dye and these were advertised as 95% cotton. They held absolutely zero dye. Even items that are 60% cotton hold dye well. These are falsely advertised as cotton and very cheaply made spandex.
1.0,Only very minimal help with night driving
1.0,This top shows as a long top but it comes only to your waist. Have been waiting for replacement top as promised.
1.0,Trash quality
1.0,Turned my wrest green in 1 week
1.0,I purchase the Heel Cheaters for the sole purpose of putting on my low quarter shoes for Honor Guard purposes however only one arrived in the package. They are supposed to be sold in pairs.
1.0,"It affects the color of my hat! After using this stiffener, I saw a lot of grey spots on the brim. My hat is dark brown and the stiffener left those grey spots on the areas where I sprayed... Now my hat looks super ugly!"
1.0,This ring is pretty however it will start to turn to a copper color and leave your finger stained green.
1.0,Not fit for fénix 5 too narow
1.0,"I'm surprised this dress gets such good reviews, the fabric is thick and stitching good but the design is atrocious. I ordered a medium, which fit but hangs like a sack of potatoes. If I wanted a costume to play Hester Prynne from the scarlet A... This dress would be perfect."
1.0,Keep Your Coins. I’ve bought several of these type dresses on Amazon and this is the only one that looked like and fit like it was cheap
1.0,Too small almost invisible
1.0,It doesn't I don't like it
1.0,The fabric is tough and it’s short. I’m already short myself but if you was to bend to pick up anything it’s over. Would have returned but it’s already here may use it for a cosplay
1.0,Does not fit if you head size is small.
1.0,Not as big as I thought.Also the chain and clasp it on it is very small  and very difficult to hook the bracelet together.
1.0,"Horrible Stitching,very thin"
1.0,Not what I expected. They’re to big and they fall to easily from your face
1.0,Not what I was expecting. They are a loose short not tight at all.  Was expecting more like a bike short.
1.0,My husband bought me this purse because it was the style I liked. I got it last May and used it during the summer. The latch started getting loose and the purse flap would be open. I put it away for the fall but when I took it out to use again I forgot the latch was loose. I thought I could tighten it but it broke. There is no way to fix it.
1.0,Split Overnight ? Im Guessing CHEAP .. or It Killed Of The Negativity Regardless It Snapped Supposed To Be Durable .. Can’t Even Get A Refund Who Wants To Wait DAYS FOR IT TO BE SHIPPED BACK !
1.0,This product is much shorter than pictured and the seams between each color are very poorly done. I was so excited about this shirt all to be highly disappointed as soon as I took it out of the package.
1.0,I read that these fit an eleven year old boy...not mine.  They were huge and cost as much to return as the item.<br />Complete fail.
1.0,"It is 100 % fake product.<br />Very low-grade stitching and very cheap fabrics.<br />This is not SHEARLING LEATHER , they put totally fake description.<br />I hope amazon will remove this product."
1.0,Upper part of sweatshirt was good but tight around waist
1.0,Not impressed at all. Very cheaply made.
1.0,Within a week impression started to form on foot foam pad.  Now they slouch to the side with permanent impression.
1.0,Very cheaply made. Was already bent before wearing.  Charney falls off chain. Not worth the money.
1.0,"It wasn’t cotton, it was polyester and when you talked it or breathe it would go in and out by your mouth"
1.0,These yoga pants are not for a  regular person only for a petite person this is why I  hate to shop on line for clothes never again.Just received it today.
1.0,This is cheap and fell apart the very first day. Don't buy!
1.0,"I thought these were Asian sizing so I sized up.  There's no need to.  I liked the color and fabric, but the elastic waist band was just not current.  It dated the pants to me.  Fortunately I was able to return them."
1.0,Came without instructions for starters. Set the time and date...4 hours later it lost 30 minutes time!
1.0,"Not as expected, arrived damaged."
1.0,This item runs to small
1.0,"No acceptable quality, never use"
1.0,Crazy small.  Equivalent of US 8
1.0,The fabric is 100% polyester.  It is very sheer and does not seem to screen the skin from sun at all.  The tag inside the shirt shows that it should not be dried in a drier.  It wrinkles horribly if hung up to dry and really has to be ironed.
1.0,The only thing good about this is the quality. The item I received was a mans size and it has brite orange stitching. It was missing the cord for the hood. It was a completely different pattern than what was advertised...
1.0,Major waste of money. Product not as described. Cheap and rough fabric. Returned and still waiting for my refund as we speak. DO NOT BUY!!!!
1.0,This product does not fit an iPhone 7!
1.0,Awful product. The balls do not stay on whatsoever. Would not recommend these at all.
1.0,Size sucked. Looked unflattering. Please dont buy this thinking it'll look great. It doesnt. Never again.
1.0,Order 3 sizes up.
1.0,I opened the box and noticed that the coating is chipped off.  I am returning this without using it.
1.0,Very disappointed. This costume looked like it was returned and resold to me. It was so smashed into its bag the wrinkles would never come out. Then when I tried to blow it up with the motor. It would not fill with air. That's when I found a big tear in the material.  A real let down.
1.0,"Returned product, they were not individually wrapped as stated in the description"
1.0,Arrives BROKEN and I need it ASAP
1.0,Dress was very cute and fit well but the stars on the dress fell off everywhere. Style and look is great but for that reason alone I would not recommend ordering it
1.0,Way too hard to read . Useless after dark ..
1.0,"EDITED REVIEW!! > Dec. 30th, 2020!!<br /><br />On the 23rd I put one of these hoop in my recently new nose piercing which I was nervous to do! 2 days later I got an irritation bump on my nose! Wouldn’t go down.. then on the 29th I went to HOT TOPIC and got a REAL surgical steel hoop and my bump went down. So my original review and fear about this jewelry was CORRECT! Don’t buy if you have sensitive skin!!<br /><br />This is exactly how they come.. in baggies lol but also no where on the packaging does it say Surgical Stainless Steel! So it makes me very nervous to even try putting one in my nose yet because my skin is sensitive and I wouldn’t want to risk irritation or infection."
1.0,Ordered a 3xl - its probably a medium. And now I'm stuck with it since the Amazon returns only uses UPS instead of USPS.
1.0,El color esta feo es un dorado amarillento y se quebran con mucha facilidad.
1.0,"Took it out of the bag, tried to zip the bag closed and the zipper did not work.  Easily returned for my money (thanks Amazon).  I would not purchase this product again."
1.0,This item was a gift and tarnished weeks after the person wore it. It looked disgusting on their Pandora bracelet so they threw it way. I'm sure you can imagine my embarrassment. I would like to be refunded the cost of the item. I do not want the item replaced for fear the same thing will happen. Very disappointed I will never buy from you again. Very cheaply made.
1.0,Nunca los recibí. No me llegaron los pondrían en diferente buson. No lo sé x que  no  los mire 😔
1.0,Simply to small for a man
1.0,Was bigger than expected & very heavy

1.0,Color certainly off light purple with cream... i ordered a small i recieved a large very disapointed...
1.0,"Item fit well, but arrived damaged with oil-like stains across the thigh/backside."
1.0,"Poor cheap quality, garbage!"
1.0,The buckle will not snap correctly and falls of leather
1.0,"Ordered this product only to receive half of it! The hood portion did not come with the neck sleeve.  Is there some funky N.A.S.A way I need to put this on? It's literally a tube open at both ends with an opening for your eyes. All the heat escapes from the open hole on top. There is a draw string to tighten one end but it doesn't feed threw the hood to tighten the hood because i didnt recieve a hood. The top pic shown off to the side is all u get, the main picture shown is not what I recieved! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!!"
1.0,This band was an issue to remove links..im very disappointed. I love the color but some links won t come off due to the needles or screws that's keeping them linked wont come out! There just stuck and I even used my teeth to try and chipped my tooth. My own fault but I did use THREE of those tools to remove links and they wouldn't budge. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Got this for leather gloves.  Spraying across top where knuckles would be as well as in palm where thumb meets palm made no difference whatsoever.  Additionally, it's NOT returnable and trying to contact the seller is a joke because they don't respond.  My title says it all.....DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1.0,Every bit as bad as reviews stated! Huge Clown pants with no front or back! Snug around boobs and darts above boob line. Sloppy hem. Lining doesn’t match up with outside. What a mess!!! Omg what was I thinking?!!!!! How do I get a refund?!
1.0,This can be worn around the house very poor construction nothing about it is flatting.
1.0,dont buy this misshapen moomoo wannabe dress! waste your money somewhere else!
1.0,They are not real. They turned my ears blue
1.0,Would like to return for refund
1.0,Not as described at all. Difficult to lace the string. Complete waste of money
1.0,The bag was cute but the shoulder strap was broken.
1.0,very poor quality - the material is very thin and see through
1.0,Very disappointed in this replacement band.  It DOES NOT FIT my Garmon Forerunner 35.  There is a plastic piece with a bar in the middle preventing it from attaching in to the white extension coming out of the watch.  Worthless!  Do NOT fall for this like I did.
1.0,TOO SHORT
1.0,washed it one time and it never worked again
1.0,"I am so sad. They look great in the photo and were exactly what I wanted, but the material is really low quality and they stretch out while wearing them. I’ve washed them once and I’m afraid to see what is going to happen the next time. Way too expensive for the low quality, in my opinion. Boo hoo."
1.0,very disappointing if I could give a lower score than 1 I would...not at all what is advertized
1.0,This suit is adorable but the wrong size was shipped.. too small! :( Looking forward to receiving the correct size.. :)
1.0,this picture is not what you get.<br />Its a half top
1.0,Cheap and bent up when they arrived. When they say fish hook earrings I think they are real fish hooks. Not comfortable to wear and very thin and flimsy.
1.0,The one I received has no color changing effect.
1.0,The pendant is much smaller than I expected and when I opened the clasp to put the necklace on the clasp broke.
1.0,These were so stiff and small that I never got them on.  There is no give on stretch to put them on.  I never got them on so one star is my score.
1.0,The shirt arrived and it is some slippery polyester fabrication.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Too small and took forever to arrive!
1.0,Too small. Cheep material
1.0,"I was very excited to receive this outfit. But when it arrived I was very disappointed.  It runs large for the size and it's very thin and cheap.  Good for one time of use, but don't wash it will fall apart"
1.0,***Too small and see through material.***
1.0,I purchased the black one and received blue
1.0,"Cheap material, too small.  Ordered a XL...maybe if your a junior, Hated this Top.  Returned it..."
1.0,It looks nothing like the picture way different
1.0,This product was not what I expected-----some of the gloves are torn right from the carton. I will not buy again.
1.0,This fabric wrinkles like crazy. I could not get the wrinkles out. It also shrunk and I hung it up to dry.
1.0,Not sure it’s actually 18k as it advertises. Color is off
1.0,The band was itchy and they were not flattering in the crotch area
1.0,Got the right size and it still fits too small... Also looks NOTHING like the picture. The straps just look cheap
1.0,This looks nice in the pics but it is SUPER THIN!
1.0,"Ring fits, however it came tarnished."
1.0,"Very thin, no tag on wether is backwards or not. and I can't even wear it because I'm afraid it'll rip for how thin it is!"
1.0,Very bad quality. Wore for leads than 2 weeks and some developed a crack from nose bridge horizontally at the bottom. Just trashed them.
1.0,this is not a real leather jacket there are some sections of the jacket made of leather but most of it is fake leather.
1.0,This product came with flaky pearls. They were already peeling. It looks used and worn. Seriously dissatisfied. For the price I expected better.
1.0,"Another failed clothing item purchased online😏 horribly made and finished. Very cheap fabric and buttons . Hangin threads and an illfit. The upside, I've learned my lesson! I'll only be ordering clothing from KNOWN sellers...such as VS, GUESS, NIKE Levi and so on."
1.0,I ordered a size 7 and the quality was inferior.
1.0,"This was suppose to be a Medium but as you can see it’s more of an XS or S. It barely covered my chest. The shirt stretches fine it’s just way too short, which you can see in the picture I laid it next to a size Medium shirt. For reference I am a 34DDD and use Medium."
1.0,The plastic flower top stripped when I screwed it onto the metal bar so I can’t wear it now.
1.0,Looks nothing like pictures. Completely unwearable.
1.0,Zipper broke the 1st time we tried to use it. The first day of school tomorrow. No time to get another.
1.0,Not soft at all. Very very small!
1.0,So I made the boots above with some leg warmers from my local beauty supply but This was the only color so I decided to purchase these and they are Pure garbage don’t look nothing like the picture they’re tacky don’t waste your time or money
1.0,Can’t stand how pointy the hat is! Makes no sense to why they made it so pointy.
1.0,"not long enough wire. Awkward. Could have been fun, but needs more length for function."
1.0,To small for a man
1.0,Very cheaply made already messed up.  End came fraying and very cheap and hard to use.
1.0,They came broken in 3 places 😡
1.0,This is made with an extremely flimsy cord which broke as I was putting it around my neck.
1.0,Not at all what was in the photo. Plus the shirt was literally a size that my 5 year old could fit in.
1.0,"Horrible, cheap garbage! Oh yeah, there are three, so this is a great deal, right? No, just a waste of my time, as I immediately packaged them back in the envelope and had to make the trip to the UPS Store to return them!  The metal rings which are supposed to hold the elastic loops in place tightly, were so loose that they fell right off. Buy one of these instead...https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N11SXUD/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1"
1.0,I'm generally a large.  I don't wear anything that is bigger than a large.  So I ordered large.  I couldn't even get these zipped.
1.0,Worst necklace ever!! Yes it's cheap but I've brought other cheap necklace from Amazon but this was the only one to turn in color the 2nd day!!!! Of me wearing it!! And the saddest part is that on the second day I put it on and it was gold. I just so happen to look in the mirror at work and the damn thing was brown! So when did it even change. I was so embrassed and just so pissed. So honestly save yourself the trouble and buy the more expensive bar necklace or just never buy a cheap one from here! oh and to top it all off the necklace broke out my neck something no cheap jewelry has done before.
1.0,"Not a good fit at all, shapeless."
1.0,I had to return it and you would not be happy at all to have this product in your hand
1.0,"Way too small for advertised size (almost a crop-top and very tight). “X” design on V-neck is uneven and V is too shallow. If you have breasts greater than A cup, do not purchase."
1.0,Cheap thin
1.0,Was not what I expected for $125.00 dollars found it on another sight for $40.00 dollars
1.0,Wont last more than month
1.0,Not very good. Broke 1st day.
1.0,"I really hate giving a bad review, I realize everyone's experience can be different, so that said. ....... these capris are super cute,but when I opened them the zipper was already broken, then they failed to leave a hole for the button to go through to close them,I cut my own slit for button to go through! The overall craftsmanship is pretty poor, there's a ton I'd have to have done to them to be able to wear them even with that it's doubtful , and just not worth the money to go that route. I'd use extreme caution before purchasing these !!!"
1.0,These are beyond terrible. They are literally tubes of fabric sewn together at one end and a cute design on them. Socks are supposed to have a heal and contour to your feet. Waste of money.
1.0,"I finally gave up on this watchband.  The strap is much too long, and it was very difficult to put on.  I was also disappointed that within a couple times of wearing, one side of the metal mesh started to fray.  Really, the only good thing I could say was that the gold color was right."
1.0,Way overpriced for the quality  !! I thought i was getting more than one pair for the price...Will not buy again!
1.0,Doesnt really hold u in...returned!
1.0,That doesn't look like the picture at all. It is really stiff and hideous. Do not buy
1.0,"I had to just erase and write a whole new review. I initially gave them 5 stars because I loved the first pair I was sent, the second and third pair not so much. I figured out that the first pair must of been the color called velvet black even though I did not order that color, those pants are awesome,  they fit me perfectly and look nice. Next pair was this weird material that has a bit of a shine , they were at least an inch and a half too long. So I ordered a third pair hoping to get the first pair like the first pair but nope they are the crappy ones. The crappy ones also have tiny elastic treads poking out in the bottom and thigh seams already, and I haven't even washed them yet, this is after one wear. I tried to order the velvet color ones to see if that maybe what hey sent first , but the wait for them is over a month and who knows what I will even get by then. Don't waste your time, much better stretch pants out there."
1.0,I returned it because it was too small
1.0,"I know you get what you get when you order online, but this sucked.<br />The material is cheap, see-through, and just bad.<br /><br />It's a bummer!"
1.0,Another product that is extremely cheaply made and not worth the price.
1.0,"These are very bizarrely cut sizes.  They are super wide and very long.  I love layettes, but these don't fit well.  I wound up having to roll the sleeves twice, the neck is okay but the layette opening is bizarrely large.  This means it rolls up easily around baby and doesn't stay on their legs.  It winds up around my kid's stomach."
1.0,"They look great.  My foot went in fine but the sole is FLAT - without any arch support whatsoever.  For the price and the hype - which is complete BS, I'm returning them.  Not only am I disappointed but put off with the erroneous crap about the supposed great arch support.  It is  utter nonsense.  My arch didn't come close to meeting with the sole of the shoe."
1.0,Cheap plastic and already broken when delivered.
1.0,"It was such a beautiful product but it didn’t last me longer than two weeks. The first day, one of the strap keepers broke off. I was ok with it because the straps came with two. But within two weeks, the band buckle broke off, leaving me only the stick part to put through the holes, but it wasn’t enough to secure my watch on without risking it entirely. It is very beautiful but not sturdy enough.  Keep in Mind I only work 3 days a week and the other days I lay around the house. I only work at a grocery store, I ring up food and stack bananas.... it still didn’t hold up! 😑"
1.0,"Shirt was too small and didn’t fit right way too tight .  I wanted to return it, but you have to pay the shipping.  Really disappointed!"
1.0,Color not as nice as picture. Very heavy
1.0,I got this because I saw a FB rave about it. Maybe my standards are higher but good grief this thing had the worst material ever. No doubt that it would go into flames if near a candle. I’m 5’6” and it just barely covered my butt. Not worth the lightning deal.
1.0,Not what I expected. Too small it's more fitting for a 10 year old.
1.0,"I really liked the description of this watch, but the attachment for the band was broken when it arrived, so can't comment on how it would have been otherwise.  returned and didn't get replacement figuring it must not be so very sturdy"
1.0,Fabric is terrible. Design is printed on the shirt instead of the embroidered design shown in the picture. Not at all what I expected.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:37644071624d841eae6781bb96fe9539]] These necklaces and bracelets are fake. The Advertisement is false it's not 925 Italy made is not Sterling silver.
1.0,foot larger than another side
1.0,This mask was a waste of money. The lights worked for 3 minutes and it broke.
1.0,"I couldn't use it, the material looks cheap and the adaptors doesn't work."
1.0,Cute at first sight but after the 1st wash material starts to fall apart an colors fade. Not durable an won’t last after a few wears.
1.0,Smaller than normal sizing.  Unstretchable
1.0,Shirt is more of a sweatshirt and it was soooo small. More of a kids size than a regular size. Sent it back
1.0,"So disappointed! First, these are huge. I’ve NEVER posted photos until now, and they don’t do justice. I’m a little girl with tiny elf like ears and these literal take up my lower lobe. Second- these are NOT what I ordered! The last photo of the pair are what I thought I was getting & as anyone can see they look nothing like what I got. Seeing as how I was going to order another pair soon I can say I won’t be ordering from this company! These were NOT worth my $13.00."
1.0,"This watch only lasted for about six weeks. It's listed as water resistant to 5 ATM, but with only light splashing, the face is cloudy with water, and some of the LCD segments are broken."
1.0,"Ordered a larger size, still way too small!"
1.0,not worth it -
1.0,The robe looked used and the size a was completely wrong. I am returning it the quality was poor
1.0,"Cute, but broke before I could even put it on.. Very cheaply made."
1.0,"I bought it in a size larger after reading the reviews but when I got them they were way too big, both the top and the bottom. I think if I would have ordered my normal size it would have been fine."
1.0,"Not a wrap at all! Not even fabric to tie around! And elastic in the back, like a babydoll dress.... very disappointed!"
1.0,It’s the typical “Asian made” clothing. Way too small and not made for USA scaling sizes. Cheaply sown. Kept it for a last minute wear.
1.0,Ordered one size bigger and still too small. Returned it.
1.0,Stitching unraveled when I was putting it on my daughter...Not good at all...😔😔😔
1.0,This is the worst piece of clothing I’ve ever received. It’s see through and it’s cheaply made. Hate hate hate so much. The straps are not adjustable and you can see the stitching. Ugh.
1.0,I’d recommend ordering 3 sizes up to get the correct size
1.0,Could not wear too small
1.0,Wasn't what I expected at all.
1.0,I ordered a small and the pants were too big for me
1.0,this product  is  broken  no  good
1.0,"Sadly, the material is very low-quality. Not worth anything north of $10. I overpaid for a poorly constructed belt and can not recommend this item to anyone. Hope Amazon will remove the product so that people will not get misled like I was."
1.0,I’m 5’8 heavy set and usually wear xl to 2x clothes as you can tell it’s way to long and way to wide. There wasn’t a lag or md of the same color. So I returned it
1.0,I received the package today with ZERO earrings in the box!!!!' I'm so upset! I was so looking forward to seeing my daughter in these.  Is this a joke??? Seriously.....
1.0,Color is also different as show in picture
1.0,"I purchased this belt on January 8, 2019, so I likely received it on or about January 10, 2019. Today, March 25, 2019, the belt buckle snapped off while buckling the belt. I wore this belt for work daily, so about 5 times a week. Over approximately 11.5 weeks, this belt was worn less than 60 times before it broke.<br /><br />Poor quality. Don't waste your money."
1.0,I love the look of these earrings.  I was very disappointed when I took the rose gold colored ones off one broke.
1.0,I ordered my usual size and this is much smaller than expected. I went to a store and bought one I could try on.
1.0,Not proportional at all. These pants were huge on me. The small was more like a large.
1.0,"I ordered this last year and the interior color is different than it used to be. It doesn't match the red in the product image and is more orange as shown in the other review posted with an image. It looks like the ring received is ""POYA 8mm Polished White Ceramic Ring with Anodized Orange Aluminum Sleeve Wedding Engagement Ring""."
1.0,All 3 already fell apart less than 90 days
1.0,No es para nada igual a la imagen
1.0,Band of poor quality.
1.0,One earring had a broken clasp
1.0,Poor fit and cheap looking. Sent back
1.0,"Poorest 'product' on Amazon.  Cheap fluffy paper, not felt. No structure. No nothing. Worth 20c."
1.0,"Thin, boxy, and the neckline is narrow while the shirt itself is really wide. Returned."
1.0,Is not heavy duty at all . A waste of money
1.0,The necklace looks like an arts & crafts project done my child. Cheaply made and looks nothing like the example! And the chain was too long and faded! Do not waste your money!
1.0,"If you buy an oversized fruit of the loom shirts, this is what they come out as. You just need to shorten the hem."
1.0,Very large and YouTube can not keep it in the ear by large.. Ugly.! 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
1.0,The football pants came with NO knee pads.  Unacceptable!  What's the point of buying football pants with only half of the pads for protection.
1.0,This coverup is much larger than expected. I wish they made this in different sizes or at least showed the actual size on the model in the picture. There is no way the model is wearing the &#34;one size fits all&#34;.
1.0,"The product broke only a week after buying it, it was well made and my boyfriend loved it right up until it broke off the chain"
1.0,"To small, tight, rolls up, very thin, not happy with these. Very cheaply made."
1.0,"You have to have your cell phone no more than 30 feet away and if there are walls between that and your necklace, it is even shorter.  So if I ever forget my cellphone as I am going to another room and I fall, it won't work"
1.0,Not allowed to give full and accurate review
1.0,"It is a very cheap, ugly, waste of $50 I have ever spent. The label came upside down, and the quality is terrible. Not to mention it took three almost four weeks to ship! Do not believe any other reviews this product is not worth it.[[ASIN:B01EBI8WQU Anello Official Black Japan Fashion Shoulder Rucksack Backpack Casual School Tablet Diaper Bag]]"
1.0,"You get what you pay for! Looks good, but I ordered it in March, wrote a complaint to the company, but I also experienced some language issues, since it was sent from China. To make a long story short, I was given a menial refund on the item, it I would retract my negative comment. The wallet began to slowly come apart, stitching is unraveling and I just ordered a new wallet, its August! If you want a wallet that is good for about a month or two, I recommend this one. I am hopefully going to order one that lasts for a good long time!<br /><br />no GAG"
1.0,Terrible quality and fit. I am 5'8&#34; and bigger boned so I ordered an XL yet it was very tight and made my chest look flatter than it is. So Great for flat chested ladies who want to look more flat chested.
1.0,Fix as expected but it swrink a lot at the first wash and dry☹️
1.0,I am very disappointed with this product because the nose piece fell apart as soon as I made adjustments for proper fit. I loved the style and the details are gorgeous but they need to improve the quality of craftsmanship.
1.0,The jewelry does not stay locked into the pipe. Had this earing about 2 months and the piece has come out 3-4 times. I have been lucky enough to find it each time it's been lost but not this time. It's to bad. I really wanted to like this and get more. I purchased this one specifically because of the description stating it would lock in differently and not keep falling out.
1.0,"Not comfortable at all, caused skin irritation"
1.0,Not at all what I expected. It's 2 pieces of metal with a big rubber band.  Hard to get cards out and even harder to get your money. Not worth it👎
1.0,The top was a peculiar fit and not at all comfortable to wear.  The cups were strange
1.0,Almost like wearing pantyhose. Too thin. Shows all bulges even being a decent size.
1.0,I’m pretty disappointed these split within the first week of me wearing them. They are very comfortable however in just a few days of wearing them the side has split and they'll most likely be trash soon.
1.0,Did not even receive the correct item
1.0,Inside pocket ripped out on the bottom during first trip. Other than that it's set up nice and would work great.
1.0,"Ring is not sterling silver, it cheap costume jewelry"
1.0,Didn’t get to use !!
1.0,Sizing is incorrect - I ordered a Medium (wear size 4) and this dress is extremely short - I am 5'4&#34; and it barely covers my rear - I would suggest ordering 2 sizes larger than you normally wear.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:82f770d8aac177e5b110092c92bf9571]] Very deceptive! These are tiny beads the picture makes it look like they are bigger . Unless you need small un drilled beads don’t waste your money
1.0,The molding material melted everywhere and the caps didn’t fit my teeth or stay molded
1.0,"Terrible, very cheap, I returned it"
1.0,"Color not as pictured. Tried to return but postage was more than the cost of the item plus shipping. Ridiculous, since this whole scarf probably weighs less than 8 oz."
1.0,"They fall out very easily. If you plan to keep in to protect your port, don't bother. The metal for the sim is also slightly larger than it should be and doesn't go in easily on s20 fe"
1.0,Earrings were the size for an infant not an adult. Very disappointed.
1.0,Returned it because I basically had to BUILD the watch!
1.0,"Not at all what I expected. This was supposed to be a gift and the color of the shirt as well as the ""M"" logo is not at all like the colors showed on the picture. This looks like a worn down shirt. Extremely dissapointed."
1.0,I ordered two sizes up. Way too small and poorly made. Cheap material. Sadly disappointed.
1.0,"I wear a 3x in womens and went 2 sizes up as suggested because of reviews. When I received it today to try it on, I noticed that it was inside out like someone had tried it on and didn't think much of it until I saw this nasty stain. They sent me something that was ""used"" and tried to pass it off as ""new"" expecting me to pay for their problem. Anyway I went ahead and tried it on to see if it would even fit in the first place and it was WAY too small and I even checked the measurements before I received the item. It is misrepresented in size by a long shot. My husband is even way smaller than I am and he could not even put his arms in the sleeves. I have 2x shirts that I can fit my arms in and this outfit would not even fit. I am disappointed and tired of these Chinese products and they should have American standards! Never again!"
1.0,"Did not fit good at all, very uncomfortable"
1.0,Zipper broke off the hood in less than a week.  Will be returning
1.0,I am updating my review<br />Broke after few times use<br />Not happy at all
1.0,Cheap material not at all what I was looking for.
1.0,"This set looks good only on the picture, its made very cheaply and it broke when i was taking it out of the plastic bag it came in. It's not worth the money"
1.0,Product description showed as sweatshirt but is t-shirt material. The lettering is very poor quality.
1.0,This outfit material is a terrible non Jean material. I broke the zipper trying to zip it up. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.
1.0,This is prob the cheapest shirt ever made. The fabric was virtually see through and fit terrible. It was probably 100% polyester and hideous. Do not buy unless you like cheap fabric.
1.0,"These masks are very scratchy, even after washing. They are not for sensitive skin."
1.0,"Pretty necklace, but was suppose to say mom, I love you not I love you"
1.0,Dislike!!! Don’t waste your time & $$$! Made in Vietnam. Smelly with some kind of solvent smell!!! Can’t launder as normal or dry. Very displeased with this product. I don’t know what I expected but you do get what you pay for on Amazon! I find it difficult to always identify where the products are made on the website! 😔
1.0,The seems were sewn all wrong so the waisted band looked like a lightening bolt. They sent grey went I ordered black. Not a flattering cut at all. And they run HUGE!!!
1.0,"I was able to try these on and walk across my kitchen only. My heel slipped out of the back of it and the shoe was way to long and wide. I ordered a half size up based off of other reviews. I should have ordered a size down, but I'm not sure that would have helped the width."
1.0,Washed my hands the strip connected to the band lifted and peeled off. Pulled the whole patter off looks dumb now
1.0,"I got 2 of these and couldn’t get either to work right.  They simply won’t turn in without fussing with it for 2-3 minutes.  I don’t need that kind of aggravation, so they went back.  It’s a simple button, it should just turn on but it doesn’t..."
1.0,Cute dress but the material was a disappointment. The color (black) looks faded
1.0,Too small for the average person!
1.0,Watch broke before I even put it on
1.0,The L's fell out :/
1.0,Awful. Abnormal measurements from chest to hips
1.0,"This is one of those ""I'd give it zero stars if I could."" On the first wash, the fabric ripped---not at a seam but in the middle of the garment. Definitely not worth the money."
1.0,I don't know because only the top came. It said it was a set!
1.0,It broke the first day I wore it. :( all three broke within the first day i wore them. And they're not tight enough so they completely lose the choker effect... So sad.
1.0,"It lasted 11 days, there is a hole already."
1.0,Terrible quality do not purchase
1.0,It was more like a store bought Halloween costume.
1.0,These bras are made for very small (made in China) women.  I ordered the extra large; still too small.
1.0,Followed the sizing to the letter and way too small.
1.0,I bought the white one and it fits like I expected it to. But..... there is visible scrap red thread stitched in the hem of the v neck. Why? Why would anyone be so careless when sewing a thin all white shirt?  Ugggh😫
1.0,Sizing is not as described
1.0,Not at all like the picture. 😕  It's really too long. Past my hips.
1.0,Did not look the way it looks in the picture. Very disappointed. I returned it.
1.0,It's a nice looking watch. However...it has lost 20 min of time. Watch band has broke. I gave this to some as a gift. I feel very bad that it wasn't what I had hoped for. 4 months isn't very long for all the issues.
1.0,"Clipped it on, seemed secure. Made my bed and the slight friction tucking my sheet in and the watch band rubbing up on the headboard as I tucked the sheet in caused one of the band's to pop out, and it wouldn't stay on after that. Returned. Sad because the color was pretty and the band was comfortable."
1.0,I did not like these pants at all.
1.0,"This fabric ""caught"" on everything.  It's a poor quality that snagged on my rings, watch, even a hang nail."
1.0,Not the correct color. It's straight up gold instead.
1.0,"I was so disappointed about this swimsuit! I looked at the sizing chart in the pictures, measured my chest and hips and ordered accordingly. When I got it the top was way too small and the bust/cups were super small. The cups were pointed out too. I will definitely be returning this."
1.0,"This one actually fits the S2 unlike the first one I ordered that said it did, however; if you are looking for rose gold, rose gold it is not.  I contacted the seller who said &#34;That band is Rose Color level a little low,so make you feel like that is Gold color.&#34; and &#34;Our factory ever did make test ,and ask our customer try ,most of them think this color is beeter (sic)).  I'll look elsewhere..."
1.0,The pearl is so tiny that it immediately fell out of the pendant it looks like crap and also everyone gets cream all my siblings got one too and they are all small and the same color
1.0,They do not stay up at all.
1.0,Material was very thin and looked cheap
1.0,Really cheep looking!! Print look weird and silk screened on. Pass on this one!
1.0,Horrible omg waste of money
1.0,It looked cheap & was super unflattering
1.0,These head bands are extremely big for newborns and the quality is not that great
1.0,Cheap quality. Fabric falling apart .
1.0,Too small and short.
1.0,Didn’t like and was ugly to be honest and not like pictures
1.0,"I was going to a winter wedding and thought this would be the perfect dress. I sized up because it is form fitting and I didn’t want it to be to tight. The dress was so tight, so short, and didn’t cover anything...definitely not wedding appropriate."
1.0,You know those ace bandages that stick to themselves when you wrap them around you? They made an entire shirt out of it.
1.0,I spent $30 on this outfit that looks nothing like the picture. The material was so cheap I literally could rip it with my fingers I can see right through the pants it was like a nylon material. Horrible quality would never order clothes from here  again. I should have read the reviews before ordering and wasting my money. I couldn’t even wear it because it was too embarrassing what a waste
1.0,cute shirt but will never get to wear it
1.0,Terrible dress. Does not even fit correctltb
1.0,"Received damaged item, and parts missing. Wheel lock did not work. Threw it in trash. I was refunded 100%. my advice is to read seller reviews before buying."
1.0,Not happy with the material and the fitting of the dress
1.0,"They were way off on the size. My husband fits comfortably  in a 2XL with room to spare. These are a 3XL and did not fit him.  So, thst was a waste  of money. I have not been able to return  them due to the COVID 19 . He liked the material, but no fit. He would of needed 4/5 XL!! That's  not right.  Sincerely  Valerie Travis"
1.0,The lights burnt out after 2 weeks & my son was only allowed to wear these indoors.
1.0,Do not buy. The dress does not match the description
1.0,Looked much cheaper in person!  Ewww!
1.0,"Very poor quality, not recommended"
1.0,Hat arrived in original packaging<br />with attached USPS Label Only it<br />wasn't secured at all HORRIBLE!!!
1.0,Just bad quality not at all what I was expecting and you’ll need a thin shirt underneath it cause it does not keep anything in just super thin and makes you look like a hot air balloon cause the waist doesn’t go in like in the picture
1.0,Gave my daughter a blister after one day.
1.0,I wore a couple of these and they were fine.  But the grip on one of the pairs immediately started to peel off.  It was messy and sticky and left residue on the yoga mat I was using.  Very disappointed.
1.0,I actually returned these because the material quality was not what I was hoping for. It was very thin and I could tell it was the type to pill up and cling.
1.0,"El pantalón es bonito, la talla es correcta , me quedó adecuadamente.  Pero en la primera puesta,  las costuras se abrieron, la tela se desgarró, muy mala calidad del producto.  No lo volvería a comprar."
1.0,I purchased this about a month ago. I just went to wear it and noticed someone cut out a rectangle in the back of the dress. It looks like someone wanted a sample of the pattern. Dress is worthless with a hole in the back.  I did not notice it when I opened it. It appears I am unable to return this. Disappointed
1.0,The shirt's design was not anywhere close to the size pictured and the shirt size itself was inaccurate. If you want the quality shirts then buy it from the band's merch store!
1.0,"Don't buy.  Piece of junk.  Hoops that hold pieces together are not where they should be, but they are hanging off other parts of the chain.  Almost like weaved in where they shouldn't have been.  Very strange and when I pulled out of package more hoops fell out which was good so that I could fix it myself, though I doubt it will hold up long.  Bought to wear with good outfits, but only nice enough to wear with my halloween costume and I hope it at least holds up for that one night.  Even though it cost very little, not worth it cause it may either be totally unfixable when you get it or last a night."
1.0,Just got this in the mail and couldn't possibly be more disappointed. The quality of the material is the worst of anything I own and even the print looks like it was zoomed in from a early digital camera. Just don't bother with this.
1.0,Is a scam is not whatever they advertise. Is a foam cheap mask not what is on picture. Dont buy it!!!!!!!
1.0,The mask was flimsy around the sides and was too large for a 3 year old even though it is supposed to be for that age. Very cheaply made.
1.0,"The dress arrived with several tiny holes in the bottom rear, as if moths had been chewing on it. Bad quality control practices and super slow shipping. I would not recommend this purchase."
1.0,Not very baggy
1.0,"It's a nice coat, however, the coat is designed for a petite person. My wife typically is a size 6-8 and even the size x-large was too small."
1.0,I was looking for a light weight material but that doesn't mean that it needs to be see through. Already gave the shirt to someone who really liked it...but it wasn't for me.
1.0,was broken when i received it
1.0,"i was shocked when it came, for what it is price should be $15.  Useless, see thru broadcloth of the cheapest kind.  It was returned.  I kept the DXL waffle weave, a much, much better product."
1.0,Materiales de muy baja calidad.
1.0,Too tight especially up top
1.0,It was dull looking and the chain kept wrapping around itself while I was wearing it. UPDATE 04/18/2018 My experience after purchasing and writing this review HAS BEEN A 5 STAR ⭐️ the customer Service was VERY concerned and was willing to refund or try another... I did and I am very satisfied with the product and would recommend shopping with the ease of satisfaction is their concern.
1.0,"I am 5'1&#34; & 180lbs. I'm a big girl but I  carry my weight proportionally throughout my body.  Usually a large fits fine and an xtra large give mw room.  The largest  size they had is a Large . I read the reviews and it seemed  that it would be fine. Since i wanted the thermals to wear underneath  some clothes during cold nights backpacking, i thought it should  be fine. NOPE.  first,  the shirt  looked like a crop top. Then the  bottoms didnt even come up all the way.  Tje material is really cheap and if u stretch it is see through. I thought i would give them to my size 6 cousin (135lbs) and they even fit HER super tight. These are just poorly made and you can tell that the quality sucks. Totally going for a refund"
1.0,On the Amazon description online this is a MENS XXL.<br />On the actual packaging the<br />sticker shows it as Womens XXL -  the packaging is correct and the Amazon online description is INCORRECT.
1.0,I didn’t like the material. It was like my daughter was wearing a trash bag that made noise when she walked.
1.0,Clasps are broken on the collar area and the dress is sized completely incorrectly. I ordered a 3xl figuring it would be nice and loose and flowy with plenty of room to be comfortable in the heat. I can't even em get it past my shoulders and I typically wear a size 8-10.<br />Disappointed in this order. Only buy if you can order up and fit in a small/xsmall
1.0,I didn't need the giant and prominent &#34;Vegan Collection&#34; logo and title written across the side of the wallet that is barely visible in the photo.
1.0,"Did not like fit or material, cheap"
1.0,"Cheap material, not comfortable and the logo is stiff satin."
1.0,"This dress is orange and red, not as shown.  I returned it because of the color."
1.0,Just the size I was looking for but the silver rings was broken and will not stay latched. Craftsmanship is poor. Too much trouble to send back.
1.0,I need my money back. I literally got the piece today and it was super small and I was already contemplating about sending it back . Told myself whatever it’s still cute and writhing and HOUR it fell out of my nose and done the drain when I was washing the dishes! I’m so disappointed literally a waste of MONEY
1.0,"I have not even had these socks for 6 months and they are getting holes in the heels.  they do not support as advertised, do not waste your money on these."
1.0,Runs really small. I could fit into it but my tah tahs are squished. Not stretchy at all and not big tah tah friendly..... will not order another 😒
1.0,tarnish very quickly
1.0,Bought 2 pair of the they both broke in the exact same place poor quality
1.0,"Usually a size medium, I got a size XL and it still was wayyy to small. Do not recommend."
1.0,It was no wereclose to fitting very smsll
1.0,"I do not have a good experience with this purchase have since sent me the wrong number .... I bought size 11.5 and the box says 11.5(29), but the shoe is 23 .... Very small."
1.0,"While nicely made, they don't help with driving at night at all. There's absolutely no difference when driving with or without them! Do NOT buy these unless you like throwing money out the window! If seller wants to refund my purchase price, I can right a positive end to this experience."
1.0,Very cheaply made and the elastic was damaged on arrival
1.0,"Fit<br />Not very slim fit, slight taper, but strangely, mostly below the waist line so it will not show when tucked in.  I am slender and V-shaped, basically like the mannequin, and the shirt does not fit as pictured.  It fits slightly tighter in the chest than pictured, but the rest below the chest is baggy and loose, and a bit short.  The mannequin pictured must have the shirt pulled back and pinned.<br /><br />Comfort<br />Very thin fabric, yet very stiff.  I have sensitive skin, and I can feel the fabric prickling my skin.<br /><br />Style<br />Definitely looks a lot worse in actuality and upon closer inspection it looks like I am wearing polka dots. Very thin fabric makes the white somewhat see-through, which is common in many shirts, but in this case, the fake lapel pocket is made so cheaply, they use a not-so-neatly-cut strip of fabric larger than the black on the front, so basically you see a strange block showing through from behind the fake pocket opening.  The collar is thin and soft, it will not keep shape--no idea how the pictured collar could stay like that--it basically lays flat with deep misshapen wrinkles on the one I received."
1.0,Super cute shoe.. Bought an 11 but I bet it was more like a 9.5. Disappointed they were super cute
1.0,"Item was so old that the leather broke on one part of the bracelet, and one of the rings did as well...it must have been sitting around for years!  sadly it was a gift for my daughters birthday, and we just found out how fragile it was today."
1.0,I loved it but wore it twice and has a huge hole wear the seams are supper bummed 😣
1.0,I don’t feel they are a true compression garment.
1.0,These are kind of stiff and the cups are way too big.
1.0,Says one size fits all way off its way too big.
1.0,"Beautiful, too heavy"
1.0,The shirt was a tight fit. It was a nice looking shirt though!  I ordered a Medium and should have gone L or XL
1.0,"These slippers already fell apart.  I just missed the return window, but I have worn this brand numerous times and this has never happened.  I dont recommend these."
1.0,Extremely uncomfortable!  Waste of money
1.0,"Is this a joke? These look nothing like the picture and they are hideous. They are very long, the front fraying looks cheap and they are not low rise like pictured. They go to my belly button. I ordered a size up because I like them a little looser but as you can see they are very unflattering. And obviously not worth getting a smaller size because they are definitely not what’s pictured. Oh and they make you pay for your own return shipping."
1.0,Too small will not stay on mouth and nose. Don’t waste your money
1.0,I've been shopping with amazon for years.<br /><br />I've never been as disappointed  .<br />I've never seen anything like it.<br />The only that was correct was the number of items. Six<br />They're weren't even two pairs that were the same size.<br />The colors were not what I ordered.<br />No need to say more.
1.0,The chain fell apart after only a few days of use.
1.0,"This looks nothing like what I received. It look like a top nothing like a dress in person, barely covered my back side. Super duper tight."
1.0,It was not silver! It’s gold
1.0,Not worth the price . Stitching coming apart after one week . Don’t waste your money
1.0,I wore the warch very gently and only got it wet while washing my hands. I didn't even take it in for shower. After 2 weeks. 2 WEEKS! The numbers on the screen started looking broken up. I will press om the screen and it would fix itself. But after another week. That method wouldn't work anymore and it was completely broken. I was very disappointed. Japanese craftmanship is saying of old world...
1.0,"The padding is too thick for me, and it makes me feel like wearing a diaper, so embarrassed."
1.0,Product fell apart<br /> first time in wash....
1.0,Rated low as the cap was not as described missing irish attachment. Just a plain hat. Quality of the hat was good and seller gave a 25% discount. They did acknowledge the hat was not as pictured and discount was appreciated.
1.0,This bag looks cheap. The lining and the stitch are so poorly done. I would not recommend anyone to buy this bag.
1.0,"Product said it was a progressive lens, but I received a round top seg.  Very disappointed."
1.0,Came broke and was hanging out of the package when arrive.
1.0,Wore it 3 times and it feel to pieces- beads all over my car.
1.0,This item is wayyyyyy to big for a wrist with no ability to adjust the size of it. It's beautiful for sure but the sizing issue means I have to return it as it was needed for work and won't stay on my wrist.
1.0,This tutu smelled so bad I could not wear it and returned it immediately.
1.0,Terrible cut terrible quality unfortunately so i am returning it
1.0,Very pretty but dosen't fit. Disappointed..Does not look like what I ordered.
1.0,"Colors as shown, but band is annoying as it slips constantly. Have to readjust it so it’s not too loose.  The band is not secured to the adjusting bar piece well at all, looks like weak glue, as it pulled out and can not be reattached. On the second day of wear! Cheap but I guess ya get what ya pay for."
1.0,Why can't they make thigh thighs to fit real women's thighs?
1.0,Got my order delivered. It was one single umbrella in a box. Absolutely ridiculous. With delivery cost it was over $100. For one umbrella? Absolutely not.
1.0,It’s super cheap looking and the onesie was so short. It was wide and short. I don’t think it would fit anyone.
1.0,These would have been pretty and worn more often had they not been painful to wear.
1.0,Broke after first use
1.0,Fits good. But if I put it the dryer the zipper breaks off or melts.
1.0,Look at the print and compare with what they sent. The pants are so dark.  They only give partial refund
1.0,"Too. Small,not stretchable hard to put on"
1.0,This item has to be in kids size
1.0,"Ordered a medium for my daughter, it fit more like a large. Wine color ended up being red. We’re returning it and will continue looking. The fabric while really soft, was a bit too silky with a bit of a sheen to it, it looked a little odd and bulky where it meets up with the cuffs. Length was great, but that was the only thing she liked about the sweater."
1.0,Cheaply made. On sleeve had hem.
1.0,I very much do not like the fit it is cheaply made and nothing like advertised
1.0,"Cheaply made.  Bounced right off the ground.  Not sure what kind of metal,  but the stone is rubber."
1.0,The packaging ruined it. It was in a padded envelope but also with tiny fragments of styrofoam which blew all over the place. I’d give it zero stars which is a pity since I like the bracelet.
1.0,Awful quality!!!it came with 2 holes(((don’t buy!
1.0,Haven't had it but 2 months and already discoloring to a pink color.
1.0,I almost lost my Iwatch about 7 times.  The band keeps unlocking it self.
1.0,"The dress was too large in the chest, but would barely close in the front. Since it was supposed to be a wrap dress it was quite disappointing. Fabric of extremely poor quality. Wouldn't wear it even as a beach cover up! Returned the next day."
1.0,Came misding gems
1.0,"Nice pattern but very thin, flimsy, almost transparent material. Took over a month to ship."
1.0,Necklace arrived without stones. Clasp broke upon first attempt; sent back for refund next day.
1.0,Very unflattering around the stomach area
1.0,"This is poor quality flannel.  After washing, it shrinks a full size.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,Very bad quality. Want to return it .
1.0,returned them because they were way too big for my face.
1.0,SEAMLESS HIGH WAIST LEGGINGS FOR WOMEN-FLEECE LINED 3 PACK (BLACK/GREY/RED)<br />{HAVE TO TITLE WHAT I AM REVIEWING AS AMAZON DOES NOT ALWAYS MATCH REVIEWS WITH PRODUCT}<br />I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THESE BASED ON REVIEWS.  5'7&#34; 145LBS.<br />I BARELY GOT THESE PULLED ON.  SMALL UNCOMFORTABLE - RETURNED.
1.0,"Very comfortable. Unfortunately, the first time I used the rest room I noticed a couple holes. Don't expect them to stand the test of time. Maybe not even a few hours."
1.0,Back party came off after one time use
1.0,size incorrect
1.0,They do not for the Oakley Sliver. Lenses are too small.
1.0,It turns my finger green
1.0,"Be careful with this product, your phone is held in place by a magnet. My phone fell out and the glass shattered. Otherwise it a nice wallet"
1.0,Coating came off after 3 days
1.0,"It is very small, it is like for 7 years old children, the quality is terrible and the product is horrible."
1.0,"Looks good feels comfortable.<br /><br />update: 10-09-16<br /><br />a few light washes, more like take a wet cloth and wipe it, the navy blue has gone brown, it looks old and tired. wont be buying them again."
1.0,"Got these last night and two have already broken. They both broke immediately after putting them on.<br /><br />The first one got magnetized to my watch clasp as I draped it over my neck and when I pulled it free the tassel came out and stayed attached to the magnet. The second one I put it on this afternoon, then picked up the laundry basket to take down stairs.  When it set down the basket the medallion was detached and laying on the ground. So disappointed! 😩😭<br /><br />These were very gentle activities. The quality is very poor if they both broke within the first minute of putting them on."
1.0,It was like putting on a foam novelty oversized hat. Way to big. And it's supposed to stretch to fit larger heads?
1.0,"The key problem is that they don't stretch, like at all! They seem like good quality, but that doesn't matter if the sizing is off and they aren't stretchy as advertised. I ordered an extra large, and received an extra large, but it is certainly not the standard extra large size! I would say it looks more like a medium in the waistline and a large in the legs. Completely bizarre, especially since the other reviews were so positive about the fit."
1.0,This swimsuit was paper thin and has no inner lining. I ordered a youth size and it looks like an adult size. I would NOT recommend this suit!
1.0,What a joke! I searched  sketchers by some ridiculousness this company is riding  on the coat tails of true comfort. I would have been better off burning  my money!  These things are junk! The right shoe is almost an inch smaller  than the left! Yes both labeled size 12!<br /><br />SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE!
1.0,This dress was so much larger than expected. The sizes are not correct at all
1.0,These earrings I received were not even alike. They were not the same as each other. That is not OK with me I don't wear earrings that are not the same.
1.0,🤬🤬🤬It looks nothing like it was portrayed and I’m utterly disappointed with it. The only positive is that it was donated
1.0,Literally ripped while putting them on.
1.0,Well... I knew it was going to take FOREVER to come but it will actually take a month and a few weeks to get to you. By then (Like me) you will probably already bought some more... I also thought these were 14 gauges but I believe I read they are 12's?? Idek know for sure. I guess between my impulse buying of seeing it was very cheap and them not actually being more specific I cant really be upset.
1.0,Tangle easily. Hate wearing them.
1.0,Way too chunky and heavy.
1.0,These masks are huge! Way too big for kids. And the filter that goes inside is super bulky and falls out. So disappointed because the patterns are so cute!
1.0,"This was NOT a dress. It was a 2 piece set. I did not like the fit. The skirt part is designed oddly, so there is no complete coverage of your lady parts like the image shows."
1.0,item was 200 per cent smaller than presented by ad
1.0,I couldn’t send them back as I waited to long to open the package - they have a strong smell to them and the sizing is horrible
1.0,"Item looks nothing like the picture. It's a printed fabric, not embroidered. It's also a cheap fabric. When you contact them for a refund, they'll offer to let YOU pay to shop it back, or they'll give you a partial refund. Total ripoff."
1.0,no recomended
1.0,the chain was extremely cheap. I received it in a package and the chain was clearly cheap and it was broken when I opened the package. very unhappy.
1.0,It to light and it not worth that much
1.0,Very cheap appearing like you would expect at a dollar general store.
1.0,Size 7 was a little small
1.0,"Not at all what was shown in listing. No collar on the shirt, weird cuff design at the wrists. Deceiving seller and I’m very annoyed."
1.0,"Sizing was a major issue - Small was tiny, medium was... also tiny. The zipper arrived broken. Skip this if you are on the fence."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:9f99611beeeb36a623687be3ebe29b9d]] Very poor durability; scuff damage with normal wear after a week. I bought 3 timex Ironman watches since February of this year. All slightly different styles. I did this because I had my last timex Ironman watch for 9 years before the light stopped working. The other watch I bought had water damage to the display the first time I wore it in a pool, briefly. I had worn the heck out of my last watch, in lakes/pools/water parks/hot tubs. Now what you would expect of an “Ironman watch”. I guess they just don’t make them like they used to anymore"
1.0,Stretched out after 1 wear. Waste of money.
1.0,"The wire is cheap, doesn't stay in place, and the material is so thin it scratches your skin."
1.0,Scratchy scratchy stiff rough  HATE THESE!
1.0,Too small. Do not fit over my small Ladies glasses
1.0,"The gold wore off the first time that  I wore these brand new gloves. I was shocked to see this after a couple of hours.  I was walking round holding my umbrella. It did rain a bit at the very start but the gloves were dry under the umbrella.  I hope not too many people noticed. I bought them specifically for the event but hoped to use them again.  Try not to touch anything while wearing these gloves, try not to hold anything."
1.0,Returned because of odd fit and cheap material
1.0,I haven't worn the shirt...washed and dried and the print on the shirt all stuck together :( returning. If I pulled it apart it would've ripped all the print. Disappointed
1.0,Cheap and useless. Keep slipping
1.0,"The photo used of the silver chain is a stock photo, not an actual photo of product I received. It arrived with a broken center chain. Not worth the price."
1.0,One black earring and one purple earring.  Mismatched set sent.  Post turning black in ear. Not happy but perfect size for third earring hole until I can find something better.
1.0,These had the most god-awful smell when opening the package. Like penguin pee and turpentine.
1.0,Not as other Miusol products
1.0,One was broke. It wasn't worth the time or effort to return it. I won't buy them anymore from Amazon.
1.0,Dress was so pretty. Under the arms was WAY too big and curved out away from my body. I had to return. I have a large chest and it was like I needed to take in an inch on either side under my armpit. I couldn’t imagine how it would be on someone with a smaller chest than myself.
1.0,The slEeves were so big and puffy i tore them off the day i got this plus it is way too tight even though other corsets same size fit as they should
1.0,The resin watch band is very hard to fasten taking up to 3 minutes to put on. I will never by a watch with this type of band again.
1.0,This item is not as described or pictured. Waste is a lot smaller than size. It looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,Zipper broke the second day I tried to wear it. Wasn't even real right.
1.0,"They are confortable, but they look cheap, I had to return this purchase."
1.0,One earring broke as soon as I put the Dowell through.  Very cheap.
1.0,more like a small brochure than a book.  rip off.
1.0,"It is just Okay. It is rather cheap looking. It is very lightweight which is nice but is still, cheap"
1.0,"Earrings are pretty, but too large and heavy.  Returning."
1.0,Awful and cheap made
1.0,No of good quality. Returning the dresses.
1.0,I ordered a small Longchamp le pliage light blue bag. What I got was a mini bag.
1.0,Ordered a 2x but was more of a small croptop. I wouldn’t even be able to tell you how many sizes it was off. Good luck and buyers beware.
1.0,Absolutely terrible<br />Nothing like the picture and a tiny weird hoodie. Don't buy it.
1.0,"The plastic that the dandelion seed is encased in has a seam around the side that is clumsy looking, ruins the effect of the seeing the seed, and irritates the skin.  Even at the low, deal of the day price, this was just a piece of junk and not worth it."
1.0,"Did not fit my Ray Ban frames, despise matching the Ray Ban model in the item description.  Don't waste your time."
1.0,"Poor quality, once it was a month old the color changed on the metal parts turning them from silver to tarnish"
1.0,one of the tassels fell out the first time i wore them and i lost it.
1.0,This was my error. I ordered the wrong size and the item cannot be returned. This item was never taken out of the package.
1.0,"These are definitely not mirrored. I put them on and I could see my pupils through the lenses. Also, the polarization is weak at best, not quality in the slightest. I drive a convertible and these don’t do anything to block the sun out. If I were you, I’d go get a pair of peppers on sale somewhere before buying one of these"
1.0,Es muy chico no lo pude usar y no lo pude regresar aun lo tengo en casa
1.0,These are ok. Looks like some slacks were cut off and then side pockets were added. No issues with stitching or zipper. The material feels thinner and lighter than my other cargos which I'm beginning to like. The belt is confusing to use and nothing special. I would never buy it separately. The main thing is the color. I ordered the gray and it is much lighter and dare I think they sent me a khaki pair but they are not quite khaki color. Don't know but I do know they are not the same as pictured.<br /><br />Update: After a wash they look a little better less like a pair of slacks that were cut and had pockets sewn on the sides. Also figured out the belt. For the money I'm bumping it up 1 star.<br /><br />Update: Seems if you buy another pair you can only write a review for the entire brand and not individual colors. I like these shorts I bought 3 different colors. But the khaki colored pair run small. When I received them I thought they would fit like the previous pairs so I just threw them in the wash so I could wear them. They run small. I want to exchange them if I can but i don't think they will after wash and wear. Too bad i liked these it's just the khaki one ran small.
1.0,Wish i could have returned this...its placement is not how it is pictured.
1.0,Material and fit was not good. Not impressed.
1.0,Have to my granddaughter way to small. Couldn't return no UPS store near me
1.0,These are kid size horrible! I threw them in the trash!!
1.0,"Nice looking sandals and all, however, the chemical smell that came with these sandals was totally overpowering to the point that I became very ill due to sinus inflammation. I have them double bagged while I try to learn where I can send these sandals to be evaluated in case, they may be harmful to people and animals"
1.0,The earrings i received  look nothing like the picture and are very bulky compared to the picture. Some are missing as well. very disappointed
1.0,"Poor quality, lasted a few months before the Velcro wore out."
1.0,Yeah..... The shoulders were so puffy I looked like a joke. It was a nice coat and from the waste down it was great. But if you're not a fan of puffy shoulders then it might not be the best idea. I'm returning it. If the shoulders weren't as puffy it'd be perfect.
1.0,It looked like my husband was wearing a shopping bag.  Even though it was advertised as slim fit - it had the boxy shape that American sweaters tend to have where it's as wide as is long.  Not a keeper.  Returned and had to pay return shipping :(
1.0,"Cheap material, wore it once and seams started pulling apart."
1.0,"Extremely too small, sizing extremely off!"
1.0,Ordered this and the thinnest hoodie you've ever seen arrived with an out of focus heat transfer logo on it. DO NOT BUY. We returned it immediately.
1.0,Hurt my feet had to return
1.0,Not good for the cold weather. Might be good for early spring or early fall.
1.0,Sizing is way off
1.0,"Poor knit material, could few times use."
1.0,Not impressed by this purse at all! It is very flimsy & is open so everything can just fall out. Also has a odd smell.
1.0,Stopped working in less than 3 months. Junk! Don't buy it!
1.0,Put it on and it broke immediately.  Repaired it and wore it for an hour and lost it. Bad quality!
1.0,"The rings holding the pieces are not strong at all and after using this keychain for few days, both the keychains were lost somewhere."
1.0,"Extremely cheap material, sizing way off! Don’t waste your one or money."
1.0,Material is very cheap. Not worth the money AT ALL.
1.0,The masks are not good quality. Air goes right through them when you breath. It defeats the whole purpose of wearing a mask. I’m returning them.
1.0,"I returned it because it was too large.  my fault, not theirs."
1.0,Turn my fingers black
1.0,Very poor quality! Has extra metal that hangs off the side. Love the color? Poorly designed. Returned.
1.0,This product is way too small to be 40d. I just wasted money.
1.0,This swimsuit was extremely unflattering. The material was ok and the sizing was ok but it did not do anything for me.
1.0,"I purchased my watch band November 2, 2022, and after four months of having it, the watch broke! I take very good care of it, I don’t get it wet nor do I wear it every day so for it to break so soon is very disappointing!! I don’t think I’ll be purchasing again!"
1.0,Colors were not as pictured. Very faded and almost grey.
1.0,To small for a keychain
1.0,Very easy to break
1.0,Too tight; It literally choked my neck. I'm 210lbs
1.0,I should have changed this review a long time ago.....hate these shoes.  Only wore once.  Way to big.......uncomfortable.  I love orthaheel shoes but not these.  They are just setting in the closet.
1.0,"I was so excited about this band, but it has completely broken within 2 weeks of my purchase... I didn’t wear it to shower, sleep, or work out so there’s no reason that it should have broken. Extremely poorly made. Very disappointed."
1.0,Dress was unwearable didnt fit not even close
1.0,Garbage very cheap it broke just trying to put it on the watch
1.0,Took forever to get here and was later the the latest projected date. Low quality. I am still waiting to get a return mailing label to return the dang thing
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!!! WHEN YOU BREATHE,  IT GOES ALL INSIDE YOUR NOSE AND MOUTH.  NOT PRACTICAL....UNCOMFORTABLE AND SUFFOCATING!"
1.0,Received this beanie as a gift yesterday. Light was dead so I plugged it into my laptop to charge as directed by the package.  About 30 minutes later the light exploded and the cover went flying across the room. As you can see in the picture the battery swelled up. I would never own this product. I was lucky I was there when it happened. What if I wasn't?  The battery might have caught fire.
1.0,"We ordered two pj sets. We were sent a large but we ordered a med. For the other one it was a 2xL for my 6 ft 5 in son and it wasn't even close to fitting. So thinking the large will at least fit his petite girl friend and the 2xL fits me, his 5ft 9in mom. Last thing, the pants are cut low in the back and not the front so your back side is exposed I not wearing the shirt it came with. The shirt is long so that helps until you sit down against a cold seat back."
1.0,"It’s really pretty but the color was a bit off, second time wearing it and the bow just untied.<br />I regretted purchasing this item"
1.0,Not as described .. Returned immediately and very disappointing
1.0,"I've tried several times to make these work and they just don't. They are very frustrating to deal with. After a few wears the spikes on the pleat that holds your shirt in place wears off so one of the straps end up sliding down your shirt. Once this happens it's very uncomfortable and is constantly rubbing against the front of your leg, I don't know how many times I go to the rest room to try and fix them. I want my shirt to stay tucked and in place but it isn't worth the hassle. Not sure if this particular brand was just poorly made but they are more of an headache than a help."
1.0,This swimsuit is not is advertise the gap in space on the side of each of the bathing suits are way too large! Not only can you see the hips but half of the butt feels like it’s sticking outside of it! And it is not flattering to the physique if you’re looking for something that’s a grip to your waist line!😡
1.0,Did not fit any adults that I knew we are very disappointed and it’s too late to return this item we bought as a gift.
1.0,Not not good
1.0,This product is a joke and doesn't work at all. JUNK. You should take it off your market. You are making a mockery of Amazon selling junk like this. X-Ray specs from the 60s works better than this crap you sold me.
1.0,It's adorable but my 2yr old couldn't fit in it! Order a size to 2 sizes up!!!
1.0,"Cute but I plan to return cuz not true to size. This is a bit snug and I want it looser, so I plan on returning. This was my first clothing Amazon purchase, so now I know sizes run smaller."
1.0,Not helpful.
1.0,Bad condition don't purchase!!!!
1.0,Much small than expected
1.0,"I just got these tonight, put them in and thought they were beautiful.  While I was home one fell out  while I was sitting at my desk.  Fortunately I heard it fall and put it back in but when I went to take them out before bed tonight found the other one came out / is lost.  Twice within a few hours they came out!<br /><br />They don’t come with any type of back or way to keep them from sliding out."
1.0,The jacket is super too small.  I returned it to UPS and was told that I didn't have the right label when I gave them the label that was sent to me.  I am very frustrated about that and am thinking of not ordering clothes via Amazon again. I am stuck with a jacket that does not fit.  I am disappointed.<br /><br />Update:<br />I found a friend who loves the jacket and says it fits perfect.  So I will just leave it at that.  Thanks.  She loves it.
1.0,Definitely not what I expected. It was super long and really big. The material wasn’t that silky material that I expected. You also need to have to boobs to fit the top.
1.0,"It's my own fault really, Expecting to get a functioning pocket watch for $7.99.<br />It looks nice but doesn't keep time worth a damn.<br />From the looks of the other reviews, I must be the only one who<br />got a bad one.<br />Maybe it was built on a Monday or Friday when someone was hung over."
1.0,The catch is so loose that I list the pin the second day I wore it.
1.0,"lenses popped out after 2 uses, scratched super easy!!!! very unsatisfied, but they were so cute"
1.0,"Unfortunately the ordering of this tie was such a headache for me. I wanted four mint green ties for my wedding party's groomsmen, and since I live out of the country I decided to buy one to start off and have my parents look at the color. The first tie delivered came just as the color in the photo is shown, and with a matching handkerchief, so since we were happy with it I proceeded to order three more. The following three ties ordered were an olive color with no matching handkerchief. I was stuck with three ties of an off-color and one that worked. I then had to order one more, hoping it would come the olive color and I received a mint tie just as the first I ordered! At that point I had two ties of one color and three of another! I then had to order two more (this time olive) and was stuck with five olive ties and two mint. We used the olive ties, because of time constraints after placing so many orders, but the color was off and I will be returning the extra and the two mint ties I had originally hoped for."
1.0,"The hinges are so loose,  it near impossible to get it libed up and clasped behind your ear."
1.0,"This item, as well as other items from this seller are mostly fakes! The bundled pin packages are so full of counterfeit pins it is disgusting. Thats why the price is so good as well. This set of thirty was 2/3 fake! The fake ones that they probably got for pennies on the dollar subsidize the cost of the few real pins that are in the bundle. DO NOT BUY!!! Putting these scrapper pins into circulation hurts everyone! this was a terrible buy."
1.0,I ordered a medium and somehow they interpreted that to mean I wanted a XXL.
1.0,"Just as the previous reviewer, I received 20 molds of the right side of the heart, and none of the left side.  I can do nothing with these.  What a ripoff!!!"
1.0,"Dress too long and bust too tight, 5 ft. 48 bust, 213lb"
1.0,Very cheaply made. Not correct sizing. Looks nothing like the pictures. Returning as soon as I can afford to send it bCk to China!
1.0,Not as pictured. Very poorly constructed. Print is awful. Fabric of sock is even worse.
1.0,Was so disappointed that the laser pen was not included. Very disappointing & very poor packaging!
1.0,Doesn't look like the picture. Not worth the money.
1.0,"The cor looks dark, but its actually bright blue. So ugly."
1.0,This product has a very poor quality fabric.
1.0,"Perhaps up until now, I was lucky. Every pair of jeans I ever bought was ready to wear. Until my ill-fated decision to buy Lucky Jeans. Let's get the positive out of the way -- they look, fit and feel great. But OMG, the formaldehyde smell is overpowering -- not just a mild mildew smell, we're talking ""night at the coroner"" smell, ""get out of my car!"" smell. I was going to return them (wish I did), but I looked up ""jean smell"" and it appears to be more common than I thought. Tips included washing/soaking in baking soda, which I tried. Did did not work. I am going to next attempt a white vinegar wash which I will do so carefully as to not make a bad situation worse. Lesson learned, you can buy just about everything on Earth at Amazon (and I do), but perhaps jeans are not one of those things, unless they come with a ""no stink"" guarantee."
1.0,I ama huge fan of Vionic Shoes and I own 4 pairs. But these shoes caused huge blisters on the bottom of my feet.
1.0,Felt very cheap and was see through..
1.0,Chest too tight
1.0,Who has this small of a head?
1.0,I’m sure it would be great if you order two or thtee sizes up from what you normally would wear.  I ordered one size up and the dress was still too small.  And the return cost $5!
1.0,1 size doesn't fit all
1.0,Did not recieve
1.0,"Was cute for a week, then the elastic started to tear..."
1.0,The hoodie was too small and the print was cut off.<br />It also had a misplaced logo on the hood<br />However i do have to give them props because they immediately gave me a refund after sending in the complaint
1.0,not what I expected based on pics. looks cheap. but was ok for the price. gave it to my 5 year old to play with. she adores it.
1.0,"The fabric feels and looks cheap. The size runs a bit small. Worst of all, the shirt is so thin you can see through it. Not a quality product! Returned."
1.0,Did not work on my bicycle sunglasses. Applied exactly as directions stated. Still fog up when riding in cold weather.
1.0,The style is not the same as the picture. The material is much thinner.
1.0,"Neckline cutout was about three times larger than a normal T-shirt.  (""Boat neck""?)<br />Neckline piping was black instead of white as shown in description.<br />Material was so thin it was almost see-through."
1.0,"Runs very small, returned."
1.0,"None of them fit the same way.  A couple of the bras fit okay in the band, but a few actually cut into my side. None of the cups fit, some fit better than others. Underwire in one was twisted.  The strap on another was unraveling."
1.0,Nothing on this dress fits as it was advertised.  The only reason that I am keeping it is because I sew and will be able to take it apart to resize for myself.
1.0,This out fit is not for girls with big boobs and big butts
1.0,Very pretty but child size. Do not waste your money if you want a comfortable mask.
1.0,I bought this for my costume and very disappointed with the product. Too big and does not stay in place.
1.0,The ring was bent out of shape and was not round like it should be
1.0,"A few things went wrong with this lanyard. I purchased it about 9 months ago, and started noticing the finish was scratching off (no big deal tbh). Then about a month ago, I noticed the tongue of the clasp was not lining up straight, but it still kept the badge in place, so again no big deal. Then about a week ago, the plastic caps that snap together at the opposite end of the lanyard cracked. That was fixed with a bit of superglue. Until today, when the metal spring clasp just sheared apart."
1.0,This looks nothing like the picture. Like in any way. I bought a size up to get the oversized look and it literally just looks like a shapeless cheap cardigan.
1.0,These broke within a week after I bought them.
1.0,"did not like it, too small. Zipper part is very, very little."
1.0,"The image and description do not show what a low quality garment this is. Instead of the knitted sweater I expected, this is a gross plastic knit."
1.0,Works good at first. This is the second one I've bought. The first one lasted about 18-20 months. This one lasted less than a year. I do not recommend you buy this boot dryer. It would be a waste of money.
1.0,Not a good buy! Was not true to size at ALL!<br />Very disappointed!
1.0,"The photo looks elegant but the watch looks cheesy, metal too bright, strap looks like plastic. Returning for sure."
1.0,"I picked this out because it reminded me of the movie Clueless and I thought I might be able to use it for Halloween. I wasn't expecting anything fantastic, based on the price, but I was expecting the straps to be sewn on in the correct spots. The fabric itself is cheap, by both look and feel, but the fit of the actual dress part was acceptable.  The straps are another story though. In the front, they are seen on with not more than 5 inches between them, while in the back they are sown in a normal position (for a spaghetti strap dress or top) to go over the shoulders. The result is super awkward looking and not at all cute or fashionable."
1.0,The design stretched out.
1.0,I’ve always bought dresses on Amazon. This one was shaped very strange. The waist was super tight.
1.0,very comfortable will be buying more
1.0,Fell apart peice by peice in public...it was so embarrassing...no thank you..
1.0,I bought 2 different versions and neither fits anyone but a child. Did I miss something?
1.0,broken already....
1.0,Don’t look nothing like the picture
1.0,Sizing soooo off!!
1.0,"Very poorly sewn. After a week or two and one washing, stitching was coming loose all over. I thought my daughter had just been rough with it, playing on the playground. I took my sewing machine to the seams, but after the next wash, well, look at the pictures!"
1.0,Giving this to my daughter. Not what a mature woman needs in her closet.
1.0,The backs are sort of hard to put on. I don't think they're made of real surgical steel since I had an allergic reaction to them. Will not be buying this style of gauges again.
1.0,"We purchased was a Christmas present.  It was not used until mid January.  The zipper stuck and dragged in the upper wide corner from the very beginning!  We mistakenly thought it would get better with use.  It now totally skips that section totally and the zipper pops opens all the way around.  Because it is 9 days past the 31 of January, they will not refund or exchange because the last day for exchanges on Christmas items was January 31.  SO BUYER BEWARE!  If you order from these people use immediately and if there is the anything not perfect with it send it back immediately!  They do not go the extra mile.  I give one star cause I can't seemed to give it zero."
1.0,I was so disappointed in this bra.  I wanted it to fit but it was to small (the cup size).  Can't do a full review as I could not wear the item.
1.0,Not as pictured. It is not an oversized floppy hat. It came folded up in a box and it's just terrible.
1.0,The lenses in these glasses are NOT Polarized.  The glasses have lenses that are slightly tinted yellow and do not affect night vision at all.  They're essentially useless.
1.0,"I sent it back, it was horrid."
1.0,"I loved it! The anklet was gorgeous, however it literally broke overnight! I guess quality wasn't as promised!"
1.0,"The title on the web page of this product states &#34;Ear Cuff Wrap Clip Earring.&#34; Does that sound like a pierced post earring?? Didn't to me, either, which I why I was searching for ear cuffs. No nickel post to worry about.<br /><br />So, this purchase was mis-labeled. It does look like an ear cuff, but it's not. The post is HUGE, by the way. It's not worth returning at 2 bucks, but -- geez. Sure wish it was a true ear cuff."
1.0,The breast line is to high goes above the breast bottom was large
1.0,I bought this dress for a white party. It was too small and not dressy enough for me. It was thin and see through. I will be returning it.
1.0,no size was even in the coat and I ordered a 4X
1.0,Never have I had anything so hard to snap together even using needle nose plyers my thumbs are so sore
1.0,"I wore this to a football game, and within a 1/2 hour all my layers underneath were wet. This is definitely not waterproof. It's also not lined so if any of the coat touches your arm it's a very cold material. The only thing that worked was the length- it did go to my knees so it helped keep my upper legs dry. But my upper body- not so much."
1.0,The Ying Yan design fell off of both posts within a week of wearing. My daughter is crushed.
1.0,This product is a cheap I mitation of the original. It cut my daughters leg like knives. I want my money back
1.0,"I was excited to give this set to my daughter for Christmas, but when it came in the mail, it looked nothing like the picture! Instead of a marbled red, it’s a solid burgundy with a brown pompom and a regular scarf instead of an infinity one!"
1.0,the glasses frame are curved like regular frames and will not accommodate frames under them. nice if you don't wear glasses for corrective vision.
1.0,Did not work with regular glasses. would not stick to the metal on my glasses. only worked with the cheap glasses sent with the Len's. Tried it on a few of the glasses I have and none worked.
1.0,"First time we used it to go on a trip, we got a hole in the bottom of the large suitcase. The inside zipper broke on the small suitcase.<br />Not very burable at all."
1.0,Front outside zipper broke. Didn’t have an appropriate stop. Really bummed.
1.0,This shirt was wildly itchy and was blindingly white. Would not recommend.
1.0,The jacket itself is very nice and lightweight so we can be wearing comfortable. The problem is there are no pockets.
1.0,"This dress is made so weird, the middle part is sewed in incorrectly, theirs no way to wear this dress, it's a HOT MESS"
1.0,These sandals fit well for about a week then became very loose. Turns feet black. Do not recommend purchasing these.
1.0,I'm disappointed with the product. The sunglasses were defective.<br />Not recommended.
1.0,It was smaller than advertised. What was meant to be Large was small in size.
1.0,Gold colored pendant bezel and bright silver colored chain.
1.0,"This set seemed really pretty out of the packet (somewhat smaller than expected) and soft.  However, I only tried the pants on for a short time and my hands and legs were completely purple after a few moments.  I didn't want to attempt to put the set in the washing machine or sink for fear it would permanently stain."
1.0,The strapped ripped and unopened after minutes of use. I had barely filled it. Returned asap
1.0,Cheap and ugly. Tossed them in the donation pile. Never wore them. They are more like pantyhose and the cheap waistband is horrible. No way I'd have even looked at these twice if I had seen them in a store. Maybe not even once.
1.0,Cheaply made. I’m 5ft 3 and this was very frumpy looking
1.0,Wore them once and the frame broke.
1.0,Worn once and fell apart
1.0,Horrible fabric! All see through! Unable to return it! DONT BUY FROM THEM!!
1.0,This is a poor version of any designed binder.
1.0,Beautiful in appearance but TOO Loose. Can't ft any of them because they wont clamp on my ears. Very disappointed 😔😔😔
1.0,"My 4 month old has an Nasal Gastric tube due to health reasons... that she is adept at pulling out!  So I needed some hand protectors so she couldn't get it. I like the ScratchMeNot and the Goumikids mittens, the other brands I tried were horrible including Handsocks and these Scratchsleeves.  Sleeves are okay, but can only go with long sleeves.<br />Pros:<br />The color. ScratchMeNot were obnoxious colors. This was neutral.<br />Loved the soft material.<br />Cons:<br />They would NOT STAY ON my daughter's shoulders, even under a shirt. Her hands and arms kept popping out. They made them way, way too wide. Weird."
1.0,Just didn't like the fit and low neckline.
1.0,The mirror finish on the lens peeled off after only a few weeks. Very disappointed but do not want anyone else to be fooled.
1.0,It to big I can't wear it
1.0,Se pone un color prieto feo
1.0,"Garbage city. Don't buy this thing, it fell apart on my wife after a week. Also, it smelled horrid for that entire week to the point where I debated putting it out on my patio at night but I didn't think that would be fair to the squirrels."
1.0,Had to send them back.
1.0,"I ordered the ULG 8 Bottle set.  They claim that it is with the heavy trigger, and that is what they have in the product photos. What they actually sent has poor quality spray heads and are not heavy duty.  I have bottles with the higher quality head (as pictured in the product photos), and I love them.  Please avoid this set, it is a bait and switch for the cheaper heads.  I attached pictures to compare what they sent versus what I expected.  The dirty bottle is what matches their photos. The other one is the cheap knockoff I actually received."
1.0,A little bigger than I expected and actually broke the 1st day I wore them!
1.0,Fit was too tight for me.
1.0,Cheaply made!  Paper that wraps around head!  Didn’t last two minutes!
1.0,"I ordered a size 4t and got a girls size 14 in a completely different (albeit, much cuter) style of vest. I won't order from there again. You never know what you will actually be delivered."
1.0,"Beautiful jumpsuit, really dislike sleeves at the shoulder."
1.0,Garbage fell apart when I tried to zip it.  STAY AWAY from this seller.  RIP OFF. Required to give at least one star.  They deserve no star
1.0,Didn't feel true to size
1.0,Came with broken strap. I can return it but is it worth going to UPS or Kohls in this covid environment for $ 7.<br />Waste of money and kid is unhappy.
1.0,FADED AFTER ONE WASH!!! 😢<br />I was very excited to get this hat. Fits great But after one wash it looks terrible. The black is a dingy grey and the fabric feels like it has been washed a hundred times. I will be sending it back...
1.0,Piece of junk. I took it out of the package and put it on. It fell to pieces. I was so upset
1.0,Super tiny and the screw does not hold well. Looks like if they are falling out. Otherwise could be cute.
1.0,"Apparently whoever designed this has never met anyone over a size two. I am a size 18 and I can wear the shorts but the shirt was a good fit for my friend who is size small. Needless to say, the fit was disappointing."
1.0,"Ridiculously small. It wouldn't even stretch to fit over a small child's head let alone an adult's head. Fabric is very cheap, hardly any stretch, frays at the ends. This is garbage. Keep looking for ones that have a seamed edge, better material and can fit over an average adult's head. I wouldn't even use this to dust my house."
1.0,Thin fabric. Does not look like photo.
1.0,Too small for a guys wrist. My 16 year old bought them for him and his GF and it won’t go on him. He’s not a large child either.
1.0,The Mode Button came off on the first day of use. Amazon does not support refund function for this item.
1.0,"Main compartment zipper didn't work. They had the same picture for each description, so it was impossible to tell the difference between the choices, unless you already knew the dissent tops of camo-based on previous reviews, most of us did not."
1.0,Would not reccommend! Very little stretch! Not particularly comfortable.
1.0,Though the description says red and black let me be very clear. The color is nowhere approximating red. It is a weird sickly Orange.
1.0,"cheap material. belt loops broke, zippers broke. only worn once and the one belt loop broke just because i pulled the pants up"
1.0,Size is way too small. Looks nothing like what is pictured. Horrible.
1.0,Wasn’t a real fan of these. Too thick and stiff for my taste.
1.0,"I wear red in memory of my son, who was killed by a drunk driver.  This new bracelet was  adorable. The first time I wore it I had compliments! Then, within a week, one string detached and the bracelet began to fall apart."
1.0,This came with the shirt only! Would not buy again
1.0,I thought the material will be more thicker it's very thin
1.0,"Recieved item, however holes were not drilled. I will have to return the product based on this."
1.0,"This book is a piece of crap.  Unadulterated garbage.  He just plain made stuff up.  His linguistics are awful, the few sources he used are outdated at best (if not have been proven completely wrong by modern archeology, advances in linguistics, etc.)."
1.0,No adjustable scrap described I can’t even put it on.. waste of money!
1.0,One wash in the washer and it creates holes in the onesie -_- will not be purchasing again
1.0,It was too big. Love the suit just to big
1.0,Tried to put it on and it broke
1.0,These are 00g not 0g - wrong size and unusable for me. Won't return because I tried them in my ears.
1.0,"I purchased this gift for my mom to give to her on Christmas, she loved it. However, after only having it for a few days, the Lucite the scorpion is encased in was cracked. It is very unlikely to be from wear and tear, my mother is a pretty quiet, stay- still kinda lady and wouldn't be running about and whatnot. So I was very disappointed to see a crack running along the bottom and the gold thread coming off and so was she."
1.0,"Very poor quality. Image and text not centered. Pleats hide the text. Don't offer refund, just exchange. Exchange had same flaws as first. Exchanged again and never heard from them again. Less than 1 star. Maybe zero."
1.0,my pits 1years old Brooke<br /> real easily
1.0,the cloth was rough and made me feel very itchy. had to return
1.0,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! THE EARLOOPS ARE TOO SMALL FOR AN ADULT WOMAN.
1.0,Not what was advertised...
1.0,Magnets are so bad. Lost in one night
1.0,"It was way to small and made out of ""plasticy"" material..... Returned the same day it arrived."
1.0,Wish I could give negative stars. After waiting a week for the package I received only the packaging and no nose retainers. Don't waste your time or money!!!!!
1.0,Product returned for two reasons. It was too small and the color was not red but a brownish tone. Unacceptable
1.0,These run much larger and they are very inconsistent - ordered a medium in 2 different colors:  the blue medium pair would actually fit a person that would order XL's regularly.  The pink pair would fit a person that orders L's regularly.
1.0,"So disappointed in this product! As I was packing the bag for its first use on a trip the zipper went flying off as I closed the bag! The bag was NOT overpacked, the zipper just simply broke off and could not be fixed, leaving me scrambling to find a substitute on the morning of my flight. I will never purchase from this brand again. I gave it one star because it is a nice looking bag."
1.0,They were itchy and very thin.
1.0,I loved my dyad 8 wide width sneakers. I have about 4 pairs that I love but they wear out. So I got a pair of the dyad 9 wide width and they aren't the same fit. I wear them to work out and my toes go to sleep. The wide width is narrower. So frustrating. I wish I could still get the 8. Now there is a 10 but I don't know if I want to spend$140 to see if they are better. Ugh.
1.0,"Don’t buy these! One of them broke the first time I wore them. They also irritated my ears... definitely not hypoallergenic. Cute, but not worth the money at all!"
1.0,"I was super excited when this product came! It lasted for maybe 2 weeks. Now the ""pop up"" contraption is broke. I had to take a knife to try and remove my cards. They were all jammed up."
1.0,Cheap stuff
1.0,Terrible terrible TERRIBLE quality. Nothing like the picture. The Bruins are uneven and crooked. Paper thin. What I got is NOT what is pictured.
1.0,"I returned mine, I am 5’2 122 lbs I got small and it feel to big, no compression at all and the material feels very cheap."
1.0,I didn't like anything about this dress.. this was what i got instead of of the floral with the split plus it was too long and big.<br />Anyways I will find someone to give.
1.0,"Not only did they send two of the same dandelion earrings instead of one dandelion earring and one dandelion petal earring as was pictured (and I was really excited about), but one of the earrings has significant bubbling in the paint. I’m very disappointed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE!<br /><br />Also, they aren’t as solid quality as their picture suggests. The part that goes into your ear is sauntered on to the main earring, they are not a whole unit as the pictures suggest. Very deceptive!!"
1.0,It’s plastic NOT REAL NONE! I live faraway from the nearest UPS STORE so I’m not driving with these 2 plastic fish hooks with the gas prices so high so I threw it away!
1.0,The first day I loved this but by the second day it was stretched out and no longer as great as it started. Was pretty comfortable when fit properly but the second use it was bunched and stretched in places.
1.0,"I wore these three times and the laces broke, the back snaps fell off, and the sole broke on the right shoe exposing my sock. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!"
1.0,I followed the fit guidelines and the dress was WAY too small around my rib cage. Pretty fabric but very synthetic feeling. Wasn't a great buy.
1.0,First time. Two buttons pop off. Most of my uniforms poorly manufactured!!
1.0,Left package feedback that Im missing a pair only received two pairs can anyone do anything about this.
1.0,They looked too small but for great I was so excited until I turned around and they were see through.
1.0,Don't waste your money on these. Not heavy duty and grabber is cheaply made. 🤬🤬🤬
1.0,Shorter than expected and balls were too small
1.0,Cheap looking. You get what you pay for. Returned it.
1.0,It was junk and pitched in the garbage.  Didn't look safe to use on me.
1.0,Came out of the box already tarnished
1.0,Terrible quality fell apart after wearing it one time.
1.0,Broke at the strap when put on.
1.0,The item was a Christmas gift and arrived with the sleeve ripped off huge disappointment that there was no quality check.
1.0,Not authentic I searched the Tiffany & co website this size isn’t on there it is way bigger than picture
1.0,The shoulder strap tore off the first day I used the bag.  The zippers do not open/close smoothly.
1.0,Super tacky and cheap looking
1.0,This was supposed to be a gift for my granddaughter but it did not fit a wrist and it came over 6 weeks late and I lost my money
1.0,Doesn’t look at all like the picture. Ugly and synthetic.
1.0,"This bead is not a genuine pearl.  This appears to be some sort of shell material shaped to look like a round pearl.  The bead has weight like a pearl but zero grit on the surface, unlike a pearl."
1.0,This felt more like a joke than an actual product. I've used things like this in the past and they are supposed to cover your entire stomach from top to bottom this one does not.
1.0,The suit I received is not the one they advertise. It's similar but not what I wanted. I messaged them a few days ago and have yet to receive a reply. I wouldn't personally recommend.
1.0,Didn’t even wear it a week and the clasp broke. DO NOT PURCHASE
1.0,Nose clip was beoken!!
1.0,"The black bracelet was dark brown not black and it had the Cross symbol not an Aum (Om) symbol, the photo is misleading."
1.0,This is Crap I paid for 9 pairs and got 2 pairs of the same damn thing. Also it was super late coming in.
1.0,I ordered the red skirt and it look orange. It's nothing like the picture I was very disappointed.
1.0,So cheap looking and the material is horrible. Very itchy!!
1.0,I had it 4 weeks and the snap broke not good quality. other than that I like it just would like to use it longer guess not
1.0,Pay for quality
1.0,"This shirt was ridiculously small.  Not just a little bit.  It was almost a joke, like if they ran out of material.  It was disproportionate and nothing like the picture.  Highly disappointed."
1.0,"5'4"" 180lbs and the xl was crazy small"
1.0,This was a gift for my 6 year old grandson to my surprise this is what was in a plastic bag.  I am not sure why anyone would send this to a customer. It looks like someone stepped on the sneakers. UNACCEPTABLE.<br />please you can do better than this.
1.0,Disappointed with how flimsy and easily bendable - one earring shape was bent and both were hard to close
1.0,Item was returned. Images nor descriptions showed it had a big Tennessee T on it. Only wanted a plain stadium seat.
1.0,Mi paquete no me a llegado
1.0,This outfit is incredibly cute.  But the neckline is so wide it scoops down below the chest and falls off the shoulder.
1.0,Print is horrible and once they are washed they look even worse
1.0,The fur on the shoes keeps falling off and sticking to the bottom of my wifes foot. Very irritating to say the least. I would not recommend this product at all and would not leave it a star at all if it weren't required to do so.
1.0,Horrible! The stones fell out and I would like a refund!
1.0,I’m very disappointed because the set I ordered has no stretch to them at all! I will be canceling my other orders.
1.0,"I would wave given it zero stars but there wasn't an option. This crown came in a cheap package and is not fit for a queen like meh. Its cheap, its not real gold, not real diamonds, not real silver, not real rubies. Total rubbish. Would not recommend. Save your money. I am a 23 year old princess and I deserve a better crown that doesn't fall apart and that I don't have to Crazy glue. IT IS ALSO TOO SMALL!! I want something a little more fitting, as well as a refund. BAD PRODUCT, DON'T BUY!"
1.0,Broke after like 1 day. Such a bummer
1.0,I am 5 foot six and 138 pounds and it’s barely fits around me
1.0,Not big enough  other than that it's a beautiful  watchband
1.0,big and bulky.
1.0,Don't size up
1.0,Came to me broken sent back!
1.0,"It's very uncomfortable, not true to size, doesn't really hold in back fat."
1.0,Anything you wear underneath this shirt will be seen. Very thin material. I'm returning
1.0,"I don't write reviews often, but this item is so terrible, I felt I had to warn others. It does not look at all like the picture. It is not a pair of white gloves with raised seams along the back. Instead, it is the thinnest gauze material (almost see-through) that is very roughly cut in the shape of the hand. They don't close around the wrist at all. But worst of all, they arrived with holes in them, and with several seams already falling apart before I even tried them on.<br />I didn't expect much for under $4, but this product isn't worth anything. Don't order these, even if they're giving them away for free."
1.0,"Missing petal, super glue showing, very cheap and not worth your money"
1.0,"This is made for a toddler size person. No kidding, I ordered the large and it was the soze of a dish towel."
1.0,"Picture is deceiving. Necklace is tiny, too small to wear"
1.0,"Fit one both the top and bottom we're off.  Bottoms were too small.  Top just didn't work for some that was busty, no support. Loved the print though."
1.0,Dangle fell off after a few days.
1.0,"Not pleased, narrow & no hemmed on the ends...yuk."
1.0,Cheaply made.  Some broke just trying to put on.  Don't waste the money.
1.0,Not as pictured...I'll wear it but to work not for good like I had planned...disappointed to say the least
1.0,Was not expecting a piece of plastic with a chain the size a dog couldn't even wear
1.0,Came with little strings hanging off the midsection and I had to remove them all with sewing scissors they were attached to the embellishment at the waist. Didn’t want to return as it took months to arrive.
1.0,"The jacket fit as expected, and the material is actually fairly nice. Especially for the price point. The lining and hood are very soft. It appears to be well made. However, in the shadowy section of the listing photo, if you zoom in, you’ll notice a fairly hidden (on purpose in my opinion) raised logo. It’s pretty big. The logo is actually on the back as well. Shoulder level, from side to side, huge, like a name on a jersey. Which is not pictured (intentionally, I’m sure). What does this logo say? JASJS BOND 007. No, that is not a typo. It is, presumably, a misspelling of James Bond 007. It looks terrible. I returned immediately."
1.0,Están muy lindas pero una de las mariposas está ensamblada al revés 😕
1.0,Not the right size... Label read 9-11 but I ordered 10-13...
1.0,My wife loved this as a gift for Christmas. It lasted about 2 hours before the straps broke. She is disappointed and wanted it replaced so we will see what happens with the replacement. Replacement arrived this on didn't last 1 hour straps and pin broke again.
1.0,"The watch is pretty looking and cool. But the time lags and everytime I fix it, it lags again. Now I passed the return window so I can send it back. Don’t order this product."
1.0,"See through,  picture doesn't look like dress i ordered"
1.0,"Not worth it. They come collapsed. You then connect the ends with a cheap paper flap to form a ""cone."" You then thread the elastic through holes punched in the paper. Very cheaply made. Not worth the price at all."
1.0,An absolute waste of money
1.0,"The watch was nice looking, but the quality is absolutely horrible. Don't do anything that would cause you to have one drop of sweat anywhere on your body because the face will fog up, and condensation will get stuck in there for hours, and you won't be able to tell the time at all. I had a pin pop out multiple times but luckily it was on a table so I didn't lose any parts and could put it back together. This watch lasted a week before it randomly came loose and fell onto the ground and shattered into a million pieces. Waste of money."
1.0,These pajamas are made for children…size large bottoms fit my  8 year old granddaughter.
1.0,Broke after first few days pretty
1.0,"The material for this product is not as described, as it is made of fish net stocking like cloth, so it would not provide any sun protection. I'll be returning this product."
1.0,"They are not polarized, the tint is almost nothing, it’s like you’re not even wearing sunglasses at all because I was still squinting cause of the brightness and they were super crooked. Super cheap product, do not buy."
1.0,Watch band was too big for my wrist so I was going to return it. Figured I need a watch for work so I would try it out anyway. It stopped working after wearing it for 1 day. My window to return it is closed. I like the size of the numbers which is why I bought it. It sounds cheap if it moves around and is not tight to your wrist.
1.0,THIS IS NOT EVEN THE SAME DRESS! weird hippie sleeves that flair and stop above the elbow. Umm I ordered long sleeves... not the same waist line. I’m really upset. I will be returning this junk.
1.0,Not durable -strap broke
1.0,"These were HUGE and fit more like BRIEFS than hipsters.  All three packages had the same 3 colors: Nude, Pale Pink, and Mauve.  Not flattering and definitely not comfortable.  They were horrible!!!!!  I thought Hanes was a trusted brand, but I guess not... unless someone is using their packaging on their own awful apparel.  Either way, I will NEVER buy from them on Amazon again."
1.0,Arrived broken. Cute but trash.
1.0,The watch arrived broken. I had to take it to the jeweler to be fixed!!  I was totally EMBARRASSED!!  I gave the big box to my boyfriend to open and there it was.... a broken watch!!  I will never order from this vendor again!!
1.0,Cheap material and way too small.
1.0,I really don’t care for this top!! Oh well!! I’ll give it to someone who likes it. The sizing of way off too!! Too small.
1.0,Very small. Won’t fit a man or large child! Don’t buy!!!
1.0,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Cheapest flimsiest and thinnest ""Jacket"" I've ever seen in my life! Im extremely disappointed with this purchase. Returning this immediately!"
1.0,Be carful way to small. I'm a us xl and ordered zz's just in case and still to small
1.0,LOVED LOVED LOVED this dress the first time I wore it...but it faded after the first wash and looked like awful. Total bummer!! I line dry/cold water/use washer bags/dress inside out inside bag....no excuse!! Sooooo hard to find dresses with pockets too :((((((
1.0,Within 1 month it turned completely brass colored. Yes it was very cute when I received it but for it to start turning brass colored within a couple of weeks...goes to show how cheaply it's made. Not worth it.
1.0,"Fabric is thick and does not breathe, Its like a sauna."
1.0,Way too small !!<br />Am still wondering if I can order another one and create to resize the first one??
1.0,Toe area started to rip after two wears.
1.0,Color wasn't what was pictured at all. Looked more like a pale yellow and extremely thin material. Returned immediately
1.0,No shape and way too big
1.0,Had for about 2 weeks and then this happened putting them in the glasses storage in my car visor. Says 1 year warranty but there is no where to claim that or use it. I’ll go back to my mini tree brand as they are made way more durable.
1.0,The earrings arrived broken!! I’m dissatisfied and disappointed. They don’t look like the image online and they are made of cheap material.. don’t do it!!
1.0,toes poked thru first wearing on 2 pairs
1.0,"The belt is giant! I ordered the small, which should fit a 25”-28” waist (mine is 26”) and it’s even too big on my 37” hips. Sure, it comes with a hole puncher, but I was kinda hoping to receive the belt at the size it was advertised at....I don’t really want a giant tail hanging off me"
1.0,I did not like this too much.
1.0,Fits the Letscom so tight that it breaks the charging plug.  My tracker is now useless!
1.0,The gloves never arrived in the package. Just the cardboard rack holder. This is rediculous
1.0,"On the model thus hat looks huge. In reality, it fits a small woman!"
1.0,I received the necklace and went to put it on and the chain broke. Very disappointed.  I took  to long to send it back so did not get my money back.
1.0,"I have been a swimmer all of my life. Currently I swim 5 to 6 days a week and was looking for a swim goggle that was more forgiving around my eyes than my Speedo Vanquisher. These are not them. First, the bridge of these goggles bites into my nose more than any other goggle. Second, these goggles have a distortion that is only noticed underwater. The distortion makes everything look blurry. For these two reasons I cannot recommend this product."
1.0,First day wear it and the silver appliqué in peeling off the actual ring itself. Really disappointed.
1.0,This item is not like the picture the bottle shape is the writing and labeling on the bottle was not the same the label is sideways and it only say the name and nothing else it's supposed to be a replica of the real thing and I can even see where they put the tape over it badly put together
1.0,"This looks sooo much better in the picture; this necklace is nothing more than cheap plastic ornaments and tin metal flowers that has a random shoelace strung through the chain detail making this necklace look even more cheap, tacky and pathetic. I didnt even try the necklace on because it looked sooo d@mn sad! 😂"
1.0,"The listing says long and 100%cotton. I received a short, polyester top, not cotton."
1.0,"Blows off, constantly comes loose, I just threw mine away. It was a ""fix Everytime you drive"" thing."
1.0,"these lenses dont fit properly, they arent as thick or as long as the original lenses and there was play in the lenses when they were fully snapped in."
1.0,Never order this cheaply material product.
1.0,"Bought XL and the buttocks area was kind of small. So after a few washes, when I sat - it ripped at the seams."
1.0,"Post broke off mine 2nd day, I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,Not a good product at all but I got my full refund so thanks for that .
1.0,"the dress is gorgeous and I was so happy to have it for the holidays but I returned it as it was cut very weird - the top of the bodice was really small - below breast level (ribcage, waist and hips) was normal but the top shoulder area was super small - maybe I just got a defective one but it wasn't wearable for me.  I ordered as to their size chart.  Im 5'6"" 135lbs 36/28/37. Really bummed because it was sooooo pretty."
1.0,I am trying to return this 3 piece set because it doesn't fit. I requested a return label and haven't received one. I cannot get a refund without it & this request was made within 2 weeks of purchase
1.0,"I've had genuine M-65 hoods, this one is not.  Don't waste your money, won't fit your jacket."
1.0,Not comfortable at all. Water sips through it. Very disappointing product.
1.0,it’s literally not a sweatshirt so if you’re looking for a long sleeve overpriced see through shirt maybe 👎👎
1.0,"My sister and I both ordered this top because of the great comments. We were very disappointed. The material is NOT soft and comfy at all - felt like a rubber suit. Also, we normally wear a large because we like our tops roomy, but the large in this top was WAY too large. They are both being returned."
1.0,Way too big the stone the sizing everything
1.0,"Cheap material. Once stretched, material appeared loose. Not worth it."
1.0,Works fine for now although the electronic component housing the battery and on off switch has clearly been fixed or very sloppily put together with hot glue.
1.0,"I am normally a size 0-2 and I ordered a small. They were huge on me! I know the description says the sizes may deviate, but they really deviate a lot. Do not order these if you are smaller than a size 6 or else they will definitely not fit."
1.0,"HORRIBLE..AWKWARD FIT, HAD TO RETURN...DOES NOT ENHANCE FIGURE FOR ME."
1.0,the cloth quality is bad. fitting size is not good at all.
1.0,The glasses have rubber on the earpiece that falls off and exposes a dangerous sharp metal point.
1.0,I wear a size 22-24 and ordered a 3X. What came was more like a Large instead. It was so thin you could see thru it. The hems were serged instead of sewn. Terrible quality! I ordered the same thing from another retailer and received exactly what I was wanting. This one was definitely not what I was wanting or expecting.
1.0,Too small looks like irregular.
1.0,"I bought these shirt stays because of the overwhelming amount of positive stars they had. Big Mistake.<br /><br />Firstly, I'll say that these worked the first three times I used them. After that they failed miserably. Let me explain.<br /><br />These shirt stays are shoddily built with stitching that came apart after my third use.<br /><br />The clasp that holds your shirt is weak sauce. It would lose it grip and come off after several minutes of attaching it to my shirt.<br /><br />Overall, these shirt stays make one thing clear. With a name like &#34; The Best Shirt Stays in the World&#34; on the front of the box, if it's too good to be true, it definitely is."
1.0,"Very disappointed in this item. The cost was three times more than what I had been paying, but unfortunately because of Covid19 they are hard to get. The quality is very poor and I will never under any circumstances purchase from this supplier again."
1.0,I bought these in March. I thought they wer amazing. Now the silver had worn off. They are actually copper. Not true sterling silver. Buy at your own risk.
1.0,Well i want a refund not happy . its not real sterling silver at all it was a gift that i could not give to my friend not real
1.0,"Seemed great at first, but literally after two uses, the bottoms look very rough, all white speckled from tiny catches/ snags."
1.0,"They look nice, but after a very short while (2 weeks), they no longer hold their tightness and then begins the journey of tightening them every 5 minutes.  The hematite (chrome beads) one snapped after 2 weeks with little to no toughness on my part, & the tiger eye one I stopped wearing because it won’t stay tight.  Good thing the price is so low; you get what you pay for I guess."
1.0,"The colour was a totally different one from that advertised (dark blue as if black instead of ordering navy blue), material was as if plastic and sewing was horrible....!!"
1.0,Ring changed color!
1.0,Didn’t like it cheap
1.0,The carbon filters
1.0,I did not like these at all. I will return them. Not only they look cheap but they are a pain to put them on.
1.0,"Arrived not folded in the pouch, on of the zippers broke after the first use, second after 2. I don't understand the other reviewers, this is very low quality product."
1.0,there are closer to ankle socks then quater way to small if i hadn't thrown the packageing away i would have returned them
1.0,"The arms are sooooo narrow they cut my circulation. The dress was poorly made, so disappointed"
1.0,Turned colors and charm fell off
1.0,Too short and bulb is too wide to fit in piercing. Not sparkly. Looks like kids jewelry
1.0,This product took the concept of cheap to a new low. This is such a low quality product that I don't think it costs more than a dollar or two to manufacture it. The fabric is super cheap and not breathable. Its more like a synthetic plastic bag than a fabric that is soft and good enough to touch the skin. It should be embarrassing for them to sell products this badly made.
1.0,String comes undone and falls off
1.0,Quality of the belt is no good. Not worth it.
1.0,They are see through and baggy.  I wear them around the house when I need to bleach something.
1.0,Size is not American for sure
1.0,Look terrible..
1.0,"Don't buy it !<br />You can find better leggings at retail stores<br />Trust me, really cheap made"
1.0,"I purchased 2 of the same band, one Jan 21st & another April 23rd. After receiving the band it was less then a week both times that the band had broke.  Learned my lesson"
1.0,Too small of 2xl
1.0,"Unfortunately the pants were not like the picture but I didn't mind, but right out of the box the zipper was not sewn to the pants. I tried to glue it on but to no avail. The other pair I purchased were the wrong color and two sizes too small, don't know how that happened, size is right on the tag. Seems like this company needs to hire an inspector or two, I can see one mistake but two separate orders needing return is quite frustrating."
1.0,These glasses are massive. First pair got lost in the mail. Ordered another pair and surprised and the size :(
1.0,the material is very thin! I dont like it. it is not as thick as I was expecting.  therefore I have not even tried it on.
1.0,"I loved the glasses, the light weight the color and the fact that they are frameless. Unfortunately it took them less than 7 months for them to break down even though I used them only when I went out for dinner to read the menu. Too bad!"
1.0,"DO NOT sleep with these socks on!  I woke up in the afternoon to severe foot pain.  ( I work 3rd shift).<br />I asked for a men's X-Lge, and I think they sent me a women's size.  If I do put them on, it's only for about<br />an hour or less."
1.0,"Fabric was cheap and nearly see through. Also, I ordered a 2x for someone who is a large normally, and it didn't even fit over her shoulders. Looked to be a small, bordering on a medium."
1.0,thinest material ever requested a refund but to send it back would have been $27 not worth the shipping bag is not even worth $5 it's complete garbage would give it zero stars if possible
1.0,They were the wrong size and wrong color.
1.0,No it ripped the second time i used it i thought it would hold up but it didn’t
1.0,Don't waste the $5. The chain is thin and broke the day I recieved it.
1.0,Will never order again. Chain is twice as long as described and had 'i love mom' etched on the heart. Would send back but not worth the trouble.
1.0,Very low quality material it looks dirty
1.0,"Misled on the description.  There is no push button to retract the handle bar.  Not sturdy at all regardless of the weight of the content.  I like the design that you can fold it flat, but not to the point that the previous issues can be overlooked.  Do not buy.  I'm returning mine."
1.0,The produce was damaged. Bottom was slippery and child could not walk without sliding
1.0,I am a size 10 and this belt is way too small and snug. Sent it back.
1.0,"Fabric started to pill and looks like there will be holes after only 2 uses. Velcro has completely come unsewn from shoe.  Sole is pretty thin and flexible. Not what I was looking for. Had other pairs for my kids that have lasted and been fantastic.  Love the design of the fabric, but that’s it."
1.0,"If you like your waist band up to the middle of your ribcage, these are the pants for you. Very uncomfortable and unflattering."
1.0,These shorts are stiff and too bulky to use as a soccer goalkeeper. Impact when you land is actually more painful than if there were no pads at all. Would not recommend for soccer - wish I could return.
1.0,I bought this set of clothes as a gift for a friend’s 2 year old. The size labeled on the set is “80 “ cm.  I mailed the gift to my friend who lives overseas. She said the set was too small for her 2 year old. I wonder if the seller shipped me the wrong size.
1.0,Runs larger and did not fit!
1.0,I purchased these sneakers in June 4th and already need a new pair. They are totally worn on the bottom souls. Very disappointed!
1.0,"I like these a lot but they arrived a little bent, twisted. They will not sit right"
1.0,Worst piece of clothing I've ever worn. Button broke after only 2 hours of use.
1.0,Terrible one day after I bought it broke
1.0,disappointed. flap will not close over cell phone
1.0,Been working from home due to the ongoing pandemic and this glass has been helping with the not-so great lighting I have
1.0,"Wrong color, I received red boots, not at all what I wanted."
1.0,It came broken and the company never contacted me back.
1.0,it’s really cute but I had to throw it out after just a few wears because of how terribly lint & anything else sticks to it. It gets ruined in just a few washes now matter how you wash & dry it and you can’t even lint roll it away.
1.0,There were two black spots on the lace in the bust area. The fit is snug and I’m not happy with this purchase.
1.0,"This item showed up with an absolutely rank smell. We tried stand oder eliminator spray with no results, now it’s just smells like flowery poop. We will move to a washing machine effort today, but I’m not confident that will work either!!"
1.0,Never got but seen a neighbor wearing them when she moved out
1.0,These were categorized under kids/baby but are far too large. They are labeled as Santa glasses when they arrived for 14+. Very disappointed.
1.0,This thing is slim but the magnet in the flap that is supposed to hold your cash and cc's is useless.  It couldn't hold a piece of paper to the fridge. That's why I bought it.  It would be much better if it was spring loaded.
1.0,Loops are not included
1.0,"Hoodie did not include rings, as shown in picture! Very disappointed."
1.0,You stick your foot in and it immediately flattens straight down to the sole. The sole is harder than concrete. This is by far the worst slipper I have ever tried on. Will be returning them today.
1.0,"Careful there, shoppers. The image on this product is a poor-quality, low resolution copy taken from the authorized vendor's web site. Even the image OF the pillow was lifted from Zazzle. Not only will you be buying stolen work, but the image is fuzzy and distorted. Please do not reward those who steal intellectual property. This is one of an large number of designs for sale on Amazon which can easily be tracked to the original at Zazzle."
1.0,String broke right when I opened it
1.0,I don’t like it at all. Looking for another
1.0,The dress looked elegant and classy in the pic. But in real life the material was cheap and trashy looking
1.0,Too big for my face as they slide over when I look down.
1.0,dont like texture.
1.0,Nada que ver al diseño de la fotografía. Venía roto y defectuoso
1.0,This blouse came ripped at the seam along the neckline.  Very cheap quality....poorly made.  Disappointed!
1.0,broke in a few days
1.0,"I was severely disappointed in this dress. The fit was a bit small, and the pockets made my hips look even wider because of the fit. Not to mention it took over two weeks to be shipped. Would not recommend unless you have a thin frame and patient for shipping."
1.0,This band for the Alta Fitbit was $30+ and does not fit or latch properly. Will return
1.0,I understand this is a $99 jacket so I wasn’t expecting true leather. But I was expecting something that would actually fit.<br /><br />I ordered a size 4xl. The jacket does not fit the measurements shown and while it looks good it is not real leather.  The arms also were cut completely wrong and felt like they were sewn on backwards. Thankfully the return process is easy.
1.0,Awful material and totally mis-sized!
1.0,Its not what im expecting
1.0,Plastic snapped on side of the goggles after 1 use.
1.0,These pants are a joke I ordered two different pair in two different sizes they both were too small and there is no way if you have any thighs hips or curs that these will fir you
1.0,No don't buy
1.0,There is only 4 ways to can orient a switch on this thing and none of them worked for my low profile gateron switches. Product feels ok but I had to return it
1.0,"TOTAL waste of money!!<br /><br />Dont even bother with these!!<br /><br />Useless. Unable to see with these--unable to see anything, at any distance. Unable to wear.<br /><br />Straight into the garbage!!  Will certainly need to be more careful with what i buy from amazon. Cant be wasting my time or money on this kind of stuff.<br /><br />Found better at the big box store outside of my town. At least there i could go through them to find something that was usable!"
1.0,"Piece of junk. Cannot push the pins out of #25 chain even though it says it is designed for just that use. The chain slips no matter if you use a vise, lock jaw, whatever. Don't buy this item. It does not work!!"
1.0,Was very cheap metal. Got for a gift and couldn’t gift it.
1.0,"Fabric Damaged from heat... :(<br />fabric is too light for dress I guess.<br />I will return it<br /><br />If you make this dress with French Terry or Baby French Terry, it will be SUPER NICE."
1.0,"they appear a lot bigger in the picture. not at all what i expected!! should’ve read the reviews first, very disappointing"
1.0,Extremely poor workmanship.  This is a flimsy metal garland affixed to a 2.5 inch diameter hunk of wood that is badly finished and about only remotely resembles a circle.  It reminds me of a middle school project.  The necklace string immediately came untied when I tried to adjust it to put it on.
1.0,I was really excited to get these shorts. A 4 pack with all the right colors and not too short not too long. I read reviews and shopped around for hours like I do with every purchase on Amazon. The reviews were great and no one really mentioned they're see through. Great if you're  wearing them under a skirt but not alone. Even put 2 pair on at once but only slightly helped. Very disappointed!!! Now I know to be careful if I ever decide to order from this company again
1.0,This item runs very large. Ordered a small as a gift and it fits more like a medium / large. Quality is good.
1.0,"Fantastic quality, but the size was very far off. I expected a cloak, not a cape."
1.0,"This dress didn't work. The cut seemed off. Waist starts off too high, fabric feels stiff and rough, sleeves are good as long as you don't raise your arms. They pull the whole dress up and puff out on the top. There's a strange wrinkle on the sides of the chest and unnecessary darts in the back that stick out. I would not recommend this dress."
1.0,The front button fell off on first use.
1.0,"I purchased a green one before this gray one. The material is way better than this one, and it’s shipped from CA. The gray piece is in different material (thinner and not cotton); also it took like a month to ship all the way from China."
1.0,"Talk about false advertising....the image on amazon shows a vibrant green clover, frog. Etc. mine arrived yesterday...the colors look like they've been washed out for several years. I am returning."
1.0,Not compatible. It doesn't fit on my Versa. Disappointed.
1.0,I love this leather. Soft. Style is beautiful BUT I’ve worn this purse for 2 Days and the strap broke off. I checked the other strap and the thread on that strap is really loose. Just poor workmanship on the straps.
1.0,Bad job on beads
1.0,Was waaaaay too small! I wear a 28 - 29 waist and ordered the medium and it was way too small!
1.0,Way too big for my phone. Not like advertized
1.0,Cheap looking.  Looks better in pictures.
1.0,"Feels cheap, very thin metal."
1.0,"No es como se ve en la foto, el mensaje ni se ve"
1.0,The small metal rods that joint the wooden pieces into a band fall out.
1.0,"The description says &#34;earring&#34;. This came up when I was specifically looking for single cartilage earrings and I thought I was buying 2 hoops but got two pair instead. Wasted $10 more dollars. Please fix your description.<br /><br />As for size, they are too big for cartilage earrings.<br /><br />As for quality, these are not CZ. No way. They are cheap plastic jewels that reflect nothing. Find something better, or better yet, save up and go to a jeweler like I plan to do.<br /><br />UPDATE: I used these earrings as place holders until I can get better earrings. I think they have been in now for going on three weeks and all the &#34;jewels&#34; have fell out."
1.0,"Bracelet turned colors, lost the gold color on all the item that were gold"
1.0,Inaccurate degrees
1.0,"does not stick, keeps falling off"
1.0,"They are extra long, but small circumference especially at biceps."
1.0,La bolsa estaba sellada pero dentro no había nada
1.0,"I ordered the poncho in red, hoping to get the exact same product as shown in the photo. The paisley prints are all an awkward color of brownish gold. No black Paisley!<br />Also, the fabric had so much statics that it is impossible to wear. Returning it!"
1.0,doesnt look like the photo at all. cheap material
1.0,size too big
1.0,"Quality of the product seems ok, but sizing is way off. It says it is manufactured in China on the description but on the tag says Bangladesh. It's one of those weird subcontinent manufacturer deals where the zipper is on the wrong side and sizing is way off. Buyer beware. 4xl fit like an 2xl. For the price I expected much better 🤷‍♂️"
1.0,"Slots are too small for regular glasses, and clips slide off."
1.0,I was super excited for this scarf to wear to Dallas Stars games. What I received however looks absolutely nothing like the product picture I thought I was ordering. Color AND pattern completely different/off.
1.0,Very thin. I  Order these a couple years ago and hit order again and unfortunately received completely different shirts then the 1st order. The 1st time they were quality and did not stretch out and now they're extremely thin and stretchy
1.0,Chain broke 2 months out.
1.0,Awful material. Hideous.
1.0,God please make your shirts out of 100% cotton.  50/50?  Yuck.
1.0,"These socks work well, They are just too small, do you  sell a larger size?<br />  I will buy them if you do. Please respond"
1.0,Honestly i couldn’t even get it in! The snake in itself is too long so you can’t maneuver the bar in. If the snake was scrunched up more it would fit going to try to squeeze it down later with pliers. Really disappointed
1.0,"I don’t understand how people have gotten this dress to fit. The torso is WAY too long, by almost 2 inches. I tried again with the size down and same thing. The top is so low and cut so narrow that your chest literally hangs out. So confused."
1.0,It was so cheap it shredded on everything.
1.0,These are not flattering at all they show ever single bump and make your butt look flat. They are also see through when you bend over or squat. I don’t know how they do at the gym I will not be wearing them to work out due to how thin they are.
1.0,Cheaply made fell apart as soon as I put it on.
1.0,bodice is very small for the rest of the dress and I'm not that well endowed. Started with a medium and then ordered a large but had the same problem. The bodice wasn't any bigger in the larger size.
1.0,Was disappointed.  Dress was too small.
1.0,The picture is misleading. These looked like a rusted copper.
1.0,"Which i guess is to be expected given the material. I wore them twice put them in my purse like I would any other sunglasses,took them out later and they were broken."
1.0,U would not recommend this product.
1.0,I read this product runs small so I ordered it 1 size bigger and it was still small. You have to order it 2 sizes up to fit your regular size.
1.0,It's not one size fit all.
1.0,Very very disappointed and dissatisfied!! The screw is coming out of the spring on the band. Jabs into my wrist and hurts
1.0,"My boyfriend bought me these masks and I liked them. He forwarded me the purchase info so I could buy more. When I recieved my order the masks were made from a different fabric than the first ones. They were black, light weight and stretchy but the fabric was a shiny knit not a true cotton like the first ones I recieved. The seams were puckered because of the fabric. It is hard for me to breath through them. I have sinus issues and this mask is going to cause discomfort in just breathing. I am so disappointed in the fabric change. I don't know what to order from this point. I realize now I won't be able to order masks online anymore because companies can change the fabrics they use."
1.0,Quality is poor. Hat feels rough to touch and came with 3 knitted caps that had a pull in one of them And were the size of a dolls head. Not a nice material/ yarn at all. Sent back
1.0,"Poorly made, size is meant for children with small heads, uncomfortable❗️"
1.0,It’s that cheap bad fabric which is not how it looks in the picture. Poorly made & the sizing is bizarre. I ordered my size & I’d say it came about 2 sizes too big. I’m returning the same day it was delivered.
1.0,the material was very heavy for a summer dress. It had a rubbery feel to it. the top was big but the waist was good.
1.0,"The watch was attractive, and it was running accurately when delivered. But within a few days it came to a dead stop. I took it to a local, experienced, jeweler who has changed watch batteries for us in the past, and also does precise jewelry repairs, but he said the screws securing the back were put in too tightly and were stripped, so the back cannot be removed and the battery (if it's the problem), cannot be replaced.<br />A very disappointing purchase!"
1.0,I was so looking forward to this but the fit was terrible and the material was cheap. I'm a small size and this was boxy.
1.0,Bottle came broken and empty :(
1.0,"I returned it.<br /><br />It fit my rather narrow feet fine, but it seemed unsuitable for barefoot dancing or karate. It felt too restrictive and like it might cause blisters around the edge."
1.0,Product Page & Label show 95% cotton. The material feels 100% Synthetic - No Cotton. I ordered because it showed cotton & seller stated cotton in Q & A. Top received with angled oblong discolored section. Didn't bother trying on.
1.0,"I wouldnt get this. It stretched out like crazy with a 38mm Victorinox auto attached (a full inch+). Ended up in the garbage bin after a few weeks.<br /><br />Nice concept, great color, and well stitched; but none of that matters since the leather was poor quality"
1.0,"Ring: 5 Stars (is a nice ring with cool carbon fiber)<br />Shipment: 3 Stars (average)<br />Seller:  -8 Stars (Inability to contact seller and fact that they can't/won't be bothered to offer a sizing guide or advice on Amazon site)<br />Overall: 1 Star (because I'm forced to give one star minimum)<br /><br />********************************************************************<br />SELLER READ THIS:  You might be selling more of these types of rings if you could assure buyers that they can get the true size.  How many people don't order because they have little faith that the ring would actually be true to size?  Assure people you can help them BEFORE they order instead of sticking it to them AFTER they buy it then maybe those that are on the fence or otherwise hesitant would maybe go ahead and order it.<br /><br />That is unless of course your stock of rings are all sized wrong and are quite random somehow in size...<br />********************************************************************<br /><br />This ring came in usual time.  All these reviews saying that it came in two days or three days must have gotten two day shipment or lives within the state the seller is in or just right down the street.  Mine came in 8 days... acceptable but by no means record time (ordered Monday and received it following Tuesday).<br /><br />I read the other reviews saying that this ring runs large in size.  I wear a size 12 as a 12 should be.  Many reviews says to get it a full size smaller.  Many other reviews says half a size smaller.  However there are some reviews that says it runs true to size ""as sized by jeweler.""  Yet still again there are some that says this ring runs small... Don't believe me?  Read through the reviews.<br /><br />This ring is an example of complete and utter breakdown of logic.  It's evidence that no one truly knows their sizes, that the jewelers out there are incompetent in sizing people, and/or the crafters of this ring are incapable of crafting rings true to size.  Logically, there should be some sort of ability to contact the seller to discuss the sizing issue.  However there is none to be found.  Logically, the seller him/herself should have been knowledgeable about this sizing confusion and should post some sort of resolute sizing standard to go by.  For example, take a damn ring in inventory and size it as it stands in the standard size measurement and let us know definitively if it's half size smaller, full size smaller, or what.<br /><br />Worst thing about this fiasco is you can't contact the seller regarding the sizing issue so you're forced to pray to God, Budha, or Sasquatch that the size you order is correct.  So now I'm either stuck with a lose fitting ring or go through the hassle of ""requesting"" the seller to OK my return/exchange of the ring ""within 48 hours"".  That's minimum 5 days for return plus 1-2 days for them to process plus another 8 days for them to mail me the new ring (which may not even be the right size...).<br /><br />Save yourself the hassle of buying and return or exchanging this seemingly randomly sized ring.  Stay away from this ring unless you<br /><br />1.) Don't mind waiting almost a month to get the right ring,<br />2.) Just like to throw money away or end up using the ring as a necklace piece (which defeats the purpose)<br />3.) Your a sadomasochist and just love annoying yourself a bit as an precursor to whatever else pain you like<br /><br />Sorry for the rant.  I get extremely agitated when 3-4 weeks of my life (ok maybe 2 hours net time) could be saved by something so simple as a disclaimer saying this runs small or whatever... which I know if they say it runs small but its actually the buyer that doesn't know his/her size then they the seller would be liable for false information which basically leaves us with the same net result I guess..."
1.0,"Purchased less then a week ago and the ball separated from the earring, so disappointing.  they were very pretty.."
1.0,these were a big disappointment.  both fell out the first day I wore them.  the Velcro strap is too 'short' so it doesn't hold tightly enough on the bra strap.  Many years ago I had a great pair of Velcro strap shoulder pads that worked well so I know it is possible.  these are also very small -- not that I want large 80's style shoulder pads but they could be 'thin' and well shaped and still be a nice size.
1.0,"Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my granddaughter.  She loved it.  However, it did not work.  Window to return has closed.  Waste of money!"
1.0,Item is smaller than expected and cheaply made. Not worth the price. Seller will not accept returns.
1.0,"This is hideous. I’m so disappointed. It’s almost shiny, and is not at all the color in the photo. I’m so bummed!"
1.0,The watch has a nice when you take them out the package but when you begin to wear them they start turning colors on you straps start to pop so I do not recommend nobody to buy these watches there are a waste of money
1.0,I got 1 to fit out of all. 🙁
1.0,One of the lenses concaved so totally unusable and I only wore them a handful of times. I would like a refund but no way to address with company.
1.0,I do not recommend this ring for anyone and has a sticker on the ring and it came off the first two days
1.0,These were MUCH larger than I expected.
1.0,The blouse came with a defect ( a long stain right by the neck) and the M which I always use  is extremely large. The material is very thin and cheap- Not what I expected and this should not cost more than $5<br />And I get so frustrated with this and having to lose my time with Returns :(
1.0,I only gave one star because I can't give a zero. Product appears small in size and dull in color. The colors showed in the description is not what I get. I will not recommend you to buy this product. Poor service!!!
1.0,"I was originally very pleased with these sandals but the thong of the toe broke after one day of wear. I have contacted the seller about a refund, but I still have not been given one."
1.0,Not as pictured.. love the old Woolrich.. this isn't even close to the shirts we've purchased in the past.. Was a few years ago but the quality has really changed.. Will not purchase again..
1.0,Not very stretchy or comfy. More like rigid and small. Not happy with this purchase at all.
1.0,The clasp broke the day after I got it!
1.0,It lasted one day before the mechanism broke.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:6cedc6928e3b61b4abbd7916b1003dd2]] So these looked like cute earrings, but a total fail on design. Earring pieces are two individual pieces-meaning they cling against each other. Everyone can hear you walking a mile away, and you have the constant noise in your ears. I removed one of the pieces, the metal stick, and wear the half circles. They’re still pretty stylish with the half circles. Rating is based on the fact that I can’t wear the originaly designed earrings... just not practical :-/"
1.0,crap
1.0,too small even I got an XL
1.0,"Buyer beware!! I ordered this belt twice... not because I liked it that much BUT because I kept getting the wrong one! 2 orders... and 2 screwups!! STILL Don’t have a belt!!<br />Ordered the oiled tan leather + cognac  (with a rustic looking buckle) and got BOTH times the milled leather 2+ pine (with a smooth and shiny buckle)!! If you don’t have an item, take it off your available times to buy!!<br />Not asking much am I??  So use your own judgement and if you’re ok with getting the wrong item twice (and will settle), then purchase on!<br />(You can see the 2 pics added... they are NOT the same belts OR buckles!!)"
1.0,fits like a bag after following the other review suggestions.  The neck is very high. Definitely returning.
1.0,"Totally disappointing, the color is not satin red like they say and, the worse thing you can't change it or return it for that I can't give any star. If I add one is because system not allow you to submit without any."
1.0,The shorts were to small. They were more like a regular size medium.
1.0,Received the product ripped.
1.0,Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!
1.0,Very disappointed that the tab had been pulled and the watch was dead--yuk...sent it back!!
1.0,Whistle is not loud
1.0,When this keychain arrived the clip was already not sitting right on the &#34;wheel&#34; part. Broke within 4 months of owning it. DISAPPOINTED.
1.0,The outfit is pretty but really small and not well made.
1.0,It's cute but doesn't stay closed.
1.0,They all came in different sizes and more then half was way to small
1.0,Posts are way too long. I hate to wear them.
1.0,"Read the reviews!!!! I sure didn't. The pants are small, cheap thin fabric, terrible print!"
1.0,Way too big for a nose ring! Pretty tho...
1.0,"This bracelet is very nice and the price can't be beat, but to my surprise the flower was broken when I opened the package:-("
1.0,"Petac steals TRexArms designs and uses cheaper materials. If you want gear to never use either save your money or buy Petac. If you plan to use the gear, instead of repeatedly buying Petac as their cheap gear falls apart, buy TRexArms and receive a quality product that holds up to use."
1.0,"I recieved this item and it didnt have the buckles to latch the overalls, making them useless. thy also fit really weird, like they are made for someone with skinny legs and a big belly. Dont waste your money"
1.0,"It came broken! Otherwise it would have been a great mask. They shipped it in a regular yellow envelope! You’d think with all these people complaining about the masks being broken that they ship it in a small box. Very disappointed, as we needed the mask for a party tomorrow."
1.0,These tights came with a run in them already - right along the seam. Very disappointing - they seem great otherwise but to come already falling apart is no good. They also seem to run small. Got a 4-5 size for my 3 year old who is average for her age and they just barely fit.
1.0,"This shirt is very cute, but extremely small... And isn't nearly as long as in the pic... I will not be able to wear it. Hopefully my daughter likes it n it will fit her."
1.0,I think these are really pretty but they keep falling off. I use both of the correct tools to put them on and they just won't stay after a few days. I've worn dermals for over ten years and this never happened. I'm quite disappointed.
1.0,Turned black almost immediately. Only wore once..
1.0,I ordered a large  for a medium hand and it was still too small.  Didn't like the zipper either.
1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS
1.0,"Small fit (go up a size), the stripes across the butt and legs don’t line up, so it looked weird"
1.0,Definitely not what I expected.
1.0,terrible
1.0,Didn't fit anywhere on me
1.0,Dress was cute but sleeves were extremely tight and uncomfortable
1.0,Do not buy these wings.. it is not how it looks in the description. They were bend and low quality not even worth 22$.  When you return it you have to pay for shipping for usps!
1.0,"Fabric, although double layer, is very thin and see through. Runs true to size."
1.0,"This skirt is at least two inches shorter than advertised.  Also, I ordered it in black.  The fabric looks like it’s been washed several times. Not what I expect from from Fresh Produce. Thumbs down!"
1.0,"not what i expected at all , i thought it would be a decent quality pendant. But nope. so i gave it to my lil cousin to have."
1.0,This is nothing like what I received.  The item I received had a strange flap in the front.  Not as pictured.
1.0,Way to small waste of money
1.0,What I received was not the dress pictured... and the lace already has snags in it and I never tried it on. This is not the dress pictured! The lace looks very cheap and it’s Hangs way to long. The picture shows a different top. See my pics to see the difference. The lace is so cheap it feels like gauze. It’s a sad amazon fail. (I took a pic with a water bottle to show size and length of lace.)
1.0,Beautiful chain but unfortunately it broke two months after wearing everyday. Sad face
1.0,Worst!! Don’t waste your money!!
1.0,Very flimsy and cheap looking. Not at all what I thought it would be.
1.0,Anyone who buys this hat is a complete loser
1.0,Very cheap material. And the skirt looked more brown than black. I returned it.
1.0,Crappy polyester fabric snags and runs like an old pair of nylons. Looked like junk after one wear. Do not buy.
1.0,This toy worked a couple of times then stopped working completely.
1.0,Este artículo no llegó a mi buzón
1.0,REALLY IS A very low quality itself looks cheap
1.0,Was a terrible fit was I very disappointed. It would have to be taken apart and remade to fit.
1.0,"These gators were supposed to serve as a face mask for my small 2yr old, who has sensory issues and cannot stand to have elastic on or around his ears/head. Unfortunately, they were too small and too thin to be effective. I will be returning."
1.0,The gems fall out easy and the whole front part falls out too. Wouldn't recommend. I couldn't even get a replacement
1.0,to small for there little heads
1.0,It was very small. I thought it would be bigger
1.0,"Too thick, not comfortable, fogs up, etc.  We have a child that can be hard to understand so we thought it would be helpful to read his lips at school too.  Great in theory, doesn't work at all in practice.  Just super uncomfortable masks."
1.0,I wore the black studs once and one of the crystals fell out.
1.0,Threw it away after wearing it once. It was way too small as well as way too tight. Wish I could honestly get my money back this was really a waste next time I’m going to Zara or buying it from ASOS
1.0,"They aren’t #4, not clear viewing...will return."
1.0,"This ring was broken when I received it. Thin, cheap, light weight and definitely NOT silver. Aluminum at best. No way this would have lasted more that one wear even if it wasn't already broken. The band was already cracked when I took it out of the package. Don't waste your money. Returned."
1.0,"I got medium for both colors.  They have the same label inside and the same code number, just one is blue and one is pink.  The pink one is much bigger all over, and also much longer through the chest (hangs well past my hips).  The blue one seems like a normal medium and the length is what I expected from the picture.  I don't plan to order this brand again.  I tried getting a similar Amazon Goodthreads shirt, and it is much nicer (material, quality, buttons, sewing all better).  Spend $2 more and get better value."
1.0,too narrow at the heel - a size 8 foot cannot pass through....
1.0,The product was too small but it looks just like the picture. Just be aware that the sizes do run small.
1.0,"This was so pretty - unfortunately, it broke as soon as I put it on. Very cheaply made. I’ve never had a necklace break as this one had and I’m bummed."
1.0,way to small and is made cheaper than it appears in photograph.
1.0,"I ordered this for hiking in winter. The materials feel ok, but the size is way off...I'd recommend ordering one size down."
1.0,One lens is way higher than the other. And it’s screwed in higher so it can’t be fixed. Too bad. I was super excited to get these. They were cute!
1.0,It broke in under one day.
1.0,"My favorite hat for a while has been an Olive/Khaki version of this hat with a brewery logo on it I purchased about 4 years ago.  When I found these on Amazon, I was excited, as it's the best fitting hat I've ever had.  I ordered the Charcoal/Black version that I was going to put my own patch on.  Fits great, but I'm returning it.  See the picture in my review.  I understand the ""dirty-washed"" concept, but why does it look like someone took bleach to the front of the hat?  It looks horrible!  To the manufacturer:  I love these hats!  How do I get one that is actually Charcoal/Black?"
1.0,The chest/shoulders ran big. Did not fit as shown in the pictures. The pictures make the dress look flowy and soft. The dress I received was still and uncomfortable. Only 2 snap buttons hold it closed. If even one button comes loose the dress will fly open. The dress comes from China so returning it has been a huge expensive hassle. Overall I do not recommend this dress. I am 5’5” and between 115-119 pounds and ordered a 4. I wear a size 34-36B and the chest on this dress was huge. I ultimately decided to return it and just wait a long time for the company to refund me because I wasn’t going to pay a ton of money to get it altered.
1.0,Don’t waste your $$$!
1.0,I only used them for less that 3hrs one ripped at wedding party. very embarrassing  now I can not return them wedding was Sunday<br />Sept 4th and last day to return it was Sept 2nd
1.0,VERY cheap looking
1.0,Description says cotton blend. There's actually no cotton. Material is cheap like stretchy costume material.
1.0,The shape was weird  and I thought the lining would be separate but it's sewn in.
1.0,Too small I had to give it to my son
1.0,"Well, it was too good to be true. The frames were cute but the lenses were not strong enough to help with my eyesight. (And my last pair was a lower strength.) Not convinced they block blue light either. Save your money."
1.0,I ordered a 3 XL and at best the shirt is a large
1.0,I sure hope the seller knows that Kabbalah bracelets are red and the color isn't optional
1.0,Absolutely was not impressed. Whole dress is 100% see through even with the protective layer in there. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Fit was fine but Pom poms were crushed in the packaging and one of the tags on hat was sewn upside down.  Would have like to exchange but item is now out of stock.
1.0,The band broke within the first day. Not worth your money
1.0,Just slide up and looks like underwear lining. Total ripoff.
1.0,Super disappointed! I ordered this item in pink and it is so big it fits my head. This is not made for a 6 month old child.
1.0,Very disappointed.  Size was way off. Runs very small.
1.0,"Huge fan of the brand; and it's a cool looking bag, but straps broke off the bag after about 6 months of daily use carrying one pair of sneaker, gym gear, toiletries, and a meal. Had used a competitor athletic brand that cost half the price which is a little beat up but have used it for years may go back to that.  not a good look for Nike Air Jordan. Very dissapointed."
1.0,"My daughter snags her post earrings sometimes and I thought these would be great! Unfortunately, the post is pretty thick and I can't get it in her ear. I even tried to put them in mine, and couldn't get them to fit! Would have been a great product if they fit your standard pierced ears."
1.0,wore it and it broke about an hour after wearing it. disappointed
1.0,Just a regular mask. Not worth the money.
1.0,Was very shiny then it turned yellow!
1.0,"I hated the material, super cheap feeling and looks low quality. The armpit holes go way too low making it fit really awkward at the chest and impossible to lift your arms without the dress lifting way up. I’m really annoyed I could not return this because I missed the return window by one day."
1.0,"While they are pretty, these are not sterling silver.  Maybe sterling plated? They do not pass the magnet test."
1.0,Way toooooo small for my average 14 year old daughter's head.  :(
1.0,Beautiful pants but way to small I wear an Xlg & that’s what I ordered  when getting them I was on vacation when I got home & by the time I tried them on  they only wouldn’t go  the whole way up. China clothes are completely run different than USA.<br />You asked my opinion & here it is
1.0,"Extra large.  Absolutely sending this back.  Too small, if you have full size breast forger it."
1.0,the backing on this broke the moment I tried to put it on
1.0,"The fabric is much different from pictured it’s like a faux silk, and it hangs limply creating a very different look from the picture."
1.0,"THIS IS A FLIMSY, VERY THIN SEE THRU SET OF BAGS. THERE IS NO WAY THEY COULD HOLD 50 LBS. AND THE BAGS ARE NOT THAT BIG."
1.0,Returned these after getting them. Poor quality.
1.0,The chain broke.
1.0,It's too small for a 2 PC 10' rod and I don't believe that was called out in the description so for me it was a waste of money...
1.0,"Yet another disappointing purchase....this is NOT the cute jersey knit dress you are deceived into buying. Fabric is cheap, print is awful and quality highly questionable. Another typical example of a poorly made product Made in China!"
1.0,Nose screw was bent upon arrival. Real titanium  shouldn’t bend that easily. I wouldn’t recommend this product as it isn’t solid titanium.
1.0,"Asian sizing, 2XL fits a child."
1.0,So small they are a joke.
1.0,"Im a watch fan...I saw a lot of reviews of this vostok automatic watches...thats why I decided to buy it, but, you get what you paid.  The quality is more than low...Im talking outside, since the mechanical works well and have good reputation, the case is shiny, ugly numbers and the cover is plastic..I really dont like it...I change the strap trying to update it but.. I really dont like it..im not going to use it..stored.  If you want an automatic affordable watch, buy a seiko...they are nice, best quality and the mechanical also is really good."
1.0,I was seriously disappointed in this swim suit. I ordered based off the sizes and the recommendations from other shoppers. The top was huge and the bottoms small. There's also barely any support in the top. I'm very disappointed as I will not be able to wear this at all.
1.0,Bought for 8 year old autistic grandsons tennis shoes and they are too small.
1.0,Jacket is super cute it just runs a bit small. I’m an 18/20 and I bought the 3x jacket. It was tight through my hips and would ride up because of the waistband. I’m returning it.
1.0,Cheaply made and small.
1.0,These sunglasses are terrible. I took them out of the case and both lenses popped out. Seriously!? Don't buy! Don't buy! Don't buy!
1.0,"For the price, it's not bad. The winder functionality is pretty decent. Only time will tell how well it performs. The finish is pretty good.<br /><br />Gripes<br />- The slots are pretty small, if you own primarily big watches (bigger than 44mm) don't buy.<br />- The dividers are movable, providing a cheap fit and finish.<br />- The band inserts are only 2 sizes, so if your wrist is too small your outta luck.<br />- if you can get away with the small ones you're going to notice poor fitment, especially in the winders and the watch will move about.<br /><br />Overall if you like big watches or you have big/litte wrists I would avoid this unit.<br /><br />Most of my watches are 40-43mm and I have 6.75” wrists.<br /><br />***UPDATE 01/12/2020***<br />The right side has stopped working altogether and the left side won’t stop winding and makes a loud annoying humming sound."
1.0,Runs small...made in China
1.0,The material is awful and scratchy. These are cheaply made. Do not buy.
1.0,U have to be very gentle the link is weak
1.0,"Very dull and it turns my finger black, always. Very disappointed . No star's"
1.0,"Doesn't provide much hold & there's a seriously tight band around the upper thigh area, so so much tighter than the rest of the item.  Actually was abrasive to my skin."
1.0,Torso super long
1.0,These were very small.
1.0,Way too small. Says one size fits all. That is true if you wear a size six or smaller. The quality was also very bad. The stitching was already unraveling. Very low quality
1.0,Broke in two pieces the first time I used it.
1.0,Did not care for this product fit too loose. Sizing was off.
1.0,"this is a cheap knock off of a beautiful ring. the blue is absolutely wrong, the design doesn’t wrap around the way it’s shown in the picture and the gemstone has a space where you can see it was glued on. it’s costume jewelry x10"
1.0,"It’s a shame because the ring is so pretty, but it broke in a couple of weeks. The bottom part broke off the post. At least it wasn’t terribly expensive.  Do not recommend."
1.0,It was so short waisted it looked empire and was permanently wrinkled. Cheap fabric. Returned.
1.0,I would not recommend purchasing this item.  It was cheaply made.  I used it less than 5 times and the long strap broke where the leather is sewn and the seams were splitting.  I did not have heavy items in the bag at all.  It is just not made well.
1.0,"This is not all leather; the twisted pieces seen clearly in the photos are made of a fiberous material, thick string? I wore these for three days and on the fourth the black band just fell apart. Note the photo all the loose ends wrapped together at the ends by tying them together; that doesn't last long. Fortunatley for me they are cheap. Also worth noting these come from asia; so plan ahead for a month wait in transit."
1.0,"Color is nothing like what's pictured, it's a very bright teal :( returned it"
1.0,Reordered. Nice quality.
1.0,"It was thin, tiny and hard to wear."
1.0,"The seams are very thin and either the thread breaks or the fabric tears from tension on the seams. The label and pants both said it was my size, but they barely fit; and had no give at all!"
1.0,"Ok, if they're strictly for play. The first time I only wore two of the bracelets together and it turned my arm green. I like them, they're really cute. I only use the thin gold one and the one with the charms though. I have very small wrist and the little &#34;pearl&#34; one cuts of my circulation."
1.0,"I loved them when I seen them, they felt like quality and I was thrilled , until I was walking in the airport and started to notice how they were flopping  around on my feet, it was too late I was stuck with only them and they made my feet hurt because I was trying to hold them on .  Too long of a toe thong !!"
1.0,Warning- it's a beautiful outfit but poorly made. It was not too small for my daughter but she wore it one day and stitching came loose at wristband and wasteband- total waste of money- I have a brand new outfit with 2 large holes in it
1.0,The ring turned my daughter's finger green on the first day she wore it.  Free would be overpriced for this.
1.0,First no instructions included.  Four batteries come with it - you assume you need to put these in so it works.  Had to check<br />internet to find some type of instructions - then had to send e-mail to company.  Not worth the hassle
1.0,"Product was made poorly they did not pat attention where the clip was place. Now i can not use the shield, and that is the reason i brought this product"
1.0,"Sadly this item did not meet my expectations. By trying to save fabric/pennies they ruined the dress. The front of the dress shows only the tops of some cottages while the back of the dress shows Santa and sleigh obscured by the giant bow! I will be returning this product, not at all the quality iI have experienced from AMAZON."
1.0,"These colors are ugly, the blue tank I ordered is extremely blue and it’s just awful. The material feels cheap and synthetic as well. I wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,BELIEVE THE REVIEWS ABOUT CAT BUTT.<br /><br />These were a huge mistake. Returned them immediately.
1.0,Dirty used ugg boots
1.0,"The watch looks great, But that's about it. Very cheap and it didn't last very long with me. The pins kept falling out and the watch would fall off randomly. Lameeee"
1.0,This shoe was not a high heel as described.  It was a flat.  The bow was also different than as pictured.
1.0,Very plastic feeling. Love the color but not the feel.
1.0,Way too small.<br />I’m a 40C and I these were extremely tight around my arms and chest. I’m 5’3 and 190-205llbs.
1.0,Item not as described. Purchased for my niece and nephew. HAT IS NOT WATERPROOF/NOT WATER-RESISTANT...not even a plastic material.  WATER SEEPS INTO GOGGLES DO NOT PURCHASE!
1.0,Was not happy at all...There was glue residue all over the shoes. Very cheaply made. Not happy at all with purchase
1.0,"Not of good quality, will probably give it to good will"
1.0,"I really liked this when it arrived. Since purchase date (30 days) zippers have fallen apart, bag is useless."
1.0,Huge. But I do have a tiny face so I looked like a bug. But very cute if you have the face shape for it
1.0,"After 1 year of intermittent use, my daughter had it on today and it began screeching like a smoke detector. We got it off her and couldn’t get it to stop. It got very warm and smelled like burning plastic. My husband hit it with a hammer and broke it into pieces. The back plate had a scorch mark. This thing could have caught in fire strapped to my daughter’s wrist."
1.0,"Not properly made, not as picture don't waste your money."
1.0,"I'm very tiny. 5'6, 118 lbs. I have a 25&#34; waist, and small bust so I ordered this in a small. It's a little loose and looks strange on me. I also expected the material to be softer and smoother, like more cotton-textured but it's a weird scarf-like material."
1.0,"This watch cannot be worn regularly; the sweat from your arm/wrist steams it up. Also, it does NOT auto rewind. OK if you want a nice-looking watch for occasional short term use in the evening as a dress watch. Best to buy a better watch."
1.0,no manual
1.0,"Waaaay too small. I thought they were pretty true to size via comments, but nooooo they are not I wear xl, ordered xl and there is just no way. maybe a medium person could wear them"
1.0,Not true to size. Runs extremely small.
1.0,One of them break after wearing it once
1.0,Had to return my product because it arrived with blue pen marks on the outside as well as inside.
1.0,"Didn’t even get the right hat.  Not only were there not these hats in there, there was one hat and it was a chauffeur driving hat.  Looks like someone’s costume. Horrible horrible horrible."
1.0,I ordered it in my normal size but it was way too small.
1.0,Order 2 times and broke
1.0,Pants run big
1.0,Definitely not over the knee length and the quality is just terrible.
1.0,"Much cheaper design then what is shown online. Doesn't even resemble item. Nothing magnetic about it, as I tested it. This item is not returnable."
1.0,My bracelet came with the image upside down. This was so disappointing. It would be cute if the image was upright. It says on their page that each piece of jewelry is inspected because they care about the quality...who checked this bracelet?
1.0,VERY DUSTY AND FUR BAD QUALITY I HAD TO THROW AWAY PLEASE  DONT CHEAT WITH THE PEOPLE  WHAT QUALITY YOU SHOW ON THE NET AND WHAT YOU SEND ?
1.0,The dress is not a regular 3x the dress is to small
1.0,It broke the first time I wore it :(
1.0,"Wrong Color. Not true to size, 3X Too small.<br />Returning is not an easy process."
1.0,"Bought a couple of these in different colors, they are such thin material they ripped as I was putting on"
1.0,"Not what we were expecting, very thin, light weight, definitely will not recommend<br />Save your money!"
1.0,"The measurements listed don’t match what I expected to get. Normally an 18, sometimes 20 so the 2xl should have fit. Definitely more like a size 14."
1.0,This bra was not true to size at all. It was at least a few sizes too small in its fit.
1.0,"The product came in pieces, I wrote the seller for a replacement and I have to take time out of my day to mail back a broken tiny septum ring… dumb"
1.0,To big and wasn't same thing on line.6
1.0,"Fit ok, however, as stated in other reviews, sleeves are long. A plus for me, however,  fabric is SO THIN, way too thin for Michigan winters! It will be going back!"
1.0,I thought this was going to be a big oversized shirt but it was not however nicely made but not the look I was thinking.
1.0,Cute fabric. Very tight fit. I even ordered a size larger which should have been loose/baggy but it was still very tight. Recommend getting 4 sizes larger (ie-get a 14 instead of a 10) for a true fir
1.0,"Fits okay, but scratched soooooo easily. One touch and it's ruined. I also ended up returning my Ionic because the pedometer wouldn't work, and the Bluetooth only worked withing a food of my headphones. Also, doesn't do all that much. You cant respond or answer calls so it's just a glorified watch. Plus to install any music you have to have a Bluetooth connector you buy separate."
1.0,"Upset<br /><br />10 of them came welded shut! I ordered clips charms , not rings!<br />They are very pretty but unable to open, so useless for my need."
1.0,"Don’t be fooled by this deal. This is the same dress that the bridesmaids are wearing in my sister’s wedding that sells for $140 on the “Mumu” site. We thought this was a crazy deal for $40 so ordered one to make sure it was the same quality. Well, it was NOT THE SAME DRESS! It was a completely different dress, different material, and different color. I was able to easily return this dress but was so disappointed. The dress took two months to get here (ordered it in December and received it in February.) We’ll be ordering from the actual site from now on."
1.0,"I am an Amazon prime user, many times over. Purchased this shirt and didn’t like it (purchased a few sizes bigger for an oversized fit and it was just long and tight, odd fit). Returned the shirt and they just emailed me saying they never received it and I have been charged again for the item. So I just paid $28 for a shirt that I sent back over a month ago. Not happy."
1.0,Not the same at all as in picture
1.0,This is not the quality it appears to be in the photo on Amazon. The blue color is lighter and the O and the L are smaller than the other letters and the polish finish is not nearly as nice. The metal is actually kind of rough on the surface.
1.0,"It looks more like Pajamas, rather than sports attire. Material is soft but feels cheap , will not order again from this company. The price I paid for this I could of gotten a name brand like Puma or Calvin Klein"
1.0,"I am so disappointed with these PJs!!! There cheaply made! I paid good price for basically cheap pjs! The hem is coming apart . They are so small. It said 6 .., the 6 is like a 4! The 8 is like a 6! I will never do business with this company again. Very disappointed!!!!"
1.0,Fits like a sparkly potato sack and several sequins fell off while I was trying it on.
1.0,"As far as the color, fit, feel... This product was what I expected. However, the visibility of ones underwear is very clear and obvious and is NOT as advertised.<br />Unless you want to wear these around the house, I do NOT suggest getting them for public workout usage."
1.0,"Cute anklet but turned brown/rusty after one jump in a pool, then turned ankle green"
1.0,Ring Broke just removing from the Little box. Hopefully buyers in the future do not have the same problem.
1.0,Broke after a few days of wearing it. I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,Esta bonito pero igual que otras beses no mandaron la talla q ordene
1.0,"The dress fit beautifully. Very flattering. Size small. The color is a pretty shade of navy blue. The dress is thin and lined. You can not see through it. Unfortunately, it is not the dress that is pictured. The arms are not slightly full and the dress is not sequined. There are small silver metallic threads that run through the dress almost like tinsel at Christmas. I returned the dress. ☹️"
1.0,Way smaller and thinner than I thought.
1.0,Cheap af
1.0,Just use one time
1.0,Did not fit with my thick lenses
1.0,Not well made broke after 2 days
1.0,The print is not lace. Comfortable fit but not expensive looking.
1.0,Way too small.  The button didn’t even fit through the hole and definitely not the design that is showed in  the picture. Disappointed to say the least
1.0,Not impressed at all. Very cheaply made. I sent it back.
1.0,These boots 🥾 are for children feet not adults 👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿
1.0,Massive! I ordered a small and received an XL (see photo.) Super disappointing. Material is clingy and probably won’t wash well. Won’t purchase again.
1.0,"corrodes and discolors, nice design but the coating must have some defect..."
1.0,Husband wears L. Needed XXL to fit.
1.0,The glasses look good but the earpieces have already broken off. I had to glue them back together.
1.0,Not the baggy appearance the photo shows
1.0,Inconsistent sizing. Runs very small.
1.0,The glove looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,Fraud and waste of money!!!! Don't order!!!! you can't even open the ring to wear it
1.0,It was so lite that it will not keep you warm.
1.0,"These are sized for a much smaller culture. I am consistently a size large 30-31” waist and sometimes size up or down, but the xxl in these shorts didn’t even go over my legs."
1.0,DONT BUY THIS ITEM!  I wish I had read reviews.  NO buckle just a faint stamp that doesn't even look like buckle.  Toes do not curl.
1.0,I had this on my keys for a total of one day before the decal popped right off and just left me with a circle of sticky silver. I would not buy again.
1.0,"Don't Bother! what a piece of Junk!  it was a gift, and what junk, worn twice and the 2nd time wearing it, the chain broke and literary  the pearl came off of the chain. I have found very pieces of Jewelry On Amazon worth the money."
1.0,"WARNING: I bought one of these years ago and it looked just like the picture. I lost that one recently and bought it again to replace it, and received the one pictured that doesn’t have nearly the detail of the original. I sent that back thinking it might have been a bad one, and the replacement of as the same without the detail."
1.0,Cheap and Waste Of Time n Money!!!
1.0,Paint job was messy. Doesn’t look like what I ordered & received it broken
1.0,The product images used are of FETISH FANTASY but this seller is claiming it it of their brand. Do not trust them they are just resellers. Yu can find the real product on google.
1.0,What I received was a different item and it is so frustrating!
1.0,"Wish there was more space and a better way to tighten. Maybe they could make more size options. Asian size, US size and large US size."
1.0,Cheaply made and looks like crap
1.0,"Awful quality, did not look like picture at all. Very cheap material. I returned it."
1.0,"So cute but, had to return there was a hole in the top."
1.0,"Length ok, but instep way to big.  They practically fall off my feet. Very uncomfortable."
1.0,"Smaller than I expected<br />And the color is WAY different from the one pictured<br />Also this isn't sweater material as it's represented,it's more of a spandex material<br /><br />Overall pretty disappointing"
1.0,Horrible material. A blogger promoted this and I purchased. Very baggy and loose with poor quality.
1.0,Ok.  Not too keen  on material used
1.0,It hurt my nipples and was super tight!
1.0,"Ordered up and still doesn’t fit right. It’s way to short in the torso, and I’m a small person."
1.0,Looked great in pictures. When it got to me it looked cheaply made and like it should be a child's purse. Returned immediately.
1.0,"When ordering these, I found my order from last year, clicked on the item and was taken to these shorts. I ordered 2. to They are listed as 100% cotton; they are not. Also, they are not the same measurements as the shorts that I ordered last year. The inseam is longer & the leg opening is larger. I liked the shorts from last year, but am going to return these. They are not what I thought I was getting AND I don’t like deceptive advertising!"
1.0,Didn’t like the material and the reflector strip on the front of the jacket. Reflector strip is grey and it looks white on the listing.
1.0,"I bought this only for the top, so I went with a small. I'm 5 foot, and weigh 90 lbs. I tried on the bottoms, and started laughing about how ridiculously small they are. If you are wanting the bottoms, DO NOT buy a small unless you are a child. I'm a small frame, and I don't even think a medium bottom would fit me well.<br />However, the top is great, comfy, and super adjustable.<br />But, this deserves a one star, because as a whole the product is not usable in size small."
1.0,"I ordered this 2-piece top and skirt in a medium. Because it was a gift, it wasn't tried on right away. The recipient is slender, and it was even too tight for her. Apparently the size tag is correct and seemed more like an extra small."
1.0,"These look so cool & my boys were thrilled to receive them as a gift when I was remarried, but they aren't durable at all. I barely let them touch their watches because they are young and I hoped they'd last, but even just handling them in the living room, one watch came loose inside its shell and the winding tip fell off!!! He is so sad and I'm bummed that this special memento is completely unusable. I wouldn't recommend. :("
1.0,The quality of the charm we actually received was very poor. The stone is off kilter and the writing in it that is supposed to say police box is so sloppy and faint it looks like hieroglyphics. One side is actually cracked and we were originally supposed to get it before Christmas. The arrival date was &#34;mysteriously&#34; changed. I'll never buy from this seller again.
1.0,Quality was not up to par - returning
1.0,The watch is cheap plastic and the sound is terrible.  Definitely NOT worth $40.  Massive rip off for fans.  Do NOT buy
1.0,It arrived broken for me too like other folks who reviewed this watch.  Very disappointing!!  There was no clasp to close the watch so it was useless. It is a very cute/pretty watch but I would not recommend buying it.  Again very disappointing.
1.0,"I ordered the size just as instructed in a 'small.'  This is not unusual because I wear a small in tops and dresses.  When I tried on the bra, it was xxxs - think pre-teen t-shirt bra.  The bra did not fit at all.  I hooked the last latch and it was a tight fit.  After wearing for 10 mins, the front of the bra started riding up and before I knew it, the bottom of the bra had ridden up to my chest/heart area.  I wrote to the seller several times requesting guidance for sizing and returning/exchanging the bra and this was their response ""You are welcome to purchase any available item at any time.""  Seems the seller is not interested in assisting.  Very disappointed with the product and the seller.  I wasted my money.  Looks like I will be donating this bra to goodwill."
1.0,The item that arrived looked nothing like this and more closely resembled part of a bad Halloween costume. Same cheap material and not even hemmed. Really???
1.0,Did NOT like. Pic looks like patina colored beads but in actuality it's all kind of baby blue colored. And all beads look same. Very disappointed
1.0,"It was cheap, so, I just got over it. lol. It is VERY cheap. It must have gotten moisture inside the package before I received it and caused it to fade out I think. I am not sure, but, you can see it glow A VERY LITTLE. And, ALL around the edges. it is almost rotted away."
1.0,Very cheap leave it where it is.
1.0,This was my first clothing purchase from Amazon.  It's looks great on the model but it's very thin.  I was expecting a little more substance to the fabric.
1.0,Charm fell off before.even taking out
1.0,"They fit the length of my feet but not the width. The sole feels hard, not comfortable."
1.0,"these pants literally ripped as i put them on. correct size, didn’t even struggle but they ripped immediately. the ones that didn’t were super see through and they suck if you try to run in them, i literally almost lost my pants"
1.0,DO NOT BUY! Very cheaply made and aren’t attached properly. Fell off as soon as soon as they were removed from the bag. Don’t waste your money!!
1.0,The metal is cheap and will leave your ear hole discolored. Low quality earring
1.0,I purchased a size 2x and it's more like a Medium.  No where near the size.
1.0,Cute purse but the strap broke in less than 2 weeks. Save your money and buy something of higher quality. Very disappointing - I should have believed the other reviews about the cheap straps.
1.0,Does not fit as expect!  I should have done my research. Being a &#34;busty&#34; women is really hard to buy a bra online sometimes.
1.0,"You're better off not buying this dress. Looks  goregous in the photo, but in person it's cheap, crap quality."
1.0,"DONT WASTE MONEY, left in freezer 5 days, stayed cold 20 min. More like; ""UNCONTROLLABLE let down"". Would have returned 5 days after arrival 1hour outta freezer if wouldn't had thrown away box, lol 🤣😂😅."
1.0,The sweater fits weird. I’m a 5’4 145 pound woman and it fits kind of snug and this is a men’s jacket…I was disappointed tbh. Wish I would’ve bought from somewhere else. It’s just not flattering
1.0,"Came in fast, looks super cute BUT. It was larger than 16g so I couldn’t use it in my helix piercing. Which bummed me out because now I can use it. Kinda disappointed."
1.0,Looks cheap. Not flattering at all will be returning
1.0,"These adjust for height, but they don't stay where you put them.  As you move they slide until they're at the maximum length.  I've stopped wearing them after less than a week."
1.0,Do not buy! While it looks great it faded within days! So disappointing because the print did look great out of the packaging. Will be returning.
1.0,The colouring and details of the shirt are much more grainy than in the picture and washed out. The material is some sort of nylon; I was expecting more of a cotton material as that is what the picture looks like.
1.0,"Way too small! I bought large, no way will it fit!"
1.0,This is a cheap piece of crap.
1.0,Too small I’m usually an L / XL I ordered an XXL and it’s short and small 😕
1.0,"Purchased these with caution because they were reasonably priced…..you get what you pay for.  Material is very stiff, they run small.  After on wash, cold water, they shrunk immensely.  I will be donating these to Goodwill…..."
1.0,These are probably the worst workout pants I have ever bought.
1.0,"No way you can see or breathe in this thing, didn't fit right. I would so get my money back on this if I could. It should be listed as a possible chocking hazard or suffocating hazzrd. A waste of time and money ❎❎❎"
1.0,The picture on the belt buckle is cool but the quality is terrible!!!<br /> I only got to wear this one time before the ball that goes in to the hole on the belt for sizing just snapped off.<br />I'm going to attempt to solder or tack weld it back on but this should NOT have happened after using the belt buckle just one time!!!😡😠🤬
1.0,This did not live up to the reviews I read prior to ordering. They help on cloudy days but there is no discernible difference at night.
1.0,"Picture is not in the middle , too small"
1.0,Not like the picture. Made poorly.
1.0,Received with holes in the crutch. Poor Quality
1.0,Broken within the first month
1.0,All of theb card slots go to the very bottom of the wallet.  There should be a seem under each slot so your cards cant slide down. very poor
1.0,This was fake all it was was painted glass. Doesn't deserve even one star. Looked nothing like the picture shown.
1.0,"I didn't even get it out of the bag. I unzipped the bag, saw, felt the material and zipped it right back up."
1.0,some kind of Scam! It said &#34;Size:(app)157x72cm/ 61.8inchx28.3inch&#34;  but it's really tiny scarf!!!  This time you get less what you pay for.  Now what am I going to do with this handkerchief?!
1.0,Fabric is good but size chart not at all.
1.0,This is NOT the ring shown that I purchased. It doesn't have the double layer of silver and gold. It doesn't have the engraving. It doesn't have the extra row of gems on each side. It's incredibly cheap feeling (I wasn't expecting a fancy ring...but was expecting it to be better than a quarter machine). I will be requesting a refund.
1.0,I thought the sunglasses was supposed to be flexible and would not break if bent. It did not take long to break. Cheap materials I guess.  Don't buy this junk product.  I don't know if I can get a refund but I will try.
1.0,This “sweatshirt” is all fashion and NO comfort. ☹️
1.0,"I normally wear size 11 but purchased size 12 just to be on the safe side and still, the sandals were too small across my feet. I tried to send them back, but it cost over $13 (paid approx. $27 for sandals) for shipping, because the seller wouldn't cover the cost, so I decided it doesn't worth it. So here I am, stuck with a pair of sandals I will never wear."
1.0,Según la descripción de Amazon estas correas le deberían de servir a el reloj Amazfit modelo GTS 2 Mini y cuando me llego el pedido a mi pais de origen Venezuela y se las iba a poner al reloj la sorpresa es que son grandes. Estoy en espera de una respuesta por parte del vendedor.
1.0,$142 for a watch band ??
1.0,It was to have a shelf bra and it doesnt . Rip off!!
1.0,Wayyyy smaller than the size indicated.
1.0,THE STONES CAME OUT ON THE FIRST WEARING
1.0,"This Item is very poor quality, I got X-Large the jacket was more like a medium (not true to size) the jacket is not what it looks like in the picture the edges were raw it was very thin supposed to be warm and fuzzy is not, I purchased 3 of them on sale only got one, now they are much higher"
1.0,It is listed as women's jean shorts got them in today and they are little girl size and I needed them for a gift for Monday so they are not going to work I am really upset by this.
1.0,Broke while trying to put on the ear. Cheap.But cool.
1.0,Black and white was really BLUE!! Do you have BLACK & WHITE OR NOT? Bought again still blue it’s not a mistake THEY DON’T HAVE BLACK & WHITE PERIOD
1.0,This is an incredibly cheap shirt. The fabric is printed not a woven sweatshirt. Would not recommend.
1.0,Not like the picture at all! Terrible. Do not waste your money.
1.0,bad quality and very small
1.0,Returned because the hat had an odd fit.
1.0,"I don't know what measurement scale this company uses but it's not you normal bra size. I'm normally a 32C and the bra that came looked like it was made for an A cup. It did not add two cup sizes, it actually made my boobs look smaller. Don't waste your time on getting this product, because you will have to return it."
1.0,I would not recommend these sport bras at all. The band rolls up and very uncomfortable.  You will be fixing the bra every 5 minutes.
1.0,It kinks too easily. Not what I expected.
1.0,Very cheap and yellow!!!
1.0,The backing does not stay on.
1.0,"I have not used this cream before, so I don't know whether I got a bad jar, or whether this is a bad product. It is very dry and sticky, very hard to apply to the boots. I grew up riding horses, so have spent a lot of time cleaning, polishing, conditioning leather boots. This stuff is a mess. It does not rub in. It leaves small lumps all over. Now that it has dried, I'm supposed to brush off the excess and buff, but the lumps and excess cream will not be moved by any means. It has formed a hard coating like paint, which cracks where the boots bend, and flakes off. My boots are overly-shiny where they don't bend, and look like they have mange where they do bend. Honestly, I'm about to take my dogs for a long walk in a wet meadow, and hope it just all comes off. Save your money: do not buy!"
1.0,I've had this watch band less than 2 weeks and the buckle fell apart. I should have paid attention to other reviews.
1.0,"Not impressed at all! The shirt had a weird fit, very thick material and was way too big!"
1.0,Bought this shirt for $30.00.  It was super small as Nike shirts run big. This horrible seller knocked me for a $27.50 restocking fee! For real? Get this piece of garbage off of Amazon.
1.0,Size large fits more like a medium. Very small arms and pockets were different sizes. Couldn’t even fit my hand in one of them. Poor quality.
1.0,You get what you pay for. Too flimsy frame. Bends easily if you don't handle it with utmost care.
1.0,Came with the bow already sheared off. Returning.
1.0,I ordered this as “pink” and it’s definitely not. It’s more coral/peach.
1.0,The photo flatters this ring. In reality it’s very cheap-looking.
1.0,"These are water shoes with a liner...a very THIN liner.<br />They are much cooler than house shoes, have better GRIP even on water.<br />The grip around the ankles is snug and sometimes a little too tight.<br />Not great but not bad, a little expensive for water shoes, defiantly not something you can slip on.<br />****EDIT***<br />Was purchased on 08/02/2020, as of 10/14 they are falling apart. Pictures Included, the left ""shoe"" is in the pictures, the right is also doing the same thing.<br />I have worn them inside the house only, never outside.."
1.0,"I tried so hard to set these up on a pair of wedges, I have no idea how to get them on -- the instructions are in Chinese so I'll be ordering others from another company."
1.0,"Unfortunately, I only got the tank and not the shorts as described. The material is soft and lightweight, exactly what I was looking for. It's a shame that the full set wasn't sent to me."
1.0,This is a good product for high top shoes only and fits if you have 1 shoe size up from regular size you normally wear.
1.0,"this item was way to small and when tried to return found out it was from China, paid a fortune to return and then was only given $0.01. When tried to ask why it was impossible to find any contact information.<br />This place is no good!!!!!"
1.0,These are made very cheap and very thin material
1.0,Fits tight in the hips
1.0,I’m so disappointed. I ordered this to wear for Easter & upon arrival I thought it was great. Until taking a closer look & seeing yellowish brown drops on one whole sleeve. It is disgusting.
1.0,These were such a weird matierial and weird fit. Sent them back immediately
1.0,"First: It was the wrong color. I wanted the red but got purple<br />Second: from the picture,  the lace starts at the waist. The actual lace starts under the bust.<br />Third: not nearly as long looking as the picture<br />Lastly: It took forever to get here.<br />Do not recommend"
1.0,"Here's the thing... these cufflinks look pretty cool.<br /><br />Here' the problem: after only a handful of wearings, the metal ends came loose (they are not supposed to) and eventually one fell out. They do not look as they are supposed to once the pieces begin to fall off (shocker).<br /><br />Here's the biggest thing: good luck with customer services from the seller.<br /><br />I called the seller directly after this mishap. My hope was that they would stand behind their product. But my expectation was that, at the very least, they would offer (or even sell me) a replacement part and more, tell me what they'd suggest to keep them from falling apart again. Think about it: I was only asking what I could do to make this product last longer than it did under very light wear (they're cufflinks for crying out loud, not football pads!).<br /><br />Frankly I would have accepted a ""Sorry, we can't help."" answer up front. It wouldn't have made me want to buy from them again, but I would have accepted it. But instead I received insult to injury.<br /><br />In the first call it was implied that maybe they could help. They asked when and how I'd purchased the product (I gave them the info). They asked me to send a picture of the faulty item (I did). By this method of dealing with someone you'd think that they at least intended to help (and no statement was made either to or implying the contrary). After not hearing back I followed up (again, having to take further action even to get an answer). ""Oh yes,"" they said, ""we did get your email and photo but we couldn't find your order info."" (It seemed clear they were going to let me figure that out rather than calling me back.) But then they asked for MORE effort on my part - ""Did I have the Amazon order number or precise date of purchase?"" Uh sure (why didn't you say you wanted or needed that up front?!) I sent it via email - action #5 if you are counting, all in an effort to get a clean answer and maybe some help, and still no indication other than that they fully intended to help.<br /><br />After this round and round it became clear that they did not, maybe never had intended to help when they sent the following message in response to all the data they'd had me run around and get to them: ""Here's an 800 number. Take it up with Amazon.""<br /><br />Now come on. If you have no intension of helping me, tell me up front. If there is a disclaimer on whether or not you'll be able to help me, tell me THAT up front. But DO NOT ask me to take time to take and send you pictures, provide info to you that you can't or don't want to find yourself, and then do what you clearly intended to do from the start: punt to Amazon!<br /><br />For $30 bucks you'd think they might have thought wiser of how to handle this - perhaps repair or replace the item, give me some kind of credit toward a future purchase, tell me the answers to my questions... in short, encourage me to stay a customer. Nope. Clearly customers do not rate as important to this company.<br /><br />Top it off: the product is broken and can't be used as intended, and not as a result of misuse.<br /><br />Bottom line: the products here look like a deal, but what you're really buying are people who don't want to deal with you when their products fail."
1.0,I normally wear a small<br />I ordered a medium and could not fit in the dress
1.0,I never got the second pair for free - never saw where I was supposed to enter the code for it.<br /><br />Be careful - this might be a scam!
1.0,The picture didn’t show in the locket I was very disappointed with the poor quality.
1.0,"These are the worst socks I have ever purchased..... do not meet any decent standard, nor serve appropriate purpose.  Way too tight.  way too long for size.  strangle one's leg.  Forms a tourniquet at the top, which is exactly what you DON'T want (i am a physician).  Extremely difficult to put on.  Amazon and manufacturer have refused a refund---this is NOT what one expects from Amazon.  I'm suspecting this whole ""copper-infused"" thing is just a sales gimmick. I have used many compression sox over 40+ years-- these are not only worthless, but dangerous/."
1.0,Must be sized for children
1.0,Not the same color as pictured! Different product than shown
1.0,STONES WAY TOO SMALL FOR MY TASTE.
1.0,"I am so disappointed in the fit of this dress, and I really love the look of it on the product page and on the hanger.  According to the size chart, I should wear between a large and an XL.  Because of the style, I thought I would like a little more ""flow"" to the fit.  So, I ordered a 2XL.  It turns out, I would need maybe  a 5XL for this dress to fit.  This XXL size dress fits me like a medium size.<br />This was my FIRST order the from Amazon Fashion line.  I am SO disappointed."
1.0,"had it in for not even 24 hours and it caused really bad irritation to my septum, also gross blueish-green chalky stuff was coming off of it. basically just painted plastic, so the color has already faded in spots cause i had it in while i showered (even though i tried to avoid getting it wet)."
1.0,Not high waisted at all! Not at all meant for an hourglass figure! Even the extra large size is too short and I'm no giant by any means. The belt isn't nearly as long as in the photo. Once it's tied there's absolutely no hang. It's like they made the belt to fit the small size but didn't add any length for large or extra large.<br />I'm going to cut them for capris. Too much trouble to return them or I would.<br />Definitely meant for the petite woman!
1.0,Definitely not what I expected. Thankfully a friend liked them.
1.0,I washed this sweater before I wore it. It still leaves white fuzz all over my clothes. I would not recommend it.
1.0,"This was so ugly and looked nothing like an elephant. A newborn has bigger ears than these, and don’t even get me started on the “trunk”. It was literally 1/2 long. Ughhhh! I would have rated it a 0 if possible. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!😡"
1.0,"Dress is much smaller than indicated. I would order 2-3 sizes up!  Also, the material is thin and somewhat see through."
1.0,"I could barely get them over my knees, the sizing chart was not correct, they fit like an xs"
1.0,"The fabric is nice, the fit is pretty true to size. HOWEVER... the zippers wont stay up!!! I ordered a XL I'm busty... I had it on when<br />I went to go walk my dog (fit fine) & had a zip up sweatshirt over top since it was chilly. Shortly after my walk started the zipper literally  just completely unzipped & popped open!!! Yep both my girls out there for EVERYONE TO SEE! Thank goodness I was able to close my hoodie up quickly & zip it up! Can you imagine if I had been at the gym with out my sweatshirt over it??? Awful product!!!!"
1.0,Chose to return this.  Tops looked bunchy over these.
1.0,Medium and Large were too small.<br />Great design but over rated and priced.
1.0,See through!  Can’t wear without a slip! Want to return but missed cut off
1.0,Connection part fell apart.  Unusable.
1.0,"i ordered the  one as shown on site  being photo #1mossy oak look ""  but when i check in my order history it shows pic #2<br /> being real tree  camo look,  until i click on that photo then it takes me to picture one hat !!!! ????? i did not order the hat in second photo  ( 2 different animals ) i dont know what im getting  better not be  like the second  photo  because thats not as described in photo i have canceled this order  due to misrepresentation of what im buying"
1.0,"As soon as I pulled the hat out of the plastic bag, I saw a long hair attached to it. When I looked at the hat more closely, I noticed it was dirty and had definitely been used—super obvious since it was white.<br /><br />I was really disappointed because it was surprisingly expensive for a plastic hat, and I didn’t get to wear it a concert as planned. I returned it."
1.0,this product ..is horrible ..it becomes rusty and the lock got ruined in a matter of weeks and now its lost in a matter of two months and by this time they tell me its too late to get a refund or return. do not buy this product. and i got this for my bday present . dont buy this even for a child in a third world country. buy real white gold with cubic at the very least for kids in third world countries.
1.0,Cute but poor quality fabric
1.0,The material looks cheap
1.0,"The ""metal"" plating bubbled and flaked. I inspected them when they arrived and they looked fine. Came back weeks later and they were flaking. To late to return."
1.0,This dress was nice but it smelled like fish when you open it
1.0,Lower quality then expected
1.0,Was very disappointed that the silver was tarnished. I tried cleaning them and everything and it was not worth it to return them.
1.0,Absolute garbage… please don’t waste your money. Impulse buy and it’s my own fault. It’s like fake material. 😢
1.0,They were nice but the size chart is wrong
1.0,Poor quality. Did not fit.
1.0,The item description says 2 pairs but I only received one pair. I would never have paid this much for one pair.
1.0,Trash and waste of money.  Slides right off card
1.0,Poorly made!!!! I opened the item and it never even made it onto my watch before it fell apart(see photo). The seller requires us to take care of shipping it back over seas.. the cost at my local ups was about 5x the cost of the item. I wish that I could at least get a replacement.
1.0,Broke after wearing it twice
1.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, and it may be amazing… I’ll never know. It’s MIA."
1.0,This item is an absolute piece of crap. The directions are non-existant and there is no way to contact anyone. Trying to figure out how to use it was impossible and you cannot return it.
1.0,The actual heal part did not feel strong or supportive … ankle breaker for sure
1.0,Not true to size. Didn’t bother returning since it was a hassle for me.
1.0,The latch doesn’t close good and I lost my watch almost twice. It’s really nice looking but definitely disappointed with it not locking correctly.
1.0,Terrible quality. Doesn’t look same as in picture. Color is off. Very disappointing.
1.0,Do not waste your money.as the necklace is way to heavy & it looks more like black.not slive.we had
1.0,Too small but beautiful dress.
1.0,"These are not the same cut. The gemological report is not real and the website takes you to a message that says ""website stopped by administrator"""
1.0,Literally got an empty blue jewelry box.
1.0,"What a joke! First of all it took so long to get in the mail, secondly I ordered a double XL and it fit as if it were an adult medium. The material didn’t even stretch and the print on it was like a thick plastic very uncomfortable. Do not recommend at all!"
1.0,"I don't write negative reviews lightly. After receiving the item, I contacted the vendor to exercise the 1 year warranty it came with. The problem was that the light did not work and the digital displays worked for about 10 minutes then ceased working you can see in my picture that the digital displays are not showing anything -- even after pressing the correct buttons). They responded within 24 hours asking if I was pressing the right buttons (really?). I replied I did, and asked about next steps. A week after two more messages and no replies, I returned the item for a  refund."
1.0,Pretty irritated .. was so excited to order this and took a gamble . I’m a 6.5 (just had my finger measured ) and the size 7 didn’t come close to fitting.. wish I had ordered up..
1.0,"The material is awful - much cheap polyester. My daughter, who wears an XS in most sizes, ordered a small and it was still too small. This is in no way a t-shirt dress - it fits to the waist. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Cute frame for boys but not made well at all. The arms became very loose after a month or so and can not be tightened.  The rubber on the arms also slides off very easily. Waste of money!
1.0,"I wear a size 12 Jean, this belt was not even close to fitting. I had to give it to my 10 yr old daughter"
1.0,"This pendant fell apart on me. My fiancee bought this necklace for me in February for our anniversary and first the clasp fell off, so I put it on another necklace then the band that holds the amethyst broke and now I just have the gem left. Terrible construction and jewelry that doesn't stand up to the test of time."
1.0,This did not fit.... I am sick of buying things from Amazon that don't fit.
1.0,Nothing good about that product
1.0,"This is so stiff and skirt is way too full. Not cut correctly,  I purposely went up three sizes, considering it was cheap. Lesson learned don't purchase!"
1.0,"I’m 162, 5’3 and bought a M. It fit perfectly, not tight, just right. Absolutely cute and comfy, but upon arrival the left strap was defected. It’s not adjustable. I’m a bit sad because I wanted to wear it tomorrow for Memorial Day BBQ. I’m forced to return, but it doesn’t give me the option to exchange or refund. Sigh. 😕"
1.0,The band is great but the ring started turning two days after I received it.
1.0,I really like this shirt but I’ve only had it for 2<br />Weeks and it has a hole on the shoulder already....Ugh!!!
1.0,"I have skinny legs, but the leg parts fit just fine and I didn't have to use the last hole to make them fit either. The waist part, on the other hand... Even using the last hole it was WAY too big. I don't know what shape the makers of this product think women are, but nobody has legs this small with a waist this big. The only explanation I can come up with is that they sent me Small leg parts, and a Large waist part."
1.0,Its dont stink as much & it definitely dont hold my boobs up 🤔
1.0,"I, unfortunately haven't been able to wear the pants, since the size tape label on the leg left huge amounts of residue when I removed it. They feel soft and look great except for the residue area.<br /><br />Will update when I hear from the company on what can rectify this situation."
1.0,Couldn't wear...too big!
1.0,Broke the same day
1.0,[[VIDEOID:ff6fd98c4b595618575c96968bb75006]] I was really looking forward to recieving this… the colors are so beautiful however it arrived broken and cannot be repaired
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:1505f173af7b8f1d9aaee6306012718]] Not a spinner ring as described. Ordered for my daughter for her 18th birthday a month before the day and arrived a month after :/ She has anxiety and thought this would be nice, instead it gives ME anxiety because it doesn’t spin. Very disappointed. It will cost me way to much to send it back. Not sure why it is threaded on the inside either - maybe I can use it for as a really cool nut for a large bolt 🤷🏼‍♀️"
1.0,I have SEVERAL chains and nothing will work the hole is barely large enough for for the necklace so you will never get the end through the tiny hole. I love the locket but they are unusable.
1.0,Very cute but they don’t stay on! Very odd design... epic fail.
1.0,The posts were too thick and hurt my ears.  Had to return them.
1.0,Cheap no good
1.0,Unfortunately the hinge/clasp constantly comes undone and is just flopping around.
1.0,Cute as expected but too small..i believe i ordered extra large and large came
1.0,Both chains broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,"Should have paid attention to reviews.  Doesn't curl up to catch hair, very small neck ."
1.0,"Terribly small, and flimsy. Even the openng wouldnt fit an 18 week old, let alone an 18 month old. Not to mention that Shoebuy’s customer service in trying to resolve the issue was at best pathetic. iI’ve never seen anything like it on Amazon"
1.0,Not true to size.  Even ordered it a size bigger than needed & it's too small.
1.0,size is incorrect
1.0,The description says women but I was sent a kids size!
1.0,One of the beads on this necklace was open when I first received it not to bad but now that it’s been used for a week or so it’s gotten worse and it comes off the baby way to easy
1.0,I ordered this for my eight year old but it fit my 3 Year Old Way too small
1.0,"Didn't expect much so not too disappointed, but still a 1 star review as they broke with gentle cleaning after a couple of months. Ugly as hell, and the frame is much wider than the lens, and rubberized, which makes cleaning them a pain, and quick to fog.<br /><br />Low quality."
1.0,You guys broke my kid heart. Only one light working and the other one not
1.0,"Saved these for Easter for my daughter. She wore them maybe 5 times since April 16,2017 & they already broke.👎🏻"
1.0,"Buyer be ware! I had purchased this skirt in my size, medium. I was so shocked when  I received it,  this skirt looked like it was made to fit a child that is how tiny it was. , It was very cheap looking, there was no tag on the inside of it showing the size or brand.  Buyer be ware, stay clear from this. I truly believe I was ripped off. What company does not have a label for size or company.  I am now going to Drop this off with all my close donations for goodwill."
1.0,"It was broken, the butterfly was separated<br />Bad quality"
1.0,I thought the earrings were bigger than they actually were.  Very dissapointed.  But the shipping and the time frame was great!
1.0,First they are a lot smaller than advertised. I didn’t go through the trouble to return and just kept them. But then they broke- like within a week. The hinge just snapped off.
1.0,I was not pleased with this outfit. Did not like the material (that’s my personal opinion)
1.0,I was hoping to wear this as a sweater dress as it’s pictured but it is not nearly as long as the model photos make it out to be.
1.0,Horrible. The fabric is of cheap material and its glossing looking. Don't waste your money. I will be returning this shirt
1.0,And it fell apart.
1.0,"These are not cut correctly, i tried these on my daughter who are smaller"
1.0,Color Looked nothing like describes. It was orange not red and it was a Lycra material. Disappointed 😔
1.0,To big slid….off the first day
1.0,"This shirt is made of plastic, it’s not even close to clothing. Think dollar store Halloween costume quality and add a exorbitant price tag."
1.0,"In the product listing it shows a place on the back of the arms for a strap to hold the glasses on your head and the strap to go with it. They came with an elastic strap that will in no way work with the glasses. I bought these to swim in the ocean and have them stay on. Very disappointed in what I received. Also, the fit is quite uncomfortable, like no one actually tried them on before mass producing the design.  If you need glasses to use that will stay on in extreme conditions, do not buy these!"
1.0,Looks great but functionality is subpar at best.
1.0,Not very comfortable. Seemed to cut into my skin between the fingers because of the sharp edges.
1.0,"It doesn't even deserve one star. The size I ordered, xl, was smaller than a medium."
1.0,I did not receive these colors. I got black and white instead. Disappointed.
1.0,"See through, crappy material. Nothing like the photo"
1.0,"fake leather, was supposed to mail back but was hospitalized and recouperating still.<br />I wish honesty a pledge here but it's not.<br /><br />Sincerely Janet Aiken"
1.0,The patterns do not line up AT ALL!  The spine converged at the seam and the bones were not visible.  The scapula got chopped off on both sides and there are two vertebrae patterns on the same line.  Horrible quality.
1.0,"Product is NOT as shown. The colors were black & dark grey, not black & white. Also the fit was absurd, I ordered an XL and couldn't even get the sleeves over my hands, it seemed like a woman's shirt."
1.0,I waited until fall to wear it for the first time but realized it had a hole in the seam of the arm. It wasn’t a missed stitch either. The fabric was cut too close so there is no was to stitch it back together. I am super bummed. It fit as expected and the fabric is soft. I missed the return window before wearing because it wasn’t fall yet.
1.0,"It looks nice, but the clasp does not open. I bought this for my wedding and don't have time to wait another month to get another one. I will have to buy a new clasp and fix it myself. I guess for the price though, you get what you pay for."
1.0,Doesn't really look like leather. Look cheapish. But I only paid 10.99 dollars so I can't complain to much. Picture on advertising looks better.
1.0,I am glad that I only spent $12.99 on this because the strap is crooked and the fit is way too small.
1.0,They run small and then when you try to get refund they want to send 30 dollars instead of full refund
1.0,"Very small, ended up giving it to my daughter"
1.0,"I am very disappointed. The box was nice and I was excited to receive it, but when I saw the pieces, It was so not what I was expecting. It appears cheap and a stone or two were missing."
1.0,This product stopped 1 week and a Half after we got them. $50.00 down the drain and my daughter is heartbroken because she worked hard to earn those shoes.<br />I won't buy any more for sure 😖
1.0,They look cheap and are smaller than the photos. There was some brown smudge stuff on one of the balls.
1.0,Very disappointed. Quality is horrible. Can not wear out in public. Very thin and see through.
1.0,La tela es muy delgada fácil de romper
1.0,The sleeves was too small.
1.0,"The Pop I received did not have ANY black in it. It has white in it and there is not any white in the stone in the picture.<br />So deceiving . The stone should be Black and Blue as shown in the picture. It should,not have white in it.<br />Wish I hadn't ordered it!!!!"
1.0,Just got these socks last night and thought they were cute but I am really disappointed with them. I've had a pair on for less than 4 hours and I already have a hole on the bottom! Also I thought they would have the padding on the bottom and they do not.
1.0,It seems to be a mens size. It was too big and the quality was not good
1.0,Cheeeeaaaaaap. Broke after wearing it one time. Stones are haphazardly glued on. No good.
1.0,"This product is flimsy and it doesn't really work, the zooming in/out feature is a joke."
1.0,I gave them away because even with the stretch they wouldn't fit.  I ordered a size bigger than I take and they were still too small.
1.0,Ratty material and why were the tags at the neck cut out?  I found several of the neck tags cut out which really made me wonder about this whole way to buy clothes.  Are they used?  Are they ashamed of where they were made or something?  Weird.
1.0,Junk.  This did nothing
1.0,I had decent hopes for this pair of earrings but they literally look worse than children's play jewelry.  The stones were all scuffed and looked like plastic.  Terrible quality.
1.0,"While the colors and quality seem good, I only received 14, not 25 as advertised.  I therefore cannot justify paying this amount for this product."
1.0,These earrings arrived broken while they were still in the package. I told Amazon about it and they sent me a replacement which also arrived broken. Both orders arrived with one earring in each package with the backing missing. When I took the earrings out they were rubbery and fell apart in my hands. They were cheap in every way possible. If I could have given this no stars it would have been more accurate.
1.0,My daughter only wore this 1 time and all the stitching is coming apart. Strap broke and theres a hole in the tail. Lets just say i have a very upset daughter!
1.0,I bought xl and my friend who is a medium could fit them I couldn't even get them up my leg

1.0,not as shown
1.0,Was too big I would go a size down and looks better on the site .
1.0,No good not what I expected. Disappointed!
1.0,I ordered a 2x can't even pull it up.  ordered 2 pair.  won't again
1.0,SHIRT RUNS SMALL AND ALMOST SEE THROUGH NOT VALUE THE MONEY
1.0,Everything’
1.0,This belt is for a small child nit a woman with curves
1.0,"Great looking belt, but-- after 24 hours-- the prong does not stay in any of the holes... it pops out after a bit of movement."
1.0,I was excited by the design of the shoe for my son BUT within a few hours of wearing the eyelet (see photo) broke and the shoe can not not be properly tightened. Very disappointing for a shoe advertised as durable and not inexpensive. Hopefully this was an isolated issue. I encourage the company to reach out to me for further information and to correct the issue. Currently I would not recommend these shoes to anyone.
1.0,Put shoes on one time the right shoe came on without me turning it on would not go out and now won't carge or turn on not happy at all
1.0,"The material is very soft yes but the white dress is extra see through also if you don’t want to reveal your thigh too much size up, it looked cute on me but it was way to see through"
1.0,"I'm 5/9&#34; and have a long torso.  I sized up per the reviews and it was the right size for me width-wise.  Going up a size wouldn't have helped.  It simply wasn't long enough.  I could barely get the one strap up but I did manage. However, the suit is so short that literally one of my breasts was above the top of the swimsuit, the one on the size with no strap."
1.0,The material was cheap feeling and the size was too small!
1.0,"Horribly made.  Fits terrible.  Ugly, ugly!"
1.0,"Was excited for these pants to increase my sweat during daily runs. Fit was great, size chart seemed accurate for my body. Buuuut, holy hell are these pants noisy. Super embarrassing to be in a conference call and receiving question about the 'weird sound' whenever I moved or walked to another room. I am returning and looking for quieter pants. If you find odd sounds bothersome, this is not the right purchase for you."
1.0,Broke on first wear. Can’t even return it. Ridiculous cheap. Don’t buy this!!!!!!!!!
1.0,This product was extremely cheaply made as the material literally pulled apart within the first 15 minutes I had them on. None of the other leggings I had purchased did this but I also ordered other ones that were different from these. I'm not sure if someone slipped these cheaply manufactured ones in by accident or what.
1.0,Not comfortable and no support whatsoever ever.  Very disappointed.
1.0,These leggings were completely see-through
1.0,Would give no stars but the threading was already stripped
1.0,I don’t know who made this shirt but the front is really big making me look pregnant and the armpits I could fit 3 arms in there not good quality at all
1.0,Horrible!!!!!!
1.0,"Just as the headline says, this is how i feel about the 3 pairs of the contour i bought...  I am returning them. though they are squat proof in my opinion. i personally have a had time buying anything seamless because of the crotch (camel toe). However this brand did very well in the animal print ones they have i absolutely love those... got a size L in everything 5'6, 175 pounds I am pear shaped."
1.0,Broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,Didn’t like returning
1.0,cute but didn't like how the belt (flap) looked on.
1.0,Save your money. This ring came rusty and ten sizes too big. It was a very thin piece of crap metal. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"I am truely incredibly disappointed in this purchase.  Out of all of my online purchases, this one has truely let me down the most.  I did my research on this suit, and ordered it a size larger than normal due to the sizing comments.  The suit came in today, and I was incredibly excited to try it on.  The top is incredible!  Fits wonderfully and looks great!  The bottoms on the other hand, were not sewn together!  The left hip, botton portion, where the string goes through was not attached!  It appeared that the sewing machine ran out of thred when it got to that part.  There were small needle holes, but no thred!  Incredibly disappointing!"
1.0,cheap quality.  No way could I keep these.
1.0,Not really what I was looking for. To thick
1.0,I am not a happy camper. This wallet bent ALL of my cards. It curved them. I would not suggest buying this product.
1.0,It is too small and tight in the chest area. Buy 2 sizes up.  am returning it.
1.0,The item is nothing like what is pictured online.  Colors are off and button was a cheap plastic bright orange. Also big gray-ish stripe in sleeves See picture attached.  The pic on left is what is advertised and pic of right is what I got. Very disappointed
1.0,Stones had fallen out when I open the package
1.0,horrible and cheap
1.0,Didn’t get to return or exchange it in time but its very cheap material the shirt material feels hard and the picture is hard
1.0,"If you lit a match 50 miles away from this blouse, it would go up in flames. The cheapest, most synthetic material (if material at all) was used to make this blouse. Not worth the money spent."
1.0,"Beautiful top.  I bought an XL,  but it was too tight for my 42C cup chest."
1.0,Its a fake.
1.0,For out side is leather but inside is synthetic to easy to ripe out
1.0,Way to small.the size is not right
1.0,Ordered an XL and item looked like an XS
1.0,"For reference I am 5'11 so I do sometimes run into issues with skirts being too short but this was ""school girl Halloween costume"" too short, if you get what I mean (lol)- barely covered my butt and would not have been appropriate to wear in public even with tights. I also sized up and it was still at least a size too small. Had it fit, I would not have kept it anyway... the fabric was cheap, almost like felt. As a matter of fact, now that I'm thinking about it, it's similar quality to what a costume would be so all things considered, maybe its just meant to be a Halloween costume. Definitely overpriced for what it is... all around disappointed with the fit and quality so sent it back"
1.0,I have a small head and it was much too small
1.0,Fits very strange in the bust and unfortunately I waited until after I got back from my trip to try to try return it and was past the THIRTY WHOLE DAYS you get to return it. Stuck with a dress I can’t wear.
1.0,It does not hold your breasts up like in the photos. Will not ever buy again
1.0,Absolute garbage. Nothing like the description. Feels super cheap. Fit was horrible and color was off. Unfortunately because of being so busy throughout the holidays we missed the return window. Complete waste of almost $40.
1.0,I wore them once. I'm extremely delicate with jewelry and as I was removing the earrings one broke after the first day. I was pretty dissatisfied.
1.0,The only reason this product. A one-star for me was because there was a smear on the mask like it had been used. To their credit everything looked exactly as described. When I complain I was immediately credited back my money. I believe if there was not the smear given the time I might have just washed it and kept it.
1.0,When I zipped up  the zipper they all came off track.  Really angry about it. The purse is really nice
1.0,I thought this would be really cute but the chain is too thin and I would have liked it a little longer.  My chain had a kink in it when it arrived.
1.0,"Fabric looks cheap.  I would return, but threw all packaging away.  Says ""do not wash""?  I will wash it and see if it looks any better."
1.0,Returned.  Color is odd.
1.0,no the best
1.0,Horrible puke yellow colour
1.0,"I just received my murano glass bead bracelet, looked pretty.  The write up indicates it comes with a 1"" extender, that isn't accurate.  In order for me to wear the bracelet, I depended on the 1"" extender, very disappointed.  We were attending an event today, May 25, 2019, I tried to get the bracelet on, my husband helped and the lobster claw clasp broke.  I have never heard of a lobster claw clasp breaking!!!  I would not recommend this item and am very disappointed, I do not have my package that it came in and do not know where to return same.  I know it came from China and was written in Chinese on the package.  AMAZON, get on it and weed out these people, we depend on Amazon to be better than China!!!!!!!!"
1.0,"They took an extra long time to get to us, but we are mid pandemic, so there's that. However, the shoes lasted two days before the bottoms literally started coming off. I bought these for my son for his birthday (he picked them out)  Super bummed."
1.0,"Got it in about 2 weeks ago, lovely ring that’s stamped S925 (needed if to prove is sterling silver) it turned orange meaning it was an overlay of sterling and not solid. Finger turned black and I called up for a refund, Amazon’s great and gave me my money back. My suggestion is don’t buy it if you have sensitive skin."
1.0,u suck
1.0,"Product came in with stains on the hood, seams were coming out, and product did not match the images depicted in the description."
1.0,Bought this for my husband. XXL fits like an M. Fabric is too synthetic not at all like wool.
1.0,"We received a long sleeve, notch neck black shirt. The color was the only thing correct about this order. Disappointed."
1.0,Did not like the color nor the size unable to use😩😩
1.0,White XL It arrived dirty stitchihg not great
1.0,Hated these
1.0,"Not happy, wrong color"
1.0,Not As Described
1.0,"This was a waste of money, it wont stay on your face and the fabric is so thin I cant imagine it will provide any benefit"
1.0,It broke a week after I bought the necklace ☹️
1.0,ugly. colors are off and splotchy. weird “silver” lines on the side. Bad quality
1.0,"These were a size 2x and look like a size 0<br /> What a joke, any good reviews on here have to be paid for"
1.0,Yes the description says right lens +2.5!  It also says “lenses” plus shows a picture of “both” lenses.  You are only getting 1 lense!<br />I felt this was a very deceptive description.  Got only 1 and immediately sent it back! 😡
1.0,I got a ring instead of a bracelet
1.0,The dress fits but there is this weird unflattering flare of the arms. Will be returning
1.0,Shorts were left out of the delivery!!! One star for the good quality of the shirt.
1.0,TERRIBLE LEGGINGS! These were not at ALL what the picture was like. I had ordered these because I saw someone recommend them on TikTok and I did not get the leggings they got. They are a very baggy material with loose stitching. There is a right band around the waist. Such a disappointing purchase
1.0,"Giant Arm Hole Showing off Side Tatas. Holy moly. Look, if you have tree sized arms, b cup Tatas, a potato belly and a huge behind then you'll love this dress. If you aren't shaped like some gorilla-human hybrid I do not recommend it at all. To top it off the waist runs small lmao. Idk who could wear this, maybe good for circus persons? As for me, I wish I could return it but I'm not going to pay for a first class seat to China to get it back to Godzilla Tailor and Dresses. Guess it will make cute rags or couch cover. Disposable income disposed of. Thanks."
1.0,"While the design is very pretty and unique, the quality is very poor. The screw that holds the clasp together came out after one month of use. The screw is far too small to even attempt to repair it myself. Very disappointing as it is a lovely design that I haven’t found anywhere else."
1.0,"The bust size was so small, it was fine if you need an A cup.  I need a C cup, so I sent it back.  It didn’t fit me, I like my breasts to actually fit into the cup size."
1.0,Not sure why but it irritated and caused my piercing to get infected.
1.0,"The reason I only gave it one star was because it was so disappointing! The fit was great, the hold was good, but the metal slides used on the front are awful! They do not loop through two holes like typical bras to ensure that the fabric doesn't bunch up! That means that the slide flips and the fabric rubs whenever you move in this. So disappointed."
1.0,Zipper broke first month.
1.0,Too small for my frame. Not realistic for 45inch waistline. Not meant for someone shaped like me trying to lose weight.
1.0,Several of the lights did not work. Out of the 40 lights we could only get about 25 to light up and stay lit up.The kids had great difficulty using them as did some of the adults. Great concept poor output. Won't be purchasing this product nor recommending it due to the
1.0,Beautiful dress just too small will reorder it in the near future and a larger size.
1.0,Jacket looked cute online but once I received it the clasp at the top of the zipper was broken off so it just looks tacky now and I noticed the lining inside of the jacket is not the best quality... almost like a pillow that’s been washed and all the stuffing like if bunches up in one area and you get loose fabric. Multiple stains inside jacket as well. I guess you get what you paid for....
1.0,"Would be small for a child. I wanted small, but not absurdly tiny.  Impossible to even get on.  Silver was pretty and liked the design, but too small to even go on my normal size ear lobe."
1.0,This was the worst nightshirt ever. It was so cheaply made I would be better off in a trash bag. I do not recommend this item at all
1.0,This item is not stainless steel.
1.0,Not fully 3 dimensional and very cheaply made brake easily disappointed
1.0,They sent the wrong size as ordered but we decided to keep them to avoid the hassle.  My son was able to tighten them up.  The chamoix is like an underwear with a huge pad.  The button fell off within a few wears.
1.0,This is so cheap and ugly. It looks nothing like the photo. So dissapointed
1.0,Didn't like look afterall - returned for refund - order still showing outstanding on Amazon acct - still awaiting refund of my $
1.0,"Never refunded my purchase, was cheaply made. Would’ve broke as soon as you got wet."
1.0,Stones not secure<br />Fell out 1st day
1.0,I would love it I’m sure however mine is missing a gem! :(
1.0,Wanted small<br />Sent xl
1.0,Advertised as sp50 but it doesn't state anywhere on the clothes as spf 50. The material is really thin. The pants do not have the mesh that you would find in bathing suit bottoms.
1.0,This robe is such poor quality and the minute I took it out of the package it rained black fuzz everywhere.
1.0,Sewing was wrong<br />Not good
1.0,Buy 2 sizes larger than what you really want.
1.0,"Horrible quality, excess plastic on earrings. Very cheap quality, do not recommend !"
1.0,"This says size 10, but fits like a zero - it is tiny!!!  I can't even get it over my head ... Maybe it's a 10 toddler???"
1.0,Came broken the back was shattered and glass all in side 5 stars for Beauty! 1star because I purchased it for a friend now I owe him smh:(
1.0,In the breast part was a V shaped piece of metal that was not flexible at all. It just sat on top of my chest awkwardly. And the inside seam of the chest is continuously exposed. This did not work for me
1.0,"A peices of junk, please don't buy it's a waste of money."
1.0,Such a cute dress. True to size. Completely see thru. Can not wear. Passed the deadline of return.  Oh well! Might wear with a complete slip underneath. Hope I don’t sweat to death.
1.0,Nice looking great print. Order 2 sizes bigger for better fit.
1.0,"The hat I received looks nothing like what is pictured.  What I got seemed to be made of a huntsman check tweed, rather than the herringbone tweed pictured.  It is not the flat cap with ear flaps I was hoping to receive.  It seems more like an eight panel casket cap, but does not pull down flat and does not have ear flaps.  The cut and the shape are just all wrong for me."
1.0,did not meet my expections did not work as promised i do not think it shouls be advertised as it is !!!!!!
1.0,They are not 1 inch. Very upsetting that I bought them for a last min order and I can’t even use them.
1.0,"Do Not Buy, unless you want to wear a shirt with someone else's name printed on it. I ordered this shirt hoping that my own name would be printed on the shirt, instead Mrs. Brannon is printed. I do not want to wear a shirt that has someone else's name printed on it.<br />It's really too bad, because this is such a cute shirt."
1.0,These socks are never big enough or true to size
1.0,I'm a very dissatisfied with these this is the second time I purchased them and the black one came undone within a week and the brown one is already starting to do the same thing. I would not recommend these...I will spend more money to buy something of better quality.
1.0,"rubbish, done never fit casio mdv- 106<br />why dont i just check out the review, so i will not waste 10buck"
1.0,"Save yourself, DONT BUY!!! I followed the size chart and even ordered one size bigger, and the XL I received could have fit my 8 year old."
1.0,Broken within a month or two not<br />Happy
1.0,"Very thin for a snow jacket.  Only two very small front pockets.  No interior pockets, no chest or arm pockets to put RF lift ticket. Lift scanners wouldn't work if you were wearing this!"
1.0,"Although the print on the fabric was very prettt in real life, the dress was made poorly and had an overall cheap feel to it. Definitely not worth $32. I also bought it because it looks like it buttons up and was hoping it would be good for nursing and pumping, but the buttons are simply sewn to the front of the dress."
1.0,This is Kristal broke off the first hour I wore it
1.0,I was chinaboozaled!!!
1.0,I did not get what I ordered. I ordered this because it had a veil and ended up with some flower clip thing I can’t even use.
1.0,"Worst purchase EVER on Amazon. Price was great- item was worthless, as it was cut to fit a seven year old child! Sizing was sooooo off it was ridiculous. I gave it away as charity."
1.0,The item was defective. One sleeve is longer then the other. An the material is horrible
1.0,"I am beyond unimpressed with the quality of these bra's. The fabric does not hold it's shape. They do not wash well. And The sizing of a Large, as I ordered does not support a 36/38 C cup."
1.0,It was to small I am sending it back.
1.0,"It fit tight. When I saw it was made of 90% cotton, I tried to return it."
1.0,"way to small did not realize how small they were gonna be,wish i would have noticed the size of them before i wasted my money"
1.0,Very disappointed. Earrings fell apart first time I wore them. Very cheaply made. Worth about .25 cents.
1.0,Small and not worth it!!!
1.0,These are the worst boas I ever bought. Feathers are missing and the knot shows at the bottom.
1.0,"This dresss would have been really cute had it not have been made with thin, cheap fabric. I received the dress and upon opening it, immediately saw a rip in the seam down the back of the dress, as well as one of the ruffles in front had ripped away from the dress. I’m not sure if I received a used dress that had been worn before and returned, or if this is just how the dress was finished. Very disappointed!!"
1.0,Poorly made. Waste of money and time waiting to receive this &#34;shirt&#34; might fit my petite 16 year old daughter. Ordered xl...
1.0,The dress in this picture is not what I received... it's the same color but you the way it floor lengths in the picture it's straight ankle length without the flair. Even the material is that cheap polyester. Talk about disappointed. I purchased for a wedding based on the colors bit I'll be returning it because it's not what was described.
1.0,Such a cute anklet! Love the hook lock but this anklet broke before I could even put it on.
1.0,way too bulkly for s summer dress
1.0,It was a very disappointed and it was too small for me to use
1.0,Wayyy too small. Doesn’t even fit in my nose.
1.0,Smelled horrible and the smell was very strong. Bought for a Halloween costume but couldn't even use it because the eye holes are so small you couldn't see even after cutting them out more.
1.0,"The color was true to picture. It was actually a very pretty color. Unfortunately, the material is very scratchy. Another thing that I did not like was unlike most wrap dresses it did not have a hole for the other side of the sash to go into to keep the dress closed. One false move and your WHOLE body would be out of this dress. And just like the reviews said it does run very small I’ve got the largest size and it still did not fit. I am 5’9” 180 pounds. I had a good laugh about it but the AUDACITY of this seller!"
1.0,Claims to have a stud on the bottom so they fall out! I’ve lost 6 in 4 days because they don’t stay in! If you sneeze the ring falls out
1.0,Junk like a Halloween kids costume not silver
1.0,This dress looked SO cute but the material was TERRIBLE. The material smelt so weird and it was completely see through even though i went with a darker color. I will be returning.
1.0,This bra is so tight that I couldn’t even breathe.
1.0,They barely stretch so only good for sandles?
1.0,Had a very difficult time getting it over my ankle (shoe size 6)! The chain broke at the hand. Once I fixed it... the clasp wouldn’t  stay tight. I’d return if it was worth the hassle.
1.0,"The plastic hooks are made of soft, bendable, flimsy plastic. We have the nano glasses with the little holes, so it should be great, but the hook plastic is so flimsy they were bent and broken in a day. The band is basically a thin bra strap and was comfortable, but it didn’t last 24 hours with a 4 year old due to insufficient hooks."
1.0,"I was excited when I ordered it, but when my 8 year old put it on, the top was see through.<br />Yes, we put an under shirt on under it, but it sucks that we had to.<br />Plus after a couple wears the straps were starting to tear."
1.0,"I recieved smaller size than I want. If I was in a store, I could of tried on belt and buy one size larger than I received. On return on web site, I did not see how to return for a larger size. I only found I could return belt. If I could have gotten correct size, I would give belt a much higher rating but I also do not know how long it will last. Walmart belts are inexpensive but only last a month or two before they break or look so bad you want to throw it away."
1.0,This dress is for a child.
1.0,This is not the same black band in the picture.  It's a much thinner band and the loops around the watch insert are smaller.<br /><br />Why can't I have the band in this picture?
1.0,Item was too small.
1.0,IT IS SEE THROUGH DON'T WEAR OUTSIDE<br />HORRIBLY MADE CHEAP MATERIAL<br />YUCKY!<br /><br />MY RECOMMENDATION : DO NOT BUY<br />MY GRADE : FFFFFFFFFFFF +<br />catziyes aka Kim Winningham
1.0,Just as display
1.0,Shoes are super cute.  But unfortunately I CAN'T WEAR TWO RIGHT SIDE SHOES!!  Im super SAD!!!  😢😢😢😢
1.0,"The mask looked nothing like the one they advertise, so beware"
1.0,At least 2 sizes too small
1.0,Was super disappointed with this dress. It was very short and thin material. I tried it on once and automatically decided to return it.
1.0,DOES NOT CHARGE refund or send a new one ??!
1.0,"Was not what I expected. Poor quality, and color was completely different than pictured."
1.0,"These are used to prevent tangling BUT these are so heavy they constantly fall to the front, necklaces will always tangle. What a waste of money."
1.0,"This mask is junk, do not waste your money. I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS. The number one reason I'm writing this review is because the company NEVER RESPONDED TO ME SO I COULD RETURN IT..."
1.0,This dress is cheaply made and not flattering. The material is thin and not breathable. The skirt on this was longer on one side than the other.
1.0,This band is too thick and will not latch.  Have tried everything and it is useless.  Money for nothing
1.0,The top was tighter than expected. The rest fit appropriately
1.0,"Item arrived damaged. Flower at the top of the skull is detached. Quality of painting is very poor and does not look like the photo online. Photo on left is from the online photo, right is my item showing the broken piece and the sloppy painting."
1.0,Product was made for a child
1.0,"Handle was only attached on one end when it arrived. Pretty back, but obviously not sturdy or high quality. Returned!"
1.0,Was really disappointed with the quality of this hand bag... it feels like plastic on the inside...
1.0,As much as I love the design on the shirt it was really really short and I paid expedited mail and it was 3 days  late so I didn't even get to wear in on St. Pattys day so I was not happy about that. The width was fine just really short.
1.0,Very cheap and flimsy with see through cloth for the mask and horrible stitching with the cloth stuck out on the ends.
1.0,Super cheap strap. Doesn't look like the picture. Colors are more white than green. It probably won't break but also it is way to cheap to be using on a nice camera. Spend your money elsewhere.
1.0,Havent even had them a month and they are falling apart!
1.0,Demaciado pequeño y feo
1.0,Was excited to get the sweater. Unfortunately the sweater was more Orange than Beige. Very disappointing.
1.0,"I like the color of the shoe. However, I wore it three times for work (office work). It looks like wore the shoes for years. If you look the old wear look shoes, this is for you. Also, they run big and they are not as comfortable as Olukai reputation is. I felt I was wearing some very low quality shoe. No worth for the price."
1.0,Tiny toooooo forever to get 6 weeks
1.0,Slightly too big for my versa. One band would not stay on no matter how hard I tried. Gold color is pretty thoguh
1.0,"warped easily, and now the lens are sticking out awkwardly."
1.0,"I cannot imagine the experiences of others who rated this so highly. If you are an average-size adult male, it is too small for your shoulders. The company's photographs are deceptive. It is so flimsy that it can only take the shape of its contents. The straps are so insignificant and so poorly padded that you cannot carry an item of substantive weight. If are capable of putting it on, I would be surprised if you could carry any items other than a tablet, your lunch, and your water bottle. I did not see any photographs of customers who were actually wearing the backpack, and that should have been a red flag about the ultimate functionality of the product."
1.0,too thin!
1.0,Extremely cheap. Not as pictured. Will not stand on it's own.
1.0,The mask was comfortable but the port broke off the second time I wore it.
1.0,"The description says herringbone, the photo shows a herringbone with a shine... you get a flat snake chain in a dull gold (almost copper) color. Definitely not as expected. Extremely disappointing."
1.0,"Don't waste your money! I bought this necklace because it looks beautiful and inspirational in a crappy time and when I got it, it tarnished right away and it looks worse every time I wear it. You can maybe read half of the lettering. I waited a while and tried to polish and clean it over and over, every time I wear it and nothing makes it better. I wish I would have spent my $30 on a better necklace! 😒"
1.0,Not what I thought way to small and I'm not a very big person sz 3 ...quality wasn't the best ..didn't send back and go thru all that mess .I donation it to a shelter place ...hope they could find a person in need and  would fit and  really appreciate it ..
1.0,its a lot different than i thought<br />its shorter and the material is very strange & uncomfortable<br />the neck is super big too & i hate how it looks on me<br />wOULD NOT BUY AGAIN!
1.0,"Perfect unisex BUT its not adjustable, no smaller size options and instead of sharing this lovely bracelet with my boyfriend I'm without one. PLEASE make a 7&#34; or an 7.5&#34;."
1.0,Don't waste your money. It turns really fast. I only wanted it for my T2 but it turned on the second day
1.0,"After one lawn mowing (and my lawn isn't that large), both heels are split from top down, now unwearable. I'll spend more for something durable."
1.0,Basically I ask a small and the pair that arrived is big enough for my husband to wear
1.0,Chain on necklace broken
1.0,Terrible Fabric . Those pants couldn’t stay in place . Oh no worst buy ever .
1.0,"This band doesn't fit the 18mm watch I purchased it for after it showed up in my Casio model-specific search, but it fit another brand. However, on first use, the pins snapped inside the watch and I'll be returning and not reordering."
1.0,Sleeve had tear. Packaging was fine but damaged top. Very unhappy
1.0,The orange is bright and the cut is very square.
1.0,They arrived torn
1.0,"It fits small. The neckline is sewed wrong and it sits funny around the neck. The sleeves are a shiny material which I didn't expect , not to fond of that. It looks cheap never going to wear it."
1.0,"This, is an old hat has dust all through it especially on the back where the snap is inside a inside a dusty plastic bag, definitely not what I ordered and not what I was hoping to get  or, to pay for even though the client's ad says shows two hats of white and a gray but this is like a sage not even gray more of a sage than a gray and only one came packaged not happy to even open the bag. Where's my other hat.?"
1.0,"Really cheap looking. Bought it to replace one I had bought locally, a year ago for $20.00, and recently lost. The $20.00 one looked so much better than this one, so sending this one back."
1.0,"Cheap feeling fabric with a weird sheen to it, far too sheer, and in person is ugly as sin."
1.0,"I usually wear a size small shirt, but after reading the reviews I decided to order a medium. This shirt is skin tight across my back! The front has a weird flap in the front giving it a maternity look. It does not hang like the picture shows. The concept of the shirt is cute but the execution is awkward."
1.0,This looks nothing like the picture! Very frumpy looking !
1.0,Runs small.  Definitely more red than maroon.  Bummed
1.0,They were a 3 x and she cried wanting them to fit and I wear medium to large and they fit me. Just gave them to another patient there. Big disappointment for mom

1.0,Mala calidad en todo el sentido de la palabra.
1.0,Cheap poor quality
1.0,"These are the most uncomfortable shoes I've ever bought!  Every edge cut into my feet, and they're ugly as sin!"
1.0,Horrible packaging and they where defected.
1.0,"May work better with smaller busted women, on larger breasted women like myself.  The zipper wouldn't stay up past my navel because of my breast size."
1.0,Way too big for my wrist
1.0,They are completely see through. I returned them right away
1.0,"Wore this a couple of times as an outer layer. I bought a small and it was big and oversized. One day I grabbed it to hang it up and it had this huge rip-I have no idea when it happened. Garbage, and my return window has closed."
1.0,Too small AND arrived damaged :( really wanted to love this
1.0,Broke before I even stepped out of the house. Very disappointed
1.0,I order 5 it to small like 3
1.0,These boots tore up in only 3 wears and I would like my money back and I only had them 2 weeks smdh they are cute but the stole of the boot falls apart 😡
1.0,Returned before I even used. Zipper was busted so didn’t want to take a chance on another. Figured zipper quality wouldn’t change.
1.0,"It is a flimsy, tacky, Total piece of junk."
1.0,"Second time wearing it, and it already broke.  Looks good but very poorly made, would not recommend.  Poor design, poor quality."
1.0,"I typically don't write reviews, but this product is THAT BAD! Would give ZERO stars if possible. The seam of the soles came completely apart in 48h. Save your money and purchase somewhere else."
1.0,"The band is very comfortable, but there are a few challenges with it:<br /><br />- the magnets both popped off after 1 month of use, making the band no longer usable<br />- I'm about 140lb and the band is actually too big for me.  it's maybe a 2 cm's short of being tight on my risk.<br />- due to the design, when you wash your hands, water gets trapped inside the band and slowly leaks out afterwards"
1.0,"Cheap, broke the first time I wore it."
1.0,"The bracelet is good quality, the necklace broke in the first couple hours of wearing. The bracelet was my biggest concern, as the sharp metal edges cut and stabbed my boyfriend multiple times. Could not wear either for more than a couple hours. Very disappointing 😞"
1.0,Did not like these!! Super thin.  They stretched out after one wear. Would never buy again!
1.0,These jeggings are so comfortable but transfer blue ink to everything. I ruined a white leather purse and it even transferred to my white couch. Would not recommend.
1.0,It is extremely uncomfortable material and it’s not made to measure
1.0,broken when arrived.
1.0,Very poor quality broke immediately
1.0,It just didn’t sit well in my nose. My nose is just too small for a bar like that.
1.0,This shirt was way too big to be a 2X. It fit like a 4X! Unbelievable...
1.0,I received the wrong size one pair was a completely different size and the others were to small the quality was very good though just would have like the right size
1.0,"I do like the material, but they are so small I can't even get them over my hips.  Also, I can't find a phone # to see about returning them.  The e mail addy must be another country, as it's very unusual looking and won't go thru."
1.0,Had glitter all over skirt and got in babies eyes
1.0,These socks began to hear after only 2 months.<br /> A waste of money .
1.0,Unable to return this item.  Poor quality fabric.  Baggy style.
1.0,"On Friday after less than one month, the portion of the glasses that hold the lens broke and the lens fell out.  I have bought other brands and designs and this only happens after a significant time. Plus I have kept this pair in its case most of the time using my other glasses for regular use."
1.0,Bought a XXL and it fit like a medium. 'Or great.
1.0,Way too small<br />Looks big in the photo
1.0,"Sadly it was too thin to wear by itself. It was a cute cut, but even after one wash the threads came loose. Also it's true the buttons don't fit the holes so there's no way to wear it closed unless you cut them bigger. I wish it were thicker fabric and better quality because the pattern was cute but totally unwearable."
1.0,I think you need larger sizes for men who have larger legs. The socks are great. Thank for good quality.
1.0,Really cute pjs but too small. Will return and order larger size.
1.0,"Wore these for a couple days, even during my showers, took them out day 3 to change and the wood is chipping and rough. Will not order from this company again."
1.0,gave me the wrong size
1.0,Buyer beware.  100% (11/11 so far) have broken while I was putting them on or while wearing.  The elastic band comes apart from the mask and the mask simply falls to one side of my face.
1.0,Bad quality. Prints are messed up. Very big! I gave it away.
1.0,First wash the sem came undone.
1.0,"The show fit fine, but I was trying to wear these out for my 40th birthday event and I walked out and the heel BROKE!!. Ruined my night had to find another option."
1.0,The loop on the top of the pendant where you connect the ring for the chain was broken on arrival.  Very flimsy.  Not worth cost / time to return.
1.0,Ripped after 3 weeks of owning!! 😖
1.0,Bought in March for my dAughter for school now it’s may and the sole is falling off the shoe
1.0,These earrings are very cheaply made. One broke after an hour of wear. I would not recommend
1.0,This umbrella is small. I was expecting a bigger one.
1.0,"Nothing like what the picture show, false advertisement"
1.0,Updated. The band disconnected quite a bit. I have now lost my watch and not sure where it fell off at. Save your money and buy another band.
1.0,"NOT PLUS SIZE!!  I ordered these after ordering a regular fit pair.  These were smaller than the regular pair I originally bought.  These are in no way shape or form plus size.  They squeeze your thigh and create a ripple.  As reference, I'm 5'4"", weight 147lbs, and wear a size 8-10 normally.  My shoe size is pretty average, size 8.  Not sure how these stockings are supposed to fit as ""plus size"".  I'm very unhappy because I cannot return them.  Buyers beware!"
1.0,Very thin not what I expected
1.0,Not worth it dont waste ur time or money. My husband only had it less than a week n stone already fell out n it scratches show alot on the black n color faded.
1.0,Product pealed withing a week. Turned black and green after the finish came off. Dont bother.
1.0,Too tight does not fit at all very disappointed
1.0,"These are terrible.  The jewels didnt stay on, so the rings are pretty much worthless, contacted seller with no response."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:c7818642b8878f46fe5fdf17a88e8521]]Not as advertised in pictures. Do not buy this. This pictures clearly show one side for license with a clear plastic pocket and the other side three slots for credit cards or other ID. What I received was both sides being the clear plastic pocket for a drivers license. This is completely worthless to me. This does not protect anything that has RFID embedded.
1.0,Dress has deodorant on it. Someone tried this on before me.
1.0,The bracelet arrived broken. It can’t be worn. The fine stitching between the beadwork is torn-no way to repair it. Such a disappointment.
1.0,"I ordered a 5x so it would be bigger then needed i got a 3x which is smaller then needed, its even small for a 3x"
1.0,returning!  snags all over it not even going to wear it as I can tell right now it’s not going to last. What two colors won’t even bother
1.0,Bad buy
1.0,"I liked the style and the color.  The fit was odd - large on top and as expected in the hips, but long.  The material was flimsy and would not hold up being in water aerobics three times a week.  I returned it."
1.0,"Sooo small, did not click closed. Returned"
1.0,"This bracelet looks good, however beware, if it falls it is going to shatter into pieces. I gave this as a gift to my husband & he loved it. It fell from him & shattered. He was so disappointed that I actually went and purchased the same bracelet again. It slipped from his hand & fell on his shoe and broke into pieces. He told me never to purchase it again. I'm so sorry I wasted my money TWICE!"
1.0,"The bag and box that come with these make them look expensive. Don't be fooled. The lenses feel flimsy and thin compared to the original lenses. Installation is easy, however the lenses don't fit snugly into the frames and make my once favorite glasses feel cheep.They are extremely difficult to get clean and get smudges off. Regretting this purchase."
1.0,cheap and broke very easy!
1.0,"MASSIVE disappointment!<br />Most of us know by now garments made in China run extremely small. We adjust by ordering up a size or two. Unfortunately, a work around like that does nothing to change the length for us, nor lack of fullness of this skirt.<br />Where to begin...<br />The &#34;Roseo&#34; color ordered does not resemble fuchsia/magenta tones of the photo. It is closer to hot pink/Barbie pink --Mac laptops are pretty good when it comes to color, and while monitors can be off slightly, this is not the case here. (The photos I have included were taken with an iPhone and even they don't accurately represent the Barbie pink color.)<br />Length of outer mesh/tulle skirt is 37&#34; as stated.This fabric is extremely soft with no heft or stiffness whatsoever. The under slip is approximately three inches shorter. Quite acceptable length & much better than coming only down to ones knees.<br />The waist, relaxed, measures at less than 12 inches. It stretches to 17&#34; accommodating several waist sizes; however, the model must be extremely petite in order to achieve the look in the photo! I'm 5'10&#34; so I had absolutely NO expectations that the skirt would even reach my ankles. I cannot &#34;ding&#34; the length because of my height. But what I DID expect was the amount of fabric depicted in the photo to be pretty darn close in reality!<br /><br />The fullness of the skirt is less than 1/3 of what is depicted in the seller's photo. I'm being generous to say three yards of mesh was used. Four would be pushing it. Not close by a long shot to the fullness of the photo! To top it off, once I tried it on and looked in the mirror I discovered a TEN INCH diagonal tear in the skirt very sloppily closed with a whip stitch. I've included two photos of this (with white cardboard behind the fabric for visual enhancement).<br />The seller offered a considerable discount for the skirt in return for my critique.  Even with the discount taken into account the skirt isn't even worth what I paid for it.  This is shoddy workmanship and a prime example of the bait & switch I've unfortunately experienced in the past.<br />How does something this horrible get past quality control inspectors? Why would a company send such a forlorn & damaged product out for review???  I'm baffled.<br />I absolutely cannot recommend this skirt unless it was to be used as the base of a costume or for a little girl's pretty princess dress up/playtime. If you chose to buy it in spite of my cautions, at least wait for it to be reduced by 80 to 90 percent."
1.0,The locket is very very flimsy. The chain already has black stripes because it is not real but I figured it wouldn’t come in black. The locket won’t stay closed because all the joints are way too loose. Even the locket has dark spots. DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
1.0,No me gusto en lo absoluto no amolda es como traer un velo el sobrepuesto la calidad de la tela es muy mala 👎
1.0,it bent as I tried to put it one. It bends as easily as a metal brad found on yellow mailing envelops. Don't waste your money on this one.
1.0,"I ordered this shirt twice, first time in a medium and the second time in a large... why is the large smaller than the medium? Medium fits but the large doesn’t at all..."
1.0,Received the wrong size. Returning the item.
1.0,"Got it for my siblings' baby shower. Ordered it 10 days before assuming that would be enough time. Nope. arrived 15 days after date of order. and is missing the letter ""L""."
1.0,Bought a size bigger than normal. Too small. I'm only 5foot 2 and this sweater was too short. Cheap looking too.
1.0,The picture's clearly show a backpack type bag. Suppose to have two string straps.. very miss leading
1.0,"sizing is way off. runs very small, doesn't look like the picture. poor quality."
1.0,The post were too big to fit in my ears. I have fairly large holes so…
1.0,Accidently ordered a big and tall.
1.0,Do not buy! Cheaply made and the hat is huge. I will have to buy something else as this was a waste of money.
1.0,El silicon d hombligo no es silicon
1.0,A size large is extra small. I returned it.
1.0,Dislike ! Poor quality
1.0,My shirt showed up smelling of fish/ mildew covered in actual mold i was able to wash it and remove the smell but material is cheap quality very thin
1.0,"These shoes are huge! I usually wear a 6.5 or 7. Ordered them in a 6.5 and they are giant. They look ridiculously large right of the box. Honestly, won't return for a smaller size because the visual appearance of these shoes is that of a clown."
1.0,Fuzzballs all over after first wash.
1.0,Didnt fit my watch
1.0,The bars for the clicker were defective instead of going up the clicker went down and I was unable to get it out of my nose. I was in pain all night before having to go to a tattoo shop. It took 2 hours and 50 dollars to have it removed. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!
1.0,"Very disappointed I only got them for like a week or so and they keep popping open and now won't even closed. I'm returning them. I'm mad cuz I really like the color, style and size but won't stay close."
1.0,"The purse is described as 10&#34; x 11&#34; x 1&#34;and the one I recieved was 6&#34; x 7&#34; x 1&#34;, which barely big enough for a small wallet and not at all near the full sized purse that I had ordered! . Also, The included card holder in the pictured has skulls on it but the one I recieved is a zebra pattern instead. The strap has a metal cheaper than what is used on the rest of the bag and it is much lighter in color and weight as well. I feel utterly ripped off and am currently pending a return request for this item. BECAUSE NONE OF THESE ISSUES ARE ACCEPTABLE! :(:(:("
1.0,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. When he opened he was so excited!! And it looked amazing....til about an hour later. All he did was put it on and open the rest of his presents and watch some tv on the couch, and it had started to pill all across the front. I would expect for this price the quality to be so much better than it is. I would never order from this seller again. BTW, the printing was like inside the material, so I really had such hopes for it."
1.0,Color is not true color it's lighter
1.0,"Gross. Cheap and Nasty. Never wore it, threw it out."
1.0,The sewing is terrible.  One pocket has a big hole and the other is unraveling even though I haven't washed it yet.  I was hoping to purchase another in a different color but am glad I chose to see one first - I will not buy another!
1.0,Too big! I looked like I had on a mumu!
1.0,It is really too small and doesn’t even cover your back. It seems like it is made for a 3 year old
1.0,Started using one but it does not stay put. It snaps off the watch continously which makes it useless. No value for your money.
1.0,"My wife purchased these. They are supposed to be machine washable, but the tag on the product says &#34;hand wash only&#34;.  Also, they are very thin/narrow.  They just are not what they advertised."
1.0,Poor Chinese sizing.  Not equivalent to US sizing.
1.0,The button fell off the first day.
1.0,Owned it for just over a month and straps are falling off and it is tearing at seams. I would never buy this again.
1.0,Shame that I purchased two sweaters and both should have been more than big enough but neither one was the true size stated in the advertisement
1.0,These glasses are far to large for any woman's face. I will not wear them.
1.0,"I got them on a Monday. i was wiping a smudge off the lens tuesday and the lens popped out and won't stay in now. I know they are a $20 pair of sunglasses so I didn't have high expectations, but falling apart within 24 hours is not good."
1.0,Shoes had a terrible odor....chemical or smoke smell that filled the room and burned my eyes.  Size on box was marked as 7H?  They were smaller than 7.5.
1.0,The clasp is plastic. Smh
1.0,"Looked and felt nothing like the picture, or the image of"
1.0,Felt good day one. By day two my feet are back to hurting
1.0,This shirt is so cute and I love the arms it’s too bad that it doesn’t last very long in the wash
1.0,Wife’s review- So so large. Sizes not realistic. I ordered a small and it fit like a large on me. The bust area was massive like I was supposed to have double ds. Plus it did not come delivered in time as guaranteed. It was prime and it came one day late...the day after I actually needed it. Returned.
1.0,I usually wear a large but ordered a 3x based on other reviews. They fit but are very loose. The fabric is the problem. It is shiny almost like satin. The khaki is peach not tan as pictured!
1.0,"These were so cute, but the silver ones broke only after wearing them 1 time I was so excited to get them and now I can't wear them."
1.0,I loved the way it looked.  I started with my normal size because the shoulders were extremely small.  I ordered two sizes larger.  The shoulder width NEVER changed.
1.0,Too much handling and the feathers were falling out. Not satisfied.
1.0,Most rediculous thing ever. This was packed into an 8x4 inch box. It was squished upward so badly that it looked like an upside down jelly fish. I’ve tried everything to get it to flatten out a little. Nothing works. It looks stupid sitting up on top of your head the way it is. I can’t wear it.
1.0,"But what I actually received looked like a men's gym shirt.  Its definitely not off the shoulder, or long to wear with leggings. The white seams show on the navy part of the shirt.  Its awful"
1.0,"I was very disappointed in this skirt. The waist fits okay, but the skirt itself is probably 4+ inches too short - and I'm not a tall person. I'm 5'4&#34;. It hits well above my ankles, which is not what the picture shows. The fabric is also extremely thin and there is no slip or lining, so you can see right through to my underpants - or even a white shirt when tucked in. I thought I saw someone's review photo of a lining on their skirt so I was surprised the one I got didn't have anything. The stitching at the waist band is all janky - not straight at all. It's lopsided and overlapping stitches. The elastic isn't anchored to anything so the pleats bunch up in areas.<br /><br />And I can't even return it because someone threw out the original packaging."
1.0,"I bought one pair of Izod jeans for my husband a month ago.  He liked how comfortable they are, so I ordered 2 more pair.  They arrived STINKING of fabric softener.  They are now on their second vinegar wash.  If this does not work I will be sending them back!"
1.0,"The description states &#34;...this hat is actually made from raccoon, with a racoon tail.” This is not true, it is a rather cheap fake fur cap with a very small and skinny raccoon tail attached to it. Very disappointing."
1.0,I did not know nor did you state that this item was made in China.  I will be wary of other products.
1.0,"This is a cute ring, but false advertising. This is not sterling silver. It will turn your finger blue. Extremely disappointed. I will never buy from this seller again."
1.0,The crystal is plastic! So upsetting!
1.0,"Fabric is very thin, color is not same as shown in the picture. i ordered medium size but it was too small :("
1.0,"Very thin fabric, no sunblocking whatsoever. I paid $70 to Amazon and the tag that was attached to the umbrella was for $ 34.99 from The Christmas Tree Shop. WHAT A DEAL!!!  Now I see this year is over 100.00 BUYER BEWARE- very cheap looking more like a beach umbrella."
1.0,I loved the material...but it was short waisted
1.0,I ordered this August 25  and here it is October 4th and haven't seen this item along with the other items I bought from this vender. I asked for tracking and they gave me a bogus number that did not work. I just hope it actually come because it looks cute. Will not buy from vender again.
1.0,"Very poor quality, very poor material and size is way off!"
1.0,"Way too expensive to have this happen..... The black accents, I can't tell what it's made of, spread black stuff all over the shorts and won't come out.<br /><br />They super cute otherwise.<br /><br />Going to write the company and see what happens."
1.0,"Would not have ordered this item if I realized it was so small.  Only 1/2 inch.  That was my fault as it does say in the description it is only 16mm.  The photo of the pull online is enlarged so much that I thought I was getting something I could easily read and see, but it is only the size of a dime.  Too small for what I wanted, very disappointing."
1.0,I do not wear this watch every day I have a lot of watches  in my Arsenal. I may have worn it 5 ×  and wash my hands with it on and careful not to get it wet and it is already fogging up and dials are no longer viewable.  It said water resistant.  It is not at all.
1.0,This was not new! It has the worst armpit smell I’ve ever smelled in my life! That is very disgusting and unprofessional .
1.0,It’s not like a tee shirt it’s like a horrible silky shirt<br />Does not fit well and will prob never wear it
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:d2ff002da3dc67d2736b6826c8a8da66]] El producto llegó roto, y la tela es tan liviana que no puede colocarse nada en los bolsillos"
1.0,Horns were fine but the fork was broken.
1.0,"Nothing but cheaply made &#34;junk&#34;. My fault, felt for it. top kind of a loose, sleeves, each different wide, NOTHING!! what picture present."
1.0,The boobs were too close together
1.0,Not sure if we are gonna be able to get that cleaned off the white leayher but the red dye on the wool bled!!!
1.0,"I didn’t like the length; the material, or how it flowed."
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Very unflattering and the feel of fabric is itchy and strange.
1.0,"The seems came off easily after only washing once. After that, it was just a mess and is now completely useless. It was a lovely shirt though."
1.0,This product is extremely cheap. The scallops don’t stay up at all. They are all over the place. It would be cute if it actually looked like the picture. But sadly it doesn’t
1.0,"I have multiple products from copper fit, including other compression socks.  These are very tight at the top. I had to take them off only 5 hours of wearing them. Maybe it was only this pair."
1.0,Class broke on first wear<br /><br />Good thing I didn’t leave the house yet
1.0,It was too small even though I purchased it a size bigger
1.0,Ordered the gloves and right hand was rip seems to have bad quality stitching reorder same gloves and sent me a smaller size.. I don't recommend these gloves poor quality
1.0,Very comfortable I like them
1.0,It came smaller than size ordered!
1.0,Wasn’t what I thought
1.0,"Just over 30 days and the balls separated from the studs.  I imagined that the little crystals would fall out before that happened. I never took them off, so they weren’t really “handled” much to cause them to break off."
1.0,Not what I was expecting. Very disappointed.
1.0,"$8.99? You've gotta be kidding me. The moment--the very moment--I opened the package, half of the earrings fell apart. The cutesy little charm was stuck (if you can call it that) to the hard metal clasp with that same sticky glue-like substance used on junk mail. Junk mail! Half of the earrings useless (although I'm sure a hot-glue gun could do a better job that this company), I put one of the few remaining pairs on my poor little sister's ears, and within several minutes, her ears were red and sore. I'd be more liable to pay the same amount of money for a single pair of sterling silver earrings of better quality at Claire's. (And, yes, I know Claire's products are probably no better quality-wise, but they work! Take it from the girl who's been wearing the same pair of their clip-on earrings for the past eight years!) This is outrageous!<br />On a side note, the case is decent and the bracelet has (so far) stayed intact. I'm shocked, to be honest. They make better products for Dollar Tree!"
1.0,"I saw prior reviews about being smaller than intended, so I ordered a size LARGER & it STILL was too small! As soon as I got it zipped the seam in the back popped! The material & packaging seemed nice when I first opened package, but this was not a good purchase at all."
1.0,This shirt was very stiff out the bag. May have been better after a wash but I wasn't prepared to take that chance.
1.0,"Un pantalon no acorde con lo que se requeria, se ve muy ordinario las costuras hacia el exterior, queda todo suelto y ancho, nos dimos cuenta que comprar ropa no vale la pena hacerlo por Amazon."
1.0,Old navy sells these for a few bucks. Nice try though
1.0,Terrible product. Cheap materials. Looks lame. Should have saved this money to light a cigar instead. Leather feels extremely cheap.
1.0,"This order was cancelled and I Didn't cancel it!!!!! For some reason, my order was cancelled and I was very unhappy because I loved this print!!"
1.0,"I Purchased a 34DD and it is way too small! Doesn't cover full and I could barely breathe, too tight. Need to return and probably won't try aother size in this bra"
1.0,The ankle elastic is way too tight. Had to cut and replace it. Whose baby has thin ankles?
1.0,Way too small for a 4
1.0,Cheap looking I returned it
1.0,"In the picture, this dress falls right at the knee. This was superrr long and went to my daughter’s ankles. I was bummed about the sizing and the material. It was not great."
1.0,Way to small from my normal size. Way more fuzY that. Picture looks like wearing a bathrobe
1.0,"I agree with the negative reviews.  Wish I had read these before I bought.  Especially maddening was the fact that you couldn't review the purchase, so wound up paying for twice as much as you wanted."
1.0,Horrible quality!! Clasp won't even stay closed and the settings are all over the place. See photos. Returning this item.
1.0,Sizing is way off. I bought a 4/5T and it really is made to fit a 1 year old.
1.0,Been using for only a couple of months and the stitching is starting to come apart.
1.0,glue broke off
1.0,There is no one I know that this would be considered a dress on. So short!!it is also extremely tight in the arms. Was sent back ASAP

1.0,"Supposed to be 18 k gold, HA, what a joke, turned my wife's ears black and they got infected. Don't buy these earrings!!!!!"
1.0,"I'm a size small, sometimes medium. These were very baggy in the front. I returned them."
1.0,Didn’t like that the straps didn’t stay in place they kept falling. It has no support on the chest area
1.0,It looks nice and the package was super cute but it won’t last. I gifted this to my daughter on graduation day and a few hours later two charms had fallen off. She hasn’t worn it since so it was a waste of money!
1.0,They are too difficult to attach.
1.0,"The item itself is an awesome concept. However, the suction cups provided with the item are not strong enough and continue to make the drape fall causing a bigger mess than if you weren’t to use one in the first place."
1.0,They was extremely too small. Wasn't what I expected
1.0,This dress is very small... The fit is really off as well. Unfortunately I will be returning :(
1.0,to small for size avg. go up 2 sizes when ordering
1.0,Very disappointed. Read reviews and decided I’d try these dresses.the fit was horrible and the material was really cheap.its a costume nothing else.
1.0,Where do i start. The dress looks like it was made by children. The stitching quality is atrocious. Bits of cotton and material here there and everywhere. And don't get me started on the material. This dress on a whole was like some third grade project gone wrong.
1.0,just opened up the package and the top half was pulled away from the bolton half!!!
1.0,It's gray not blue. I wanted blue.
1.0,Not a real Casio product. It will not fit what it is designed for. This product is falsely advertised.
1.0,The brand is NOT Fiber...and the design is not wonder woman.
1.0,"This is a bull crap buy. Don't help at all,don't waste your money like I did."
1.0,Not going to buy again. Cheap quality
1.0,"What we received was not even what was pictured.  It was a completely different pattern.  Also, the quality of the rubber was very poor-the colors were cloudy as if it had been sitting in a storeroom for ten years decaying.  Unfortunately, due to a family emergency and then an evacuation for Hurricane Florence, I missed the return window.  Please do not buy this product.  Save your money."
1.0,be careful washing this it-shrunk and now fits my 8 year old grand daughter
1.0,"The picture is great, the product is just ""ok"". The cords that wrap together to make the necklace were frayed when I got it, and after wearing it one time one of the cords came out of the clasp so I had to remove it completely. Guess I got what I paid for, because it is not great quality."
1.0,"It's a polyester blend. I hated the fabric, and it was too big and boxy. I ordered a medium."
1.0,"I can only review what I got.<br />But first let me start by saying that I got the wrong item. The one I got didn't have any pearls. I figured I would give it a try, besides for less than 2 dollars I didn't have much to loose. & I should keep it & make the best out of my situation. I graved it & just as I was about to put it in my head one of the sides snapped off. Very cheep material. I contacted the seller. I send them a picture if their material & they told me &#34; in this cases we give refunds &#34; this was over a week ago. Until today amazon hasn't send me an email confirming the refund. But for less than 2 dollars it's not even worth the arguing."
1.0,His broke in a day. Hers broke in 2 days.<br />2nd set: Both in the same day. Cute idea
1.0,"To small, like the other jackets, jeans, shirts that I've ordered. All too small,  won't be ordering again. , cheap fabric and isn’t even a coat. don’t order from them, it’s a waste of time and money."
1.0,"Just like everyone else said, the top isn't adjustable AT ALL. I ordered the smallest size and it was still loose and ill-fitting everywhere."
1.0,"At first glance, the coat fit well and looked nice, just a little wrinkled. But I quickly noticed crumbs in the pocket and stains on the sleeve. If you're going to advertise your clothing as new, make sure it's actually new. Will be returning.<br />Unfortunately, this coat is exactly what I need for a Halloween costume and I will most likely end up trying to buy it again if I cannot find an adequate alternative."
1.0,Not much thicker than gauze. Think I'll use it as a tapestry instead. Oh well. Live and learn !
1.0,The ears are too heavy and keeps pulling the hat back.
1.0,The photo is zoomed in. The bottom of the mask does not fit as pictured. My mask has discolored spots on it. I waited nearly a month for this mask and it does not look like the skyline as pictured. I was very disappointed when receiving this mask and was so excited to get it today and unfortunately I will be more cautious and read reviews more before hand! Hope this helps the next person.
1.0,It was cheap and didn’t not fit.
1.0,"I ordered these for my 12 year old niece, I selected the size for teen girls. I'd be surprised if they even fit my 6 year old daughter. They are way too small."
1.0,Absolutely nothing like product. Wanted to wear to my daughter's formal High School cheer banquet but dress looks like witches Halloween costume.
1.0,The balls came of after only wearing for two hours. Very cheap. Had to return.
1.0,"I knew I had to set my expectations low for the price, but not that low! None of the jewels were attached straight/aligned with the back, some were missing the ‘metal’ color. Overall quality was so poor that I figured I may wear maybe 7 of the 30 pairs and that did not justify keeping them."
1.0,I ordered a 3x because thats what size I normally wear and it fitted terrible.
1.0,"These shirts are uncomfortable and are not good for people who sweat a lot. They get stained easily. I recommend buying bamboo material shirts, which more flexibility and do not stain."
1.0,"Supossed to be one size fit all, but it was too loose for my wife's size 5 feet.<br />So absolutely no compression.<br />Thus of no use.<br />Thus returned."
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture.  Fits like a pajama top.  Pockets make hips look very wide.  Smaller than size ordered
1.0,"Amazon excellent in terms of shipping.<br /><br />The belt looks great, includes a tool to make the belt change, also includes a pair of quick-release bolts, only that there is a problem with those bolts, one does not have a lever and when I do not have I cannot use the belt, I cannot use normal ones either because it does not have room for manipulation. That bad."
1.0,"Bought this shirt for my husband for our wedding. Bought an XXXL. Tag said it was a 3X. But it was so small!! He couldn't even come close to buttoning it up. It actually fit my 14 year old perfectly.  Cute shirt, just obscenely small"
1.0,The gold look old. Almost like rose gold but look fake.
1.0,The fabric of the product is not cotton. I don't like the material. :(
1.0,I just received these gloves within 10 minutes or less. String started coming loose  and a hole in one of the fingers
1.0,The bracket keeps untying I hate them didn't know at the time I could of returned them so they went two trash also the heart stuck two everything
1.0,I don’t know how anyone can walk in these? They are insanely uncomfortable
1.0,Very sorry i made this purchase.  Terrible quality.
1.0,Very thin and cheaply made. I’m sending it back.
1.0,Its like wearing a bad pad
1.0,It was cheap and tacky looking in person so I never used it.
1.0,Fabric is so bad that calling it disposable is too kind.
1.0,Made very cheap looking!!! Wasn’t like the picture at all!!!
1.0,Cannot wear any of them. The first broke my wrist out. Tried another and it was worse. I washed them all with soap and water before wearing and they still had this effect.
1.0,"I'm not even going to waste my time taking pictures of this junk. This is the cheapest of cheap costume jewelry.<br /><br />Think of the 25 cents vending machines outside of stores that sell junky trinkets for kids. That is about the quality of these pieces.<br /><br />I had low expectations to begin with and was still disappointed in what I received.<br /><br />If this cost a dollar and you were getting it for a child, it would be OK. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money on this junk."
1.0,"Okay, there's a section that asked how does it fit. The options they had their we're not working for me to explain the fit of the skirt. Now this skirt looks nothing like orff it's nothing like it does this lady in the picture I am 5 9 and a half away 866 lb I got the skirt in a medium because other buyers said to get it a size down because of the elastic waistband. Which isn't the problem the problem is it does not flare the skirt just hangs there. If you look at the picture the lady has her hands in your pockets she's making a skirt flare the the skirt is flat and boring I do not like it I gave it to my daughter."
1.0,"Honestly....really crappy quality and not comfortable. I have a very thin face and this thing barely fit me. Spare yourself and get something else. Also, not breathable."
1.0,No stretch too small
1.0,Doesn't look anything like the picture and the material is thin and cheap.  The fit is all wrong.  Waste of money.
1.0,Not so straight like the photo I didn’t like the material much
1.0,The stitching came undone within a few days of use.  I bought this as a gift and was embarrassed when she showed me how it was falling apart.  The pictures from other reviewers are very much what she showed me.
1.0,For beach or pool but not for going in out because is see through
1.0,"This was so disappointing. Poor quality, super thin and had loose strings all over. It also was significantly smaller than pictured. I ended up returning it."
1.0,"These pants are soft and comfortable but they do this weird bunch thing in the front. For women who have a big pouch below their stomach, these pants may be a good choice but not for anyone with a relatively flat stomach.<br />I am super bummed because I was very excited about these pants"
1.0,Not good quality. Straps were ripped off when I got it with a gaping hole in the side.<br />Straps that are attached don't stay tight and loosen on their own. Not a good product. Only people who think this would be good are people who never have had a good backpack.. And then the customer service is even worse. Smfh
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH!!!  The company is very small and will charge you $35 restocking and shipping to return a watch that doesn't work.  I received it for Christmas and the watch will NOT sync with my iPhone 8 nor does it accurately measure your sleep, workouts, or calories.  In fact, it almost doubles your steps for a day.<br /><br />STAY AWAY from this product and company unless you want to throw money away.  It is a neat concept but the watch just doesn't work.  And it is evident the company has no regard for customer service because you can't talk to anyone when you call.  All you can do is leave a voicemail and they do NOT return your phone calls."
1.0,"Ughh tried 2 times. Both times the criss cross straps were uneven,meaning 1 longer than the other.<br />It also has a very big boxy cut. Very unflattering.  Waste of money."
1.0,Worn for 2 hours and the seam fell apart up the side.  Luckily I was close to home so I could change.
1.0,I loved this sweatshirt till a month in it started getting holes warn in it with very  light use. Very disappointing.
1.0,It was definitely not oversized or long. Fit more like a crop top.
1.0,"Wow, they are easy to break.....why is amazon selling these as indestructible?  Do not buy."
1.0,Not that quality as expected
1.0,"I understand these bracelets are meant to absorb negative energy “ojo” and unravel and fall off, but the actual quality is poorly made and unravels fast."
1.0,"The lining of these leggings is not Sherpa, or even soft for that matter! The fit is weird, too short. Overall, not recommended."
1.0,This fit nothing like the picture and the seems were in an awkward place. It was uncomfortable and poorly made. Sent it back.
1.0,Love how the watch look but the pieces on the band just feel off in 4 days of having it
1.0,"The product does not have a size listed with it.  I would have liked to order it but, I am not going to take the time or spend the money on something that I don't know if it will fit or not."
1.0,This is child's size earring
1.0,Didn’t fit size was wrong<br />Item was for a child
1.0,longer than what I expected. useless to me
1.0,Tiny!  I got large and they fit my daughter who wears little girl size 8years old. Do not recommend
1.0,Esta compra nunca lo he recibido todavía estoy esperando
1.0,"After waiting 3 months to get here from China I had 4 masks fall apart in the first hour, the ear straps ripped off."
1.0,The fabric is very scratchy. I could tell it was made from cheap materials. If you're 5'5&#34; don't buy these gloves. They were about 2 cm too long for my fingers so I could barely use the touchscreen function of the gloves.
1.0,beware the top is 100% see through......
1.0,Beware that you will only get one set - one top and one bottom.  When I wrote a negative review previously it was declined.  Let's see if this one gets posted.  Deceptive description.
1.0,backs were to small very cheap
1.0,I purchased the black and if it were blue I could pass for Grover from Sesame Street. It is fur like and not in a good way.
1.0,"One of the worst pieces of clothing up on Amazon. There’s not even remotely look close to the photo, the material is extremely cheap. And there was no return policy. Waste of time and money"
1.0,Do not like that yo have to bend one of the arms to insert bead/pompom.  Doesnt go back together
1.0,came broken and very long
1.0,Was entirely see-through and not appropriate to wear in public
1.0,While the design on the landward is cute...the little clip at the end of the lanyard is cheap metal and not to be trusted to hold your keys.
1.0,Zipper broke the second time I zipped it
1.0,"I'm not sure that I can even express how disappointing this bracelet is. It already looks slightly tarnished. The bar part is barely 1 inch long. It is so flimsy it looks like it will snap if you even take it out of the package. Since it was only $20 I wasn't expecting it to be the best bracelet I've ever seen, but I am pretty sure the velvet bag it came in is worth more than the bracelet. I have found better quality items in gumball machines."
1.0,Not at all what I expected. Ordered the small. For a Halloween costume. I have tiny hands but these were so big. They are a good 2 inches too long in the fingers. Also not very well made. I was expecting nicely fitted gloves. Unhappy with this purchase.
1.0,it looked nothing like the photo at all when i wen to return it it was too late
1.0,Pants are terrible they don’t look like the pic above
1.0,Not even week of light use and handles ripped at base
1.0,Trying to adjust the size is a real pain. They just keep resetting to the smallest size witch is for an infant
1.0,"I ordered 5 size mediums and 2 size larges all in the color khaki, the larges are a different color then the mediums for whatever reason. I need all of them to match considering I bought them for my bridesmaids. So is there any way they can be exchanhed for the correct color so they match?"
1.0,The picture shows a high waist but it was not high.  Plus it has a thin elastic band that barely keeps the waist up.  No drawstring to adjust so pants don’t ride down.
1.0,"The skirt is nice but is too small in waist, I ordered my normal size, I'm really disappointed."
1.0,Do not buy
1.0,The top just barely fit my dress which left me with no waist.  The skirt part was too huge.  Not worth sending back because it would cost me more in shipping.  So Goodwill makes out again.
1.0,Nothing like the picture. Fits like normal cardigan or sweater not like the picture at all
1.0,Received my items and was very disappointed in the product!  Item that was received was nothing like the item pictured here on amazon!  Color was a mint green not a military green!
1.0,cheap stuffs guess you get what you pay for
1.0,Believe others when they say this bracelet smells bad. Made my whole room smell like mildew.
1.0,These parts were so thin and so small I sent it back right away.
1.0,Sizing inaccurate.
1.0,"First of all it is too large, looks I did put myself into a large black bag, has no shape like in the picture at all.  The fabric is too thick so you get hot in like 2 minutes.  It looks well finished but don't expect to look like in the picture."
1.0,"This has is not a men's neck scarf. Clearly it is designed for women, a disappointment!"
1.0,"Earrings look like they came from the beauty supply store for 2.99. They wasn’t shipped in a box, leading to bent backing upon arrival. Save your money! Returned immediately!"
1.0,Im a 2xl. Bought a 3xl. Couldnt even get into it. Was super tiny. While advertised as a winter hoodie. It is very thin. It is a light pullover at best.
1.0,Ridiculously small!!!
1.0,"Ordered a (adult) men's XL, it came with a 2XL tag, and fit like a men's SM/MED - could barely fit it over my head/shoulders. Returning"
1.0,"Ordered two pairs same size. One pair is too small and the other fits, but such cheap looking. Not worth the money"
1.0,Terrible. The lens was scratched. The arms were hard to open and close. Don't waste your money on these like I did.
1.0,"It is just a piece of square cloth, neck is super small and does not fall on your shoulders like in the picture, is not very comfortable and not stylish as it appears. I am returning it."
1.0,Shirts are way smaller than advertised
1.0,I couldn't get the plastic off off one side. Have to throw it away.
1.0,The only thing that changed color was me when I realized I'd spent $56 on a ... what? Not simulated Alexandrite that's for sure. Purple plastic maybe? Avoid. Terrible purchase.
1.0,"Product would have worked well with costume for Halloween, but had to return medallion because there was no necklace to wear the medallion.  Would have kept purchase if chain had been included, but as it was not worth what I paid for it."
1.0,It Doesn’t Glow in the Dark after wearing it the whole day.
1.0,"The sweater looked cute in the pictures, runs small. Thread is hanging in random places and it seems like it’ll come apart any minute. Not worth the price."
1.0,"if you are a swimmer like me don't waist your money here. i bought 2 and just a few months ago. they are now useless the fabric has loose all the elastic and they are no longer fit. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SWIMM WITH THEM.<br /><br />i think it could be great at first time because of the price but really poor quality.<br /><br />if you SWIMM DON'T BUY THIS PANTS, GO WITH THE SPEEDO ENDURANCE +"
1.0,Was not happy at all it's not 1 inch it is smaller than 1 inch and very lightweight it seems like it is not glass more like clear acrylic very unsatisfactory more like plastic will never order again
1.0,These are terrible. It’s cheap tape image folded on top of a bracelet. It’s wrinkled and worthless and we are returning immediately.
1.0,The quality of the product is very poor and in mmm very disappointed .
1.0,loved these boots. just what i wanted. style was perfect.down side was they don't come in wide calf size for us goddesses.
1.0,Sent it back the sizing was way off
1.0,The socks where nowhere near what it is pictured. They look like very cheaply made pantihose. I also ordered a pair of Vitalsox and those were great! I am disappointed in these Go2 socks.
1.0,"Terrible quality, zipper dosent work and the slip is so short you can so all the goodies."
1.0,Don't waste your money it is a piece of junk very flimsy.
1.0,When I bought them I always go a size up due to my big bottom. However this one didn't fit me at all. They didn't Stretch at all.
1.0,These were very thin and poorly made. Not worth the price. I would be something more for a dollar store item.
1.0,"This particular item is too short, it keeps coming unstuck from my pants."
1.0,Zipper broke the second time my wife used it could not recommend
1.0,Very bad quality paint on the band.<br />The paint came off as soon as I put it on my watch. The band is slightly touching the rim of the watch and as I was putting the watch on my hand it rubbed slightly against the watch rim and the paint came right off. Please see the attached picture.
1.0,Charms already falling off out of package. Cheaply<br />made. Would not recommend.
1.0,this is quite weird that the watch is not working in the entirety of my possession. Never recommend anyone to buy this watch.
1.0,An overall great robe but the stitching started coming off a week after my wife had it and now it broke and we decided to throw it out
1.0,Item is made with poor quality material. It also smells bad.
1.0,"Very disappointed, the chain length is very short, not at all what the picture implies. Sad because the leaf is pretty."
1.0,"This is not easy to use. In fact, I find it useless. It does not work for me. It was a waste of money."
1.0,I would really like a smaller one
1.0,"Looks cute from far away and belt fits well -- but, bow is extremely cheap and you will look cheap close up. The bottom of the ribbon is not sealed, so it came out of the box fraying, with strings hanging everywhere. Probably will completely unravel within a few wears.  Returning!"
1.0,Collar unsewn/unraveled
1.0,This is not a sweatshirt. It’s silky and very bland looking
1.0,"I had this chain for maybe two days and it already broke. No one pulled it or anything. It actually broke without my knowledge and because of that, I lost my favorite rose quartz pendant. :( I have bought other chains from this same seller that lasted a lot longer, but this one was a huge disappointment."
1.0,very light-colored and barely visible. The contrast on this photo has been significantly turned up. It looks faded and cheap. I look like the worst cult leader ever.
1.0,Pants fit perfectly but the top is too small... he loves the pants but can’t wear it as a set
1.0,More of a shirt than a dress and very sheer. Not what I expected
1.0,"This shirt is totally unlike any shirt I've ever worn. The buttons are sewn onto the left side, while the button holes are on the right side. The illustration on the website has been flipped 180 degrees side to side from the shirt I received. This caused me a bit of consternation when I first attempted to put it on. Yes, I could put it on but the simple act of buttoning it took some real effort on my part, Unbuttoning it will drive any man insane. The material is soft and I thought the blue color was very nice. However, I must say the quality of the construction is poor. There are numerous loose threads, the stitching is not even and the threads attaching the buttons needs to be trimmed. The fit felt somewhat ""off"" – it's not too large or too small, it just doesn't have the right proportions. Are we sure this is a man's shirt?"
1.0,The material is not flattering on. I bought a size up because I normally have a problem with shirts like this over my chest and the material gapping. and it was still too small and I could not wear it. The front was too low cut for me and the material was not soft and seems not well put together.
1.0,"Looks to be an OEM Samsung Gear S3 Silicone band, albeit an import/non-US version BUT the description said BLACK, I wanted BLACK, so I ordered BLACK, but I got dark blue/navy.  Unfortunately, I didn't realize it until I went to switch my old, worn-out band after some travel and I am now beyond the return period.  So-- item was NOT as described and I am NOT happy.  Get your Gear gear elsewhere."
1.0,I am extremely dissapointed in these  earrings. They look so elegant and classy in the pic. I got them yesterday and they are so  cheap looking..Very dissapointed. Now I must find a new pair for my son's wedding in a week.
1.0,The quality of this dress was horrible! I ordered 2 sizes to big (size 24) and when it shipped it came (size 10) and the fabric it self was completely see through.
1.0,"This dress is too short, a size too small, and poor quality (It ripped the first time I tried it on)."
1.0,did not like the material. felt weird.
1.0,Discolored and not a stone
1.0,"I ordered a size 14/16 for my 12 year old. They arrived today and were marked, ""youth large"". They are very, very small. I am guessing that they would probably fit an 8 year old."
1.0,I got a half size larger and it was too tight.  The top of shoe was not wide enough.
1.0,Way too small!!!!! Poor quality.
1.0,They were wayyyy to tight for my toddler
1.0,"I had hopes for this - I even ordered 2-3 sizes up from my normal size,  No way the sizing is correct, material was extremely thin, and not as long as in the picture.  I returned this."
1.0,this wallet fell apart very quickly I didnt get to use it but for a week
1.0,Had these on the car for 3 days and as my wife was driving around 50 mph the drivers side antler snapped off from the base into the road.. Waste of money as it only lasted 72 hours.. These should be able to withstand freeway speeds if they are to be sold to consumers... Very Disappointed in this product..
1.0,Lenses are very loose in frames and pop out with normal movement.. Would not recommend
1.0,Awkward fit. Cheaply made.
1.0,Outer shell is poorly constructed!  First time trying on jacket ripped the under arm seam.  It was almost as if the cloth and thread had dry rotted! Also the shoulders are too narrow.  This is an Extra Large which fits more like a Medium.
1.0,"VERY CHEAP, WOULD NOT RECOMMEND"
1.0,Cheaply made. The segura me stitching shows and looks cheap!!!!!!!
1.0,This top is nothing like the photos. Don’t buy. I wanted to save some money and buy this to go out. I was very unsatisfied.
1.0,"It says it's a pack of 6, but it's only 1. DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,"Broke and fell apart after first use. Had high hopes, guess you get what you pay for"
1.0,Poor quality dress
1.0,"My son was very disappointed with the mask, we didn’t know the mask required assembly and that the item is made of foam. I would not have purchased the item had I known this. It doesn’t cover your face, you can see right through it."
1.0,"According to the size chart the XL size robe should fit ... but I wanted an extra roomy robe and I ordered an XXL robe just to be sure.  WHAT A TERRIBLE FIT !!!  Although my waist is SEVERAL inches smaller than the XXL theoretically should accommodate -- the robe just barely closes around the waist.  The sleeves might be okay if the person wearing the robe had EXTREMELY skinny arms -- I'm NOT a body builder or gym bunny, but I could barely force my arms into the sleeves -- they were way too tight.  The dimensions almost seem random ... or they used a very tall & skinny model and randomly guessed at their size chart information.<br /><br /> The length was SEVERAL inches too long for me to wear without tripping if I climbed stairs, so I had it shortened before ever wearing it -- too bad, I cannot return it."
1.0,Way to small order like 3 sizes up
1.0,I took the wording of the description to mean misses size 7/8.  It was way too small for my daughter.
1.0,Very Poor and blurry graphics despite good quality shirt. Cannot even read the words around center of shirt. would not recommend.
1.0,"cheap, light,"
1.0,Well they ripped the first time I wore them so not happy with the purchase. They were a little small but not to the point where they should have ripped.
1.0,Very cheaply made. Only had them in for a week and the stones came out and the metal started tarnishing. Would not recommend!
1.0,Returned it!! This jumpsuit does not drape your body as pictured. It is very snug...and not in a good way!! The sleeves nor the legs draped as the picture at all. Don't waste your money!!
1.0,"I placed an order for 3 of these sports bras.  Received them, loved them.  They fit perfectly - I was SO happy!  I placed second order for 5 more (same size).  Got them and they are all WAY too tight.  At least 2"" smaller than the first order.  The dumb thing is . . . there's no sizing label or imprint on the bra.  I have no clue if whoever picked the order grabbed the correct size.  I'm very disappointed. :("
1.0,"Sized very small.  I ordered a women's medium just to be on the safe side.  I normally wear a women's small.  I couldn't even button this shirt.  I gave it to my 10 year old daughter, who isn't very big, and she could wear it."
1.0,I misunderstood thinking it came with all 5 varieties. It is for just one of the 30pieces.
1.0,Way too small no room for any volume
1.0,"This product did not fit the age/child it was meant for. Too big, poor quality"
1.0,"It was billed as an orthopedic walking shoe, it is definitely  not. The velcro pops open my ankles felt worse after wearing g these than they did when I wear flip flops."
1.0,"These supposed &#34;gemstones&#34; are nothing but cheap, frosted glass beads manufactured in China. Some of the beads still have the factory nibs sticking out of them. What a waste of time. The picture looks like real gemstones and judging by some of the reviews, perhaps some other people got real gemstones, but mine were junk.<br />Edited: Second thought-the other 3 reviews look questionable..."
1.0,"I wanted to contribute so I bought this bag. I did NOT get the bag that is pictured. Since I don’t want to walk around with a bag that says AIDS on it...which is what I got...I do not use this bag. It’s just sitting in my closet. I didn’t want to return because its a good cause. So don’t expect to get what is pictured....Cause you won’t get it more than likely. They should at least say, “various styles.”"
1.0,"They look, and feel, heavy. Definitely not the &#34;light&#34; earrings feel that sterling silver provides. I don't know what these are made of, but they are NEVER going in my ear lobes. Very disappointing. 😕"
1.0,Big scratch on lens. Very cheaply made
1.0,I ordered usually wear a small but I brought a medium just in case it runs small and the jacket could no get across my body it smaller than xsmall. Would not recommend!!!
1.0,I don't mind cheap but I do have a limited to cheap an this is Sooo dollar tree cheap! Like child's  toy for a dollar..... more like 25 cents at a yard sale !!! NO STARS!!!
1.0,"These pants are SOOOOO small! I would have to order like 2 sizes up for them to actually fit, I had to return them. I am 5'8'' and weigh 170 and an usually a size 10 or 12, I bought a large, but need a 2x to fit. The fabric is kinda silky, which I am not sure if I like either."
1.0,Awful.<br />Dress is completely see through.
1.0,It’s Paper Thin & Doesn’t Stay On. It comes off yr head EVERY MORNING. The bonnet was on my pillow longer than it was on my head. Had to return it. It’s not double lined either (but in their defense they never said it was.)
1.0,Too bad the color comes off.
1.0,"I ordered this ring in a size 10. The ring that came was labeled with a tag as a size 10, but it was not a size 10. My husband wears a size 11 and this ring was larger than his wedding ring. Not only was the sizing incorrect, but the mood strip was incredibly poor quality. It was absolutely beautiful at first but after minimal wear it was immensely scratched up. I understand wear and tear but this was not typical wear and tear. I am so disappointed because it truly is a beautiful ring!"
1.0,I’m a nail tech and I bought these because I have issues with the glasses I had fogging with my mask and I bought these with high hopes but they do fog up and it really sucks because I need my mask for nail dust and I need eye wear for nail dust as well.
1.0,"Ordered them thinking it would fit like a regular piercing, it does not. Wouldn't order this is you dont have some ear piercings to near small gauge size."
1.0,"Muy pequeño, como para una niña, ni siquiera me lo pude entrar en el rostro, a nadie adulto le sirve, una pérdida de dinero."
1.0,Poor quality fabric. However cute to wear around in the house for “Him”.
1.0,This is an absolute joke. The worst quality in every aspect! My wife completed the return within 1 minute after she opened the package. We were actually laughing at the poor quality. We even had to pay to ship it back!
1.0,"I bought this watch for work because I'm I health care and I thought it would be easy to clean. It is,but the face cracked in two places with in a week. I'm not sure if this was just an old watch but I expected more out of a swatch product."
1.0,"It fit perfectly, but the material is terrible. Didn’t look like the picture and is very stiff. Maybe a wash will help?"
1.0,It was a lot cheaper looking and light as a feather. I was very disappointed
1.0,The earing fell apart once I open the package
1.0,"This mask looks really cool. However when we received it out of the package it was all folded up, was stuck together, and smelled like fish bait. Very disappointing…"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:4007af4243a48431b05e5e7dda2cdb09]] Very disappointed please see attached video . You get what you pay for. I will be returning this. click the comment to view video
1.0,This mask it awful! It has no wire piece to fit over the nose and the fabric comes to a point and just hangs there. No different than wearing a cheap bandanna.
1.0,different sizes very unhappy
1.0,Very cheaply made I wouldn't spend the money on this item
1.0,"The iron on “ONE” looks cheap, she didn’t even wear it since it looks so cheap and bad"
1.0,"Terrible quality fabric- basically felt like tissue paper. Also very thin. The lace was not white, but instead off white which made it look dingy."
1.0,Its good but toooo small
1.0,Too small and turned color
1.0,"The band size is ok.  Cups are tiny and have no give.  It's like trying to fit a melon where a tangerine should go.  Wearing this with a tee shirt, it looks like I have four boobs."
1.0,I was expecting great time keeping with the 6R15 movement but the watch I received was running +/-10 minutes per hour. This isn't an exaggeration. I had to return the watch. A real shame for such a stunning looking seiko diver.
1.0,It’s too frustrating to buy it. This is my second time buy it. I have to return it again. Too small. I don’t even know what is my size now.
1.0,This sweater was ripped in three places when I got it
1.0,"Received item broken, it wasn’t even round in shape and the plastic is very cheap. That’s what you get for the price, I guess."
1.0,Horrible! Way too big. Not the same as the photo! Not even tie dye.
1.0,The quality of the product was lacking. I was not impressed.
1.0,Way to small. I wear a Xlarge so I up sized and bought this in XXX Large. What I received stated XXX but would be equivalent to US size small. Do not buy. What I received looked nothing like the picture. It’s just a small tan Tshirt.
1.0,Can not figure out how to use it very disappointing it has no rhyme or reason to it
1.0,Terrible. More like a see through scratchy rag.
1.0,"These earrings hang down, NOT as pictured."
1.0,It opens up everytime you move your wrist. Just buy a regular watch strap
1.0,"It doesn't fit like a 2XL and it isn't a full hood. When I see hoodie in t shirt form, I expect the hood. Why else would I be looking for a shirt like this?"
1.0,Basically plastic. Cute in concept. Not to be worn on actual human hands.
1.0,Super baggy. And cheap
1.0,"I just got these today the bottoms are clearly used, dirty on the inside and has a skid mark along with other stains. The whole package smells strongly of perfume. I’ll spare you the absolute horror of a photo, but I cannot describe how awful it was to realize this is not a cute new swimsuit but a disgusting very used garment."
1.0,"It came with a dead battery and after using it for 3  hours, i just fall apart. i would not recommend it."
1.0,"The band is very light in weight and cute, however the claps on the band DOES NOT stay closed. I ha e almost lost my watch multiple times. Just for that reason it only receives one star for the look."
1.0,sent back..poor quality
1.0,Y’all I’m average height/weight. XXL order is SO SMALL it doesn’t even fit a child.
1.0,"The pendant is very pretty and true to the photo. However it arrived with a broken/ damaged chain that wasn't discovered until the gift was open and wanted to be worn. Very disappointed, a simple look by anyone would have discovered the damage (chain is barely hanging on to the mystery eyelet). Poor quality control! Will hopefully be able to exchange for a better chain."
1.0,"The style and color of this dress were extremely cute, but unfortunately it’s not wearable as the quality of the cloth is cheap, transparent and kills the look completely."
1.0,Miss sized big time..couldn't wear it donates it
1.0,It hooked and broke 😔
1.0,don't waste time and money go buy yourself a pair of cheap reading glasses
1.0,Waste of money they do not fit
1.0,"To small, material is cheap. It looks cheap..."
1.0,"You can buy Vuarnet's on Amazon, but not for 10 bucks.  Vuarnet's are amazing sunglasses made in France.  They have glass lenses, not plastic.  This is a deliberate attempt to deceive customers.  Don't fall for this.  If you want 10$ sunglasses, go to the drug store.  At least there you can see exactly what you are getting."
1.0,way to long and its UGLY
1.0,"The pendant was tarnished.  It didn't indicate the .925 quality of the silver.  The clasp opening was so narrow, it was very difficult to insert the other half of the ring.  The entire clasp was too small to open if with the smallest of fingers."
1.0,Impossible to get the ball off. Couldn’t use.
1.0,This product broke after less than an hour of me wearing it.
1.0,This dress as an XL is more like a size 6.  It is sized wrong and appears to be super wrinkly.
1.0,Dont buy fell apart right ehen opened
1.0,This item runs big...  Definitely not a sweatshirt type material....
1.0,"fell apart the first day.  Just tied together, not crimped or glued at all."
1.0,Very cute but the clasp broke within a week.
1.0,The size medium is more like an extra-extra small. They look like children leggings. The color is also way more pink than purple. Overall these are not flattering in any way.
1.0,"This dress is beautiful but the zipper is broken, very disappointed with the zipper quality. Would have loved the dress if zipper would have worked. They need to do something about it."
1.0,ugly! smaller and very cheap...it's a give away purse.
1.0,"The boots are very nice and stylish, but the material wore off within wearing them 2 times. Very disappointing."
1.0,"I only wore these less than 12 hours and i have pilling between the legs.  I wear a size 6 in jeans but had to order an 1xl to get a proper fit (not to tight or loose). Not the quality i was expecting, substandard. Will be returning"
1.0,I returned it.  It was unflattering and the waistband rolled over. It was too loose through the thigh. I also disliked the color but that’s on me.
1.0,Received dark gray instead of white stone as pictured
1.0,Very bad company. Don’t buy from this place.
1.0,"These are advertised as 1.6 mm pins, but they are actually 1.5 mm (1.48 to be exact)  I already have 1.5 mm but not worth the time and money to send them back. So if you are looking for 1.6 pins don't buy from this place."
1.0,Cheap product. Arrived with stones missing. Better be glad I had a coupon ending up only paying $2.65 a pair. Do not waste your time or money.
1.0,I bought a large but it barely passed my butt. I
1.0,They did not fit over my glasses like they were supposed to.  I had to give them to my daughter.
1.0,"I don't know who these pants were designed for, but the answer certainly isn't 'a normally proportioned human'.<br /><br />The waist is like 40+ inches, the legs are SHORT.  This is on a medium.  It feels like these pants were designed for someone who's shaped more like a basketball with pencils for legs, rather than a human being."
1.0,They all had sharp barbs and when I tried to screw the balls off they all stripped. I wasted some money here. I suggest you look at a different product...
1.0,There was no black in them they are white. And the bottom bell's are not wide at all. I'm 5'4 and I have to where flat shoes or sandals with them otherwise they are too short.
1.0,It wasn't at all what we thought. Sad
1.0,I am a small adult and can not get it over my hand. This might fit a 5 year old hand.
1.0,I did not like this item it's horrible. To big the earings are to heavy they hurt my ear. It was not worth 30 dollar's and 52 cents it is not real silver its fake
1.0,"Love that it has pockets,  but it's too small.  Order a size up."
1.0,Not what I expected and this size is for little kids. Did not look like what the picture shows. Very disappointed.
1.0,IT CAME BROKEN. I WASTED MY MONEY.
1.0,"The listed measurement is of the exact length of the webbing, not the useful length of the belt so, the advertised 56&#34; belt would actually be a 52&#34; belt, (but I can't be sure as they sent the wrong size).  The buckles on the belts I received are a lever type, not the sliding bar type as pictured."
1.0,To short! remember if you are a tall person with some buttie DO NOT BUY this product
1.0,THIS PRODUCT IS CHEAPLY MADE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!
1.0,Very cheap looking and just crappy. I returned it.
1.0,The beaded lanyard is too short to use as a facial mask holder. I need to order the longer length.
1.0,"After opening the necklace, it was in several pieces. None of the rings to hold it together were closed far enough. Of course, with it falling apart, one ring is lost."
1.0,The button was not secured enough so it popped off. So be delicate when using the button.
1.0,To small. Hard to get on
1.0,"The gray is NOT gray; they are green. Also, they are WAY bigger than expected! I got them in 3-6 months (&#34;gray&#34;) and 6-9 months (tan). The 6-9 months are so huge I doubt they will fit before my son is walking. I purposefully ordered these in specifically smaller, pre-walking sizes since they do not have any tread on them. These would be terrible for an infant learning to walk, which is probably when they would fit.  I will keep them and hopefully my child can wear them a few times since I would rather not go through the hassle of return shipping to China."
1.0,Looks like something mom would wear. To long doesn’t show enough of my legs
1.0,A XXL will fit like a medium in normal sizes. So ridiculous
1.0,The size is totally misrepresented.  The description states refund applicable including shipping.  The item is marked medium; there is no way this is a medium.  All my clothes are medium and I could not get in this garment.  I will remember this name and NEVER order anything advertised by them.
1.0,Swim suit material... I wasn’t into it.
1.0,Fake cheap metal made my ear swell
1.0,"cute, but way smaller than i thought. too small for me and my friends- it squeezed on our temples."
1.0,This belt isn't really a one sizer. It is way too small
1.0,La tela es muy de mala calidad
1.0,"Product arrived with about a 2&#34; section of the weave unsewn, which will eventually cause the rest to pull apart easily. There doesn't appear to be a return label included with the shipment, otherwise it would send it back for refund."
1.0,"The dress is not what it looks like in the picture, it’s not as poofy as it looks, I tried a crinoline but it didn’t fit on the dress."
1.0,Broke the first time it was wound.
1.0,The seams and material
1.0,"The material is very soft, but it seemed to run extremely small.  I am keeping it because it's just easier than sending it back, but I wouldn't want anyone to see wearing it because it's so tight."
1.0,Doesn't even work. Came broken.
1.0,Never used them since the ball was too small for my need. Couldn’t return them even though they were still in the original unopened package.
1.0,nothing like the image. the cut is just like a standard beanie.
1.0,"This was so horrible. I got the correct size but as soon as I stretched the shorts to step into, the elastic band snapped. Never even got one wear out of this item. Just horrible. All doesn’t fit in any right way."
1.0,Just silly to take the dang patch off! My daughter was so excited then she was like wait....
1.0,Cheap and ugly as heck.
1.0,"Way too small, and the shoulder straps are thin and sloppy.  You have to pay for a return so be sure you order at least a size too large.  Also note that the size chart is way off on US womens sizes - XL is a size 8 and that is accurate."
1.0,The metal clasp broke (literally just fell off) the first time I tried to put it on.
1.0,"This dress was very see-through. I guess this must be purchased only by skinny ones, not curvy or else it will reveal your love handles"
1.0,Does not fit true to size I normally wear a Large and it was WAY too tight.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture and no where close to the sizing chart<br /> Wish there was a negative 1
1.0,"There is no S logo in Swarovski crystals as shown in the product photo at the time we ordered (I can see seller has changed the photo to manage this but we suffer the consequence). When we complained, seller gave us runaround and then finally stopped responding.  We paid a premium for the S logo - otherwise I would have gotten a plain black leotard for 1/10 of the price."
1.0,"But at all Swarovski look .. It,s looking so tiny and not at all worth of price"
1.0,Material very thin.  Was disappointed with the quality of item.  Loved the color; but disappointed with texture.
1.0,I ordered a 4x and can barely get it over my head... there is no way the size is accurate. Very disappointed
1.0,Shoddy craftmanship. Sent it back
1.0,"The cleaner worked fine for four months, after that a white plastic collar had broken off from the cleaner head. I contacted Zeny company direct and submitted my order number along with pics of the part. All I wanted was the part itself, after a week or more of e-mail tag , it was very obvious the company was not going to anything for me!! Very poor customer service!  But elsewhere!"
1.0,"I was really excited for this dress... as soon as I opened it i felt the material and it is very rough. I tried it on and it looks nothing like the photos. The elastic band is itchy and sits in a really weird spot on my body. It's very big and ""frumpy"". Even in a smaller size, I would not recommend this product. Returning this tomorrow."
1.0,Poor quality broke before I even got to wear them
1.0,Runs large!!!
1.0,Socks didn’t have a heel.
1.0,Horrible horrible the worst thing i bought
1.0,"Bought this for my granddaughter, the bottom seam on the out site pocket was not stitched together has  three in hole."
1.0,"Ordered and returned! Such a disappointment, stone was so little for so much money!!"
1.0,Won’t stay up on the face. Bought for a 2.5 year old
1.0,"I ordered these for a relay race for field day. They held up for 3 separate field days, but the lenses were so blurry the kids couldn’t put them on to run In their race. I had them wear them on there head. Very disappointed with the lens being blurry and foggy. Would not purchase again."
1.0,Runs small--can't use.
1.0,The ball will not go back in easy it was very hard to install
1.0,They do not stay in place. Constantly slips off heels. 😡
1.0,"The compass and the temperature don't work, I guess it is for show only"
1.0,I could not wait to get this watch. I love the style and think it's classy. However I have had it one day (today) and I could not keep it on. The clasp continually came undone and it went up my sleeve or on the floor ALL DAY LONG! Really disappointed as I truly did like the look.
1.0,"Why on earth is Navy Seal embroidered UPSIDE DOWN??? Just like it shows in the picture, which I obviously didn’t notice when I ordered. Stupid! This was a gift and now I have to scramble to find something else in time."
1.0,Not to sure about these zodiac constellation necklaces. I looked up the constellation with the zodiac signs and they don't seem to match.
1.0,"The fabric is almost shiny, and I ordered black but it actually looks closer to navy. It also has a strange fit, and the bottom of the shirt flairs out due to it not being sewed well."
1.0,"Coming apart, terrible quality."
1.0,Stone is much smaller than it appears. The crystal fell out of the bracket a week after I got it.
1.0,Doesn’t fit the watch
1.0,Item broke into three pieces within two hours. Both are junk. They won't refund or replace. They insisted that I fix it myself
1.0,Not at all what I was expecting. Completely not true to size and such a disappointment.
1.0,"looks very low ,no texture ,very fake."
1.0,I couldn't my earlobe in the space to put them in the peirceing
1.0,Extremely poor stitching. Do NOT buy this product. Started falling apart within 3 weeks of use. For Amazon's name sake: I would suggest Amazon to discontinue this product. This is a poor representation of Amazon quality.
1.0,Adult size was made for a child.
1.0,runs REALLY small
1.0,fell apart with first washing
1.0,Can get a better quality hat at a truck stop
1.0,I was told the sizes are true to size but that def is not it they are atleast 2 sizes smaller than what you ordered wish i would of known before ordering
1.0,way too short
1.0,"The picture looks nothing like the real thing. It's very small, thin, and cheap looking. The description claims its sterling silver but I doubt it."
1.0,Terrible product.  Super cheap material.  Comes to a point in front.  Looks like it is from the dollar store.
1.0,Too small. I have the size adjustment enlarged to not in use. I can wear the hat but if it shrinks one millimeter I won’t be able to use it.
1.0,"Absolutely not what is pictured. I ordered a blazer, what I received is an under glorified cover up. The waffle weave left me in shock. The back is pieced together, not solid. The advertised picture looks very little like the item received."
1.0,It doesn't fit me .. too small... Transparent.. change the description...<br />WORST RETURN POLICY<br />THEY KEEP TWO DEMANDS FOR RETURN...<br />1. Have to recommend a friend and sell it to them<br />2. If you RETURN it they will​ charge you a dollar...<br />Does it make sense... Y we have to lose money without doing anything...<br />Disappointed
1.0,Was broke 30 min after use.
1.0,I would never buy this item again. It not worth your money.
1.0,These earrings were way to small for my big hands. I couldn’t put it together on my ear so I ended up returning them.
1.0,"I can’t even describe how icky it feels next to your skin. Don’t buy, it went straight into the trash."
1.0,"Cheap-feeling material, corset-style closure in the back (NO zipper). Product page photos VERY deceiving. Dress looks better in the photos than in reality. Very disappointed with the quality of this item. Even MORE disappointed with the total lack of customer service and disregard for customer satisfaction from the vendor."
1.0,"I'm 5'7"" and this dress basically was a maxi on me. Material is not the same as what the model is wearing."
1.0,These are designer knock-offs of a Mykita + Bernhard Willhelm &#34;Diasuke.&#34; Not cool to rip off the design.
1.0,The ear stud was broke when I received it
1.0,IF YOU WANT A T-SHIRT ORDER THIS.
1.0,This easy nothing that I expected. You ca literally fit just 2 bottles of water in there.
1.0,So I got these in and out of the 18 pair set I got 11 pairs. I am missing 1 full set and have 6 plugs that don't have matches at all. So in total I got a 28 pac instead of a 36. I am not please this has happened for the second time I would not recommend this company.
1.0,"I ordered an XL and they hit mid calf. Way too small in the length, but almost too big in the waist. The material is also cheap and uncomfortable."
1.0,way too small- sizes are way off- would not buy again
1.0,Flimsy at the least
1.0,This shirt fits oddly. It is very snug in the bust but if I went a size up then the torso would be too loose. Not a fan. Pretty design so I’m bummed it didn’t work out. The fabric has no give at all
1.0,Immediately after opening we noticed the stitching wasn’t even on. The only sewed half the number on
1.0,The fit is ridiculous! The only common thing it has with the picture advertised is maybe the color. The pants are incredibly wide with weird cut and LONG (even with my 5'8 height).
1.0,The product is not made from the material shown nor is it the same color as the image. I was given a pea green long sleeve t-shirt.
1.0,"Did not like, looked a little cheap. Well, they were cheap. Sent them back."
1.0,The collar was grossly misshapen. Sent back.
1.0,Fits awful.
1.0,-000  i’m instructions how to set the clock. Cannot figure out how to set that day very complicated watch .!!!!!
1.0,"Not fit moto 360 1st generation, i cant return since im overseas"
1.0,Dress is not what’s pictured. I ordered 3 and returned them all. They dress is not floor length. And is not flattering on the body.
1.0,Avoid this watch. It quit working properly less than a week after I purchased it.  I'm very disappointed. Caveat employ...
1.0,The Bucks head broke real quick 😂
1.0,Do not buy this product. The suction cups of the product don’t work at all. What a waste of money and time.
1.0,I was so disappointed with this bag. The stitching is already coming apart. This makes me doubt all verified purchasers because I’m not sure how anyone thought this bag was worth anything.
1.0,Sent them back
1.0,Well I got them run small
1.0,People are saying that the item is not like the picture. Of course not! This is an unauthorized vendor who doesn't even have the decency to include a model representative of the sorority in the advertisement. They're not even pretending!  Genuine/Legit members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority should be ashamed to purchase from this vendor.
1.0,Made for midgets!
1.0,"Absolute junk, fell apart in weeks. Not real leather, they are lying. Don't waste your money. Go down to your local western wear retailer and buy a good quality &#34;Real&#34; leather belt for 20 bucks to fit your belt buckle. Thats what i did."
1.0,It's not worth the price it's not made well and I feel bad I picked this out and this is my mans account and sadly it's not what I expected. also I see the price dropped after he let me pick it out and he bought this for me this was my Christmas gift he got it for me.:/ over 50 and now I see it's less.i feel bad it isn't what I thought at all.also reviews are down more then when I picked it out! but it's the thought that counts but I feel bad I don't wanna drive him crazy and have him return it I'm just upset he spent so much on bad quality for something that's definitely made cheap for the price he payed. be careful. Js.
1.0,Nothing like a kimono just a plain night robe it was cute but not to leave the house which was my intention
1.0,This tunic is flimsy and the material is slick. The neckline is odd shape. It will be returned tomorrow. Do not waste your time or money on this top.
1.0,Have not even had these two weeks and the ear piece broke off.  Was hoping they would last longer than Gas station sun glasses...
1.0,"Shirt not as described, not even finished being sown together open seams. Very cheap fabric and the neck line on my shirt is frayed. Very disappointed and tried to return and offered just a 15% refund and told to give as a gift. No way I would even give this shirt to someone"
1.0,I should fit but the boots are very flimsy and even though her foot should fit her heel wont go in
1.0,I read that these ran small so I order a 2xl (which should of been plenty big) and it was still too small! It looked like a childs shirt.
1.0,This is just the cheapest looking thing when I tried it on
1.0,Too big and is really uncomfortable to wear. It feels awkward because of its size around the finger. Otherwise is pretty but just not something I enjoyed wearing. Returned and was refunded
1.0,These are not surgical steel turned ears green an discolored if wasnt past my 30days I'd return them look cute at first but after days wear they tarnish an turn ears green
1.0,"I thought it was a sweatshirt, it was a tshirt. I ordered in in June and got it on aug 18th.  Runs very big. I ordered a large thinking it was a sweatshirt.  I would suggest sizing down."
1.0,We’re jammed into a package envelope so shoes were smashed flat and were pulling away from toe rubber sole. Contacted seller and they told me it would be expensive to return and needed to do several things to reply back again to begin return process. Not satisfied. Will not buy from this seller again.
1.0,Shirt looks like a cheap soccer jersey material. Not at all what the picture makes it seem.
1.0,"Broke a week after wearing it. Looked great, but the front piece broke off the bar, had it in my conch piercing"
1.0,El color lo pierde rapidamente
1.0,"I ordered this to replace my daughters headband that our puppy destroyed. Hers looked exactly like the photos, I was so excited to be able to find another to replace it. However, it came in the mail and it is extremely cheap looking. The one we received has satin ribbon just loosely wrapped around the top so that the frayed end of the ribbon is even showing. Nothing is the same as the picture - it is a different headband altogether. If you want something cute, look elsewhere because this isn’t it.<br /><br />I’d give 0/5 stars if I could."
1.0,Missing my nacho libre  mask and 1 mask had no mouth or no nose hole😡
1.0,got a completely different dress. messed up my order.
1.0,This item was bought for my mother. The first time she wore this it split at the seam on the left side. Although the material is good however this was a bad purchase.
1.0,The finishings of the dress are lower than expected with an unfinished fold over hem which was a serger finish.<br /><br />This dress is NOT a true wrap dress with 'just' a tie up sash to make a faux wrap appearence.
1.0,"This looks nothing like the pictures! Shame on me for not reading the reviews, this is awful"
1.0,Won’t stay on crocs- continue to fall off
1.0,Dislike order the replacement lenses and only one fit right don’t waste your money
1.0,"The fitment of the gauges was great, and the clarity of the design was good , but I ordered the black and green and it came in white ."
1.0,I measured myself and it was literally WAY too small.
1.0,Not really worth it. As described and on time.
1.0,"It was almost like it was 100% spandex.  Really weird feel to it.  And,  it was not a material that would breath on warm days, very heavy"
1.0,So this only comes with one black band. They don’t clarify that anywhere in the description.  👎🏽<br /><br />Update:: Just read the description… it clearly says two paradores but I only received one. No one reached out from the company to help solve the issue.
1.0,These sashes are a good size kn length and with the colors match very nice. The problem is that all 6 that I purchased came with holes in them. Can't return them because we need them for Senior night. I will not be making the whole profit because I can not sell a defective product at regular price.
1.0,"Faded after one wash. Shrank after one wash, to small order size up."
1.0,"Really bad material. No where near cotton, it’s some weird nylon material. The dye comes off even after washed."
1.0,First let me say that the jacket is nice but the pants after washing them lint up to the point you don’t want to wear them again unless you have a lint machine to take the lint away
1.0,This is not a real sweatshirt. It's so thin and I absolutely hate it. Such a waste of money. DO NOY BUY.
1.0,Short and 2 different colors.
1.0,Cheap quality . Looks terrible on. Had to return
1.0,"Not flattering at all, fits very weird and material is cheap, is definitely going back"
1.0,Outside pocket ripped open.
1.0,"made very cheap,bought better bags at dollar tree. Very unsatisfied."
1.0,You need to go up a size and the material is very soft but very clingy
1.0,"Fit as expected because that's the only choice I have that is somewhat close to my response.  And, in order to rate this item I had to choose something.  It wasn't at all what I expected.  The material was &#34;scratchy&#34; not soft.  It didn't hang well and it was cheaply made."
1.0,"I returned it because it was 1) too short, that's why she has it tucked in.  2) the sleeves did not fit properly.  3) it definitely was not made like on the picture.  Maybe mine had a defect."
1.0,Looks good but looks are deceiving
1.0,I purchased Tag Heuer glasses and had problems with bubbling and shreading on the frame. I first made contact with Tag Heuer in August 2011 and have been redirected to other depts/people several times over the last 4 months. Still no resolution. Poor customer service.
1.0,"I took out my current insoles, and added these (after some trimming for length). They were WAY too thick to be comfortable, as they made me feel like they were shoving my feet out of my shoes. Of course, I HAD to trim them to get them into the shoes, so can't return them.  Very unsatisfied with this purchase."
1.0,I opened the clasp and it broke. Immediately as it arrived. Get what you pay for.
1.0,No stars because I ordered 5x and it fits a size 10.  Gave it to my cat.  She loves the material.
1.0,"Although these are super cute, the bat is MUCH smaller than the pumpkin making them a very awkward pair to wear together.  The pic is NOT true to size!!!"
1.0,"The short looks nothing like the picture! Lighter shade of grey! Much higher, boxier neckline than featured on the model...if they used they same shirt they altered it greatly. The fabric is still nice land soft, but will be removing everything from this company from wishlists and shopping cart."
1.0,i turned black after 1 week
1.0,"It looks fluffy, it isn't. The inside is like burlap, VERY abrasive to the skin, i couldn't be worn for 3 seconds."
1.0,Not US sizing.
1.0,Definitely not what expected for the price
1.0,was very cheap could not see through them
1.0,When it was delivered I only received the shorts. Also the color seemed faded.  Item was returned
1.0,The sweater was way to bulky under the arms where the fabric all hits your side.  I returned it.
1.0,"I am very disappointed in my order that arrived today! The sweatpants had orange zig zag type marking on it near the top by the pocket, pills and you can see the errors in stitching. Please keep this in mind as you make your clothing choices."
1.0,Beautiful in the picture but when arrived it does not stay in the sphere shape at all and it was bent. Do not recommend at all
1.0,Very large for my wrist and cheaply made
1.0,It looks cheap! Too shiny!
1.0,Really small.  Bezel arrived bent and cut.  Will return.  Terrible.
1.0,"The price was good.  The watch is exactly as advertised. However, it stops whenever it feels like it.  Hours at a time.  I thought it might be the battery.  I replaced the battery ($13), but it continues to lose time when it chooses to.<br /><br />Don't buy this watch!"
1.0,"The low price & soft stretchy fabric were the best parts of these shortalls. As other reviews mentioned, yes, you do have to assemble the straps. The biggest downfall is the sizing. In the pictures are the XL blue XL olive shortalls I ordered for myself vs my daughter's Walmart brand Med. Black shortalls. When comparing the waist,  doublju's XL shortalls are slightly smaller than the black Walmart medium shortalls. The olive pair did not come with buckles. It's a double loss for me but a single win for my daughter."
1.0,The hat came folded up like a piece of paper. I wasn't able to return the hat to it's original shape.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:f20467c3c3a585ddc18525125b5401cd]] This is the most uncomfortable thing I ever wasted my money on.  It doesn’t stay in place and pinches the skin so bad
1.0,I received this as a gift .. It was missing the cord .. the person that gave it to me contacted AMAZON .. no satisfaction .. item was new in box or at least the box was new but the cord was broken off .. seller should have been ashamed.
1.0,it broke within the first 3 hours of use
1.0,So the necklace clear wire lasted for about a month and unfortunately the window to return it closed. This is a bummer. Sigh.
1.0,Super cute for a couple of weeks. Then them pattern peels and falls off.
1.0,"The leopard print material is really thin, cheap and elastic just like a bathing suit; the black fabric is thicker and better material, I wish the whole dress was made of the same fabric. There’s no cleaning instructions but I wouldn’t wash that in washing machine and definitely no high heat drier or ironing or it will shrink. Fit was ok. I wear 8 and bought Medium. I decided to keep it but this is not the type of dress that’s gonna last years and I’m not expecting to wear it in the cold winter."
1.0,It was itchy
1.0,"The holes in the mask to look through are located in the nose, and they are about the size of a pea and also located well below the eyes.<br /><br />You would be very disappointed once you try this on."
1.0,"Luckily they are stretchy around the waist, but the real problem is how they fit around my legs. They don’t give any,  so when I walk they act really weird. It’s hard to explain so I might save these for beach days or just donate to goodwill."
1.0,I ordered a large and couldn't get it over my thighs. I have a wide lower body so I usually size up but these run very small. Aside from that the material was a little strange but thick and they seem like they'll last a while if you can wear them
1.0,I was looking to some small earrings for my granddaughter but realized the post was too big for the hole in her ear so I used them. Majority of the jewelry I wear daily is 925 stealing silver and have NEVER had a reaction. After wearing the small hoop earring’s with the clear stones for about a week straight I noticed my ears were starting to itch and the more I wore them the more they would itch. Long story short... 925 Sterling silver doesn’t seem to be the metal that they’re using OR the only metal
1.0,"Way to long, 5' 4 try to cut it not good!"
1.0,"I listened to reviews and ordered one to two sizes larger. I shouldn't have. It was true to size. Besides that, very disappointed in microthin material. I don't see it making it through one washing. Pretty much a waste of money. Maybe suited for beach wear over a bathing suit top. Very very sheer."
1.0,"Large body with small sleeveves. Extremely poor construction: frayed stitching everywhere; buttons far too small for the button holes, and not to  mention terrible material. and yet the dealer will not accept returns. Lost money on 2 of these shirts"
1.0,"It's a big piece of fabric with two holes for arms, no shape whatsoever, it's just supposed to hang on you, if I knew what it looked like before buying I wouldn't have."
1.0,Burst before even using it
1.0,The shoe is to small and tore when I tried to pull the back to put it on my child
1.0,not like the picture. very small and not detailed. came dirty
1.0,Real small bottom and too big of a top for myself but good material!
1.0,"The zipper broke the first time I used the wallet. Save your money, invest in something better."
1.0,"Followed the fitting guid, still WAY too small, couldn't even pull up to the knees<br />RETURNED"
1.0,"The first jacket I ordered was too small, then I ordered the next size up, but when I got the next jacket it was the same size as the previously ordered one."
1.0,Este pedido no a llegado no me regresan mi dinero y ni contestan mis mensajes
1.0,"Product description is never the same as the photo<br />very poor quality and horribly uncomfortable tightens chin and mouth<br />Muy mala calidad el producto muy incomodo aprieta la boca y la barbilla un material muy duro, nunca como muestra en la foto,,"
1.0,Turned colors immediately after wearing it so now it looks brownish or dark gray. Also leaves a green circle under my belly button from the contact with my skin. So pretty when it arrived but it doesn't last. Ye be warned.
1.0,I wanted a skull with a moving jaw; the jaw doesn't move and I tried ordering twice. I would not have paid $22 for a non moving jaw when it's clearly stated it moves and it's shown in the pictures.  Can't contact seller??
1.0,Igual este otro sombrero vino lo mismo
1.0,No go
1.0,"This is only good if you are wearing it underneath a very tight blouse or a swim suit.  Originally, I bought this to wear during summer but when I discovered that this goes off when you sweat, I can now only use it for my swim suit.  I'm gonna need to find something much better than this."
1.0,Most of these tongue rings were the exact same. Also the bar was way too skinny for the ball. They were actually useless
1.0,Nice pants except for the snaps.  The material is stretchy without reinforcement around the inside snap so they pull off very easily. Purchased 2 of theses pants and the material is soft and comfortable.  Lost 5 snaps on each pair so far.  Would not recommend because of this flaw.
1.0,Sent me the wrong earrings they're very similar but not what I wanted and bigger than what I wanted too gawdy for my taste.
1.0,Received this item twice and there is a black stain on the yellow dress in the fold of the dress.
1.0,"So I figured I'd try these out, to do some new style of cabachon setting. I got maybe 100/120 and most of them were round ones at 2-3mm (bout half of these) with only about 5/8 of 15-18mm. Not worth the price I paid"
1.0,"Expected this to be much larger than what the pictures indicate. Very misleading, would not buy anything from this seller again."
1.0,This watch is supposed to be water resistant- but is 100% not water resistant. Not really practical for a 7 year old.
1.0,"These are by far the WORST glove I have ever used. The material is stiff and does not stretch at all, making the gloves so hard to put on or take off. I also feel like the sizing runs small. I generally can use a medium and it might be slightly tighter but better than a loose large. I struggled so much to use these, and usually ended up ripping half of them just trying to get them on. They also tear easily while on; they just have NO give. Really disappointed."
1.0,Ordered a size up so I could have some comfy around the house jogger pants. They definitely run small. Even with ordering a size up they were skin tight and so uncomfortable!!!
1.0,No it feels plastic. Wife caught on to me. She's pissed.
1.0,"These fit around the waist fine, but the inner lining goes up the butt almost like a thong. Super uncomfortable. I returned the day after I received them. No way I could wear them."
1.0,Too tight in the arms and across the back. Not the right cut for anyone with a chest.
1.0,If I was 95 lbs and 6’ 9” they would be great!
1.0,Terrible item.  The colors where majorly off from picture.  The size on the bottoms was not what I ordered and the tops size was conveniently cut off.  You would think I would learn my lesson ordering from these places.
1.0,A joke at best. A waste of time and money. It fits my 12-year old niece!!! Size 1 -3 at most. Not at all as advertised. So very disappointed
1.0,How ridiculous that these don't even come in a size 10 (or 11). That's a massive chunk of the population!
1.0,"Color is not as shown, does not stay locked In watch face !"
1.0,Everyone one of them tarnished and couldn't be restored. Def wont purchase again or recommend.
1.0,Do not fit! Way too small for the average adult arms and hands.
1.0,Received Arm &amp; Hammer deodorant instead of stockings!!!!!!!
1.0,They are very loose and make walking very difficult
1.0,This is a warm weather hooded jacket not a hooded sweatshirt ! Amazon needs to fix their categories and search engine. Since I'm a GUY...in the wintertime...looking for fleece hooded sweatshirt... And I received a lady-like thin spring jacket...
1.0,Muy  delgadita y rota
1.0,Worst quality and high price.
1.0,On the second pair of these because the first one ripped putting it on the first time. This one ripped too. Trying another brand
1.0,I still have not received this after 2 months.
1.0,Horrible. Dont buy
1.0,"I ordered these specifically because there looked like there would be a good variety of mushroom charms, but I only received one mushroom.  Mostly it was a lot of duplicates of a few charms, with a few one off of other designs.  Overall just unimpressed and would not recommend."
1.0,Would not recommend. These bands gave me an allergic reaction after a couple of hours of wear. Burned my skin. I would give these zero stars if I could.
1.0,Wrong strength
1.0,I was extremely excited to receive this product. Pink puff leggings. I checked the sizing and XS was size 23 waist witch is my perfect fit. I received the product and the tag said size 6. I had to return and get a refund. Overall the leggings did look like the photo provided and was made well and looked like a quality item.
1.0,"These earrings are cheaply made, one broke the day we got them! They are hard to wear, and I definitely DO NOT recommend these!!"
1.0,Didn’t fit I had to return it
1.0,Bad quality for the price I can get a very good quality.....very cheap looking...
1.0,"Nice looking belt, had it for 44 days now. The ball on the buckle just fell off and now im walking around the office with a belt that keeps coming undone."
1.0,My Fitbit flex 2 didn't even fit in it
1.0,Already broke!!
1.0,On the light top of the eating it's shiny bit without light its look like piece of glass not sparkle like a diamond at all
1.0,You know that's not the correct phrase right?
1.0,Wrong color sent received black not grey as pictured
1.0,"I changed my review to one star. I broight it on a trip and after 3 days the sleeve (to slip on the suitcase handle) ripped and the zipper broke. Super cheap construction.  Yes its super lightweight. I didnt fold it i to a little pouch, I just laid it all out flat in my suitcase so it really took zero space. That part was great. But I staryed using it a few days into my trip and it fell apart. I bought it in 2017 and never used it. I took it with me but had the need to use it until now. Very disappointed."
1.0,"When it was delivered it was already bent, but I thought I will keep it anyway. Well it hasn't been two weeks and the pink middle part has already fallen out."
1.0,"Plastic, cheap.  Sorry I bought them."
1.0,Terrible sizing chart! Had to pay for delivery AND having to pay for returning it
1.0,The item is ugly. I thought it was true tie-dyed shirt. It is not. It is printed on and the dry fit material. The print job is terrible. I will be returning.
1.0,I recieved two princess shirts in different sizes.. When i wanted one princes and one prince.
1.0,Looks nothing like the photo. I was hoping for a sturdy duffle bag with structure nope! It is the most flimsy bag ever and sounds like you are opening a bag of chips every time you touch it. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money.
1.0,not really made well and the fit is odd
1.0,I bought two for some light cosplay and they did work well for that purpose. But then I washed them and they came out a few inches shorter. Beware!  These are more like lightweight sweaters than short sleeved hoodies.
1.0,They do not work at all they make ur feet sweat and they make ur feet so cold it’s not worth a dime I don’t want them I’m about to send them back no good they get -5 stars
1.0,Do not waste your money
1.0,"I ordered a size 38C and was disappointed to receive extremely small products. I measured the band on my tape measure and it's literally only 30 inches, with about an inch of give from the elastic, literally couldn't even clasp it around any part of my torso."
1.0,"Bought medium based on size chart, but this top fits like a small.  Definitely size up!"
1.0,"This is a thin shirt, not a sweater. Returning is made so complicated."
1.0,"Awful, I threw it in the trash. Itchy polyester fabric. Made for a very petite person. I'm generally a U.S. medium I ordered a large. It was so short and so uncomfortable all over. Threads were pulling on all seams out of package. Cheap material, cheaply made."
1.0,Tarnished already
1.0,These goggles are comfortable but I have them one star because they started fogging up the 5th time I wore them. They are now as good as the dollar store goggles I used to use.
1.0,Shirt was loose and I had to tie the side. It don’t even look like what the picture shows honestly
1.0,This is made with that cheap fabric that WISH products are made with...<br />Was expecting a quality shirt..DO NOT BUY!! Not this over sized tent.. This fit like a 2XL on me.
1.0,It is much smaller than what I have ordered before at the same price.  I have a necklace with 30 birthstone jewel kids.  It really looks out of place with the others.  I don't care how many more Grandchildren there are ... that is the end of the necklace.
1.0,"Bought this as a Christmas gift--my husband wore them twice and the back broke off in his hand.  Unfortunately, it was a day after the return window closed, so I guess we are stuck with having put out the money for something that is sub-par.  Very disappointed in the quality."
1.0,Even went down TWO sizes and the bra straps can still be pulled up to my EARS. THIS IS NOT A HIGH IMPACT BRA!
1.0,"I am returning this item because it did not match the picture at all! BIGGEST problem? The straps are not attached to the dress!! The picture shows a speghetti strap dress but my dress came with two ties, in  Siri you could tie the dress behind your neck and halter style but then that messes up the bus line of it and it doesn’t lay properly,  also the ends of the straps are raw so you can definitely tell they were meant to be sewn to the dress but were  not! Also the fabric is so thin it’s impossible to wear  being that it is white you would see any undergarment,  and if you wear no undergarments you would visibly be able to see that also! I buy cheap sundresses all the time at this price point I don’t expect anything extravagant but goodness gracious this thing looks like an art project."
1.0,When I threw it in the dryer on medium heat for the first time the letters melted together and came off.
1.0,This is not a body shapewear at all and the one I bought came with a hole in it. I wouldn't recommend this product.  When I think of shapewear I think of spanx and this isn't even close to it.
1.0,Received wrong item
1.0,Received the wrong print. Will have to return and reorder
1.0,The arm throw out and I didn't like it
1.0,"You can't tell by the pictures, but it is really cheap looking and feeling watch band.  Reminds me of something you might win at a carnival booth.  It was so cheap I didn't even bother with returning it, just threw it away.  Do not recommend (with emphasis)."
1.0,This jumpsuit is very small!<br />I contacted the seller and was told that I would incur large shipping costs!
1.0,Broke the minute I tried to put in on. Cheaply made but what did I really expect for such a low price.
1.0,Did not work at all and I dont have boobs but they seemed too small. I order the biggest size.
1.0,"See through and the material is awful, itchy, and hot."
1.0,Horrible!!! Not sure what that so-called built-in bra thing supposed to be but I felt like I was wearing a shield of armor on my chest!  Couldn't even get to the rest of the dress because I couldn't get beyond how awful and ugly the front of the dress was!
1.0,you get what you pay for! grips peeled off within a couple days of wear. they aren’t warm.
1.0,"The price was really good for this, however, it fits a bit on the small size. Also, I washed it per the instructions before I wore it using the Woolite Dark detergent and it still faded."
1.0,Cheap look and feel
1.0,Very colorful but the sizing was way off and they took forever to come!
1.0,The earrings were nice quality but the backs didn't have a hole.
1.0,Way too tight & difficult to fasten
1.0,Not for my body type. Or preference. The material is way to stretchy
1.0,I was super excited for these earrings and they both arrived broken and smelled like chemicals. I do not recommend these earrings at all. Extremely disappointed.
1.0,Nit like picture at all.
1.0,Too small and you will have trouble using the restroom of you dont have anyone there with you. I returned this item..not for me
1.0,I just received a dirty swimsuit!  A friend purchased the swimsuit for me because my vacation is quickly approaching.  Very upset and disappointed.
1.0,"I purchased a different sweater clip from this company some time ago which I really liked.  With this one, the charm in the middle slides around on the clips and gets all cockeyed.  I'm hoping my handy husband can do something to make it more useful."
1.0,Film came off after a week of having them. Loved the frame but very disappointed!
1.0,Really poor design not worth 11$👎
1.0,I just don’t like it at all! Maybe a different color might look nicer! ( I ordered the black one) I forgot to return it! Lol but it’s all good. I do go to the pool a lot.
1.0,"I gave this to my granddaughter, it fit her. For me, the size is too small."
1.0,"Cheesy frames ....for$12 I at least expected it to last more that a month......Not like the similar pair I own through another company. I was impressed by the different color options ,but that was it ...I  will never purchase  again"
1.0,"Not at all what I expected. This is a short type of jacket. Short and wide. Not a cardigan. Unsure what material this is, since there is no tag. Definitely not as advertised. It is transparent and very thin."
1.0,Need to recheck sizes
1.0,I purchased these a year before. Never worn them. I got acid test kit recently. I tested them for sterling silver as they claimed. These are not sterling silver. So disappointed. I trusted the stamp. But the stamp is fake.
1.0,Way bigger than the pictures!!!
1.0,"I originally liked these sunglasses when I received them. They didn't fit perfectly as the nose part was a little wonky, but they worked. I've had them for two months and have only worn them a handful of times and they're already messed up. I used the case they came with so I know I took good care of them. The tinting and polarized part is rubbing off in a lot of places. I'm very unhappy with how long they're lasted. I've had inexpensive sunglasses last years. I contact the seller and they told me there is nothing they could do about it and they offered me a 20% off coupon to their site. Why would I want to spend more money on a product that sucks? They also told me there is nothing they can do about it because the item is sold and shipped by Amazon, which it isn't."
1.0,The band is so thin it broke the first day I tried to wear it. I bumped my hand into something and it bent. It was downhill from there.
1.0,"Bcame in the mail, put it on and within 5 min the clasp broke off the chain.  What did I really expect anyways."
1.0,"Fake one received, lost color and pieces over time."
1.0,"The luggage arrived a month prior to my trip. However, when I arrived at my destination one of the luggage had 2 missing wheels. The luggage was cracked in the area where the wheels were installed. So this left me with 2 pieces and less space for my return. Now in my arrival home the other  luggage is missing 2 wheels once again. In addition to being poorly made, the luggage was difficult to roll and the zippers can easily break if you’re not careful. The lining inside starting tearing away from the zipper."
1.0,The belt is breaking after 2 days of use
1.0,This item was the wrong color . Item was a khaki color .
1.0,Fabric was very thin and seams came undone
1.0,Do not buy this ! Very thin “silk “like see through material . No protection at all . Honestly the worse thing I’ve ever bought from Amazon !
1.0,NOT COTTON!! Will be sending back.
1.0,Terrible.. doesnt sray on your head.  U must have a pumpkin size head for it to not fall off! Disappointing!
1.0,"Cheap quality, I immediately returned for a refund."
1.0,"The material isn't good at all, it's not soft n it's so transparent, also it runs so large for my size<br />While the chest area it tight."
1.0,dont Waste your money neckline is different and ties are uncomfortable
1.0,"The wings were off upon opening the package and the ball fell off the first time my daughter wore, I fixed it to the best of my ability and my daughter lost a wing the second time she wore it. She still wore it but the next time she wore it the ball feel off and the little connector piece was broken when we found it. Great length in chain for an average size 11 year old but I’d never suggest a friend buy this piece."
1.0,The lock on one of the piece is no good. It would not lock.
1.0,This sweater is baggy and limp and saggy.  It has no shape to it other than sack of potatoes.  Returned.
1.0,"These run super short, be prepared for high water pants."
1.0,Straps looked really cheap and I returned the item
1.0,Pinches my neck when I wear it.
1.0,Runs small and too short and my daughters 5’2.
1.0,"If you're buying this because you wanna be comfy, dont. The top is made out of some type of swim suit material. The bottoms are weirdly bagging from the bottom but super tight around the butt region. Would not recommend."
1.0,Was broken in half before unwrapped. Would have been cute for my grand daughter but this was a lost cause.
1.0,They worked themselves completely off my foot -
1.0,I really did not like. I am a size 12 i order a 2x that did not fit they were too small
1.0,The fit all these jeans are terry
1.0,"Update; Purchased Nov 26, 2015. Glasses sit in car, under car center panel arm wrest. Inside protective sleeve, never exposed to sun. On Jan 24, 2016, took them out, both lenses had 50 cracks in them. Worst glasses I've every purchased. Sending them back."
1.0,Not enough beads. Actually looks like some were missing. Friend has normal wrist size. You can see the string when wearing bracelet.<br />The starfish is pretty. Just looks like beads are missing.
1.0,"I have long legs, 32” inseam, and these were 4-5 inches too long. The material was cheap and not very stretchy.  I return them."
1.0,"This tank top is not true to size. It is extremely short as well. I am 5'5"" and generally wear a size L. I ordered a L and it fit like a small. I gave them to my 12 year old daughter to try who is 5'1"" and generally wears a ladies small and they were too small on her as well."
1.0,Broke after a 4 weeks and is just a crappy sticker on the back
1.0,Way too small for a man.
1.0,The backs are flat. Not my biggest problem. The whole pearl comes off when you're trying to take the back off. Super cheap. Also returning. Came wrapped. Almost didn't look at them. Glad i did.
1.0,"The model here has to be about 4'7"" and 84 pounds. The pattern and feel of the dress was fine but it did not cover any lady bits and I am only 5' 4"". Had to return (no problems doing that) but definitely does NOT fit like the picture."
1.0,Doesn't look like the picture at all.
1.0,Super big and long the mesh part not cute like the pic unless ur about 6”0 and 200lbs
1.0,"Was looking for a normal sweater, wasn't aware this had a mask..omg hilarious, no thx I'll pass"
1.0,Style doesn’t look the same
1.0,The material on this isn’t what it looks like. The material is like a regularly cheap t shirt that you get at Wal Mart with a cute cut out area. Do yourself a favor and don’t buy it. Save your money. Not worth it at all. 0 stars if possible
1.0,Cheap. Breaks easily. Broke off my wifes ankle after 2 mins of having it on.
1.0,"Horrible! The material feels like spider web...seriously. Very flimsy.Out of the pack of 5,shave already thrown away 4 pair's because they ripped before I got them past my hips."
1.0,Got these for my 3 1/2 year old. Got a xs I believe. These are absolutely HUUUUUUGE. My husband could wear these lol. The quality is just ok.
1.0,Only had for two months and the coloring came off...
1.0,"I bought this stuff on Amazon. At the beginning it was very nice, but after two months it was broke and I cannot use it anymore ..."
1.0,"I read reviews and it said that a lot of people got a size that didn't fit. Based on that info i went up one size. After receiving the shirts, I tried one on and thought &#34;wow, without washing these yet, they are kind of small on me.&#34; Then I washed them and they turned into half shirts. My wife is considerably smaller than me and they barely fit her right."
1.0,"I had to come here and say this sweater runs three sizes too small. I’m around 160lbs, 5’3, and typically wear M/L depending. I wanted an oversized fit so I went with L. Unfortunately, this fits like a small. So if you’re anything like me, pass on this one or find an XXL for an oversized fit."
1.0,Too cheeky
1.0,"First of all, these are way overpriced. Also they run large. I’ve always worn a mens size 10 and these are probably 1/2 a size too big.<br />I tried really hard to like them. I wore them for a week with thick socks and they stayed uncomfortable. I went back to wearing my 2 year old Sketchers and these shoes are hiding under my bed."
1.0,"I was excited by these until they arrived. They were wafer thin, and not because the fibers were super stretched. I don’t need strangers knowing if I have a beauty mark on my lower regions and whatnot."
1.0,Jacket is stiff and material is very low quality. Returning item.
1.0,Broke with in a month. Do not buy.
1.0,It looked cheesy and smaller than  the other hat we have that measures the same size. My bad for the price I will pay more for better next time.
1.0,Arrived in pieces
1.0,Disappointed in the flashing lights.  Lights randomly come on.
1.0,Small and cheaply made.  Adjusted it to the largest setting and it’s still too small.
1.0,"Boxy and very unflattering. I bought a small and it was huge.  Itchy, rough material, nothing like linen. This one went back to Amazon!"
1.0,They are very warm and water proof. My complaint? The lining isn't sewn in. Every time I take them off I have to push the fingers back where they belong.
1.0,"these glasses do work well and how they are supposed to, but on the flip side they are extremely poor quality and the lenses always come out the glasses. it would he no problem if they just kept coming out and it was easy to get them back in, but every time i’ve tried to put them back, the lens has cracked. i am disappointed with this purchase"
1.0,Not at all like the photo.  Different material so it’s more fitted than flowy
1.0,Too small and the color was off it was not the same color as the picture or the discription
1.0,"Tiny in both length & width. Beanie behind it is a women's size I wear. The color looks better in person, more royal."
1.0,The letters change color in the daylight but unfortunately they started coming off on the second day of wearing it.
1.0,"Ordered this t shirt twice ! And twice I got the wrong item, pickers must have wrong scue number on I this item, can't talk to a human being at Amazon so I gave up !"
1.0,Very very small.
1.0,Don't buy it. Very cheap
1.0,"Estoy muy molesta con la compra de este producto me enviaron unos arietes usados , inservibles."
1.0,Product was not as described in product description when order was submitted.
1.0,One earring broke where the heart is looped by the earring hook.  Broke the second time I wore them
1.0,"These came - they were very uneven-looking, and after a while I figured out why. They aren't spiral, meaning a coil that has been sliced into sections, they are hoops that have been twisted open, meaning they are asymmetrical and crooked-looking. Which for me, defeats the point of jewelry. Utter junk."
1.0,These are tight in the wrong places for me. The bras dig in below my arms and just fit very poorly for me. Usually I’m a 34 B. I guess I needed a large.. normally I wear sm-m sports bras.
1.0,It says it fits up to 55 inch waste. I'm a 47 inch waste and it barley fits. Can't button all the way<br /> Also material is not a solid layer of plastic but woven so it's not durable
1.0,"Bought because I wanted something made in USA. Sadly, these masks are huge and totally useless. Threw in the trash. Complete waste of time and money."
1.0,"Doesn't fit a pandora bracelet.<br />While twisting on, we broke the bracelet. We now have to get a new one and we can't  get the broken piece out of the new charm.<br />Bummer!"
1.0,Very small.. not true to size at all.  Very cheaply made.
1.0,Cheaply made.  It looks better in the picture.  The top piece kept popping off.
1.0,Way way too tiny😐
1.0,"Not the best, but not worth returning for the price. Backside of earrings are rough and sharp. I had to sand down the mountain peaks."
1.0,Run big. Definitely not leak proof. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.
1.0,At first when u wore this it turned my skin purple. I was humiliated at a pool<br />In Las Vegas.  I assumed I needed to wash it again I wore it again in Florida same result bled purple on my skin.  I love the color & fit I soaked it in dish soap. Hung it in the Rented condo it bled onto the white bathtub!  It took me a hour to get the stain out.  I should get a refund or a replacement.
1.0,Horrible and cheap!
1.0,Needed a father's day gift  and this is not a man watch
1.0,This is a sherbet orange and doo ok sent seems I like an actual t-shirt material-wise.  Returned
1.0,0nly sterling silver is clasp n round tag buy clasp with 925 stamped on it.<br />Turned neck green within 3 day use. Glasp n tag look good tho
1.0,The gold tarnished after about a week.
1.0,"Finally got warm enough to put on my daughter, she wore it ONE TIME not even for a full day and the crotch ripped out on it. Not happy about it at all."
1.0,Didn’t like because didn’t fit
1.0,Too BIG to fit through hole (on both snds)...<br />DONT bother wasting your time purchasing!!!
1.0,Runs about 2 sizes too small and zip broke wearing shorts for the first time.
1.0,These were poorly made and shipped poorly.
1.0,"El sweater corre grande, la calidad no es buena, la tela tienda a lucir medio transparente.<br /><br />Lo regresé."
1.0,Can't sew anything at all.
1.0,These are not even close to being true to size.  I ordered one size up and they are way too small.
1.0,"Bought two of these sunglasses and they both broke the same way within a year of normal usage.  There is a design flaw in the stems where the rubber inserts are positioned.  The plastic frames are weakened and break after repeated wearings.  Of course, my two both broke on the same left side so I couldn't even salvage a pair out of the two."
1.0,"The belt came defected, one of the snap buttons had fallen off"
1.0,Item is black rhodium plated which is not stated in the main description of item.  Not silver in color as expected.  Also incorrect size! Description states 7.1&#34; plus extender but it is only 6.5&#34; in length.  Looks like something I could get at a dollar store for a little kid.  Be careful to read full description in the comments which is not totally accurate!
1.0,Bad size .. worse description
1.0,"I ended up giving this to my sister. I ordered the size that was stated for my measurements and unfortunately, it was too large"
1.0,The size I got was a xxl and it fits someone that  wears a size  12. Definitely not sized right.
1.0,I’m extremely disappointed. I wasn’t even sent the correct item. This is a short sleeved dress that looks NOTHING like the picture. I thought I would be able to wear the dress for an event but I was wrong. I need long sleeves. I completely wasted time ordering this.
1.0,Optical clarity is good. But in less than 90 days the coating wore off the lenses and they are nearly unusable
1.0,"Extremely small and does not follow measurement guidelines. Also, low quality because it comes buttoned and when you try to unbutton it the thread is trapped in the button. When you finally get the item unbuttoned you end up with hanging, loose threads in that area. The seller also charges about 35% of the item total in return costs when you try to return it. Definitely not satisfied..."
1.0,"Dress arrived looking like an oversized robe with a huge hole in the side. Worthless, cheap piece of junk."
1.0,Super tangled then it broke because it was tangled so bad
1.0,No sirve
1.0,Very poor quality. Looks much cheaper than pictured.
1.0,"Despite using the size guide, this is too small. I would go 2 sizes up or expect it to fit snug against the body"
1.0,I just recieved the tie today and i don't like at all<br />The cut of the tie at the end is not even<br /><br />I dont know if suppose to look like that... But i dont like
1.0,"Returned, you could see through this cream color"
1.0,"I was so disappointed to receive this mask and see Vote misspelled. My mask don’t have a T, it has an I. I can’t even wear it, it was a total waste of my money. Buyer beware!"
1.0,Don't Wear these driving! You won't be able to see green lights. Beach glasses only.
1.0,The letter was much smaller than expected and the chain broke in less than 24 hours
1.0,"The picture shows a bunch of feather and when you receive the product it barely has any. The feathers also fall off easily. Honestly, not worth it. I only bought this as a gag gift."
1.0,Style was different from picture of original order. Disappointed and returned.
1.0,4 times too small poor quality false advertising on sizes
1.0,This is Worst product I ever bought on Amazon  !<br />Horrible Quality<br />Cheap Materials<br />Fit<br />String broken before I could blink.  I wanted other colors<br />But hell no!<br />Waste of money and time!<br />Sooo disappointed<br />I spend a lot of money with Amazon . I am insulted.
1.0,"Awful, broke a month after I got it."
1.0,"Since I was 16 (more than 25 years ago), I have been using Swatch watches.  I loved them.  Unfortunately, this was my last Swatch.  The crown broke in less than three weeks after purchased."
1.0,Did not hold up for my 10 yr old boy.  Lights malfunctioned within two weeks. Holes in shoe within 60 days.
1.0,If you are a large to xl do not buy this!!!...you need to be a size medium or the xl will be way too small
1.0,[[VIDEOID:47e2585ce600087686b1a01a430298fa]] No es la que pedi.
1.0,Very cheap and very tiny rings. Would fit someone with a very small hand
1.0,"I'm not terribly large chested, barely a D. This didn't cover anything. Front wires were loose inside the cloth, so it slipped around and offered no support. I have no idea how this managed to be too big and too small at the same time, but disappointing to say the least."
1.0,"A couple of the gloves had holes in them straight from the package.  The stitching is very poor and in a different shade than the fabric.  Also, the dye in the gloves stained the gel polish on my nails."
1.0,"Returned due to being slimy. The fabric looks poor and so artificial. On top of it, not a warm winter sweater."
1.0,"Didn’t like the shortness or fit of the cover up. Wasn’t my style, but it may be for someone else. Returned with no problems."
1.0,"Junk, Fell apart, don't waste your money."
1.0,Cute dress..but order at least one or two sizes up .
1.0,Since I bought it  for my wife it hasn't work properly. My wife is very upset
1.0,Disappointed doesn't look at all like the picture. Fits like a moo moo.. just disappointed
1.0,"I'm not sure who would fit into this swimsuit.  There is no torso.  The cups sit at my waist.  The straps look nothing like the picture and are extremely thin and long.  It's the most oddly fitting swimsuit I've ever tried on.  It's also not red.  It's a rusty brown color, and the material is so thin it wouldn't last for more than a couple of wears."
1.0,The bottle wouldn't stay screwed on so meducation and the bottle was soon lost.
1.0,Badly done
1.0,"It took more than 2 weeks for order to be delivered.  The mask frames did not fit well on my face and did not stay in place.  Also, the hard plastic was uncomfortable.  I am going to try another type made of silicone."
1.0,Cheap! The back closures broke the first time I opened them and some don’t even line up to close. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!
1.0,I ordered an XL. Packet it came in said XL aswell. It ended up being a small. Ot fits my wife instead of me. Not happy.
1.0,"Didn't fit, which it was adjustable. It took to long to arrive. Disappointed."
1.0,"Colors don’t match picture. Skirt is more of a navy with red. Runs very small. I ordered a medium, and usually wear a small/medium in clothes or a 6"
1.0,"none of the pictures and descriptions actually match the color of the glasses, shipping will not be refunded even though the product in correct when you receive it. DONT BOTHER WITH THIS PRODUCT"
1.0,Not happy with this slipper. Way too small - not true to size. I bought 2 sizes up and was still too small.
1.0,"I wear a size c bra and this does not fit me at all. Plus, when I tried to unzip the case, the plastic was stuck in the zipper when I got it, so I had to end up breaking it to open it"
1.0,This dress is terrible they should have throw this in a trash before sending it out to a customer the striped does not match up from the front to back and the scene where they sew is coming apart now I have to pay my money to send this mess back
1.0,"This was a Christmas gift and after one month of use, the cheap interior is cracking."
1.0,Got delivered today. My daughter put the bracelet on and literally had it on for 3 minutes before  the clasp broke and it fell off. Can’t rate the necklace.. hoping it lasts longer than the bracelet. As for the Transaction with the seller I have no complaints. Not happy with the quality of the merchandise.
1.0,"This is one of two watches I purchased at the same time (one for work and this one for events). Both were defective. They don't keep time and when I took it in to the local branch, they confirmed it was defective.<br />What good is a watch that can't keep time?"
1.0,"Item is different color, and the writing on the inside is already worn off. I'm embarrassed to give this as a gift now. No time to return before Christmas, so in the trash it goes I guess. I'm very dissatisfied"
1.0,This dress was very short.
1.0,Cool product but the batteries were dead. Tiny little u41 batteries.
1.0,"Disappointed. Nice size but only 2 colors, 2 patterns. Not what I expected."
1.0,"Tiny, cheap quality"
1.0,The synthetic fibers make the socks slippery in my shoes.
1.0,"I ordered these earrings and 4 days later one of them came unscrewed.Luckily we found it, but then a couple days later the same one fell out again and it was lost. They are very pretty however it's a shame it came undone. I made sure they were secure in my little girls ears."
1.0,These are way smaller than they look in the picture.  They are teeny-tiny.  They look like the studs babies wear when they first get their ears pierced.
1.0,"THIS ITEM IS NOT LEATHER! IT'S PLASTIC!<br />This seller is dishonest about this product. Is it is poly urethane, say so! It smells! Terrible!"
1.0,Didn’t like the material on this and the fit was off for me
1.0,"Couldn't figure out how to convert this to a brooch.  The one pin that was supposed to be removable wasn't.  Very disappointed because I wanted this primarily as a brooch and it's so pretty.  Oh, and a stone fell out almost immediately."
1.0,This item does not look  like product.<br />Shows the tails in the picture but does not have them.<br />Just a plain onesie ... very disappointed 😞
1.0,"I  was hoping for a nice product, however i got the ring and it was not round it looks like it was smashed and causing it to no longer be round in shape."
1.0,"The idea was cute, but this is for a child's head apparently. It's a shame it didn't fit and sadder even that I could not return it which is what earns it the one star."
1.0,I don’t think I’ve ever had earrings that were so difficult to latch into place.  I’ve worn this style before—from a different manufacturer—and I’ve never had problems like this.  They’re going back.
1.0,I'm very disappointed.  The color is dull and it looks dirty.
1.0,Waste of money.  They don't stay put.
1.0,"AWFUL made my nose soooo infected and had 2 blood bubbles with both of them. Maybe I just need hypoallergenic... But if you have sensitive skin, DO NOT GET THESE"
1.0,"The pattern is not as vivid as shown.  I've read that the pattern may wear off.  I like the vivid contrast, and am disappointed in the actual band's appearance."
1.0,Y’all I only bought this because of the picture of an American girl wearing it and all reviews said fit as expected...... I wear a 14 and couldn’t get it on!!! XL!!! Oh!!!!!!! I hate returning things!!!!!!!!!
1.0,Product is not what it shows on line cheap material very desapointed<br />Not worth it
1.0,"The size of this product isn’t completely accurate. I ordered 2x which is what I usually buy, because I like it to be loose on me. But this 2x is really small and it fits my 13 year old daughter"
1.0,It looks like something a child would wear not something for an adult... It's really small
1.0,One earring fell apart after one wearing.
1.0,Runs super small. Be prepared to return it.
1.0,This baithing suit was too small!! I ordered it in a large. I am 5'5&#34; 149lbs and the swimsuit fit like it was an extra small
1.0,These may be nice but there were too short.  The colors were nice
1.0,I'm planning on returning this. The shirt is definitely a size or two small. Very thin material.  It's cheap and it shows
1.0,"This is a great bag and perfect for days when you need your bag close or don't want to carry a big bag.  However, this bag is cheaper at the parks, or the disney store website than it is here."
1.0,Broke after just two weeks of use. What a failure of a product.
1.0,"The back clip fell off!  Noticed with the other that it was loose, so I suppose that’s what happened to the other one…"
1.0,If you have a room full you will need to be close to see the small board
1.0,I expected nicer blue tanzinite and a larger setting. The white gold doesn’t look like white gold. Im returning these.
1.0,The wallet gets bad scratches in it quick from little things. The pockets also won't hold two cards after three have been in them. The leather just stretches out and the cards will fall out like nothing is holding them at all.
1.0,"Much bulkier than expected, will be returning"
1.0,"I waited weeks for what I thought were made in USA masks.<br />These are made in china garbage, unsafe don't use !!!"
1.0,This was delivered last night and went to put my cards in it and it ripped.... pretty bummed because I was looking forward to this wallet
1.0,"Super thin material, like if u breathe too hard its going to rip, not like lacy leggings where u can move n it will be ok.<br />Hand wash it only."
1.0,"Don't buy, its NOTHING like the picture."
1.0,"This is at least 2 sizes smaller than you expect it to be. Quality is chintzy, not worth the bother to order it. It's also no the same quality or color as what you see in the photo."
1.0,I purchased this belt a month ago to go along with my brown shoes. After one month of wearing this belt it is almost broken where the clip goes into the belt.  The visible side is fraying pretty badly as well.  If i would have known it would break this easily i would have gone somewhere different.  Highly disappointed.
1.0,"Looked great when I got it. Problem was, the pins they sent to attach the bands to my watch, were too big. Or the holes drilled into the band were too small. Probably the latter. So disappointed."
1.0,Fabric is cheep. I wore them once and the inseam shredded within an hour and they weren't tight at all. Crap! I will never buy from them again
1.0,"Visually, looked good but did not clip properly to the watch.  I am returning."
1.0,Cute. My vrandson will love
1.0,The v neck threads were coming apart and there were noticable flaws in the fabric. Already returned the dress.
1.0,"This is the wrong symbol for medicine. Kind of hilarious that so many people incorrectly use this one... This is the Cauceus, when the proper symbol is the Rod of Asclepius. STOP FEEDING INTO INCORRECT SYMBOL USAGE.<br /><br />Caduceus: &#34;In Roman iconography, it was often depicted being carried in the left hand of Mercury, the messenger of the gods, guide of the dead, and protector of merchants, shepherds, gamblers, liars, and thieves.&#34;"
1.0,"As of May 2019, I have owned this watch for 13 months.  It was fantastic up until about three months ago when it started to lose 5 minutes per day.  I have contacted Amazon and Watchseller to see how they will remedy the situation.  Basically the watch does not keep correct time.<br /><br />I want to love this watch.  I am still hopeful it will start to keep correct time."
1.0,These are badly made and a bad design. The join between the curved decorative piece and the ear wire is too weak to hold the heaviness of the decorative piece. It also has no indentation to stop the back falling off so the earring just flies off with any normal head movement.
1.0,Was not able to register purchase.
1.0,too small not a tunic not long at all<br />I usually wear xxl...ordered two of these... both way to small. disappointed in color also. faded color<br />gave away.  lesson learned.
1.0,"I hadn’t even gotten to try on the costume yet before I realized there was a huge tear in the seam below the zipper. After further investigation, I noticed that the stitching is very cheaply done, and if I were to even try the costume on, I am confident that the stitches would tear. Will be returning."
1.0,Runs very small and non returnable
1.0,Within two weeks one of the balls completely broke and I didn't even touch it.
1.0,Size 8 should not be considered a large. I am a size 10 which is usually a medium. I sized up with the large but it fit like an extra small.  Sent it back.
1.0,It is way too short to wear as a dress. I got an extra large and it is smaller than I expected.
1.0,The stones in this bracelet were way smaller than I thought. This wasn't worth the price
1.0,This was a terrible fit and very unflattering. I’m an XL in most clothes and I ordered a 3x to be safe because they said to size up and it was so unflattering and uncomfortable. Definitely do not recommend.
1.0,Not what the picture shows never buying clothes here  uhh
1.0,It doesn't fall on the body how it's meant to and the fabric is cheap and rough.
1.0,They only thing you can fit in this is your arm!! That's how small it is.
1.0,"Way too big. I ordered a small and it was more like an extra large. The material was a weird material as well. I was going to return, but ended up giving to my MIL."
1.0,"They don’t work for me. I followed the directions but never was able to see clearly long distance short distance or anything in between.. came in a nice case, but I can’t get them to work."
1.0,"I Am a avid AMAZON shopper. Normally, I Am truly please with my purchases. However, this SUMMER has been a most valuable lesson. U.S. women, please BEWARE of ALL items from foreign countries, especially China. Ordered a few Summer dresses, blouses, and coordinating jewelry ... and, what a major disappointment! NONE were as advertised and the smell of petroleum. This particular necklace set was another FAIL. Acrylic or plastic necklace were much smaller in dimension and looks like children`s jewelry...NOT even fitting for a teen to wear. I AM DONE with all things women's fashion apparel (including handbags) from AMAZON. If any AMAZON BUYER REPRESENTATIVES are reading...U.S.A. companies...PLEASE!"
1.0,Nice shirt but I just could wear it once.
1.0,"I ordered this item with the Behind you message, however the last word is “need” but the bracelet says “heed” . Big disappointment as the bracelet itself is very nice."
1.0,Literally adult small. Not a child sized glove.
1.0,"Irregular/IRREGULAR/IRREGULAR/ really weird fit/I got the pink color leopard ,,which looks very pretty pink (vibrant) sweater looks very drap ,,NOT VIBRANT ‼️Really weird fit ,,gave it to my daughter (who is petite) ,,I am a woman’s size 14,,,,sweater looks way to small on me ,,,"
1.0,"I followed the size chart, ordered a size up from my Norman VS size,  I did everything i could to ensure a proper fit and they are unbearably tight.  I ordered three of three of them that are completely useless"
1.0,"I expected a soft cotton shirt like all my other extreme shirts, however this one feels like sandpaper. I never once wore the shirt the entire winter. Horrible horrible horrible."
1.0,"These are sooo tiny that one went right through my ear piercing and slipped out, never to be found again. I guess it was my fault for not more carefully noting the size, but I cannot imagine why anyone would pay that money for something so small. These are even too small for my second piercing, which is too bad because now I have just one. I would recommend these in a larger size because they are well made and quite lovely."
1.0,"Definitely smaller than they should have been. They also seemed to be cut oddly, but it could have just been that they were too small."
1.0,"Cheap material, wayyyyy too small"
1.0,The print was sewn upside down. Sent in for an exchange. I received the replacement and it's the same deal. I believe this seller is just trying to unload a bunch of defects on unsuspecting consumers.<br /><br />The flamingos are not upside down in the featured photo.
1.0,"The gaiters were too tight to fit a petite, thin 4 year old and didn't stretch well at all.  Could hardly get them over her head. Not worth the bother to send back, so I cut them up for doll bed covers."
1.0,Broke after mo.
1.0,Item received did not look detailed and intricate like the photo description. Returned mine.
1.0,I didn't even get the chance to wear this.  The &#34;clasp knob&#34; broke off the first time I put it on. Just popped right off.
1.0,"Shiny, itchy and smelled weird. Not even wearable. The picture is blurred and off too. Total rip off"
1.0,"My daughter's feet were sopping wet after she wore these for the first time in wet snow - socks dripping wet!! Terrible boots, also wind and snow can get right in via the open top. They look like boots but do not act like boots. AVOID!"
1.0,Size was more for a child - horrible - I didn’t even try on as too small - I am a size 16 and thought xl would have fit
1.0,My daughters bag broke the first time she carried it.  She's ony 5 so it was upsetting trying to watch her carry the stings. The only thing inside the bag was a small beach towel.  :(
1.0,"They look so pretty, but I never got to wear! I knew they were delicate, so I handled carefully, unfortunately, when removing from 'holder'the piece on one part broke & impossible to repair...a waste of $14.99"
1.0,Inaccurately advertised!! This is just a normal bra with weird cups.
1.0,When I opened the package the ring was in I found it was broken already. One of the braided bands that goes around the ring was not fasten down so I am having my boy friend fix it so I can wear it. I'm not going to waste my the me trying to return the broken item I will try to fix it to the best of my abilities but I will say they kinda broke my heart when I opened that package up and found it damaged. All the excitement of that ring vanished right then and there.
1.0,Way too small. Not an accurate size.
1.0,"Sandals where only used as house slippers. Nothing strenuous, just walking around the house.  Velcro pad on the left shoe detached from the cross strap after just over a month of use."
1.0,"The material was nice, however the first time we put them on, the fabric tore at the stitch points.  Had to pitch both in the trash."
1.0,Cheap and not leather. Husband threw away in the trash.
1.0,"You get what you paid for. The black dye runs. I have only used it once, because the dye runs."
1.0,Its short.
1.0,If I could give this ZERO stars I would! The item received looks NOTHING like the item depicted. I waited a very long time to receive this item for my son's birthday and now I have to return it and look for an authentic one elsewhere! I can LITERALLY fold this mask in half! It is not a hard plastic but flimsy and arrived damaged! Horrible texture and quality!! Highly disappointed!!
1.0,"No. Not this time. It's my second one a day unfortunately,  it came broken. The bangles are each slit."
1.0,This item was missing a stone in the middle row. It is very obvious. I will return this item.
1.0,I have found whennordering on here to go a little bigger then normal so I ordered an XL. It wasn't just a little big... it was HUGE! Like too big to even be a dress!
1.0,The material is cheap and the color is not at all close to the one in the  picture. It’s not brown it’s more like an old peach.
1.0,It didn't have that dark rich purple like the picture. It's not worth the price.
1.0,"Painful and doesn’t do anything, waste of money"
1.0,"Hardly does anything , sprayed on thick 🤷🏻‍♂️"
1.0,"I shoot superhero videos for Youtube (Youtube: Superhero Battles In Real Life) and spent a lot of money on the Flash costume and an extremely high amount for this mask to complete the costume. (To the creators credit, the mask looks nice. Unfortunately it's way too expensive- should be no more than $25 in my opinion). It came smashed and the plastic is so sharp when you try to put it on. To top it off, the mask is too small. I'd say it could fit a child or small adult. I'm not even too tall. I'm 56.5 and it's still too small for me. I feel it's completely unusable and that's why I gave 1 star. I hope I can get a refund."
1.0,I bought this as a Mother's Day gift - unfortunately its way too small.
1.0,"I ordered a 2xl (XXL) because usually hoodies seem to shrink a bit and I wanted a loose fit to wear when riding motorcycle. I received the order, the bag said XXL, but the hoodie inside was an XL. So I did an exchange order, specified what happened, received the new hoodie, same thing happened.  I ordered a 2XL (XXL) but they sent me another XL. I kept both and as I expected, they shrunk a little.  Not sure why they couldn’t get me the correct size I ordered. Not impressed! Other than wrong size, it’s a good quality sweatshirt."
1.0,I ordered the tan one and the white one. The white arrived with the white fabric on the buckle peeling off. I tried to reglue but it's still peeling.
1.0,I don’t recommend buying this product is so cheap made and star fooling apart
1.0,"This dress arrived with the back seam unraveling. The color was beautiful. But if it was falling apart even before I put it on my body, I wouldn't even attempt to repair it. I was very disappointed."
1.0,"I normally wear a medium, but ordered a large because of reviews. Large was still too small and arm sleeve had a 1” pull apart after one wash on delicate. You get what you pay for."
1.0,Fit baggy and loose and broke after a few days
1.0,Viene más angosto de la cadera ... y cuando estira la tela los círculos se distorsionan feo
1.0,This is not a dress.  It's more of tunic top.  It falls just below the butt.
1.0,Beautiful but broke within 2 weeks. Only wore it 3 times.
1.0,Horrible broke while sittin in the sun...
1.0,"This was too big for my nose, I couldn't get it in."
1.0,Small for the size listed!
1.0,"I started out liking these, then I cleaned them and the chrome finish came off !<br />So I’d say don’t buy!"
1.0,"Nothing like the picture. The neck is very fitted, and is just a larger neck hole, not like the droopy shoulder that it shows in the pictures. The top is not oversized slouchy cute, it’s just big. It is not designed to look cute. I ordered these to wear as getting ready pajamas for my sister and her bridesmaids, but I have to return all of them now."
1.0,Really disappointed that these were dark navy color while they look black in the photos. They do run a little small and probably wont wear these much. They also had glue and scuffs when I first opened them.
1.0,Too short for me and I am petite. I wasn’t lookin for a crop top.
1.0,No me quedo
1.0,Disappointed! Wanted a white hat that was pictured and the one I received is most definitely cream colored.
1.0,Older people have hard time getting on.
1.0,A mess !!! The hand part didn't fit.
1.0,The hat is completely flat and has no structure to it at all. Overall very disappointing.
1.0,Not the dress that was advertised and didn't come with a bow.
1.0,Was lil small
1.0,"Size runs overly large, sizing measurements listed are inaccurate. Shipping costs are extremely expensive for such a poor quality shirt."
1.0,"Doesn't work for Mission belts, just a bit too wide.  Had to order the genuine replacement strap by Mission."
1.0,Ok hat not slouchy nothing  special
1.0,"Not free people brand. Misinformation, and badly advertised."
1.0,My 8 year old daughter got only two dance classes out of these before the heel broke off. Price seemed great at first but not worth it if they don’t last! Spend a little extra for shoes that will last the entire season.
1.0,Terrible! Tore after 1 wear.
1.0,These run super small. I ordered the large (12-14) for my 7 year old and the shirt is a half shirt and the pants are high waters.
1.0,Very cheap. The sloth is a sticker of some sorts. Not embroidered.
1.0,Very Disappointed I request my return never got it. Very bad quality too. Zero Start
1.0,This product was to heavy and broke me out.
1.0,Very poor quality- Ring broke as my daughter was putting it on her finger for the very first time.
1.0,Overpriced cheap tie unfortunately.  Very disappointed.
1.0,It kinda loose
1.0,Poor quality and already had a hole in the side when I opened it.
1.0,Beautiful but the designs were all faded and it came sticky :(
1.0,This dress feels like a slip that should go under another dress. I’m pretty sure it wasn’t intended tone worn by itself. I would have preferred cotton over whatever type this is
1.0,Really cheaply made. I put it on and the clip broke after the 1st day. Would not suggest.
1.0,The battery was dead in the brand new watch.
1.0,Way too small for a grown man - one size does not fit all - nothing special about the quality
1.0,"Not helpful at all for night driving, no anti-glare coating."
1.0,"I got them for high arch, didn't help"
1.0,"As soon as these came in the post broke off. Because they were inexpensive I have tried to repair them, with no success. Super glue will not even hold the post in place. I was so excited to receive these earrings, and haven’t worn them a single time."
1.0,"I bought the Black red dress, I am a size 12 and ordered a Large that ended up being too tight so i ordered the XXL and the top of the dress covered half of me and the bottom was ok.  Wish it fit better."
1.0,Broke within the first ten minutes. Do not waste your money.
1.0,"I am 6 foot two, athletic build 225 pounds With broad shoulders. If you wear an extra-large you might want to order a double XL. That is if you are my build. The arms were also too short and very tight around the biceps. I am not a buff guy either."
1.0,Nice apron however this Buckeye family didn’t appreciate the Bulldog logo at the top. I guess maybe it would be good for split household .... lol
1.0,The large was more a medium
1.0,"Top is too big, bottom is too small. Top is stretchy soft cotton, bottom has no give whatsoever. In spite, it kind of works! Best of luck.... Disappointed.<br /><br />5'3"", 250#'s, 42DD, 16-20 to depending, 22/24 bottoms."
1.0,Quality is nice but they are too small to be wearable. Super small.
1.0,Don't like and no shipping back info.
1.0,My son wanted this mask waited 3 weeks for it and when it came in it was all crumpled and broken. not worth the time waiting and waist of money very cheaply made
1.0,My daughter manage to pierce her nose but the nose ring was to big to go through save time money and pain and just go pay to have it pieced she had to wait 2 weeks to let heal before they would pierce her nose
1.0,The charms are very tiny
1.0,"Really cute. The print is nice. *** Have to change my review. Completely split open at the seem, material is fraying.*** such a shame"
1.0,Buttons to small
1.0,This ring is way smaller than expected and the rhinestones have been falling out since day one (a week)
1.0,Entirely too small not whats in description
1.0,I rarely leave reviews - but being an avid FAUX FUR collector and designer- these are far from fluffy- they are not soft. They are basically craft store quality crafting raw fur. There is no movement to them. You can buy a yard oh Funky Muppet fur and make these ( I bought these out of curiosity - seeing if I could save time with one of my designs- I would NEVER  use them  - even for a quality costume. The picture is NOT accurate . Save your money
1.0,"Although the bag is beautiful, it smells awful and is very sticky. Moved it to the garage because it was stinking up the house. I have owned other leather bags before, but none that had a bad odor or left residue on your hand."
1.0,Like color but size chart was not even close to actual size.  Not pleased!
1.0,"Shoe is very small, way too small and especially hard to stretch over the foot bc the elastic at ankle is just tiny... possibly need at least a full size larger and still not sure it would be easy enough to get on my daughters foot. Returning and probably not purchasing any Nike over internet as i thinkits best to find in store and be sure of fit."
1.0,Broke my skin out
1.0,"I ordered this dress and it was beautiful but a little to small, returned it and re ordered a size bigger and received a completely diffrent dress Not Happy, now i have to go out of my way to return tnis dress and being 9mon pregnant im not happy at all."
1.0,"Complete garbage, looks like a cheap Halloween costume.  Looks nothing like the picture and the fabric is thin nylon. through it in the trash"
1.0,Love the color and the jingles but the SMELL IS UNBEARABLE! I have sprayed it multiple times with febreeze to no avail.
1.0,I'm having a severe allergic reaction to this metal even though it says it's fine finish18K platinum plated. It's causing a reaction within the first 10 mins of wearing it. May be fake.
1.0,Very cute shirts but the opening for head is too small. Not able to wear because of this. I ordered a size larger but the neck of the shirts don't stretch at all for fitting over the head. Grandson normally wears 2T and this shirt was 3T.
1.0,"This mask was not the quality I expected. The material was too stretchy, which allowed big gaps (openings) on the side of the mask even after adjusting the strings.<br />I will be returning this mask, will not work for me."
1.0,Made way TOO SMALL!!!<br />Size up now n 2 sizes!!
1.0,The watch fell apart the minute It was taken out of the box.
1.0,Like the look of the shorts but way way too small. Definitely will be returning
1.0,"I thought the shirt got lost in the mail because the tracking was wrong. Finally got the shirt today. It’s a good weight, but it is tiny. My daughter normally wears a medium or large top, and I bought her a 2X. I’m worried it won’t fit her. It’s that small. Plus, it is not a longer length or tunic cut at all. Looks like a plain plaid shirt. Very disappointed. Don’t waste your time or money ordering."
1.0,es incomodo
1.0,Very disappointed! Looks nothing like the photo. Very tin material!
1.0,I checked the sizing chart before ordering. & had ordered a 2xl or 3xl. It came in more like an xs. Ended up giving it to my mother a few years ago.
1.0,The feathers were falling off before I could get it out of the box.
1.0,I shouldn’t expect much from a $20 pair of sunglasses but I generally expect the minimums like the nose pads. Kind of disappointing as I have to take time out and repackage them and send them back. Not what I want to do with my free time.
1.0,Too off brandish
1.0,This is so false advertisement
1.0,"Flimsy, absolutely no support for foot. Bought better ones from Walmart. In the garbage."
1.0,It was too small too short did not fit at all and it was a 4X
1.0,"This is a picture of the straps and as you can see the design that shows having a clearly darkened outline in the listing is not at all what the band has. The band just has the imprint that is barely visible.  In addition,  the picture does show the oval button type clasp which is my bad for not noticing but I wanted the design so that overruled my attention to detail, moot point now,  but this type of design offers a bubbly and awkward clasp area.  I bought 4 of these,  returning them all.  Bummer."
1.0,It fell apart after 1 week
1.0,It worked well initially but lasted less than three months. Don’t waste your money
1.0,3X is not a TRUE 3X its more like a XL. I have many 3XL's and this is no comparison as far as the fit. Very disappointed.
1.0,"The clothing items from this provider are sized for children, and material is flimsy and cheaply made.  Do not buy!"
1.0,Horrible material. Dont buy!
1.0,NO prime.
1.0,Junk. Yes I paid very little but the color has worn off completely in 2 days. It was a silver color and it's now light purple.
1.0,It was made smaller in the bust to waist area It was pretty I am so sorry I could not use it. If your the size listed below go one up
1.0,"Dangerously uncomfortable. These cut so sharply into the bridge of my nose that I would be afraid to dive for fear of lacerations. I tried to trim the nose piece, but the way it was made prevents having enough room across the bridge.<br /><br />I wanted to like them, but these are a definite no. To be clear, this isn't a gradual pressure that turns into an ache; this is instant discomfort that quickly becomes pain. Cannot recommend for adult faces."
1.0,Very Small!
1.0,Looks nothing like picture. It looks like a pj's
1.0,Too small hard to open or put on wrist.
1.0,Well I ordered white they sent me pink ughhhh...  going bike riding tonight with my WHITE lights on my bike and no WHITE glow shoelaces smh
1.0,The shirt originally felt small and tight. I bought an XL and it fits like a medium. Maybe my wife will like a new shirt.
1.0,I bought this belt for my son. When searching it was made for kids. My sun came home drenched in urine because he wasn’t able to take off the belt while at school. As a mother I am so sad he experienced this. I can just imagine him in the bathroom having to go and unable to remove this belt. This belt is not kid friendly.
1.0,The sizing of this is WAY OFF. It was a complete waste of money and I couldn’t return it.
1.0,"I ordered a small, my usual size. Im 5' 4"" 108lbs. This top is extreme stretchy and fits weird at the top around the neck, did not matter if I had it tucked in or tucked out. Arm holes a little too large.<br />Maybe the extreme stretch makes it fit this way. No label inside. No Way to see if there was even a front or back. No care instructions."
1.0,"I specifically bought this as a front opening button down shirt. That's what I need for medical purposes. The shirt is nice and soft, the description is fraud."
1.0,This wasn't a very well made tankini and it offered no support.  I returned it.
1.0,Very cheap looking. They came bent and one had a loose back that fell off the first day.
1.0,The bottom lace hem ripped within one wear. I was given no problem returning for next size
1.0,"I really wanted to love this skirt. There's nothing to love. The material is cheap. The color is more red than pink, although not ridiculously different.  It's waaay too small."
1.0,"Definitely a woman's watch. If you're worried about that, don't get it. If you're not, you will love it."
1.0,My feet hurt way worse when I wear these.
1.0,Its to hot for summer.
1.0,Item was so cheaply made of polyester material and the headbamd was just a strip of cloth. I got a refund though they said I could keep it. Won't let my daughter wear it so probably will drop off to Goodwill.
1.0,terrific small pad cover light weight..however...wrong size.Is it REALLY too darn difficult to simply put in the actual DIMENSIONS  of the case so we don't have to buy it and HOPE it MIGHT fit??After the fact I read some others comments and oddly..many had the same issue I did and responses usually refer to the notebook model number rather than simply saying WHAT the dimensions of this case were.
1.0,It's a okay item at first but after you get maybe mid exercise and truly start to sweat you can't breathe through it. It becomes a wet towel on top of your face.
1.0,About 4x smaller. Did not fit at all. No padding at all and the material is scratchy.
1.0,Zipper broken right out the packaging.
1.0,Socks Fall down and doesn't come in a size big enough for a person with larger calf muscles. Didn't compress anything and is made of the nylon that makes your feet sweat.
1.0,"I bought a large size because Asian sizing usually runs small, but this was tremendous. Normally I wear things oversized, but with this I couldn’t because the shape of the garment is not just free flowing, it is cut to go in at the waist so it just was unwearable. I guess for this to fit properly I would go a size down from normal, but I’m not even sure that would look right."
1.0,Bad they don’t stay on the ear lob.
1.0,Couldn’t figure out how to put it on. It doesn’t come already ready. Very difficult
1.0,The stitching comes loose very quickly! Very disappointed!
1.0,They sucked. Don’t buy. They didn’t keep feet dry. Water gets in and they are pointless.
1.0,"It's made with poor material, They sent to me other completely different! It was too much less than I expected..."
1.0,I was not happy with the fabric or the fit.
1.0,Material is thin like a shirt. It’s listed as a cardigan but it’s really a thin long sleeved shirt. Not very warm.
1.0,"Product arrived in a timely fashion. They looked very pretty. But then, one earring broke as I was putting it in. Very cheaply made.This makes me wonder if this product is actually sterling silver. You get what you pay for."
1.0,"Show me the setup with a key installed.  I'm looking at it, I see the cute little screwdriver that came with it, I see how the shackle opens. Where does the key go?  The shackle is too big to go thru the hole in the key and the lanyard seems to be riveted shut.  I guess you are just expected to install a key on the end with a split ring.  It could have been so much more with the rivet removable (screw) and a single use key installed while ditching the shackle.  It seems to be good quality but missed the boat on attachment.  Back you go cute little leather thingy...."
1.0,"These remotes are horrible.  I have to be in my garage for them to work, which kinda defeats the purpose."
1.0,Was sooo upset I just ended up giving them away they were so tiny couldn't even fit my pinky waisted my money
1.0,These are comically large. Way too big for my glasses.
1.0,No Sleeves?! The picture shows an item with sleeves but there are NONE. Ridiculous.
1.0,"The are light, beautifull and nice, but the frame is Damaged I don't really recomend this product to any body."
1.0,"Just opened this and only received a cheap dress, definitely not close to worth $60. Save your money."
1.0,The fabric is too long and can't barely see the logo when I put it on
1.0,Not a good fit don’t like the fabric
1.0,Way way way too firm. Can't hide them under any pair of slacks or pants. You'd have to be wearing thick tight jeans in order for them to be pressed down. I am 5'4&#34; and about 110lbs.... maybe it's not for my size.<br /><br />Great concept though.
1.0,Super baggy and not at all the green color as shown in the picture.
1.0,Shoes are cute but they run small. My daughter couldn't wear them.
1.0,"when I took the straps out of the package one of them was scuffed, I was annoyed but as long as it didn't impair performance I wasn't going to make a big deal about it. I then I attached them to my switch controllers and the strap adjuster for the other strap broke the moment I tried to adjust it to my wrist. I brought these to play Just Dance but what use do they serve me if I can't adjust them to my wrist??!"
1.0,"It’s a beautiful bracelet, but for the money it’s not worth it at all. I had it for 2 months and it broke. Pura Vida Bracelets have NEVER broken, but this did, and it’s a lot more expensive."
1.0,"The dress has 2 leg slits so it creates this weird like tribal banner looking thing. Not to mention the small is friggin huge I'm a size 2 this is wayyy bigger. Not flattering at all. If you're goi for amenite woman then yes, buy this dress. You won't feel sexy at all in it. Regret purchasing"
1.0,Way smaller then I thought it was going to be.
1.0,Very pointy
1.0,"These bras were comfortable, but so very thin for a sports bra. I wore these to spin class and felt like I had no support at all. I wouldn't recommend buying these."
1.0,"This is not silk it is 100% polyester<br />Edit: They are no longer advertising this as silk, the seller has also contacted me multiple times even after I asked them not.  I will not be buying anything from this seller at all."
1.0,Says this is an extra large chain. LIES!!! Maybe for a child. Don't buy!
1.0,"Not true to size and large fits as small… yes as a small, not even a medium, a small."
1.0,"I bought the blue , it is shiny and colors aren’t as in the picture. I was expecting more of a subtle overall color but this is alot brighter. Almost looks like neon orange. My stripes match up but the overall shape of it is kinda weird. Probably not worth returning as I got it on sale but absolutely will not buy again."
1.0,"These are awful. I do not have long fingernails by any means, and I went to pull these up and my nails shred right through them, leaving a gaping hole. Furthermore, I found them to be a bit too snug, I purchased a L and usually wear a M or L. I recommend spending a bit more on pants that will hold up longer than two wears..."
1.0,The material is not what I espected
1.0,Not whit I expected not good
1.0,Not at all long enough to be a true kimono. Fabric does not drap and is stiff as ever.<br /><br />Gave it away to a friend
1.0,My husband thought they were a pair of my underwear LOL please do not sell these anymore. The stitching on one side was so bad and not even at all. Waste of money.
1.0,"It’s SO, so big. Order down 2 sizes."
1.0,These tubetops were tiny and i went by the size chart. No way they would come close to doing their job. I returned them.
1.0,Loved the dress but it was way too small
1.0,Mine came completely tangled in a ball and after untangling the whole necklace it was broken.
1.0,This product runs extrenely small! Would not recommend.
1.0,"This is a super cute top, but it is NOT true to size...the XL looked more like a medium.  It wasn't worth the hassle of sending back, so I gave it to someone smaller than me."
1.0,Probably the best watch I own
1.0,To small...
1.0,"Had big pleats, no slots for belt, very small in waist, large in legs. Nice fabric, might be nice for someone else."
1.0,Very disappointed with the items they don’t fit me or my daughter and I ordered the correct sizes and they were the complete opposite of what I wanted and I will not be referring or buying any more products from this company.
1.0,"Earings do not stay in your ear, very cheap product.  Returning immediately"
1.0,It smells like a strange wierd scent oil.  I threw it away :(
1.0,This was a horrible purchase.
1.0,"Omg, these suck. First off, they are not in American sizes, the cups are way to small. The bands though are weirdly large. They come with this weird strap I have no idea what to do with. Just shop in person some where local."
1.0,The pendulum came off its mount first time I used it.
1.0,"I ended up returning this as it was not the material I was expecting.  It's my own fault for not reading the description, but it was more like a bathing suit material than a dress."
1.0,Thin cardboard and overpriced.  Not good for anything events or travel.  Head ban keeps falling off.
1.0,Good slap bracelets have the design printed directly in them.  These are wrapped in a plastic tape thing that starts to peel off as soon as one tries to slap the bracelet on.  Not worth it.
1.0,"I bought these boots in Macy's and after wearing them the first time, the fake patent leather creased pretty badly.  After 2 or 3 more wears, the creases turned into complete cracks which let moisture in. The last time I wore them in light snow, my feet were soaked.  What junk.  Same thing happened to the Khombu Queechee boots I got with the fake patent.  Khombu used to be great but the quality now is garbage.  Lucky for me, Macy's told me they'll give me a full refund for both pairs, even though I got them 3 months ago and no longer have the boxes or receipts."
1.0,"This band looks really nice, and even feels nice....but I was so disappointed when it broke in less than 1 day. Wore the new band for a day and fell asleep with my watch on. When I woke up, it was broken. All I could think was I’m so relieve this didn’t happen while I was out and about or at work because my watch watch would probably be broken or lost."
1.0,They said to purchase 2 sizes larger for men but my husband wears a 2xl and I ordered 4xl and it no way even came close to zippering
1.0,"This nose guard is too small for adults, even with a narrow face. Tried it and it messes with my field of vision. I would have returned this if my kid didn't play with it and broke it. I would NOT recommend this for adults."
1.0,"DON'T buy this item, broken after two days"
1.0,"I will note first, most of the reviews that are positive, the people received the bag for free or at a discount. Here's how bad the bag really is. The handle unraveled the first 5 minutes of use. Then once the bag was filled with three beach towels and one bottle of sunscreen the handles started ripping from the base of the bag. I loved the colors and size, but not worth it due to quality."
1.0,Not at all like the picture.
1.0,"Face of the watch is very small. I have other military style watches that have much larger face. The dimensions say 50mm, but that  is the width of the watch. The face which is most important is very small. The alarm or chime is not get loud."
1.0,This is crap it does not even fit on your head at all
1.0,"It's so good that I lost the less than a month after I received them. That's why this review has no pictures. And I don't miss these sunglasses at all.<br />Cheap construction, cheap lenses, not photochromic at all.<br />Would not, and did not buy it again."
1.0,"Necklace came a month after purchase broken and in tons of pieces, very unimpressed."
1.0,"I bought this from another seller.<br />Do not purchase. This is not a sweatshirt.  It's made from a slick shiny material, the gnomes are not 3D as pictured and it runs small. A cheap China shirt."
1.0,took  forever  and came broken  waste of money
1.0,"It looks similar to the picture, but it's thin,  see through,  and uncomfortable."
1.0,I wasn't sure what to expect for the price...product is poor quality. The straps of the glasses were twisted yet still sewn on that way. You could see the foam that is between the glasses & the hat & the plastic eyeglass part of the glasses had a small crack in one of them. Threw away.
1.0,"It was broke, I got it for a gift. when he opened it the the end of the black cord was not attached to the silver lock, at all. There fore he couldn't wear it...After the Holidays are over I will be sending it back."
1.0,"Looks nothing like this shirt, it is a short sleeve tshirt will be returning mine"
1.0,"This bag is absolutely horrible. I had a little hope it wasnt a total piece but i was let down. Im never salty buying a piece of cheap gear, but i guess there is always that one or first time for everything. The zippers are trash. You can barely get them to move. The material is garbage and very uncomfortable. I have bought backpacks from the dollar stores with better quality then this. The side pouches arent real molle, its velcro. The shoulder pads feel like a peice of cardboard wrapped in plastic. There is no backing to this pack either. If you like extra buckles this is definitely for you. There are 8 extra buckles that serve absolutely no purpose. Also the bag is heavier empty then my day pack full. They literally made this with the cheapest material they could find slapped a thousand buckles on it to call it a ""tactical"" backpack.  If you gave this a positive review, you've never been in the woods in your life."
1.0,I wore these 4 times & the post snapped off.  They are exceptionally fragile & not practical.  Im very disappointed.
1.0,"Super cheap iron on decal. Already has wrinkles in decal from shipping. Look like it would come off in one washing. Sweatshirt itself is a very wierd material. Keychain advertised did not come with sweatshirt. Asked for a refund, seller only wants to give me a partial refund."
1.0,I am 5’9 and a size large but I decided to get XL and it fits waaay to small. I think its a med or a small but it’s definitely not XL.  Gave it to my daughter who is a medium n it fits her better.  Oh well. Material is nice!
1.0,Really cute but not for me. Made me look bigger than I was.
1.0,"Garbage, how dare you try selling this… buyer beware!"
1.0,I purchased these gloves to uses when handing my cat. His claws goes through the gloves and he scratched me
1.0,For a Christmas for my brother in law
1.0,Horrible quality and completely made up sizes. Not worth any stars but they make you choose at least one.
1.0,"Not how it looks in the picture, more of a cheaper fabric. Colors are good but I don’t recommend"
1.0,"The dress is nice but it runs very small. I am 5""1 and I ordered a medium and my butt was hanging out. Order 2 sizes up"
1.0,Just super poor quality. Not what I expected. I know it was cheap but in person it was super poor quality. Don’t buy!
1.0,Very flimsy. Will not hold eye piece unless I stand straight up.
1.0,Didn't fit as expected. It was rather small to be an XL. I ended up selling it to my coworker who's 5'8 & slim.
1.0,Should be marked wide on the top of the wrong size. Returned
1.0,Not happy with the quality or sizing
1.0,Fits good through the waist and hips but does'that fit well through the bust.  The cup is fine but it's too big around so it feels like it fills up with water.  Would be great if you were just sitting by the pool but not great for actually swimming.
1.0,Piece of crap.  Wont stay latched.  Don't waste your money people!
1.0,My daughter complained that the wind went right thru.
1.0,Mask pushes tight against face.  Fogs up and makes it hard to read lips.  Difficult to breath with mask on.
1.0,"Does not look like this its super blurry, badly printed."
1.0,These boots had a very bad chemical smell to them. I washed them a few times because I thought they were cool looking. I even soaked them in mouthwash in the sink thinking alcohol and mint smell could cure it. No luck. I would not let my kid wear these. Shipping was good that's why I give it one star.
1.0,"Nice bag, but I used it a whole 5 times before the stitching came undone and the straps broke off. Pretty bummed about it. :("
1.0,Fell apart right when I opened the package
1.0,This product is extremely small and I sized up. I have tried to contact the seller and have not be able to.
1.0,"I would do zero stars. Item is from CHINA and has that awful poison smell to it. I did not even get it out of the package before I got a headache. I don't know what that stuff is that is used for shipping, but it can not be safe for humans."
1.0,These classes were ugly! and when they arrived there was a scratch on the lens.
1.0,Top of dress is made weird to bulky<br />Terrible design
1.0,Poorly made and broke as soon as I took it out of the package.
1.0,"This was supposedly water resistant, but got fogged up inside after it got wet. The screen was impossible to see even after it dried out."
1.0,"I will never wear this top!  Besides being cut very small, the fabric is so thin and it feels terrible - not soft but almost like cellophane.  It cost almost nothing so I won't feel bad tossing it in the garbage."
1.0,Turned silver. I returned it
1.0,Did not look like the photo. Sent back for refund.
1.0,The unlocking silver button I circled in the picture is sticking out and every time I bend my hand to get something it unlocks and the watch almost falls. It is driving me crazy. I wish I realized this before the 30 day return were over.
1.0,"Very thin material.  If you have any flaws, this dress will accentuate every detail- good and bad."
1.0,This bag is poorly made. I haven't had this bag for only a couple of months and the loop that holds the strap has completely torn off. The zipper for the inside pocket has detached and the main zipper is about to come off. I only use this bag for the gym so it's only going through normal use. Yet it's falling apart very quickly.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product.
1.0,"They were not anti fog, so I returned them."
1.0,"doesnt sit straight, crooked brim"
1.0,Sweater was XL but was big enough for maybe a 12 year old child.
1.0,"Was sent SHOELACE , NOT this necklace. Waiting to hear back. Is for my father's Ashes and his funeral is Friday the 20th :("
1.0,Quality was fine but the planet print suit came extremely faded.
1.0,Pretty but cheaply made
1.0,No RFID chip present. Hooked it up to a reader and NOTHING. Total scam!
1.0,"You would think it's made of cotton but it's like silk, possibly rayon. I returned it right away."
1.0,Do not buy
1.0,"Ordered a 4XL, fits like a borderline 3XL. Very tight. If you order, I highly suggest going up a size.  Had to return unfortunately"
1.0,Horrrrrrible material!!! Feels like a bathing suit. Not flattering at all!!
1.0,Husband was able to cut through a glove while at work.
1.0,tried on for 5min and couldn't stand any longer
1.0,WAY too small. I'm pretty sure these are kids sizes. Very cheap material
1.0,It broke the 2nd time wearing it
1.0,"Not so good strings, break easily..."
1.0,A waist of money it looks nothing like the photo very disappointed I will never by from this company again
1.0,"Broken zipper, smelled, cheap. Replaced it already."
1.0,"The dress had some bizarre tag, fit way too tight on top and too large on the bottom, which is weird as I'm a bit pear shaped. I opened it to discover it simply wasn't FINISHED. There's a huge hole IN the dress where the tie SHOULD be... but no, that was just randomly tossed into the cheap bag."
1.0,got this as a gift for my girlfriend and it broke at the top after her only wearing it for a week
1.0,Whatever they are made from they are not like any gloves I have had before. They tear very easily even putting them on.
1.0,Terrible sunglass readers. I use sunglass readers when I drive. Always but 2-2.5 magnification. These glasses distort my view of the dashboard. Would not purchase again. Useless.
1.0,"Sloppy not cute, very very thin - not as shown."
1.0,Runs small! The material / fabric used is not as soft as soft expected. It's very scratchy and uncomfortable to wear.<br />Also the design / pinstripes on the fabric are are uneven and wavy when they should be straight and evenly spaced.
1.0,supposed to be high impact. not a chance. those little pads inside are stupid as well
1.0,worthless the glasses broke after 17 days
1.0,"Too large, the shoulder sleeves  is hanging I when you bend my arms."
1.0,Advertised as non-slip and then guess what? I fell on my ass. Socks are thin and there is no construction or enough elasticity to make the socks form to your foot. Clearly the “grippy” silicone does not work our I wouldn’t have fallen on my ass.
1.0,these sun glasses are much larger then they appear in this picture !!! make sure you check the frame size before you order it
1.0,Too sheer doesn't block out sunlight. Not what I expected.
1.0,The stem of the earring was painted.  When I tried them on they cause burning.  They also don't fasten and fall out.  Not happy with this product.  2 days later my ear lobes are infected and swollen.  I do not have allergies and have to use stainless steal
1.0,Awful material and doesn’t fit.  Wish I would have tried on before I washed them so I could return them
1.0,"NOT nickel free. Cheap quality metal. I sterilized 3 different rings/studs, even using 2 different solutions and all 3 resulted in allergic reaction within an hour. Returned for refund."
1.0,Not what I ordered!!!<br />These uggs came with a jewel and bow on them.
1.0,Wide as a tent.
1.0,"Ring is junk. Not . 925, not even good steel turned finger green."
1.0,"These goggles seemed fine. I wore them in the pool twice after receiving them. After just two uses, the part which holds the length adjustment snapped off. I would not recommend this product."
1.0,I did not like the material. Bad purchase!!!
1.0,"Not true to size at all, but nice material."
1.0,"Although this was comfortable and breathable, the wire that broke pricked my finger when I tried to retrieve it out of my pocket. I am just happy that this was not my eye area."
1.0,"This didn't last up to a month. I used it to carry my books and laptop to school, about 3 times a week. It got a hole in the bottom from scraping the floor (there's no support to keep it from scraping the floor, like some trolley bags have), so my books got wet and torn from scraping the ground through the hole. I bought a different bag to replace it because it's practically useless now..."
1.0,"WAY WAY WAY too small, ordered a size bigger based on previous review but XL fit more like a medium borderline small."
1.0,Awful the lens are blurry and scratchy
1.0,This item is not sized correctly.  It did not even fit over my head.  It was returned the next morning.
1.0,"I ordered a 1X, but it was so small and short I don't any size would have fit."
1.0,The first line of the engraving was not readable. Very disappointed since this was a gift.
1.0,Sizing off. Runs small.
1.0,"Much smaller than anticipated, jewels are barely noticeable"
1.0,not what was advertised
1.0,Tie is faded
1.0,"Gotta this bag on nov 11th, 2016 now it is dec 7th 2016 and it is coming apart."
1.0,Very cheap looking and cheaply made
1.0,I loved the charm however the chain was WAY to thin and fragile . I was scared to wear it thus I sent it back !
1.0,Description says 2 pair but only one comes in the package
1.0,The color peeled off the nose rings after just one day.<br /><br />I also ordered these because I wanted the vibrant hot pink nose ring and when I got them it was a dusty pink. Not at all what they look like in the picture.
1.0,found broken ..not acceptable
1.0,Defective straight out of the box. I was so looking forward to getting this belt. Two of my coworkers have it and they highly recommended it. Quality control should have never let this defective belt out of the door.
1.0,If they say large go xl cause large is medium go with Stacy Adams true sizes and they don't bunch up like the rest
1.0,"First day out on the water, within 10mins, reached down in the boat and tore the inseam out! Had to fish the rest of the day with torn pants haha (plus I let the big one get away - what a day!). Anyway, they are light weight and extremely comfortable to wear- more comfortable than regular pants, somewhat waterproof, and just plain good fishing pants in terms of that.<br /><br />However, they are the least durable pants i own. This is because the crotch extends lower on these pants compared to my more expensive ones. This “slack” means it puts more pressure on the inseam when bending and twisting for lures and fish in your boat. DONT BUY, and if you decide to anyway, at least bring and extra pair of pants on the water with you!"
1.0,Horribly small maybe fit an infant head!!!! The hat is made well and colors are nice but too small.
1.0,"These were very pretty, but I wear a size 2 and these jeans were way too small"
1.0,The chronograph portion of the watch failed. The watch is poor quality.  The supplier failed to comply with  the return agreement.  Amazon failed to take any action on this issue.  I am totally unhappy with the supplier and Amazon.
1.0,Definitely order a  size up!!  It runs very small and not much stretch.....
1.0,"It is too big for a medium.  Although the seller advertise ""free shipping and free returns"", the return is not free.  You have to pay for return shipping.  This is ridiculous!!  Please DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!"
1.0,It was super pretty but so small
1.0,Shirt was way bigger than what I ordered.
1.0,These are so ugly. I know they are supposed to be modeled after the Lele Sadoughi earrings but these were cheap and not at all what I thought they would be. The center stone makes these look super cheap and you can't take it off because it is glued in place.
1.0,"Not sure I'm keeping it. First off it is dark dark &#34;turquoise&#34; not at all like the picture shown. The inscription is fuzzy at best. You have to hold it and turn it to try and read it. It us not as they show. If you know what it says you can maybe figure it out but to give as a gift, it takes more than one person to try and decipher. Very disappointed."
1.0,very poor quality masks how these received such high reviews is a good sign of review tampering. The adjustable ear loops are very short seamed more for children than an adult. Size was small also the reason I purchased was the high good reviews.<br />they are lies.
1.0,"Bought the 3T for my daughter whom just turned three and it fit more like an 18 month. Size up if you want to purchase these. The material is good, but not made to correct measurements"
1.0,Hate it! Try again. Awful! I would not recommend to my cat or dog!
1.0,Bought these as a Christmas gift and had to return!  No quality control - 1 of the pockets on the pants looked like it was sewn inside out - did not match stitching on other pocket at all. Very disappointed as these were super cute and soft.
1.0,Cheap shirt not long like pictured. Very thin and looks cheap. Not happy!
1.0,I was disappointed with the color -orange pinkish - not red!
1.0,Look really cheap
1.0,"Beware: This is a mouth bandana. Not a face mask…. the kind you want to have in 2022. Strange product. Picture is misleading. Sorry no pictures, I already returned them."
1.0,Definitely not Silpada!!
1.0,Way too big. Much more than in the pic.
1.0,"This is the worst design for a necklace. Every single day it breaks and takes me about 15 minutes trying to fit the small chains back together. It's almost unwearable. Don't waste your time buying this; if you do, a lot of time will be wasted fixing it every day."
1.0,The watch band I received was totally different from the one in picture on Amazon website. It still looks ok so I decided to keep and not to return it
1.0,These sock are made of hosiery material. Disappointing.
1.0,I could not get it to fit my luxe. I should have listened to reviews
1.0,They don't hold the socks together.
1.0,it is way to small.  with only 3 snaps holding the back together is no way this cheapo hat will stay on.  it also has tons of strings already fraying off of it.  sadly this was the best i found through Amazon for a non ground or express plain fedex hat.
1.0,"At first my daughter loved the watch, but we found it hardly holds a charge.  Then we found the cover for the USB port gets in the way of the charging cable and needed a lot of time to fully charge.  This was becoming to much of a hassle so my daughter hardly used it and with very little use the power button stopped working.  We had it for only 9 months so I decided to try to get a warranty replacement.  Their warranty PDF says to mail it in with a check for 4.95 but they don't give you an address a phone number or any way to actually contact them.  This will be the last Disney product I buy and nothing from this maker ever again, not worth giving to your kids."
1.0,Bed missing from the end of bracelet.
1.0,"I’ve worn and washed these 3 times. There’s now a hole in one of the pockets, and the material that encloses the elastic waistband is splitting on the inside of the shorts.<br /><br />The style is super cute, but the material is cheap looking, cheap feeling, and wrinkles very easily."
1.0,"Was broken, when I received. I tried to fix it, and it started to fall apart more."
1.0,"The termination is not good, it has loose threads"
1.0,"Doesn't look much like the picture, had to return mine. It is way too big and baggy. I am pregnant and even on a pregnant belly it looks ginormous."
1.0,"I ordered a size medium and was very disappointed when they arrived, it fit like it was an extra large so I am not happy with this order at all"
1.0,They don’t even work the screws just fall out and they don’t even pinch I was expecting a lot more it was a disappointment
1.0,Did not find this product comfortable at all. I have another brand and find them to be way more comfortable.  The pouch was just not working for me in this particular brand.
1.0,The sizing is off. I got a XL based on my measurements but it’s too big. I’m going to return and repurchase in a size large. I normally wear a 10 in “regular” clothes.
1.0,Picture is deceptive!
1.0,"These were so flawed, I would be embarrassed to wear them. You expect a real baroque pearl to have some flaw as but these were beyond that!"
1.0,Does not look like it was well made and fits on body oddly. I'm 5'1 at 135 lbs. Maybe it's just not for my body type
1.0,They're so small. Like come on
1.0,"Was not a Beanie, don’t know what it was. But it was made for a infant. Not for kids"
1.0,"Instant return. Super cheap looking material, and just not well made."
1.0,Item was missing a sleeve. Horrible!
1.0,"I bought this item with hopes that it would help with running/walking at night - however after recieving two units - both damaged upon receiving them - i determined that the quality was horrific.<br />Both lights were broken at the point that they would connect to the belt.<br /><br />I also have to say, that even if they were not damaged, these lights are HUGE. I would think they would bump around a lot while putting miles on outside.<br /><br />I guess for the cost, if you were doing minimal walking - and somehow received one that didn't self implode upon looking at it, you might be ok, but after going through it on two units, i would steer clear and look somewhere else."
1.0,"So the first time I just thought I messed up, so I ordered a LARGE again...well they sent another MEDIUM!! Very disappointing.  The jersey is great, just way too small. Wondering what I have to do to get a Large!"
1.0,"I wanted to love this, but I got one wear out of it before it started to fall apart. The sleeve unraveled after wearing it one night."
1.0,"Too bulky,  way to wide, not sure why this product is so oversized, but I cannot use it .  Have found cases that are much smaller , yet still accomodate my sereghetti drivers.."
1.0,"It was very puffy above the belt and the fabric was bad, can’t imagine wearing it in the summer time. Had issues with shipping as well."
1.0,"These run very big.  And thr elastic is flimsy, they dont really stay on well, because they are too large and the elastic is thin and not very well made.  I am totally disappointed with this purchase.  I guess that's what I get buying underwear online lol."
1.0,"the post broke off the second time I wore them,I will try to  get my money back"
1.0,"Fit how it was supposed to, BUT I had a good event to attend & I made sure i read the description a few times as it was labeled as “gold” but it’s actually a rose gold color."
1.0,"Way too small, and next size up was sold out, will be returning. Don't buy your regular fitting size, it will be too small"
1.0,I did. Not like it.
1.0,"I didn't like the quality of the fabric, it looked like I was wearing a huge scrub top"
1.0,Way too small. I should’ve known better based on where it came from.
1.0,False advertisement. The product that you receive is not the product that you order. There’s no bling there’s no sequence there’s no glitter at all. The photo on Amazon that they use is not the product you receive
1.0,i liked it for 1 week
1.0,Cheap. Poor quality.
1.0,The fit of these jeans is amazing but the open area on the legs is crooked. Looks horrible in pictures.
1.0,The band design disintegrated in just a few weeks. Poor quality.
1.0,Not worth it at all .
1.0,It came broke! I had to glue the bee back on myself. Didn’t want to bother sending back for a replacement after I waited a week to receive it.
1.0,I ordered this shirt in both Medium and Small sizes because I love this brand's material -- but the shirts turned out to be too boxy and not cut well.  It was disappointing to have to return these.
1.0,Literally shrunk to child size after 1 wash!! Don’t waste your money!
1.0,Ate away at my daughter's ear garbage product
1.0,I am sure this product is made in Asia because of the sizing discrepancy. I ordered a 5xl for me and it fit my daughter who is a size 14. Very disappointed. I was really looking forward to wearing it.
1.0,Stained my ears and irritated them. Also anytime I clean them with saltwater the “rose gold” wipes off. Not worth the money
1.0,"It looks very cheap ,the fitting is too lousy looking. It doesn’t look elegant"
1.0,"Does not fit correctly, lenses were scratched ."
1.0,too flimsy. hair falls off when you try and remove it after cutting. useless.
1.0,The sweatsuit came in a package it was inside out and Winkel not even folded up
1.0,Really like the watch and it's stunning at 1st glance. Thought to wear it for a party and found that the know doesn't come out to set the time (almost broke my nail). To unlock the buckle is another nightmare! Absolute defective piece.
1.0,"My thoughts would be I did not like this beautiful skirt ,because it was not elastic waist pay attention to that"
1.0,I purchased these in black. The material is super thin and they are pretty see through without even bending over. I returned them.
1.0,Very pretty dress.... But I went to go with my size. But needed to go down a size cause it was just that big
1.0,Fit horribly. Made cheaply. Wasn’t aloud to return. Do not waste your money!
1.0,"No longer than an average short on a tall man.<br />When I shop for my 6’4” long legged husband I purchase the longest short on the rack in the store and these were no longer than what I can purchase in the men’s department, not even the big and tall area or catalog. He was absolutely disappointed."
1.0,Buttons are non-functional.<br />Pattern looks like it's made for little girls<br />Fits like a hospital gown and looks like one too.<br />Fabric is thick and pattern is printed-- not woven.
1.0,Did not work at all. Does not tight enough and water get in no mater what you do.
1.0,"Item wet, smells and dirty"
1.0,I used it once and one of the springs broke
1.0,I just don't think they helped.  I feel like the cars appear farther away than they are. :(
1.0,First order arrived - silver on one side and black on the other.  Returned.  New order received - 2 silver on one side and black on the other.  Two boxes were empty!  Do not order these!  Had to run out the day before Christmas Eve and buy replacement gifts for my coworkers.
1.0,This looks like plastic. It is very cheaply made. But I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,Would love to purchase these but everytime we try it will not let us.
1.0,I had high hopes for this dress. I ordered the size suggested from the size chart. The smocked bodice didn’t cover my chest. The sleeves were to short. The dress looked like my grandmas nightgown. I’m returning it tomorrow.
1.0,Lines don’t match up!
1.0,"I did not like the way it fit, waist band was too thick and could not wear a shirt over it.  Terrible design."
1.0,not worth the price...I have to return this..
1.0,"I didn't have the highest expectations, because the Disney costumes I've bought in the past have been pretty shoddy for their outrageous price tags.  This costume however, is the WORST I've ever seen.  It's not worth even $5, let alone the $20 sale price I paid.  First time out of the package, the sleeve tore off, and it's been downhill since.  It's been worn 3 times (still needs to make it through 2 more parties and trick or treating), but I'm not holding my breath.  Fortunately, I sew, so I can fix the problems as they occur, but most people probably aren't that lucky.  The material on the skirt/sleeves is really rough, and the ears were detached from the headband when it came out of the package.  DO NOT BUY.  I really thought I'd save myself the aggravation and time in making a costume this year, but at least it would have lasted more than a few hours of wearing time.  Thankfully, my daughter is 2, and doesn't seem to notice.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,Fabric is too thin and it does not fit
1.0,"Don't buy doesn't work to bulky and won't fit teeth, looks good but it does not mold to your teethe and I watched a video and did it perfectly and still didn't fit right. Don't buy"
1.0,Not what the photo shows! Buyer beware. They even charge you to ship it back to them
1.0,"I am so disappointed with this ring... The gold looks like it's chipping, it looks so cheap. I am so embarrassed about giving my mother this ring but now I have no choice :-( I just want to cry."
1.0,"It isn’t red at all as stated or as shown on pictures.  It is hot pink. Terrible quality, it is stiff and looks like it’s cracking. Color seems to be rubbing off on edges. I have bought silicone watch bands for years on Amazon that have been GREAT bands and never have unpaid this much. Waiting for a response to return."
1.0,These are nice until you wash them. And the. They are horrible. Look like warnout sweatpants
1.0,RUNS EXTREMELY SMALL
1.0,I ordered a x-small and it ended up looking like a loose hospital gown. That’s what my husband commented on seeing me in this dress.
1.0,Received wrong size as it was in UK instead of US
1.0,"Though it looks great, it stopped worked only after two months! I don't recommend this watch."
1.0,Bad cracked
1.0,Will not honor return shipping
1.0,Nice look but I didnt see much difference other than all lights got yellowish... They didn't make my night vision better at all and actually I could not wear them longer than 15 mins. It just didnt feel right....I returned them
1.0,Hurts my wrist
1.0,They were awful...broken and when I opened them they were covered in dirt
1.0,"These are horrible. Title says Women’s however there is a lot of fabric in the crotch area of these pants, like way way too much. There is no way to wear then without them looking ridiculous and feeling weird on."
1.0,"Not sure what size they are basing and XL or XXL, but overseas their size chart must be based on a smaller scale! The sweater doesnt even fit past my waistline. Hate dealing with these types of returns!"
1.0,"These cases are absolute garbage. They don’t smell like leather, then when you put your MacBook in, it’s so tight that it made me worry if the screen would get damaged. The one I first received was discolored, and the replacement just smelled awful. Stay away from buying them on Amazon, view it at the Apple store, but also note that it’s a tight fit, I just didn’t like that."
1.0,"This is NOT a Women’s size. I ordered a Med, which I usually am, and it could fit my 5 year old nephew perfectly.. Will be returning."
1.0,"Not good quality, doesnt look lone the pictures AT ALL"
1.0,Not constructed well. Looked cheap.
1.0,This product is great beautiful looking but men do not wear it in any water the minute you get into water all the gold trimming that is from the ways around the fine Design to the side and even a bra strap it rips off
1.0,"Smells terrible!!! Even after washing them several times, the horrible smell is still very strong!!"
1.0,The holes tore witing a couple of weeks.
1.0,I don't know how they make this look good in the photos. It's basically a sideways mickey mouse watch that feels as bad as it looks.
1.0,"I am so disappointed. I thought I had actually found no show socks that would stay in place no matter how much walking i did; but, alas after about 6 weeks they stopped ""working"" and they began  crawling off my heal all the way into my shoe. no matter how many times i stop to readjust they no longer stay in place.  Ugh."
1.0,The compression sleeves worked well upon first wearing. But they didn't hold up in the washer/dryer. They began to unravel.  They need to be hand washed and air dried.
1.0,the dress material is not good. the size is too small. not a good experience.
1.0,Fabric very thin. Not as expected<br />Pants became pilly after washing. Cheap quality
1.0,I WAS LOOKING FOR A VERA BRADLEY BAG.  THS ONE WAS MIXED IN WITH THE VERA'S.  I KNEW IT WASN'T A VERA BECAUSE IT WAS TOO CHEAP.  LESSON LEARNED.  IT SMELLED FROM SMOKE WHEN IT ARRIVED.  MUST HAVE BEEN RETURNED BY A CIGARETTE SMOKER.  TERRIBLE.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR.
1.0,It didn’t hold up. Should’ve returned it right when broke !!
1.0,Much too small. Avoid these.
1.0,Broke immediately.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Bad bad bad
1.0,Do not buy it’s horrible
1.0,"This bra is not a “true to size” item. Feel like I’m trying to squeeze into a baby gap top. Like a training bra from when I was 7…. 22 years ago…. Giving me armpit fat I didn’t even know I had and so tight on the sisters they’re spilling over, NOT in a good way."
1.0,Earring came apart as soon as I opened it.
1.0,"Be careful with this Jacket.  Although the photo on the website appears elegant and well constructed,  the jacket that I received was anything but.  The workmanship is poor in quality.  The seams are double vs. single stitched, are not curved to compliment a feminine hourglass silhouette and are not aligned with the darts in the back, as illustrated. Merchandise has a Suspect dye job as the Leather is dull in color and lacks shine.  Smaller Buttons than advertised.  Measurements are also different than those  illustrated on the Website.  The sleeve length and length of Jacket  is not in accordance with specifications.  Both are longer by at least 1 inch.  This is Fraudulent!  It's  a completely different jacket.  MERCHANDISE WILL BE RETURNED!!!!"
1.0,My son wears a 2.5 in New balance ordered a 3- 4 there is a finger tip between the heel and the back of the shoe. Good quality just very small
1.0,"Terrible material, super cheap"
1.0,Its too big. It fits horribly. it is cut poorly and put together poorly. and the material is horrible. soooo bottom line is i hate it and it was a waste of money
1.0,Does not fit breast right. Correct size was selected. Makes boobs look lumpy under clothing. Will not be using again. Waste of money.
1.0,"it broke 4 days after I started using it, and i probably can't return it because its broken so..."
1.0,DO NOT FLOAT! Gave them as mother's & father's day gifts to have at the lake house.  Told mom & dad how they float after they opened them.....and then we tested them. Falsely advertised. Very disappointed. Especially since they loved them & were excited at first.
1.0,This says ‘womens’ but is clearly a men’s fit. The sleeves are long and the torso isn’t ladies cute.
1.0,"Not even close to what is picture. Very short, fits over your head and very thin. Just plain disappointed."
1.0,"These are not quality leggings. I have purchased 4 pair from Lush Moda , I didn’t realize  not the same vendor. They are not clinging to the leg and the crop is not tight on the calf and just rides up to the knee. It’s like they just cut off a straight leg knit pant and called them crop leggings. The fabric is also cheap and after one wear the seams are coming apart. Go with Lush Moda and not this vendor. Very poor quality. I thought they were the same as the others, so I threw away packaging and can’t return. I’ll be putting them in the trash."
1.0,The hole for the head and neck area is so small that my daughter couldn't even get it past her eyes when trying to put it on. Very disappointing.
1.0,"I have a couple of pairs of huggie hoops, but these will not stay latched. They are cute and lightweight, but they are useless since they don't stay closed."
1.0,This is sized for a toddler.  Not even a small school aged child.
1.0,Washed in cold water and dried for a short time on delicate cycle and the shirt basically shriveled up.
1.0,"We sent this back, it was just too cheap feeling. Ran a bit small."
1.0,There was a big cut across both from and back of shirt. Very disappointed
1.0,"Like most everyone comments, the magnet brakes after a few uses. The savings is not worth the cost of an Apple Watch when it drops off your wrist into something the watch can’t be recovered from."
1.0,Arrived broken and earrings were not even the same. Different sized center parts. Very disappointing.
1.0,"So I purchased this Minnie shirt for my daughter a while back, placed it in my closet to hide it until I was packing for our Disney trip. Upon “unboxing” it for our pending trip, I noticed that the white stripes on the right sleeve were completely stuck on each other, when I pulled it was tearing the print and essentially ruining the shirt. Such a bummer, she was not able to wear this and because it was past the return or exchange window, I am out the $$."
1.0,I received an empty box!!
1.0,Terribly made. Ears do not fit over the slots it is supposed to attach to. The ONLY reason I didn't return it is because I had to meet a deadline for a project. Tint is not as shown nor is the colour of the helmet. Blues and yellows are wrong.
1.0,"Comes off easily, fogs up quickly and let's the tear gas in."
1.0,Cute but broke in the frame within 2 months of my daughters birthday
1.0,Broke before I even got to wear it. Do not recommend
1.0,This shirt looks betterin picture than it really is.  The fabric is clingy and very cheap looking. I sent it back.
1.0,"display too small, not very water resistant, no second time zone"
1.0,Sent it back skimpy and cheap.
1.0,"Very pretty, but be very careful with the magnetic closing, I  lost my fitbit."
1.0,"Pants were tight to begin, and even when washing on cold and hardly drying at all the elastic waistband shrunk in horrible ways. I literally washed them then tossed them in my donate bin."
1.0,If you have a large size head or thick hair this cap sucks the largest they have is extra large it is a joke these run very small
1.0,The size is for infants. Does not fit a toddler head. Unhappy with product. Would not buy again.
1.0,The quality is poor . The glitter comes off the cloths and goes all over my kid’s face and even eyes . That’s bothering .
1.0,"This looks nothing like the picture. The writing is so faint, it’s barely visible. It’s not shaped the same as the photo, nor the ring from the movies. It looks like a plain gold ring that is super thin. Don’t waste your money. Plus, it was guaranteed to come in 2 days in time for Christmas, and it arrived in 5+ days. I was disappointed to give this as a gift."
1.0,This didn’t come out the way it was pictured. I got a bigger size than usual and it still was small. The color was way off!! Really disappointed because I was looking for last minute sweaters to wear.
1.0,Badly
1.0,I normally wear a size medium in most underwear brands. These are definitely WAY too small to be a O/S garment. Would not recommend to anyone who is not an XS or a S
1.0,"Most awkwardledly fit garment I have ever tried on. Way to big in the body, but simultanously too short in length (both the sleeves and bottom hem). Returned promptly.<br /><br />For reference, I am 5'4, 155ish pounds, larger shoulders, smaller chest. Going a size up or down certainly wouldn't have help the strange cut and fit of this top."
1.0,Couldn’t even pull them up past my knees. Ordered  XL. I normally wear a size 10. Must be child XL
1.0,"Poor quality, they broke in less than a month."
1.0,Horrid. They're smaller than my pinkie nail. And they do not screw fully. I'm incredibly disappointed. The absolute only Good side is that they came early. But these are a true waste of money.
1.0,barely absorbs and they are not wide enough for working out
1.0,the pic looks like the tights are purple the things were white with red tye dye looked like i had my period all over myself maybe a halloween look but would never wear this junk in public they are not purple a play on the camera lol
1.0,It did not work.
1.0,One pair came with a small hole already in it. It’s tiny but they are soooooo sheer that a small hole means after one use im going to have to throw them away.<br />Another pair that has the clingy lace garter is so large on top that I’m going to have to fashion tape them to my legs. I don’t know why they made the thighs so disproportionate to the stocking but it’s horrible.<br />And one came with a weird white stain dried on to them.
1.0,This makes is for little kids. i bought for my BF and it did not fit him. Half of his face was sticking out of the mask.
1.0,This seems we're not sown there was no collar It was just a shirt that wasn't put together terrible terrible quality control
1.0,they were pretty big
1.0,Metal clip rubs in the pocket
1.0,Very weird cut. Returned.
1.0,LIIEEEESSSS. This product is NOT 2x2 .... not 2inches in width. ... a waste of my time.
1.0,This has to be the cheapest made necklace I've ever bought. I had it for 2 days and the loop already broke. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!
1.0,Not as pictured.. Waste of money
1.0,Sizes are way too small. Order one size big
1.0,Way smaller than expected and awful cheap material.
1.0,It’s over size! For me it’s like large
1.0,"So after nearly two months of no word, Amazon told me this product was lost and to contact the seller for a refund. Seller told me it wasn't lost, but gave me a $5 credit ""for my patience"". Nearly another month goes by and the dress finally shows  up. However I get it out of the package and one of the straps is sewed on backwards! No quality control. Also, it's more like a shirt than a dress, or even a nightgown perhaps. I have large breasts  so it might drape better on someone less endowed. Overall wasn't very happy with this purchase."
1.0,AWFUL MATERIAL VERY CHEAP!!!!
1.0,Product came with a major defect. Definitely a let down. Avoid buying.
1.0,Cheap the clip isn't great.
1.0,"The hat was perfect, until the adjustment ripped off of the hat (cheap material and poor construction)."
1.0,Necklace already broken within 1 week. Wouldn’t purchase again
1.0,Not good.. it’s like  wearing a trash bag ...
1.0,"I received the shoes on March 10, 2021 and this picture was taken today April 27, 2021 - the entire bottom of the shoe came off. Some of the fasteners in the front broke as well - I would not recommend this product at all"
1.0,Returned these lenses. Made everything blurry. Was like looking through a water bowl. Makes your Oakley's no better than flea market sun glasses. Would give no stars if possible.
1.0,Super let down. I should have read the reviews. THIS IS NOT GLITTERY OR SEQUINS. ITS JUST FABRIC THAT LOOKS THAT WAY.
1.0,Turn green
1.0,"I didn't measure lol but I got this to use in my labret piercing, I'm glad it was way too big & not cute because it broke almost immediately"
1.0,Ordered a size larger and it still fit too snug :/
1.0,"Disappointed in this jacket that I was so looking forward to.<br />First, I think it runs a little small.<br />Second, and more importantly... the zipper broke right away.  So disappointed."
1.0,I order one of these an the 3 day zipper come off that not good because I order a 2x an which I should order a 1x
1.0,Very bad product this is just too large for baby at least new born Baby
1.0,I didn't like the dresses I ordered 2  and both were very disappointing!!! Cheap material and dress is must shorter than advertised on the picture! I  order size XXL Still very tight I  normally wear size 12-14 .
1.0,Very thin and cheap too small. Waited too long to return
1.0,Not xxl
1.0,Not worth the money. They didn't even cover the balls of my feet. I do not recommend. I would return them but not worth the postage.
1.0,This scarf is very thin and not as described.
1.0,I have had this for less than a month and the stone fell out.
1.0,Cheap fabric..would not recommend
1.0,I like the shoe but there was such a strong smell of formaldehyde from them that it actually made my entire closet smell like formaldehyde.  I tossed them in the garbage.
1.0,I should have sent it back but didn't want the hassle so I gave it away. I was highly disappointed with the length and overall size of this shirt. The quote is super cute and material is super soft. Hate that is was so unflattering
1.0,These suspenders broke right away. Highly dissatisfied.
1.0,Earrings were bent so bad. They are killing my ear lobes
1.0,"Material is good however, description states adult but yet size seems like it’s for toddlers."
1.0,This was very poorly made.  The stitching on the seam was coming apart already and the bra inserts were especially cheap.  I like the concept but couldn't keep this one.
1.0,broke the next day
1.0,The quality is not as expected.
1.0,"return cost is $28; they have not responded to my request for return to a US address as they offered. Dress is gaudy, heavy; not as pictured"
1.0,Slides of your heel vey quickly. Will end up giving them to Salvation Army.  I have had great luck with other no show style socks from Smartwool.
1.0,This looks cheap and not worth the money. Its not a sweatshirt type hoodie the material is very thin and the letters look like the color ran  off its just weird looking. I don't recommend buying this. Contemplating on sending it back.
1.0,These are for a size 8 or smaller foot.  All kinds of threads inside that catch in your toes when you try to put them on.  One pair out of the six fit.  Got a hole in the only pair that fit in one hour.
1.0,Haven't had pants long at all and the zipper snapped... Can't return them!!
1.0,Frame broke like the next day after I bought it.
1.0,This dress would not fit a 6 year old child.
1.0,"Well, I blame myself on this one.  I read all the negative feedbacks and ignored them.  Although the bracelet looks great it fell apart after the 2nd day on my wrist.  I really hate it too, because it looked so good.  But like the old saying goes, you get what you pay for.  I do not recommend this item, unless you plan on walking around with a bottle of superglue in your pocket."
1.0,This arrived slightly tarnished and with scratches. I returned it.
1.0,The picture looked nice but in reality the hat did not fit well.
1.0,This is faulty.  Not sitting straight in the long tassel.
1.0,These glasses broke with in 2 months of purchase.
1.0,Cute style but not for medium width feet. These are very heavy and too sloppy for a normal foot. Better for a large wide foot. I wear 9.5 Medium and these were way longer like an 11 and very wide. Could not hold on my foot thus requested a return.
1.0,Not xxl  more like xs
1.0,"Top is extra big, bottom fits."
1.0,These are horrible!!  The button to retract was broken on both.  So the hot metal could not be turned off or put away.  This was a total waste of money!
1.0,This fabric is really bad nothing like the picture<br />I’m so upset I received the package and was so excited but just to see this cheap material nothing like what’s up on the site I need my money back this is not funny  and just so you know I just put one star because this won’t allow me to send the message unless I fill in all the blanks
1.0,"Ummm, that's not an opal."
1.0,Had to adjust it everything I stand up
1.0,Hollow. Paper thin material. The other earring is not opening. So it end up getting damage. There is no way it will open without breaking it. Very bad product for me. I guess i get what i paid for. Wasnt able to return due to some problems on my end. But product wise its not worth it
1.0,"Thin, not denim, cheap looking, took 4 wks to receive. NOT AS ADVERTISED"
1.0,I could not stand to wear it once having it on because the garment emitted a strong and foul chemical smell. It was over-whelming and made me nauseous so I had to return it which was too bad because I like this particular shade of blud
1.0,the seams of the hoodie aren't even sewn together. there's a huge hole at the bottom where the material isn't sewn
1.0,Horrible. Not at all how pictured. The beaded one is way too small & the other one that came with it with the moon is extremely big and poorly made. Can’t wear it.
1.0,"These glasses are plastic, including the lens'<br />The ""Wood"" look is from stickers that come off after only a few times wearing them.<br />All in All, pick another pair from somewhere else."
1.0,Too small..!!
1.0,"I probably should have washed it first! The color rubbed onto everything! My bra, my shorts! It was a mess!"
1.0,This is not glittery. It looks as though fai upsomeone cleaned up great and she is with a napkin it is trash and I want my money back. I would’ve returned it sooner but I’m dealing with a child with terminal cancer and I need something to make her happy and smile and this is not glittery this is just purple blotches
1.0,Have always purchased Timberland oxfords.  They are always comfortable and last long.  I purchased these and I am completely disappointed.  The insides are lined with a cheap lining that will not last a few weeks of wear.  The cut is too low and rubs on the ankle bone.  If I didn't need asap I would have returned.  Not the a quality and comfort I've always experienced from Timberland.  I will never buy them online again.
1.0,Tore too fast
1.0,"Material is multi-layered and hot, not breathable. Dress looks much better on the model in the photo. I'm a small/slender person (5'3, 113lbs) but this made me look fat, as it just hangs down without any definition. Also, too wide around chest area, I'm 36in.  Seller is fine, took my return with no problem. Design of dress just doesn't work."
1.0,Something got between the lens and my glasses and scratched both very bad and since it sits directly on the lenses. They can lead to damaging your glasses. I Really like them until it ruined both.
1.0,These pins are like a weird muted drab purple color they're not pink and I was very disappointed to see that they were such an odd color.
1.0,These started falling apart after the first time in the washing machine
1.0,Pendant thin and chain short
1.0,"This thing is huge. I was expecting something dainty. If you like the way Dennis Rodman looks, you might like this."
1.0,"I purchased this tie for my boyfriend for an event we attended around the holiday season. Fast forward six months, this tie is pilling and falling apart.  This tie has been worn less than a dozen times."
1.0,I returned. This is not a soft sweater.
1.0,It looked like someone has worn it had finger prints on it
1.0,It's poor quality product and the display shows white but it has a cream color. I'm 100% highly very dissatisfied and will not order no more from Amazon.
1.0,These are horrible and useless. Don't purchase.
1.0,This mask was not as described!  It had no insertable filter or place to put a filter in.  Very upset as I spent $20 on it.  Will still use it given current crisis but shame on the seller !!  It was also too small for my 10 year old son who is petty small for his age.  Will give to another family member.
1.0,Love it but it was too tight
1.0,"I was extremely excited to receive and wear this on  my neck. My hat size is 7 1/4...  I have a normal size male head, and I cannot fit this over my head. I am looking for the address of where to return this item."
1.0,"This bra was way too small and too tight.  I ordered my regular bra size and this bra was just too small.  I am not sure if I was supposed to order up or not, but it was a struggle to put on, and once one it was uncomfortably tight, and I was unable to wear it."
1.0,I bought this bracelet because I have seen how popular they are on Pinterest. I was disappointed when I received it and found out that it was way too large. I have small wrists but the opening was so big that the bracelet fell right off. It is also nearly impossible to get the hair tie on the bracelet. I returned this product right away.
1.0,I got the wrong color sent to me. I thought i would give them a try away. I walked over the bridge. A 30 minute walk. I had to huge blisters on the top of my feet. I had to buy band aids to continue walking.  On 1 foot a got a blister on the ball of my foot. Needless to say i returned them.
1.0,It said US size XL /14....more like a size 10. I will never buy this brand again.
1.0,Bottoms were cute and fit just right. Top was too short.
1.0,To small 😞
1.0,"This shirt looks nothing like the picture! Its dull and ugly! The fit is just bad, I doubt it would look better on a thinner person."
1.0,This item was advertised as a double XL and when I received it it was barely the size of a large
1.0,This is NOT a men’s watch. The band is too small for my wrist and my wrists are small. This is for a child. No man could ever wear this band. The face has the hour and minute hand labeled. I would think a adult would know the difference.
1.0,Very very cheap and faded fabric
1.0,To tight on top of toes can’t wear them they are the right length.
1.0,ME entegaron un modelo distinto al de la foto de Amazon. Este tiene la vicera plana. Yo había solicitado el modelo con la vicera curva.
1.0,"Love the style but runs small, had to return"
1.0,"Totally misleading. Short, not long, sizing all wrong. I ordered a Medium according to sizing but it’s more like a extra small. I guess they get something out of these reviews that teach people how to order but it’s not worth returning for the shipping costs and effort. Total disappointment."
1.0,Beautiful shirt great material. Runs to big
1.0,We're to small
1.0,Cheap looking left my moms ears green
1.0,"This dress came crumpled up in a small bag. It was very wrinkled. The fit was way too small. I am 5'4"" and weigh 155. I ordered a large and it fit more like a small. I have ordered from Romwe before and the dress was really nice material and a proper fit. So now I will be hesitant to order from them again."
1.0,very akward not comfortable
1.0,The pendant is super thin and has no real weight to it.
1.0,That it was sterling silver and the style is beautiful.  However this is not ment to wear everday.Two of the 3 strands broke with 10 days of wearing.  Would not recommend buying if you plan on wearing every day.
1.0,Cheap shoe it broke the first day I recieved them and tried them on!
1.0,"Ok. So the quality of this tank top isn't awful, but 1. it runs incredibly small (it fits more like a small or a medium (but that's pushing it..)) I'm a medium normally, but ordered a size up (large) because I don't like wearing clothes that stick to me like a second skin. This tank top is SKIN TIGHT as a large. I can barely wear it comfortably, and, like I said, I'm normally a medium. Also, the dark purple color is a royal blue color. Not purple at all. While this is partly my mistake because if you mouse over the icon for this specific tank top it reads &#34;004-Blue.&#34; But it the pictures look nothing like what you will actually be receiving if you pick the tank top I did."
1.0,"I bought this watch for my partner, 1 month later it is not working. Very disappointed."
1.0,The plate with writing broke after 2 days
1.0,"I actually bought this by accident by pushiong the One Click bit kept it because  it is so cute and so perfect for me. Unfortunately, the top piece already came off within 4 months.. very disappointed because now it ia useless."
1.0,Looks unprofessionally done and absolutely terrible to even send something like this to a customer. Wasting my time.
1.0,"Instead of six pairs of socks , I received only four pairs . I feel cheated."
1.0,"Pretty bummed the advertised image showed black, blue, rainbow, gold, rose, and silver sets totaling 12 pieces. I bought these for my daughters because this set included their favorite colors: blue, rainbow, and rose but I only recieved one blue, one rainbow, and one black, all of the rest were plain silver. If I knew they would come that way I would have bought a plain silver set. At least they were the correct gauge."
1.0,Fits weird.
1.0,Came broken (one ear muff not latching to the side) and it keeps falling off when trying to put them on.
1.0,"I purchased this item as a gift for my husband who spends all of his leisure time fishing.  He usually wears these as a temporary mask and to keep the wind and sun from his face and neck.  It took forever to delivery.  I was excited for my husband to open the package.  I was soooo ashamed and embarrassed.  Cheap, cheap, cheap all the way around.  We threw it in a drawer.  Maybe one of our grandkids can wear it and pretend they are fishing cowboys?? Haha!"
1.0,I usually wear M but I ordered L because i like loose sweatpants.. unfortunately this sweatpants fit small for L and its low waist you can’t bend down. I ended up donating it.. not recommended
1.0,Was broke in half when I got it because it was just stuck in a little bag and shipped.
1.0,Appropriate for price
1.0,"did not last at all, keeps slipping off the phone."
1.0,"Unfortunately, this dress was 6” too long. M size. I’m 5’4” and ordered down a size as some reviewers suggested but fit was still a bit too big. Very stretchy fabric. Fabric contents were not accurate. This dress was 90%poly but I was expecting 65%cotton."
1.0,"Slightly snug when I tried them on out of the package. I am getting smaller, so no big deal. Then they shrunk again in the wash...ugg!"
1.0,Was sent a different brand of green shirt with leopard print sleeves. Not even long enough to be a decent shirt.
1.0,Incredibly cheap looking. Purchased as a gift but gave it as a kitsch memory piece of when my friend and I liked renaissance fairs and the like. She split it and used the pieces separately as decorations for children's zipper pulls.
1.0,"The ""charm"" I received is NOTHING like the one on the picture, not to mention the quality is awful on this, will not recommend, extremely disappointing. I have filed a claim with AMAZON about this seller, and will request a refund."
1.0,I tried sending the shoes back because they are too small but have yet to get a reply from them.
1.0,They are attractive but very uncomfortable.  There is a very large screw on the frame between the two lenses that pokes you in the bridge of the nose. Had my husband try to file it down but it is still sharp.  Would not recommend purchasing these sunglasses.
1.0,The color wasn’t red
1.0,Do not buy
1.0,"The only good thing I can say about this shirt is it being 100% cotton and the embroidery. First off, it runs very large, boxy and unflattering to the body. It also had two slits on the sides of the shirt which exposes your skin. I returned it. Silly shirt"
1.0,The shoes where two different sizes around the top of foot
1.0,I did not get the entire outfit. Only the dupatta(scarf). Terrible
1.0,One size does not fit all - this item was too small with just a fraction of the Velcro available.  Also the single strap design slips right off during the night.
1.0,Cheap material.  Not very attractive.
1.0,"Fake, smelly material."
1.0,Turned green
1.0,I hate it.  It may fit a small child's hat.
1.0,"Wtf is this piece of junk, save ur money. Got one for my 13 year old son and it was made of plastic and broke within an hour after delivery."
1.0,"I am very disappointed with this product. I ordered a 2x and it fits more like a large. Rush logo is not silk screened on, it’s more like an ironed on decal.<br />Would absolutely not buy again"
1.0,Bad sizing and customer pays for return. Don't Buy. Save Your Time and Money! I sincerely wish this company would size their shoes correctly. The shoes run narrow and very short. I have over 300prs of shoes from other brands in the same size that fit. So I know it's NOT My feet.  I can't wear this brand. 3rd and last time I will try this brand.
1.0,Too small and has padding in the cups that you cannot remove.
1.0,"not very well made....not comfortable to wear, I would not get this if I were you."
1.0,Cheap plastic &#34;skirt&#34;.  Felt like I was wearing a skirt made from a plastic bag.  Very tiny.
1.0,Very poor quality and construction. Would definitely NOT recommend.
1.0,"These didn't fit like I thought they would, material was not what I expected. The want to slide down constantly. Not happy with product. Shorter than what Id like."
1.0,Agreed. Do not waste your money on this vest! Cheap material and poorly made. Fits super small and just bleh. Not worth 25.00!  More like 10.00!
1.0,"Possibly the worst product I’ve ever bought to protect my shoe from creasing. You have to cut the piece so it fits and if you mess it up, there goes the money you spent. Above all, the toe shield is flimsy and not worth purchasing. Very disappointing."
1.0,"I took a chance and purchased these despite the bad reviews and it was a huge mistake. These reeked of gasoline. I couldn’t even keep them inside the house, let alone put them on my child. I’ve purchased other items from this brand in the past and never had an issue so I’m not sure what’s going on. Amazon should not be selling these."
1.0,I bought these for my parter who has other hospital antiskid xxl socks.<br />They are not true to size.<br />I tried them on and they barely even fit my narrow feet. Very snug. No toe room.<br />He is a mens size 14/15 and i am a narrow 9.5 in ladies.
1.0,"Wow, I ordered blue and got black"
1.0,Product fit nice but the strap broke after only about 3 hours of use while on my face disappointing.
1.0,"Very cheap materials and poor quality lenses. Does not do any vision correction, or even close. Does nothing, makes vision worse."
1.0,I was honestly disappointed with the quality of this band. I used it once and threw it away because it looked/felt like a cheaply made kid's wristband. Very different quality when compared to the authentic Samsung bands.
1.0,Broke the first time I used it!
1.0,"Disappointing.  Nice bling except that the bling starts about six inches behind the buckle and extends around the remainder of the belt.  When you put it on, the front looks loopsided:  Bling on one side.  VERY plain black belt on the other.  Guess thats why they show it rolled.  I have several bling belts and none of them look like this.  No self respecting cowgirl would be seen in lopsided bling.  Not good!  The removable buckle is OK.  Otherwise this would have been a total loss."
1.0,"I choose this one over others , that were less expensive by half the price. Thinking it would be better quality. Says it is 24k gold plated, it is poorly painted, with bubbles in it. The writing is hard to read and the hour glass is hot glued on. I am very disappointed with this item. It was supposed to be a gift for my niece's birthday that is tomorrow. And I am embarrassed to give it as a gift. And out of time to get something else."
1.0,"Love them, great fit!"
1.0,Don't buy this.
1.0,These hurt my ears immediately upon putting them in my ears. I tried to wear them for awhile to see if they would adjust but they didn’t. My earlobes are still sore a day later.
1.0,"These are made for women with an extremely long  torso, I had to pull them up past my belly button and then roll the waist band. Also, the material is not comfortable."
1.0,Ordered a size too big and they are still too small
1.0,"I've had this wallet for a day and the pattern is already starting to wear off. I haven't been doing anything out of the ordinary, just sitting at work at my desk. Also, the wallet design is pretty flawed in that if you have more than about 3 cards on each side of the wallet, it stops being able to close.  It does have a sweet design though....for now :("
1.0,Not a great value because the buckles are flimsy. They slip and loosen. One broke after 6 weeks.
1.0,"As others had commented, these pants are poorly constructed and way to small; the upside here is that my wife just got three pair of sleep pants(until they fall apart)."
1.0,Loved shirt but runs very small
1.0,The picture was not a good representation to display the quality of the item.  Very disappointed
1.0,This was supposed to be wide calf but was not and unable to return for refund via Amazon
1.0,If I could give zero stars I would. This is nothing like the picture!! I purchased the rose gold plating with the white sunburst. This is clearly yellow gold and the dangles in the end don’t have the crystals like pictured. It was my main reason for purchase! It’s just plain gold balls.. awful! Don’t waste your time purchasing because it’s not as pictured! Will be returning. Please my photo for reference..
1.0,Advertised as fleece lined. I wanted the bra section to be fleece lined - for  warmth. NOT.  Very scratchy & uncomfortable inside bra area.  Bodice is fleece lined. Returned.
1.0,Nylon was tough and the principal behind the belt is good but the design is absolutely ridiculous. Neither buckle end will go through belt loops so there’s no point in having the quick snap buckle. Terrible for everyday use.
1.0,"Run small & narrow, the back part that touches the top of the heel feels sharp"
1.0,"I didn't like the fit not the material. The peep hole on the back was odd. I'm 5'8"" and 138 lbs."
1.0,"I knew these were inexpensive sunglasses going in so I wasn't expecting top quality eyewear, but I did expect them to last for more than a week.  The frames are made from an extremely brittle plastic and in my case snapped on the left, top side of the bridge when dropping them about 12 inches onto a table.  The lens then fell out.  I buy cheap sunglasses because they are prone to loss when doing obstacle course races, but these didn't even survive light daily usage.  Pluses? The lenses are nice and dark and the fit seemed good.  I can't recommend these due to complete lack of any kind of durability."
1.0,"Fabric looks cheap.  Stitching is poor. Not at all like it looks in the picture. Tried to return with the shipping label provided by the company  but the package was returned because the address on the label doesn't exist. Oh, and I  paid over $5 for the shipping.  It was not paid by the seller."
1.0,Horrible fit and the thong part hurts like hell.
1.0,Broke and shattered into pieces after wearing once.
1.0,If I had 2 left ears these would be perfect.  They are so pretty it’s very disappointing.
1.0,Runs very small order 2 sizes larger
1.0,The product is nice but the size is more a small or medium not an XL I have ever seen
1.0,No me llego el pedido y por la psndemia recien pide ir y constatar que no llego soy de otro país me pueden ayudar
1.0,Looks like picture but really small in size
1.0,These showed up without invoice and the seams are poorly sewn. Very large for size ten.<br />Would like size 8.
1.0,Fogged up after five minutes of use
1.0,"Wow....I own several brands of compression socks, as I wear them every single day to work.<br />These would not even fit over my calf.  Sooooooo small.  I returned them and will be getting adult size socks from another company."
1.0,These are NOT clip on earrings like the product title says they are.
1.0,I dont like it . Its to plastic feeling
1.0,"Of course it has stretch, the simple pull of the halter strap you can see through the black material straight to the white liner."
1.0,"The fabric is completely sheer and you can see everything under it… undergarments, tattoos, everything! If that’s your jam, you’ll love it. If not, may want to avoid this one."
1.0,i like it but it tore as soon as I tried putting it on.
1.0,Very cute but arrived broken
1.0,"I thought these were very beautiful.  However, the pictures - even the description/title - on the page were deceptive.  They claim to be clip-on earrings, but they aren't actually clip-ons.  They have an open back that does not clip.<br /><br />To be honest, I didn't keep them long enough to figure out how they worked because they were a gift for my four year old and eight year old nieces.  Just looking at them, they seemed like something that could easily fall off and get lost, in my opinion anyway.  Therefore, I did not feel these would work for them at all and returned the earrings.<br /><br />I'm sure they would work for anyone who wants a very loose and open non-pierced earring, or has the patience to figure out how they are meant to work, but for young girls with small ears, not so much."
1.0,It felt good at first but it wouldn't stay on my shoulders and I was so aggravated with this swimsuit by the time it was time to leave the beach
1.0,I ordered the women's size 8-12(shoe size). I wear a size 9 shoe. These socks were so small/tight I couldn't even get them over my foot. Wasted money.
1.0,"If you are looking for a baggy sweater, get two sizes larger than you'd typically buy. I bought this with the idea it would be super baggy and fit like the picture. It does not. Not even remotely close. It is very small and ""tight"". I borderline want to return it."
1.0,"Runs like 3 sizes too small. I’m not a big person, these were tiny."
1.0,Dress is way to short. I am 5'9 size 12 pants and I ordered an XL. It is way to short and the dress is a bit tight. The fabric has only a slight stretch. Really disappointed.
1.0,"Not tall at all!  Trying to fit a 6'2&#34; tall thin teenager is impossible and this was not tall at all.  Also it is not a Henley as the buttons are for show as there are no way to button them as the holes are not cut and if one did cut the button holes, the shirt would not fit correctly as it is cut for a v-neck.  Total disappointment!  Bad advertising!"
1.0,"This extremely thin cotton crop top is not worth the price! Better quality at Forever21 or Walmart for way cheaper can be found for such little, cheap material."
1.0,Seams around the thumbs are coming loose and it’s covered in weird spots of funky looking shit. Not the brand new item that I paid money for. I will definitely be returning and don’t recommend anyone to purchase.
1.0,it was see though and the material is cheap
1.0,Looks terrible. I put it on and removed it immediately. I will not wear it.
1.0,Wish I read the reviews. Nothing like what the picture is. Ill never wear them out in public.
1.0,Absolutely cannot say anything positive about this shirt because of the material. It was SO ITCHY that I couldn’t even try it on. I’m not a picky person either... I just can’t describe this material. It’s horrible! Returning ..... without a doubt. 🤮
1.0,Very Cheaply Made .Afraid To Wear It
1.0,"Unlike the description of this product as 100% cotton (with all the breathability the natural fibers bring), it actually contains NO cotton at all. Returned."
1.0,"5'8""..us size 4...orderd a small based off of reviews and size chart. Too small through the waist, but barely. If that was the only issue I would have just returned for a larger size. My big issues are they are above ankle height and I was looking for a long pant. Also the rise is just weird...tight through the crotch. It's like you are wearing a bathing suit bottom with poofy legs"
1.0,Beware! Runs small!
1.0,"I was so hoping this would be the chain I could use for all my pendants. It is such a disappointment.  If you adjust it shorter, the part hanging gets tangle up.  Would not recommend."
1.0,Beautiful designs. Socks poorly made. Last only about 10 times before they wear through.
1.0,Heavy weight
1.0,The necklace is pretty but it is too small.
1.0,These have been obviously used.
1.0,Broke the first night I had it.
1.0,"the waist band is huge, and sloppy looking. I've seen cheaper higher quality than these. I'm a size 5 and the mediums were huge and ridiculous looking. You will want to hide the hideous waist band. It's not a tightly sewn neat elastic band, it's clunky and sloppy looking. You will not want to wear a crop shirt with these pants that's how bad it is."
1.0,"was very disappointed that is item was soooo very small. item should be at least the size of a nickel to be appreciated. it was my own fault i didnt realize it was so tiny.<br />dear manufacturer please make this adorable charm at least the size of a nickel.<br />please advise if this ever becomes available larger. thanks, jac"
1.0,This Watch broke about two weeks after its delivery. I wore it swimming and to the beach like 8 times and water got under the screen. Waste of Money! Buy a Shark Watch because the warranty is far better.
1.0,Very small they only refunded a small percentage of what I paid and I kept the shirt
1.0,They don’t look like the pic. The also feel like cheep plastic. Is it real Guess or a knock off?
1.0,"Seemed like alot of pressure for a 6 month old, the package states for 8+ month but I didn't see that in the description. Put them on our girl and she started crying until I took them off."
1.0,I ordered a size bigger but its  small in size and the length is small as well.. I  DIDNOT like the fabric.. the print is nice.<br />I will be returning it :(
1.0,Not as described. Seller hasn't responded.
1.0,"dislike, comments say true to size, but did not fit the way 11's should fit."
1.0,This dress runs large from the waist up!
1.0,This dress is made of a more synthetic material which ends up making the dress look like something an older woman would wear to bed. Very disappointed there weren’t any seams to make it appear form fitted for a woman’s shape.
1.0,"I loved this sweater when I received it. BUT, with each passing day, the sleeves - both sleeves - unraveled.  I bought this in October 2019. No reason why the sweater should be coming apart."
1.0,Shoes don’t stay tied. Waste of money
1.0,they are nice but i ordered 4mm and received 2mm size..
1.0,"had nothing to do with the picture depicted, it was also see-thru, the XL would barely fit a 10 year old child, very poor quality"
1.0,Material is see through. Ordered a small and it went to my knees. Don't waste your money!
1.0,"mantengo la prenda en su caja de compra donde guardo mis otras prendas, no la he usado todavia y hace pocos dias estaba limpiando mi caja de prendas y me di cuenta que esta pulsera cambio su color plata a color amarillo,  la deje tal cual como la vi porque no entinedo a que se debe este cambio siendo Plata 925"
1.0,"The blue is lighter than the picture which is not nice<br />The sleeves and length of dress are shorter than picture<br />The belt is short and you can not fit it from the front...<br /><br />After submitting that feedback to the seller, they contacted me apologizing, they offered discounts on new items, free shipping to them, or refund $5......I choose last option as I do not need to buy more now.<br />thank you for caring."
1.0,Bad quality. Waste of money.
1.0,"It’s a nice transfer picture of Selena, but looks cheaply made. Transfer can clearly be seen along edges, like it was just thrown on the shirt and glued down. Some of the corner edges are lifting up."
1.0,It's very odd not as pictured I hate the material is like a stretchy shiny material
1.0,"I have worn and washed maybe 3-4 times since purchasing. I just was folding it out of the dryer and noticed the hood had a huge hole at the seam. This is VERY poor quality and unfortunately I'm outside the return window. Don't buy! The gray one I purchased is holding up fine, so maybe it's just an issue with the yellow ones."
1.0,I got two left one and the other two I can’t put them on because  The heals don’t have the other pice to hold them in
1.0,These tarnished very quickly
1.0,This is not what I received not even close
1.0,Doesn't look at all like the photos. Better off putting on a men's white button up.
1.0,It fit perfectly but The material of the product was not what was expected .The style was very nice.
1.0,This shirt did not fit even close to what is pictured. It was oversized and did not have a good shape at all. Loose neck low line and the sleeves were awful. My husband did not wear it . I used it as a night/sleep shirt.
1.0,Velcro fell apart after wearing for 2 weeks
1.0,Too small/very thin material
1.0,Broke the first time wearing them!
1.0,Color ishown in the product image deceptive. This does not look anything like titanium finish. Look elsewhere!!!
1.0,Not good quality...do not buy it!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:ba79e77b016c6479e42e0f896307411]] No es realmente lo que esperaba del artículo a mi hijo le gusto Niño al fin lo que le interesa es el diseño y los colores son bastante parecido a la imagen que muestran pero el material se ve barato medio raro es un tejido tipo elástica no es lo que esperaba 😔
1.0,This is the kind of product you find in a dollar store.  I washed it to get the horrible wrinkles<br />and it is still horrible.  Since I washed it ….can't go back.  Looks nothing like the picture.<br />Very sad.
1.0,I bought this product thinking it would work constantly. But come to find out I have charged it and it still doesn’t work like I thought it would. Very disappointed in this product because of lost money.
1.0,AMAZON!!!! Not one of the reviews here matches the rimless glasses shown.  WTH!
1.0,"Ring is made of base metals and can not be resized at a jewelers.  The look of the ring is fantastic, but what good is it if you can't wear it.  Buyer beware!!!!"
1.0,Didn't realize that it was so shiny.
1.0,Seam came apart and runs small size
1.0,It was terrible!! All the buttons popped off and before that none of the buttons would fit in the holes! And the part that’s supposed to tight the straps was in two pieces so it didn’t work. It was just awful!! Very unhappy with my purchase!
1.0,Would of been a nice shirt but an XL fits like a medium. Very short. Disappointed
1.0,"Cute earrings but they are are not as described, they are gold. The description says silver and photo of item is silver as well. Photo includes purchased earrings and one of my silver earrings so you can see the difference."
1.0,"loved the first order, re-ordered, got something different, not happy with replacement"
1.0,Pure garbage. Maybe it would have fit in my wrist if it didn't break when I took it out of the package. Have it one star because it wouldn't post without it
1.0,To tight on the face barley can breathe or see….
1.0,I like the butterfly 🦋 but I didn’t get the chain what come with it
1.0,I ordered a 3x muscular and was hopeful that these were normal sizes. When I got the shirt I had to double check the tag because this shirt was a large at best. I definitely would not recommend this product.
1.0,"The product itself may have been ok, but amazon left paper package in the rain and all the bows were soaked and stained like this. I then dried them on low not realizing they were all just glued on and glue melted on some of them after 2 minutes"
1.0,"I ordered one 2 weeks ago and it was beautiful. Hand stitched and what a deal! This one is cheap silk screen, not stitched and MUCH thinner. So unhappy. Ordered from the exact same place for the same price. I feel like I got bait and switched."
1.0,"Go down a size or these will not fit you, which is really disappointing since I'm a size 0 and they don't go any smaller. The flare is almost comically large for a size 0 plug and the saddle is a mm larger than advertised"
1.0,Not the size that is written women's xlarge it like med or small. Wasted money on several shirts. Buyer be ware.  To expense to send back
1.0,Not satisfied..
1.0,The t shirt it very sheep not good
1.0,Very disappointed. No weight to it at all
1.0,"Pretty boots, impossible to get into! The construction needs to be rethought. I literally could not get my heel past the ankle! You need arches like Barbie to wear these!! Horrible!!!"
1.0,No support at all
1.0,The base of the piercing was not smooth and cut up the inside of my lip.
1.0,Did not like fit but colors are beautiful
1.0,Way too big and too long from crotch to waist  and then the legs were too short like high waters.  Goodwill donation
1.0,"It has a terrible design with a magnetic snap that pops open when you try to carry it by the handles. It throws the weight distribution off, making the handles unusable.  The shoulder strap also has a major flaw, as the tabs that secure it have stretched out and now it pops off at random times and the bag goes flying.  I wish I could return it, but the return policy is too short for a bag that should last years."
1.0,This item looked great and I was really looking forward to having fun. They sent me a used retapped one.  It is covered in loose black fibers that get in your eyes. Total nightmare. Customer service didn’t seem to care and only offered a refund instead of taking it down. Good luck to those who buy it. Make sure you check for the hair inside the mask.
1.0,"These shoes worked great for 2 months and my son received many compliments,  but now they will not charge or light up at all.  They were worn no more than 10 times and still look brand new. They have never been wet or left outside. Very disappointed."
1.0,The shirt is way too short I do have a long upper body but even normal shirt fit me these one go to my belly button
1.0,Awful product does not work the pictures are not like what it really does look like I was one day late trying to get my money back on it and Amazon refuse to refund it I would say you can buy something else much better than this for sure for the for that price
1.0,Cheap garbage
1.0,Completely did not fit
1.0,"These run large, but they were also uncomfortable. The seem at the tongue is poorly made, so you'll have a rough piece of shoe scratching the tops of your feet all day. The sides of the shoe flare out while walking. I sent mine back."
1.0,These masks do not fit well to the shape of my face. If you are looking for something that sparkly this is not the mask for you!
1.0,I was so excited for these pants! Zipper was broken and looked like they were worn. No tags or poof of new product.
1.0,Bend and fall off really easy
1.0,Not worth your time and effort money!! It's cheap material... so small... awful. So disappointed.
1.0,"As expected when purchasing a &quot;one size fits all&quot;, the first thing you expect is for it to fit.<br />Oddly enough, HA,  this is NOT a one size fits all!<br />I'm 5'7 and weigh 135; my pant size is anywhere from a size 5 to 7, but usually 7's are too big.<br />This top fits snug around my hips. It is not loose as the picture displays.<br />If you are bigger than me, don't purchase!!!<br />If you are expecting a soft flowy top, don't purchase!!!<br />This top is not soft, but rather scratchy."
1.0,"I've bought dresses similar to this one that were great, so I came across this one on a deal. It arrived & immediately you can tell its cheaply made. The mid seam is off, it's not even straight across and the seam is rippled.. And the top material is ok, cotton. The bottom is some type of cheap spandex or something. I expected better quality."
1.0,Heavy. Link adjuster didn't work.  Returned it
1.0,The metal clasp closing system digs into the skin
1.0,This Thing Broke. The Tasels Fell Off!!!
1.0,Screw broke off side of frame
1.0,Pieces broke off easily
1.0,Ordered 3 sizes larger and it still doesn't work. Cheap quality in material.
1.0,"Once I got them and tried them on, they were just to large for my style. They're nice looking, fit well, and even very stylish, but just not for me."
1.0,"2 years ago I bought the silver/black frames from a retail store. After few months, they broke. The store fixed them. After nearly 2 years. They broke again and the store couldn't fix them because there was no warranty. Now I purchased this from Amazon, and same problem."
1.0,Doesn't stay in place.as soon my husband start to move in bed that thing  comes off his head.
1.0,"Size is incorrect based on their sizing chart. Ordered a 2xl, and it measures 33 inches. Per the chart it should be 39.<br /><br />Other than that, it's beautiful. But I can't wear it :("
1.0,So disappointed with this purchase. The pictures look so cute in comparison. What I received was a very cheaply made “shirt.” The material was horrible. It was the same type of cheap material they use for Halloween costumes! Was poorly made with lots of loose threads. Don’t waste your time or money on this product. I returned this immediately. Didn’t even bother trying it on.
1.0,I ordered a size up and it is way too short to wear. For reference I’m 5’1 and ordered a large and it was too short to wear. Returning
1.0,The fabric doesn’t look anything like the picture.  It is pure polyester and doesn’t have this faded cotton look like in the picture.  Looks very cheap.  Will be returning.
1.0,"Frumpy, I tried to make it work, it looked cute on the hanger but once I put it in my niece it swallowed her it was actually too big but I got her size.  It was just ugly no matter what I did, luckily I had a back up dress"
1.0,Nice shorts but Too small
1.0,"I needed to return the items because they didn't fit right and the seller wanted me to pay for the shipping to return when any other time I have returned an item, it cost nothing"
1.0,Bands are metal and will not adjust.  Very pinching if you don't happen to possess a very round head!
1.0,The little plastic pieces on the sides for adjusting the size have all broken the first use. Garbage.
1.0,Very junky.  From China.  Poor quality.
1.0,do not buy this product!
1.0,"Beautidul shiet, too bad it runs so amall."
1.0,I purchased brand new shoes yet when they arrived they were clearly used because someone’s name was written inside the shoe with a marker. They do not hold up well for a little kid.
1.0,The picture looks nothing like what you get. It runs very big and is poorly made. The straps are coming apart and  I have not worn it. I will use to lounge around the house. Wasted money
1.0,I though this would be comparable to Shefit. It’s not! Save your money. It runs incredibly SMALL. I got the largest size and it’s still way to small.fabric and cheap and itchy. Just buy the real thing. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Stiff as a board, not floppy, sizing not helpful what so ever. I wrote many email asking for inch measurements and they kept replying with unwanted and unneeded. information,They are not customer friendly. Very cheap materials also. You will regret the hassle and high blood pressure, I know,it happened to me. 😈😈😈😈😈"
1.0,Way too small...had to return
1.0,Granted I don’t look like the model but the medium sweater went to my knees and was huge. Sent it back
1.0,The jumpsuit had a stain on the left pants leg.<br />Does not have alot of stretch in fabric order up a size. I wish the stain wasn't there ... I want to order up a size..<br />Not sure
1.0,Sheds like crazy. Can’t wear it. Bought it for my daughter and she only wore it once before deciding it was not worth wearing.
1.0,Poorly made hat.
1.0,Fell apart in a hour.
1.0,The shape and colors are nothing like the pictures. Very misleading.
1.0,"When I received it ,it wàs broken"
1.0,not the best material
1.0,Thin chain and the clasp is a spring not a claw.
1.0,"Poor Quality. Sizing is inaccurate and the bands are not snug and tight enough. I ordered the smallest size and it runs big. Returned the item and I had to pay shipping back, deducted from refund. Wont buy next time."
1.0,The sizes on here aren't what you get. Made in Pakistan.
1.0,This is pretty in the pictures but ugly as sin in real life. It fits horrribly. It looks dated and old fashioned. and it was a waste of money. XD
1.0,Tarnished when I received. Looks like an earring from the 99 cents store
1.0,Complete junk. Do not buy. Smells like death and the stones instantly fell off. My son was so disappointed.
1.0,big hole in them after wearing them twice
1.0,Would be ok if I was 12 yrs old
1.0,Looks very nice but it arrived broken. Guess I should have listened to the other reviews!
1.0,Arrived so tarnished. Not worth the time and money.
1.0,Very small. Maybe good foe the nose
1.0,Don’t even bother unless you wear a men’s size 13 or larger!<br /><br />I wear a women’s size 6.5 and these are HUGE! Disappointed!
1.0,This was super small and super thin... looks like something you’d get in a hut for 50 cents in a far away land! Them hemming isn’t straight either!
1.0,"Although technically a woman's shirt in small, it was clearly a man's shirt in small, which was huge on me. Very disappointing."
1.0,I normally wear a 1x or a 2x. I ordered a 5x. This bathing suit would have fit perfectly if I was 8 inches shorter. I'm only 5'6&#34;. Very disappointed. It's a cute suit
1.0,I bought these in the darker color and loved the way they fit. These lighter ones in the other hand are about two sizes to small
1.0,The product arrived over a month late and was poor quality. Not good enough to hold a modern phone in place while running.
1.0,Such a bummer!! I wore these one and washed them and the seam threads are coming apart!! I own a black pair of the high waist leggings and don't have any issues. Pretty disappointed with these...
1.0,Broke after one use.
1.0,This arrived broken
1.0,"Way to small, return policy sucks and they are made super super cheap. You get what you pay for and these are crap."
1.0,Hated these
1.0,5/5/2018 Just good the item. Opened the box and the glass already fall out.
1.0,Does not fit Amp phone as advertised.
1.0,Necklace was in a huge knot when I opened the box. To my surprise the necklace was broken after I managed to get the know undone. How interesting<br />Returning asap
1.0,Didn’t even last within one hour.<br />Super Cheap and waste of money.
1.0,Swimsuit is cute but good luck getting your child’s head in…
1.0,"Demasiado pequeño. No es talle 8, corresponde a talle 4<br />Muy mala compra. Me sentí mal con esta compra. Siento que tire mi dinero"
1.0,The white waist band is sewn in inside out. So I either have to wear the skirt inside out or wear the tag sticking out.  It looks unfinished.
1.0,"This one came in a bag that had sand in it. Weird, but whatever. I was sorely disappointed when I ordered this in an 18 (size 14, but I have 38G breasts) and it wasn't even close to being a size 18.  This did not cover one breast fully when tied completely and as tight as I wanted. I even bounced a little and my boob popped right out. If you are busty like I am, just scroll past this one"
1.0,Very thin and cheap material. Whoever sewed these together must have been sewing with their eyes closed. They’re also very small and look nothing like the picture.
1.0,Not very comfortable and always breaking. Hard too take off and put on. Went back to the sport band my watch came with.
1.0,I returned this.  This would have been an embarrassing gift to give to someone.
1.0,I didn’t want work out pants
1.0,Not the same color at all. More orange
1.0,First one of the shirts was not in the package. I did contact Amazon but no response from the seller. The sizes are way off. Much smaller than expected.
1.0,"Order a size up and know you’re not getting a t-shirt, you’re getting a REALLY high up crop top. It’s a shame cause it’s soft but wow am I bummed out about the shirt. Gave it to my 8year old niece."
1.0,"I bought these N95 respirators (saw on CDC website) and recommended them to everyone, UNTIL they ""updated"" the style. Here's what went wrong. For comfort, they flipped the entire respirator upside down, encased the metal nose strip and attached it to what used to be the chin area of the respirator.  All the measurements are off now.  Former chin area is now gappy and and ill-fitting at the nose bridge area and the former nose bridge area is now at the chin area and does not fit snugly under the chin anymore.  As a result, both of straps, which they left in place, are all wrong now, too. A mess. They no longer fit tightly and are not protective. All the measurements are off. Trust this review. I was into buying these all the time, but then they changed and now they're not safe. They took a great N95, CDC approved respirator and ruined it themselves by redesigning it. If I could find the version they had before (with the exposed metal strip at the nose), I'd buy them again. Still searching for a replacement."
1.0,When I walk they slide down
1.0,Do not buy this. I have worn this size for years and this shirt is sized too small! It had no stretch at all! Immediate returned!
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap. I should've read the reviews but I purchased it off of a wish list so I assumed the person already looked into this. I've seen necklaces come out of a 25 cent gumball machine that are better quality than this. The emblem is bubbling and a mess. Doesn't look anything like the logo should. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
1.0,They arrived tarnished. They are simply ugly and very cheaply made. They look nothing like the pictures. Dollar store earrings look better than these. Two thumbs down 👎 👎
1.0,Color was off wasn’t gold
1.0,"It looks nice, but the buttom will never close so your walet will be always open, mine NEVER CLOSED. don't  by this produtc you will be disapointed"
1.0,I ordered 5 bracelets from here.  Two have been delivered.  I am a very thin guy with very thin wrists.  These are so SMALL! Please note if you are a living human being the bracelet won't fit! Also... They don't return phone calls.
1.0,This is not a sweatshirt. Material is cheap and the colors are not near as bright as in the picture. Very disappointed. Even the bottom of the sweatshirt is not the same.
1.0,It was too small. The sizing is not right!
1.0,The sizing was more for an anorexic teen or a child. Extremely dissappointed in size. Quality was good.
1.0,This backpack is unraveling right before my eyes. I feel like it only has a few more moments before it’s just unuseable. There is constant fraying of the material happening inside and outside of the bag. The shoulder strap is breaking for no apparent reason. The zipper can’t be used without snagging and bunching on even more fabric. Just terrible. Not worth the money.
1.0,Does not look good so I returned it.
1.0,"This purse is absolutely beautiful, but it is already falling apart."
1.0,If this is a 3X then I am a monkey in a space helmet. I wish I had read the reviews.
1.0,This is not good for larger women. I ordered extra large but its not like a shirt you tie on the side its like a crop top.
1.0,They are really big
1.0,Shirt had a hole in it. Not impressed with quality
1.0,"I didn't even try this top on because the material is NOTHING like what's pictured!! This material is shiny and cheap, looks similar to bathing suit material, not something I would wear as a top. The print is also very different than the pictures."
1.0,"Crappy, very cheap"
1.0,Very scratchy material. Poor quality cheap material. Did not bother to wash to see if it would soften up the scratchiness because of poor quality Fabrick.
1.0,"The dress is beautiful,  fabric is not perfect but is good, the problem is that the sizes don't match the size chart they provide,  they even asked for my measurements before sending me the dress and always ended up being big and with one missing button, I write to them and they suggested  to sell it,  fix it on my own or retur it, they will just return $15 to me cause of the missing button. So if you want this dress be ready cause if you are lucky it will fit you or you never know if will be big or small on you, if you check the reviews some people say it runs to big other it runs to small.<br />They don't stick with the measurements chart they provide."
1.0,Only had bracelet on for couple of days and started to tarnish
1.0,The hat arrived completely smashed and misshapen. Very unhappy 🙁 the hat will is beyond repair
1.0,8 pair were broken.
1.0,"I’m 4’11”, 115lbs and bra size 36B. I bought this dress for a friend’s dinner but it was too loose and long. It went pass my knee and the top was loose on chest and long on arm."
1.0,The color is not even close to the picture. Somewhat big for small size. Stitches quality is bad. Exta trade on the patches. No quality control. Extremely dissatisfied.
1.0,"I sent them back, the shape didnt work for my face but I did purchase another pair from Quay that looked much better. The quality of the glasses are excellent for the price point!"
1.0,"Haven’t used yet but very thin sole, if you need to avoid stepping on sting rays, don’t buy this."
1.0,size is extremely small
1.0,Cheaply made. Neither pair latch. Sending back.
1.0,"These pants are comfortable, but half of the waistband ripped off after the first wear. The stitch quality is exceedingly poor. Very disappointing!"
1.0,A.W.F.U.L. I even ordered 2 sizes big and it was still WAYYY too small. Don't get it. Not worth it.
1.0,"I bought a bathing suit just like this in a store, but in another color.  When I saw it in black I was really excited.  But this one was made very cheap, very stiff - didn't fit anything like the other one - I would NOT recommend buying this. Waste of money."
1.0,The product material was not as expected.
1.0,"This is a Men’s Size, not boys."
1.0,The bunnies feel off as she put them on the very first time!
1.0,Out of 15 anklets 9 were broken!!
1.0,They were thin as paper.  Very poor quality and I returned them.
1.0,Strap broke after 2 weeks of use.  Picture looks good but thin material and doesn't hold up
1.0,The elastic ripped right when I put it on and it's loose on my arm so I can't wear it
1.0,get a popcicle stick; it will do the same job.
1.0,Packaging of the item was horrible. Used a gigantic box to pack three small filters and one of them was already open! Very disappointed.
1.0,Did not like the material.  Would not recommend.  I returned mine.
1.0,It was very thin and the bands ripped very easily. And the pockets were too small
1.0,The reason for the discoloration and small size is because this is stolen work.
1.0,Worst ever. These aren't clickers they are captive bead and the opening is too small to fit around my average sized septum. I tried to bend one to get it in but then it was too warped to hold the captive bead. Maybe if you have the dantiest nose in the world these will work for you but if you have a normal size nose do not buy
1.0,Item was supposed to me an X-Large. Instead it was more like an small.
1.0,I sent this necklace back for a refund
1.0,"These were cute, but after having these for a few weeks the backing came off in the shower. I can no longer wear these. These are flimsier than other types of earrings I have purchased."
1.0,"kept slipping no matter how I used them. I had lost a lot of weight due to illness, and rather than buy all new bras, I thought these might fill in literally until I could gain the weight back."
1.0,Absolutely horrid. I will be returning. I can't believe how cheap it is. Get what you pay for I guess.
1.0,When you think titanium you think shiny right? I do. Well it's definitely Low Grade not shiny at all. It's Pasty Grey. If you want a shiny good looking keyring your buying the wrong product. But that's to be expected when it's dirt cheap I guess.
1.0,Color is great but size is not so much.
1.0,"It looks pretty decent and the pendant is a good size. However there is no clasp or anything like that, meaning that only way to put this on is over your head.  As result I am writing this now became the rope inexplicably tore off as I was taking it off  as I normally do. This has now happened twice after another one after the first broke.<br /><br />Edit: the the seller did contact me via email and offer a refund. The problem is he tried to manipulate me into posting a positive review. First I was told to change the star rating to, which I did, but that was not good enough. I got another email asking me to leave a review with “positive content” BEFORE receiving a refund.  The implication being that my refund on a shoddy product is dependent on a positive review. That is dishonest and I will not obey.  I have reported this seller to Amazon for this and would encourage everyone not to buy this product!!!"
1.0,"The jersey is REALLY BAD QUALITY. The lines in the jersey are made of a non-stretchy material. When it was sewed with the stretchy material of the jersey, it causes the jersey to bunch up and look weird. Do not recommend."
1.0,"Rough material, way too small and I wear a small top and size 4 jeans."
1.0,Jacket is beautiful but it runs too small! That’s my second time buying from them and I asked for XXL but the XXL fits like a Small (US) WTF?? I’m very disappointed!
1.0,"I felt the chain out of the bag, it was in 2 pieces vs one preassembled, and it looked nothing or felt nothing like my old one.  I feel mislead.  But I did not see it was for women, so perhaps it has a place for the right person.  still, I think something a bit more resilient would be better."
1.0,This product is not sized correctly.
1.0,got a used one. Returned it
1.0,Size is about 4 times smaller than what it should be.  I ordered for a 4 year old would not fit an infant.  Only plus is they are cute...
1.0,"Really sad about these bands.  I have the S2 Classic and yet don't fit right, the opening where the pin goes is too short.  I didn't try then until just after my return window closed so I am stuck with them and looking for a new watch band again.  :("
1.0,"I ordered an extra large, I'm not a big person,I just like loose fitting. This was an average small."
1.0,You'll need a very fine point pen to write on this..
1.0,Image appeared larger when it arrived and not as small as pictured. Dimensions were meant for a giant face.
1.0,Cheap piece of elastic nylon like material. Appears to be cut with scissors then sewn together in the back.
1.0,My daughter worn it once and it ripped right down the inseam. This product is made extremely poorly.
1.0,Cute dress & fast shipping.<br />However the back has a button with an elastic loop it needs to go into.<br />The button will not fit into the elastic loop. Button is too big for it.<br />I can’t wear the dress- if I could sew maybe it could be an easy fix. However I can’t so the dress is useless to me.<br /><br />Ordered a replacement dress- it has no way to button the back.<br /><br />!!!MAKE A WORKING PRODUCT!!!
1.0,If you feel the the need to walk around in this you may as well be naked. I threw it away. Junk!
1.0,There's no way this is worth anything over $19.99 in my opion. Unhappy that the material was almost see through. I thought I was getting a nice robe for my mother at a $40 price. I guess that's what they mean by lightweight. It is definitely not giftable.
1.0,It came broken and dirty. It's a waste of money.
1.0,I washed this item so that when my granddaughter opened the gift she could wear immediately.  The colors faded and item shrunk up.  It looked more like a hand me down than a new item.
1.0,No gasten su dinero es este producto.
1.0,Cheaply made polyester and too big
1.0,Malisimos se ocxidan
1.0,"Purchased xl (14/16) for my 13 yr old and he could not even get them up over his thighs!  Super tight, too small, waste of money!  These are not true to size at all!"
1.0,Purchased this product on July 19th and on October 12th plastic frame broke around both lenses making it is impossible to use. Not even 3 months of gently used glasses are now garbage.
1.0,"I have a freakishly large noggin, so I'm used to having to look around for ball caps that fit. I have never experienced trying on a hat that was way to large, even for my size 8 head. This thing is just wrong in every possible dimension. The peak flopped over like a chef's hat."
1.0,I got this for a Halloween party. Not happy the shamrock is missing and some of the senqiince. Also the feather is going the wrong way. I'd return it if I had time going to have to use my crafting skills to fix it. 😒
1.0,"I received this about two weeks ago and wore it for the last two weeks. The metal chain became discolored quickly, and then the chain came apart in  several places. Poor material and construction."
1.0,Cute but cheap.
1.0,fit too small. had to go a size up. bottom fit okay but the top was too small.
1.0,The bracelet is misspelled on the inside and reads as follows: whenever you feel overwhelmed rememer whose daughter you are and straighten your crow. Seriously!!! WTF? Can’t give this as a gift! How embarrassing! Don’t waste your time or money!
1.0,Don't Bother
1.0,Not quality. Poorly made
1.0,"Too small, tight, and too short for taller women size"
1.0,This is the third one we've purchased. All three have had big bumps/bubbles in the metal. All three were defective. Very poor quality.
1.0,"I will never buy these again I had a allergic reaction to. The Black dye in the mask, my face is severely discolored and now I'm seeing a dermatologist to try to help me correct that issue"
1.0,"This is the first time I've ordered from Amazon and had something so cheap and poorly made arrive at my doorstep. The string does not even tighten the dress - it has no functionality. If you are petite you will absolutely disappear inside this giant, shapeless item. Returning it."
1.0,"If you're short,  this will fit fine.  This shirt didn't even come down to my hips.  I ordered an XL and it was as tight as a large.  Don't waste your time."
1.0,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I opened the box. It looked  cheap, wrinkled, asymmetrical - I wouldn't wear it if it were free, let alone for $60. You could get a better wallet at a dollar store. I sent it back."
1.0,Very shapeless tote that does not have any structure or stand up on its own.
1.0,They do not stay in AT ALL. Will fall out of your ear and the back will never stay. Sad cause they are so cute
1.0,Los colores no son es muy corta y angosta y el material es incómodo además llego 5 días tarde de la fecha de entrega nunca llego para el cumpleaños de mi hija muy mala experiencia
1.0,Damaged product
1.0,"This may be asian size. It runs really really small. Wish they would indicate that in the description. Returning. Bummed, the material is nice feel though"
1.0,Poor quality and too big
1.0,They sent the wrong sizes so I was not able to wear. The small would've fit fine.
1.0,"Wrong size was sent to me, just didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back so I could not enjoy it."
1.0,I have bought these numerous times each time being careful not to expose them to water but each time the diamond or cubic zirconia part becomes tainted and cloudy making it garbage
1.0,"This dress uses a lace-up corset closure in the back, however, there is no string attached or included. Needed dress for a wedding this weekend, now unlikely to be able to wear it."
1.0,Looks really cheap. I was disappointed. I returned it.
1.0,I know it was cheap...but I thoughtI would be able to wear the darn thing at least one time!! Sometimes you do get just what you pay for...so save you money on this one.
1.0,"Not what I expected. they were to short on the top. Wore one pair one day, washed them and there was a hole in them on the top of foot. They don't seem made well."
1.0,"I don't know why this is showing up as something I bought. The one I got is completely different than this, it's a fake leather with a bit of decor on it.  The one I got is okay but I'm seriously not impressed as it is rather flimsy."
1.0,I didn't like this earring set at all. The setting of the stones looked like something from the dollar store.<br />Poor quality stones as well. Don't buy unless you like cheap looking jewelry
1.0,The glass fell out of this watch almost immediately after buying this. Paid 146$ and the watch is already broken. I’m very displeased.
1.0,Don't bother buying this.
1.0,"My husband liked the slipper because of the comfort but after 1 1/2 months while we were away the rubber soles would break off in chunks.  I contacted Foot Smart they wanted it returned in the original box, being 1200 miles away we didn't have it.  We arrived home contacted Foot Smart now are told because the 60 days are up cannot send them back, slippers costing this much should not fall apart in 1 1/2 months.  He had the same slippers a year ago they fell apart but not until 10 1/2 months later.<br />Someone should stand behind the producy."
1.0,The material look cheap. Low quality material
1.0,"Colors are not what they are pictured! Not happy about that. However I did not notice the one star review prior to buying. So my fault, poor service to let buyers think that’s what they are buying."
1.0,Do not like the fabric feel to it. Feels stiff. Wish it was more softer.  But besides that its nice to have
1.0,Item was WAY shorter than the picture shows
1.0,Very cheap look
1.0,"It didn’t work, right from delivery. Bought a new battery, still no luck"
1.0,Really tight and the gold part seems very flashy.
1.0,Was so excited to gift this for my daughter on her birthday ... the minute she took it out of the package the chain BROKE. Don’t order this .. ugh.
1.0,I would give zero stars if possible. The pair of shoes I received are a complete fake. They are not even real leather. The shoe smells so bad and toxic. Really bad knock off. I have seen several complaints now about fake merchandise from 6pm. I will not buy from them. Buyers beware.
1.0,Freaking rip off. I could have paid $1.50 for a bottle of rubbing alcohol and it would have been the exact same
1.0,These are supposed to be for kids to use but they are impossible. The sizing is difficult to adjust and difficult to make it stay from one user to another. They are a pain in the ass to open up and put on. No way a child would be able to do it on their own.
1.0,Surprisingly cheap quality ! The design literally looks like a computer printer printed it on the material ! Looks like someone zoomed in on the image and it's super pixelated ! Defnitinely not worth the small amount of money ! I will personally never buy again!
1.0,"Worst quality sunglasses I have ever purchased, the lenses are thin and cheap, the frame is not durable at all.  Even though they are $7, I could buy better ones at a dollar store!"
1.0,Was so excited for my Birthday to wear these...absolutely can't.  They are clip on. If you have ever tried them you know how horrible they are. Don't go through the pain.
1.0,One of these arrived broken and when my husband wore the others for the first time they also broke off the cufflink.  Just sad as he had been eyeing these for awhile and these were a gift.
1.0,cheap material and I felt the white looked like a cheap nightgown.
1.0,Pésima compra no solo tardó un mes en venir. Y se baja todo no se ve el regalar y se dobla<br /> Pésimo
1.0,"The watched arrived with a non working battery, and as soon as the battery was changed the hands of the clock fell off."
1.0,The plastic one that  spirals broke as soon as my daughter tried to put it on..
1.0,It says for true to size. I couldn't even get this shirt over my head! I would say order at least 2 sizes up.
1.0,If I could rate these no stars I would! They were wayyy too small and the color was off. The pants do not look even close to this.
1.0,Kind of hard to install. Look cool but as soon as I had my shoes laced up I slid my foot in slowly and 2 of them just snapped. Broken. Not worth it to me
1.0,"Very loose fitting, thin material.  Could be used as a sleep top."
1.0,Turned brown and black after only a few uses.
1.0,"I have two pair of CompresSport calf sleeves and they are a wonderful product.<br /><br />These socks, however, is not a great product and has questionable durability--so much so that I returned them.<br /><br />To start, the woven fabric is *very* thin. It's more like cotton than a tech fabric if that makes sense--more like traditional athletic socks. Thus, when you start pulling them on it stretches, badly. Like I could see my skin/calves between the woven parts of the fabric because it stretched out the weaving (think knitting or whatever when you stretch that). That's disconcerting because that means they're much more susceptible to tearing. I have larger calves than most people but I suspect this would be a problem for anyone. Had they simply made this out of tech material--whatever that stuff is called--there'd be no issue with the weave. Unfortunately, someone at CompresSport decided to go a different way.<br /><br />Definitely not worth the extra cost."
1.0,"Crap, absolute crap! It takes a really poor quality product and/or customer service experience for me to spend valuable time to compose a review. The unbelievably poor quality of this shirt warrants a cautionary tale for others considering purchasing it.<br />The shirt I received has a hole and the seams are all frayed with long, loose threads that are all bunched up - not like it was intentionally designed to look rustic, it looks like a 3-year-old made the shirt!"
1.0,"The bracelet I received looks nothing like the photo.  There is not much stain/paint on the bracelet.  It looks like a 3 year old tried to paint it.  I wasn't sure what to expect in the quality of leather, but I did expect the coloring to be similar to the photo."
1.0,Horrible not at all like the picture. Instead of it simply being a pair of patterned flare pants it’s two pieces of fabric with the pattern of top and inside a weird black liner. Not at all what I wanted.
1.0,was for a child not a grown person..never order from there again
1.0,We wanted these glasses for a Halloween costume but they stretched out immediately and were not able to be worn. They were a waste of money.
1.0,Both posts were bent when i got them. Afraid theyll break if i try to straighten them out . If i push them theyll break.  Oh well. Wont buy any more
1.0,I agree with the<br />Other reviewers. Nice looking but the optics are off just enough to drive you crazy.
1.0,Not durable and not very pretty. Looks very cheap and gem flips over to painted silver backside.
1.0,Looks very cute on but smells so horrible. Washed twice and the chemical smell is still there. Returning!
1.0,"Too small, but also, didn't like fabric!  Will be returning!  Need return information, which was not included in packaging!  Please assist!"
1.0,The material was like a cheap curtain.. nothing like the photo. I returned the dress.
1.0,The shocking feature stops working.  Not worth $200 when it will randomly stop working
1.0,trash
1.0,So ugly in person. The white part is more on the yellowish side. Also has a bumpy texture. No thanks!
1.0,Size large turned to a medium after washing.
1.0,Top isn't made for someone who has over a B cup.
1.0,Too small not even close
1.0,Definitely will not be buying from this company again. So so tiny.
1.0,Improper English.  Item will not work for what it was intended.
1.0,Cheap. Arms were not the same on each side.
1.0,Overalls came with back pocket unsewn and falling off and hems around bottom unraveled. THey are cute but would disintegrate after washing
1.0,"Was expecting solid red, white, and navy blue but got weird &#34;distressed&#34; versions of the colors. Very frustrating since I needed these for a costume."
1.0,"absolutely the worst studs available. i bought these for my wedding and the studs kept popping. the problem with them is the back portion is the same size as the front. therefore not being able to be put through the back of the shirt, because if you do anything above normal breathing, they will come flying out."
1.0,"I never got these! I WAS EXCITED TO GET THESE BUT DIDN'T! My husband had gotten  me a beautiful black diamond ring in gold, a very large pendant/necklace in gold, earrings...and I wanted these to go in a second set of holes I have in my ears. Never got them  :/"
1.0,This package arrived with only two colors. The description is very misleading.
1.0,I ordered the necklace this is a keychain...... not happy.
1.0,"The purse is beautiful, glitter doesn't feel terribly rough, but this purse ruined everything I wore while wearing it. I took it on vacation to Las Vegas, we didn't even walk all that much because we spent all day at the pool. It just caused massive piling, discoloration, and even irritation on my arm. I won't ever carry a glitter purse again. Also the tab discolored after one weekend wearing it. Sorry the picture isn't clear. Just trying to get the word out there. It's cute but it's the devil."
1.0,"The front of this item was partially rounded, but the back was flat and still sharp in places. It looks like it came out of a mold. A little clean up and rounding would have been good for this."
1.0,"The shirt looks great, but I took it to have it dry cleaned and the first time I went to wear it, I noticed there were no cuff link holes in one of the sleeves. Now I’m trying to figure out how to contact the seller so I can get an exchange, but not that easy."
1.0,"Flimsy & cheap quality. Definitely NOT chiffon, some kind of poly"
1.0,Poor quality. Look more like plastic toy
1.0,"These leggings are very shiny. They are nylon and spandex, not modal. They run a bit large: I often wear a medium in pants, but the small was perfect for me. I really want to like these legging, because the fit is exactly what I've been looking for. The rise covers my hips but not my belly button, and the length is long enough (I'm 5'4&#34; and they'd be long enough even for a taller person). They are just so damn SHINY! I don't know if I'll be able to get use to this look. It seriously seems like I should be performing in a dance concert somewhere. I think I'm going to send them back.<br /><br />Edit- I tried them on a second time to make a decision about keeping or returning them and found a hole in one leg! Definitely going back now, and I added &#34;bad quality&#34; to my description. Such a bummer."
1.0,Shoes came smaller then the actual size
1.0,"My husband does not like this mask! The material is awful, doesn’t stay put and rolls up."
1.0,"I am 5'10&#34; and the length was perfect without a heal. This dress runs large so I would recommend ordering down a size if you are unsure.  The material was awful.  It is shiny, cheap and I felt like I was wearing a parachute. The gradient color was nice but that's it.  I won't be wearing this dress."
1.0,"Looks cute online, but ordered a small (I'm 5'1 & 125 lbs) and the band at the knees was way too tight. I couldn't really walk. The top area wasn't flattering. It also looked like it stretched too much because the black faded into white. It was also very see through in the back, you'd have to wear &#34;no-show&#34; material for under garments."
1.0,Cute but very hard to position and screw back on because it is round and the hole tiny. Wish the  secure back was better
1.0,Comes in looking totally different its shorter in pictures it comes below your waist but is is shot almost like a belly shirt.  Did not like at all
1.0,too many zippered pockets and confusing to remember where everything  went.
1.0,The leggings came with a huge rip across the back
1.0,"I gave these to a friend who wears a sm/med in tops, they fit her perfectly. Too bad I would have loved them had they fit. No where even close to an XL."
1.0,"Poorly made, one arm fell off in transit, the other ones fell off after use. Don't buy."
1.0,Terrible quality.  Horrible.
1.0,This is not for medical use. And it’s not kf94. Fake face mask and fake descriptions.
1.0,"I was extremely disappointed with this swimsuit. I measured and ordered according to the sizing on the product description page and the bust was still WAY too small. I wear a 36F but measured in inches across the top of my bust and the sizing guide said 3XL. My boobs could not get any wear near to being covered with the  size top I received! Addionally the bottom was too loose!<br /><br />The material of the swimsuit was extremely cheap, the center front seam was NOT at all centered. The underwire was poking through the mesh material. Worst of all the front looked TERRIBLE due to loose white threads all the bust area! Yes loose WHITE threads, not red, they must have been sewn through from the backing or something!<br /><br />I am returning this swimsuit as soon as possible, it not only does not fit as described, it is made of cheap flimsy material. I would try recommend this swimsuit to anyone honestly. Not because of the sizing but because is just badly made.<br />* I did receive this swimsuit at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review. I don't enjoy leaving one star reviews but this swimsuit was seriously just awful..."
1.0,This don’t make me sweat at all and elastic dig into my skin
1.0,"These felt like jeans when I pulled them out of the package. The XL looked more like an XS, definitely not for thick girls or girls with any kind of a curve. Also there is no way that these could be for working out, the material was terrible! Do not buy!"
1.0,Not like the picture and the color
1.0,Ohhh god this sweater was horrible in smell. I literally had to leave it in a bucket full of water and scented fabric softener so the smell would leave but not even like that could I get rid of the smell. Apart from that it wasn't even soft. It felt really itchy but it did fit as I liked.
1.0,I did not get the address
1.0,I was so excited to find this sports bra as I run six days a week and need my phone.  As soon as I received the package I tried to put my phone (iphone8) into the pocket.  To my surprise it did not fit.  I am so bummed!  I can't even put the phone in the pocket while NOT wearing the bra.  There is no way I could get it out or put it in during a run if needed.  :(
1.0,Cute but coudnt get it open after trying so hard it broke before i even got to put it in
1.0,I buy readers all the time that last for years.<br />I purchased 2 pairs over the past 6 months and both pairs completely broke where you insert the screw.<br />Very disappointed
1.0,"These are the types of socks that have threads on the inside on the opposite side of the pattern. They do not stretch. I bought them for my boyfriend, but they wouldn't even fit on my own feet, which are women's 8 1/2. I bought the men's 6-12 listing. Super cute, but can't imagine who these would fit."
1.0,It does not work unless you buy a portable charging bank.
1.0,"Not only was it too small, but it was packed poorly. I have to take it to the dry cleaners and have it pressed because it was very wrinkled. It is an XXL but its actually more like a Medium. I assume it was made in China, as past purchases from that country have been too small, including shoes."
1.0,the posts are too long and the earring falls forward.
1.0,Sizes are erratic. Ordered a XXL and it fits like a small. Had ordered a XL and it fit like a medium.
1.0,To heavy on the ear cant wear it
1.0,"Cheap, plastic type fabric. Very small. Not good quality."
1.0,"Pills incredibly!  I purchased for a trip to Alaska and wore it approximately six times.  The last five feeling like a ragamuffin.  It just &#34;sluffs&#34; off even when nothing touches it.  If I could return this, I would in a heartbeat!<br /><br />UPDATE : NOT LONG AFTER THIS THE COMPANY CONTACTED ME.  I am completely satisfied with the  customer service and would absolutely purchase again.  Sorry it has taken me so long to update too.  Sincerely."
1.0,The toes wore through after the first time I used them. Very dissapointed!
1.0,Not good for heavy breast. Did not work well with a B cup.
1.0,Ordered an XXL and its meant for a child practically.
1.0,Very flimsy not worth he money
1.0,This Sling Bag IS NOT WATERPROOF.  Used it today in the rain and everything inside got wet.  How can you advertise that it is waterproof when it is NOT...
1.0,I wanted to see if these would live up to the non-slip description and they definitely do not. I've had these on for less than 15 minutes and they've already slipped off my feet 3 times. Disappointing.
1.0,Poor quality... it looks and feels cheap... you absolutely get what you pay for!
1.0,"Doesn't fit at all like the picture, not wide at the top to hang off one shoulder, none of what's shown is how this fits on a person."
1.0,"Absolute trash. Very disappointed in this purchase. Nowhere in the description does it mention the cheap, thin plastic this badge is constructed of. My distain primarily stems from it being grotesquely overpriced. What you get would be more in line with a 99 cent price tag. If you have money to burn and just need something that looks good from afar to complete your Cowardly Lion costume it will do the trick."
1.0,love the picture
1.0,"My box was missing a gem, only three chains, one cord I couldn't use because the knots were wrong- NOT adjustable.  The wire wrapping is amateur at best"
1.0,"Let me start off by saying I wouldnt even give this 1 star. When I tell you this item is nothing like the picture,it came as a child blouse and it was grey not blue and I ordered 3X. And its totally my fault cuz I read the reviews but thought I'll give it a shot anyway. PLZ PLZ PLZ waste your time."
1.0,"Impossible to put in or use, the ball in the middle comes out completely and is impossible to pop back in, the metal is too thick to bend or widen at all and the opening is too close together to even put onto my ear or nose. The only thing that was good was the sizes would’ve been perfect and it is high quality material."
1.0,"They were too small to begin with and when washed, the reduce almost by half!"
1.0,It was in German.....
1.0,"Product description is inaccurate - the shorts are WAY too small, and are extremely awkward with a thin tight elastic. The top on the other hand was too big, and wouldn't flatter any woman. The model in the photo has to be wearing something else, because what I received was awful."
1.0,So not worth the money.  They are cute but worth about literally a quarter.  The seller must think the quaint box and packaging makes up for the crap value of these earrings.
1.0,"it is light comfort but 2 of them got broken and the glass came out for no reason, so I will not buy from you again"
1.0,sweat pants were smaller than the other pair I had ordered so I gave then to my son.
1.0,These fit when new but not after one wash.
1.0,"Smaller than advertised.  The cut is pretty, just 2 sizes too small.  The material is a little too thin for it to be this price. I'm returning it."
1.0,"I was so excited to get this shirt for my daughter that is 2. It was incredibly too big, like fitting my 12 year old niece too big."
1.0,way too pricey for something that lacks in quality
1.0,"Bought for my 4 year old son for summer vacation. The slippers very poor quality, got tears and broke after 3 weeks he used them. The return date is already over.. need to buy him something else"
1.0,"This really isn't a product review, but more of a service review. I ordered this product for work, outing,  that popped up quickly.  Amazon said two day delivery. I have Prime so I quickly ordered hoping that Amazon would come through when I needed it.  Sadly it arrived the day after I needed it.  So, I am returning it, in the nice bag it came in, without even trying it on. Looks like it would be warm."
1.0,How can one be expected to purchase a pair of shoes if you dont tell us what the size is. Come on! I looked and looked and looked. I finally gave up as this was crazy making.....
1.0,Was not pleased with this purchase. Purse started coming apart after a few weeks of use. Would not recommend.
1.0,"I ordered what’s advertised on Amazon and pictured in the screen shot, but received what’s pictured in the second picture on the piece of wood.  This is so misleading. Don’t order this unless you are trying to get picture number 2."
1.0,"It honestly didn't fit, couldn't even close around my body. It was not flattering, had 0 stretch and was completely see through.<br /> If it had fit it could have worked well but still wasn't overall what I wanted in a swimsuit cover up"
1.0,It broke within a week.
1.0,This pic showed a decorative item for A LEFT EAR.  I bought it for my left it it came for a right ear. I specifically  needed it for my left ear . I wouldnt even given this a 1 star bug it said I had to.
1.0,"I wore these one time and my hands were still cold! It was only about 30 degrees, so it doesn’t seem Ike they are very good. My hands started off cold and remained cold in the gloves...never warmed up."
1.0,Returned color was not as presented in photo.
1.0,"Was not sent full items as described, no dark brown was sent. Only light brown and black. Please resend the correct items or issue a refund thank you!"
1.0,"Are these for a babydoll head? Much too small. Unless you have a babydoll-size head, DO NOT BUY THESE!!!"
1.0,Cute toe ring. Very thin so it will break easily. If you buy it to wear never take it off. If you buy as a gift warn the recipient not to put it on and off - it will break. Had to pay half the price of this ring to get it fixed. Not worth it.
1.0,Awkwardly tight around the chest... wish I had returned it.
1.0,What is the size lol?
1.0,I was hoping to take this to a professional and have them shave my hats maybe three of them total it did not have enough to do one I will not buy this product again it's different it at first but did not do what it claims I will not recommend this to any body or for their hats as soon as you think it's done its job and you hit I was hoping to take us to it professional and have found shape my half maybe three of them total it did not have enough to do one I will not buy this product again it's definite at first but did not do what it finds I will not recommend this to you anybody or or their hats soon as you think it's done it's John and you hit a certain temperature outside it is almost as if it goes back to nothing I would almost rather use of bottle of hairspray
1.0,This product is so small. It would not fit a 10-12 size boy.  The material is listed as quick dry breathable - it feels like a regular cotton t-shirt. Very disappointed in this company. will not buy again
1.0,This is not a 48! I've ordered the belt twice and both times sent it back because the sizing is wrong.
1.0,"This is 100% not what the pic shows, I’m very disappointed even the neckline is different. This is not what I was looking for however the pic is exactly what I was looking for. The pattern and color are the same but I wanted it to be draped like the pic and I bought this with my birthday money and now am out some of my birthday money because I had no idea this was made in China. I’m not even going to bother just won’t ever order clothing off Amazon again. Don’t waste your money on things like this."
1.0,"I was so disappointed when I received these. I had high hopes they would be the same quality as the pairs I purchase at stores. They are not. I ordered the black pair. These are see through. Not just on the butt, also the legs. I brushed it off and thought for the price I'll wear around house. Then second time putting on they are peeling on the seems in the crotch and the outside leg. So they are crap. I would not recommend these to anyone. I never leave reviews, but wanted to make sure to let others know. I've purchased many pairs of this brand and they've always been high quality,  I don't think these are the real deal. Very disappointed."
1.0,Purchased item for an adult based on the description but couldn’t use the wig as it is child size.
1.0,"Cheap stretchy spandex-like material.. weird seams & buttons. The price is def too good to be true, this looks like a great knock off from a cute dress on Princess Polly but it is definitely not good quality."
1.0,Hat is just way too big doesn't fit at all
1.0,Did not work as advanced
1.0,Soooooo long.
1.0,Size was men's large
1.0,Cheap and weird. Good thing I only intend to use it as part of a Halloween costume.
1.0,I didn't have a chance to hate it... the design demands perfect/precise materials and assembly which were absent on the band I received. The part connected to the pins was not crimped perfectly and it fell apart trying to attach the watch.
1.0,Had to return...only used once and threading coming off...
1.0,This is the most ill fitting cheaply made dress I have ever had the displeasure of putting on my body.  You get what you pay for on this one...which isn’t much.
1.0,Poor material. Doesn't look like picture.
1.0,"Is a child sized item, or an extremely small framed woman"
1.0,Band is so small it will not fit a child’s wrist
1.0,Dress and sweater were made very nice material.
1.0,Terrible! Do NOT waist your money. The sole feel off the 3rd time my daughter wore these. Absolutely terrible quality. I replaced them with a pair from walmart that were cheaper and the quality was 1000% better.
1.0,"Very cute online, not attractive on the earlobe."
1.0,You have to go up a size because it runs too small.
1.0,Thought this was so cute but after my partner wore it for 2 days the magnet came off. Poor quality
1.0,"UPS scanned it as being delivered, but it was not. I was home and didn't get any packages this day from them. I was looking forward to this for the winter. The image makes it look cozy."
1.0,Terrible product. Leaked from the booties on the first use.
1.0,Ordered based on size chart and when I tried it on it was 2-3 sizes too small.  Couldnt even get to my hips!
1.0,Sizes are incorrect and are not made for a true plus size woman.  I ordered a 5XL and it fits like an Extra Large.
1.0,FELL APART IN A WEEK
1.0,Ring on the charm was broken where it was to be secured to the bracelet.  Was only $4.99 so that explains it.  Cheap price...cheap product
1.0,"This is only one handle, not a case of 6 like the description says."
1.0,"I expected more for this price.  I returned because it was very cheap looking, you can definitely find better quality elsewhere for the same price."
1.0,"I normally wear an XL comfortably and I figured it would run a little small, so I chose a XXL to be safe. It's was tiny. I let my friend try it on who normally wears a Large and it was snug on him. Unless you have a slim body, it's a no go."
1.0,"I don't know why this fabric was so clingy and uncomfortable, but it was. I wouldn't buy it again."
1.0,Sewn horribly all along the bottom edge - Fabric is so cheap it reminds me of felt used in art class as a kid. Want to return but it is not worth the effort will donate to Good Will.
1.0,"Seemed like a good winter weight shirt, but after only a few washes small holes have started appearing on the sleeve and back."
1.0,"I am unsure who the designers are designing for but, they will definitely need to go back to the drawing board in terms of sizing.<br /><br />The jacket is way too small and wouldn’t even go over my shoulders.  For the supposed sizing, it should have fit fine but what was labeled as an XXL would have been like trying to squeeze myself into a Medium.  Never gonna happen.  The material is extremely thin and doesn’t look it would have amounted to much even if it had fit.  Disappointed in the overall product.<br /><br />I would never recommend this jacket."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:3364a630f30a736f4fcdccc9d18dbbaa]] Very cute and easy to install watch band. It came as described and it was shipped out fast. I absolutely love it<br /><br />🚨UPDATE 🚨<br />The band doesn't stay close, the claps on the watch come open once every minute, I kid you not. After 1 week this thing went in the trash. Yes, it's very cute and easy to install but that's where it ends. It's pretty to look at but not functional<br /><br />☆☆☆☆☆= zero out of 5 stars, I wouldn't recommend it"
1.0,El articulo nunca me llegò
1.0,This necklace is WAY to bulky and heavy. I thought it was going to be a simple little necklace that I could wear with my bikinis but it was so big I couldn't even wear it with a regular outfit.
1.0,"Very unhappy with the sticker, after applying the sticker to my vehicle it began to curl up along the edges...the window surface was cleaned with winded and pre-treated with alcohol wipes, then allowed to dry. Within 24 hrs of application the edges curled upward."
1.0,"I thought this bra was great when I got it. I bought it because I need something that doesn't rub,because I have a high impact job which requires me to move a lot and I work 12 hour shifts. After I wore it for one day. I had rub marks under my arms and bruises as well. I will be returning this product."
1.0,These pants gave you the worst camel toe in the world and they are like a weird spandex material they feel very cheap. Not worth the price. And the pockets look terrible you can see anything you put in your pocket and it’s so bad I can’t even describe it please save yourself the headache and don’t buy
1.0,"The band looks great.  However, it will not stay connected to the Fitbit.  When I go to attach it, it comes off, therefore, this band is useless."
1.0,The material wasn't as expected.
1.0,No me hagrado por que luego se hiso orrible
1.0,This is not a muscle shirt just a regular tshirt paid 19 dollars for a regular tshirt with iron on dont buy
1.0,"The bar was too long,  couldn't put it in my ear 😔"
1.0,The blouse is very pretty but not true to size
1.0,It actually fell apart it was very cheap I understand if u cant give me a refund
1.0,Definitely not what I was expecting. Bought a medium and fits like a xtra large.
1.0,"I just received this item today and it is total crap! The finish looks terrible. The metallic paint I'm guessing they use, was all bubbled and there were visible defects all over the item (see photo). I am going to attempt to return it."
1.0,The black clip won't even open wide enough to slide over a tie. These are too wide for a skinny tie.
1.0,Quality of ring is not sterling the ring tarnished within a month of wearing it. I would not recommend this item/product/seller
1.0,Not good lenses. Can't see well with them and will hope to find my old brand I used to buy from Walmart.
1.0,Quality is good...but sizing is way off.  I am returning.
1.0,"I thought I would order a t-shirt for the big packer bears game. Read the review below and thought i would buy this shirt. Material of this shirt is 50% cotton and 50% polyester, yet feels extremely thick. The design is not stitched on shirt but is paint that has been screen printed on, unlike the review below. WHY I GAVE THIS ONLY ONE STAR the stitching of the arms/ armpits is by far the worst stitching i have ever seen. I don't have big arms or shoulder yet this is extremely tight around the armpits, i can't even breath in it. The shirt otherwise fits extremely good, fits like a slim-fit. I wear a medium in many other shirts and don't have this problem. I don't know whether I received a defective one, but am extremely disappointed in my first NFL Purchase. Just thankful for free return from Amazon."
1.0,"Ugly as homemade sin. It looks and feels cheap. Rhodium plating on sterling silver is not a bad idea, as it prevents oxidation and keeps the piece from turning black, but on this bracelet it somehow managed to look tacky instead of luxe. The magnetic clasp is weak and is clearly looking for the first opportunity to catch on something and pop open. The hinge is doomed. And it’s huge. The internal circumference on this one was greater than 7”. When it rolled along my arm (admittedly more Olive Oyl than Popeye) it sat nearer my elbow than my wrist.<br /><br />I flatter myself, perhaps, but as I am a trained bench jeweler I have to say I know whereof I speak. I don’t own electroforming equipment, so I couldn’t make something like this myself. If I had, I’d be too ashamed to admit it. I made a special trip to the UPS store today, driving uphill both ways in a blizzard, to return this unutterable piece of crap in less than 24 hours, lest it somehow corrupt the rest of my jewelry collection.<br /><br />Other than finding this waiting on my porch, I had a pretty nice day yesterday."
1.0,"Disappointed, looks bigger in the picture<br />Not worth it. Stones are on a cheap elastic band"
1.0,I can't do yoga in these. The pressure applied to the feet during yoga causes the toes to bind and pinch. I can mentioned to classmates who said they felt the same way trying to use them.
1.0,Much too large
1.0,"I order this like a month and a half ago and the offer says 60 pieces, well I just hot my little package with only 8 pieces 🤦🏼‍♀️😡"
1.0,The jewels fell out of these almost immediately.  Don’t waste your money!
1.0,I may have received a dud but this broke shortly after I got it.  Left side button fell off and it was unusable.  Was able to return but did not purchase another.
1.0,"Advertised with white tuning forks logo, came with dark logo, almost same color as cap.<br />Haven't heard from seller..."
1.0,It took almost 4 weeks to receive.  Way too long.  It is nice but a little difficult to close and open.
1.0,This dress is literally so far off of the actual picture it’s ridiculous - returning this today!
1.0,The design is upside down  so when you open the wallet the picture is upside down
1.0,Very uncomfortable on the bride of the nose and does not keep water out.
1.0,"I give this product two stars because the design of the dress is the same, but the material is thin and shiny 😐. On the model she doesn’t have a bra on and the dress is staying up, that is not the case. With a bra on the sleeveless arm does not stay up. The bow isn’t a bow, it’s just a piece of material tucked in a loop 🙄 and the description says that the color is a little off, well my dress looks like pepto bismol pink 😒. I am disappointed because I was going to wear this dress to a wedding, but it looks more trashy then classy. I guess I will take this as a lost and keep looking. Please don’t purchase the dress, you will be disappointed."
1.0,Beautiful camisoles but run VERY small for the size indicated!!  I will have to return them.
1.0,Awful material sticks on your body nothing like the picture
1.0,Material was terrible and the fit wasn’t good either around the chest. Not what I expected.
1.0,The shirt did not fit despite me ordering 2 sizes bigger. Donated to Goodwill.
1.0,"The straps keep falling off my shoulders and the Left leg seam is damaged,  the seam is split and the stitching shows.  I would like to return for a smaller size and undamaged item.  There is no where to print a label for return,  please help me.  This is getting annoying because there is no where to print a label for return."
1.0,"Got this as a gift.  Looks cute in the dark. But in the light super faded. Looks like I have warn and washed 1,000 times. Very disappointed"
1.0,"Do not buy this!!! First, see the seller’s picture as advertised as red plaid, whereas in real life it’s just a black mask with tiny red squares. It’s looks bad. Secondly, I ordered this mask back in December 22nd, I just got it yesterday. It is currently February."
1.0,These are horrible and cheap and a complete waste of money. They DO NOT fit the ear like the picture.  Don't order these.
1.0,Earring looked cute but it broke right away when I tried to wear it. Very disappointed.
1.0,Cheap never even worked so never worn once.
1.0,"Shoe was not stable and could not adjust the strap. Rather than deal with returning the product, I gave them away."
1.0,"I returned this. The shoulder part of this fit weird, too small, almost like it was for a little girl."
1.0,Lots of glare. Lenses looked dirty even when they weren’t. Very distracting to see through.<br />Although I loved the look.
1.0,"Too small, not made well, flimsy poorly made, not worth the price.<br /> Bag was seen as brown but black bag arrived instead so poor color description."
1.0,Only worn twice & velcro detached
1.0,I received this product a week later than the expected date. I opened it up only to find that the band snap is broken and on top of that its non-returnable. So I just lost out on money I paid for it.
1.0,The “energy” you feel from this pendant is radioactive exposure to Thorium…
1.0,I was upset but dint fit on my watch
1.0,"I purchased a size 2X(XXL). I usually wear an XL for a  loose fit. Therefore, I ordered this one size larger, hoping it would have lots of extra room. Nope! It’s a snug fit!!<br />Also, it’s not the same material as the sales photo, or the same stitching. False advertisement."
1.0,It's very cute but disproportionate so that the only way you can see the sheep is to have it completely over your head or bunched up around your face.
1.0,such a waste of time to wait for
1.0,Ordered large. Had nice long fingers but tight fit. I have an iPhone 6. Gloves did not work on touch screen.
1.0,"The color was a mustard yellow-gold. And, not my favorite color."
1.0,"It was really rusty and i know it's not real gold but it had some black out lined, anyway its not like the picture i had to bend it in order to actually fit my ear, but i dont wear it anyways. Not worth the money too be honest"
1.0,Everyone of them had one or both straps popped off in an attempt to put them on!!!
1.0,I ordered this for my dad for his birthday and it's trash. It could be a toy for my 3 year old. I ordered 17 inches and got 13. It wouldn't fit even if was actually stainless steel and thick enough for a man's wallet. Im extremely disappointed.
1.0,"This ring is beautiful in person. I was so pleased when it arrived. But within an hour of wearing it, a stone had already fallen out. Not durable at all."
1.0,"Would not recommend, they broke the first week I got them."
1.0,"Cute and soft but really poor quality.  Loose threads on first time wearing it. I'm afraid to wash it, looks like it will disintegrate."
1.0,"Awful! If I could rate zero stars I would! Flimsy, cheap garbage"
1.0,I love your dresses ... but I was sent the wrong one
1.0,"LESS than 50% of the lights worked!!  A fun idea, but very disappointing.  Hard to believe there was an average of four stars.<br />Where can I dispose of those that don't work?  Little batteries inside???"
1.0,"half star available?  UGLY, UGLY, TACKY DRESS.  looks like a horrible 90s dress.  i plan to return it, if i can."
1.0,Cheaply made. Mine came with the back earring post broken off.
1.0,I’m 5’5 and the pants cam up far above my navel. I did not like the fit.
1.0,Battery never worked - so I have to replace it before I even get to wear it. No instructions come with the watch and couldn’t any online to set the various settings.
1.0,The top was too revealing and open. The shoulders kept slipping off. The bottoms fit fine.
1.0,"The hardware that holds the strap, broke the very 1st time I used it, to make matters worse I keep trying to get ahold of the company and ask them if we can just exchange. No one ever replied from the company. So I LOVED THE LOOK OF THIS BAG SO MUCH!! However, the company has Terrible customer service, and must have used sub standard hardware. I REALLY was so excited to get this in the mail...I'm a purse and bag collector, my husband calls it an addiction  so this bag got me excited when I saw it on another web site, plus on TV. It's great looking, just cheaply made, I'm so sad to say that...I hardly give such a low rating but their customer service and hardware deserves it."
1.0,Broke after 2 hours of wearing.
1.0,Fits well and super cute! But they arrived with the entire right side split in half! I assume some fatty who has Prime wardrobe split them and sent them back. The company thought it was okay to send them split in half! I see other reviews saying the same thing!<br />I contacted the company with no reply!<br />I would order again but I don't know if I will get a repeat of this problem! I do not have time to send them back!
1.0,One of the earrings came bent and misshapen. I returned them for a refund less the $4.00 I spent on return shipping. I was very disappointed that they were shipped out like that as they looked really cute and had good reviews.
1.0,The sleeves measures 13 inches.  Way to small. This will be returned.
1.0,Zipper broke the first time I tried it on. Company wouldn’t return it.
1.0,I dont know what hapened but this is what i got from them and its too late now as i am getting married 6 hours from home in less than 48 hours. Very upsetting.
1.0,Nothing it’s no good you guys don’t know. Sizes
1.0,"Not suitable for any workout, poor material , not flattering at all"
1.0,Shipped back!!  It didn't fit.  The should were too short.
1.0,Returning item face and band completely different colors. Face was cracked when received box wasn't damaged any. Cheaply made
1.0,Not like the pic at all
1.0,The ring I received is nowhere near as good looking as what was advertised. The metal is all dull and it looks like someone just shoved the into the ring. Someone else said that the maze was etched into theirs and not set as mine is terribly done. I wouldn't be surprised if pliers or a hammer were used with how bent the maze is and that part of it still sticks out. Goodbye my two dollars!(not a big loss)
1.0,It looks too cheap. And the color is very diferent
1.0,Said it was cotton/linen. Definitely polyester.
1.0,"Granted, I'm 5' 9""...however, this blouse has an empire waist line inches from the neckline.  The bottom of this blouse comes slightly above my hip.  If you are 5' or shorter, this blouse could be your new dress."
1.0,Ordered up it fit in chest fine but the waist is cut very small
1.0,These were discolored & way too small. Not what you want if your looking for something warm for winter! Mine arrived & the white ones had a large purple stain on them & the other pair were 2 totally different lengths. Best to buy leg warmers by looking at them!  That said there was no problem at all returning them.
1.0,It actually looks very nice and super shiny. The Medal is weak and it detaches easily.
1.0,"Straight out of box, my kid tried on and the tounge on one sneaker just.. fell out.  He insisted he liked them and wanted to wear anyway ..so, whatever.  A few days later 2 of the shoelace holders.. the white rings on sneaker, were ripped off and floating. I'm really annoyed at the &#34;high quality &#34; mentions.  It's bad luck to lie.  I got him awesome kangaroos with pocket and all- for less!  So, yeah. These are ok if they are $4."
1.0,"The only thing that was correct was the color and it was a 2 piece pants set. It was not the material I thought, the top was not baggy, it was a regular grey top that zipped down the back! Not sure if that is part of the design pictured…but I kept it bc it still fit."
1.0,These gloves are NOT WATERPROOF WHATSOEVER they are hand sponges. Just soaks in the water and retains it while your hands freeze.
1.0,Returned. Doesn't fit well at all.
1.0,I’m not a usual plastic jewelry purchaser so I wasn’t sure what to expect. I suppose they serve the purpose of keeping ppl from infections and worth it if you get sick. But I’m not sold on this assortment of plasticware for your face. Reminds me of a picnic lol
1.0,"Not very happy with this purchase. I realized the pendant was going to be small, but for the cost, I didn't think it was going to be that small...I actually had to use a magnifying glass to look at it...Instead of the Sword of Saint Michael, it looks more like a stick pin. I was actually going to return it for a refund, but the person I purchased it for, liked it, so I gave it to her."
1.0,"This XXL polo has nice design, that is where it stops. I’m 6’1” and 235 and it wouldn’t fit my 12 yr old grandson, who is of normal<br />Size and weight!!!!! What a waste of time and energy"
1.0,They are cheaply made. I've had every pair I have worn break.
1.0,So my kid wore these one time to a birthday party (the red ones) and they ripped from front to back. He was extremely embarrassed and almost in tears. Luckily I brought both pairs in case another kid needed some. He changed in the car and the blue one held up thru the party but some how didn’t survive the washing machine.
1.0,1.) The colors shown are not the ones sent to me.<br />2.) The photos shown sure portray a larger item. Or the models used are smaller than real life. I cannot do much with these--just use them as neck warmers!  Not recommended.
1.0,"I ordered a size bigger according the their size chart. They are too short, and I'm sure my shins are well within the measurements. They are not comfortable then they squeeze the wrong parts of your legs."
1.0,"Weird fit, very small."
1.0,"Fabric is lovely and thick, very  soft. BUT it's like the top and bottom parts were two separate parts that are sewn together leaving a thick seam around your leg. you can turn them inside out but it still weighs down the leg warmer & doesn't look all that nice. I gave them to my friend who is not so picky ,but really, it's not just one piece like other leg warmers that I've bought so rather disappointed"
1.0,Theirs no room for alterations
1.0,To small around back area
1.0,This jacket is very cheaply made. It looks good online but the fit was off and it looks like something I made in sewing class years ago. I was very disappointed.
1.0,Broken before use...
1.0,"Cheaply made. Very thin, shinny material. The upside, they are comfortable but I don't believe they will last.  I would never wear them at yoga, I would be afraid the seems would open."
1.0,I'm disappointed in the fabric. It's more like a Jersey knit tshirt fabric. I was excepting a better quality fabric. Probably gonna return it.
1.0,The pants are really cute but they run ridiculously small.
1.0,"Practically impossible to adjust the wristband and when we finally did it broke!!  Piece of junk!  Unfortunately, I couldn't give it less than 1 star."
1.0,"Nunca llego a tiempo y me cobraron y no me devuelven mi dinero, son unos ladrones"
1.0,The plus size sizes are not plus size at all. 1x fit like a medium
1.0,They where to tight and didn't stay up.
1.0,"This shirt looks cute in theory but it doesn’t work.<br />First off it’s way too small and short. It’s not even a crop top style but it looks like a boxy kids shirt. You can’t tell which is the front and which is the back and the material is cheap. The tie neck just doesn’t work, it’s much too small.<br />I’m 140 lbs and ordered a large. It looks like a xsmall.<br />Returning for sure."
1.0,"Color is off, the checker pattern is a lot bigger than what they advertise, you only get 1 piece when you order so make sure to order 2. They don't make this apparent."
1.0,Came with what looks like ink stains on them
1.0,"beads are plastic,  dont but"
1.0,Tarnished at delivery cheap!
1.0,"ORDERED THE TWO PAIR EARRINGS ONE SHORT AND ONE LONG CHAIN AS SHOWN IN PICTURE, WHAT GOT WAS TWO PAIR OF SHORT CHAINED EARRINGS. I THINK A REPLACEMENT OR REFUND IS IN ORDER."
1.0,"Yes they are summer weight. Unfortunately they were too big (I ordered according to size guide). They are very cheap (hence the low price for 6!) They are not silky at all, they sag (ankle, knee etc.) By the end of the work day I just wanted to rip them off and trash them!"
1.0,Zipper broke several weeks after purchase. Stitching frayed and separated zipper from bag. Very thin plasticy material.<br />Bought it for light use—-holding makeup extras at camper. Would not recommend fordsu to day or at all.
1.0,"Even after reading the sizing reviews, I ordered a size up, hoping it would fit well, and it didn't.  It looks so cute in the pictures and I was so excited, but I can't even wear it. And it's very disappointing."
1.0,Low support<br />I can’t even fell the insole<br />It feels like a regular insole without any king of support
1.0,Way to small. Trying to return but the seller will not contact me/return my emails
1.0,Very cheap! I write reviews if I am extremely happy or extremely sad! This item is dangerous!!! Do not buy it gives allergy for kids!!
1.0,The top I received looks absolutely nothing like the top in the picture.
1.0,Cheap....not made well.....guess I'll use them as slipperz.
1.0,Poor quality and the size was way to small. I ordered an XL for my 14 year old nephew and the fit looked more like a M. The fabric was thin and scratchy.
1.0,"I was so excited about these - they are cute earrings and really had potential. But they are entirely plastic and arrived broken and with one of the ""metal"" (plastic) pieces totally mangled beyond repair. Now I am stuck with the hassle and annoyance of returning an item that is only worth $8. They also went down in price immediately after I purchased them, so overall I am really not thrilled with this company. Had they not been totally mangled, 4 or 5 stars."
1.0,Returned them. The hot pink is a dusty pink. Yuck.
1.0,The size of these mustache rings are ridiculously too small! They would be cute if they were made to fit a human septum! Waste of money and time.
1.0,Hi - this item is extremely poor quality. the back plastic fastener came off the hat before my daughter even had a chance to wear it and now we have passed the return window.
1.0,"After months of trying to get the stink out of these, i have given up. These are quite heavy and i dont want to lose more in shipping expenses to return.  The smell is so awful i have to leave thses outdoors. No amountbof sunshine or vinegar is reducing the stench.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE!"
1.0,This dresss is not at all the same dress  ddescribe in the photo it was a complete shame
1.0,Constantly sliding down my nose if I bend over they fall off my face and they don't block much sun I also didn't like that someone looking at me can see my eyes still but the style is super cute I wanted to love these
1.0,The plaid pattern was cut and sewn crooked and lined up at different angles for every section of the skirt. Looked like a complete mess and was so distracting it barely even looked like a plaid pattern.
1.0,the description says its sparkly but its not!  It looks like dots.
1.0,"The color is DEFINITELY not red. Bright coral, really bright!"
1.0,Gave it as a gift to my daughter and it broke in less than a month.
1.0,"Had to return it, because it did not fully inflate."
1.0,Very upset 5 year old...she didn’t get a chance to wear her sandals this summer because the shoe strap popped while trying them on.
1.0,If you are NOT a little women do not buy!!!!
1.0,I didn’t get what I expected
1.0,"Don't let my title confuse you, the only good thing about this shoe is the slip resistant.<br />When I was using this during my cleaning job I wanted to test how water proof it says it was, so I hoes the tip of it being amazed by the water slide off than I put it on.<br />During my shift I noticed my feet feel a little wet so I check and didn't find what was wrong.<br />Until I put more weight on one foot and like squeezing a sponge a large amount of water washed over my sock.<br /><br />Tl:dr don't buy this product."
1.0,Material was to thin I would like a refund but gift card instead because I don’t have the old card
1.0,"WORSE BRA.......EVER! Even more ill-fitting than Victoria Secret’s bras. I’m a petite person, usually wear a natural 34D and went by the reviews and ordered up. I even went to the makers website to confirm my sizing. The bra is so odd and does not give side coverage. So disappointed."
1.0,Had this 1 day and it broke. The band broke.
1.0,"Broke repeatedly, definitely returning"
1.0,"Always love the look of this dress so I ordered it! Surprised by the sizing, most of all. It fits funny in the waist, almost small but tolerable, and despite my large bust the top is huge and has no support, straps or elastic. Disappointed by the size proportioning!!"
1.0,"Horrible quality! I ordered an XL, it came in super duper small. I put it over my shoulder and the seams ripped."
1.0,Ehhh not what I expected
1.0,"I ordered a new Minimialist watch from the Originalgrain.com website directly.  It didn't work, right out of the box!  I just notified them via Facebook, but that's 100% unacceptable.  If they don't make it right, I'll just file a claim through the credit card company, and let them deal with it.  Not a good showing at all for th efirst purchase I've made with them.  :("
1.0,I recieved mother mother only not as it says ruin my Christmas present
1.0,I don't like it all actually going to return it!!  Very cheap fabric!!
1.0,Doesn't work - not even a little bit. Sending back for refund.
1.0,It was tiny. The clasp was broken and so tiny you couldn’t fasten it or make it close. It was shaped like no clasp I’ve ever seen. I returned it instantly
1.0,They were very tight on upper arm and rolled down.
1.0,"This was a extremely low quality product. Do not purchase, it's a lot different than the picture..I returned this."
1.0,"My daughter brought these for herself and they look nothing like shown, don't bother!"
1.0,"I am distrougt at how poor this product is. I got this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas, it only lasted less than 2 weeks. It broke my heart to know that the light broke, because of how exited she was when she received them as a gift. I am truly and honeslty disapointed. I will not ever be purchasig form this seller again."
1.0,"I bought these, along with 5 other brands for a wedding event. I'm a size 28(US) and I'm between a B and C cup, the actual sticky part that goes on your boob stays well however trying to join the clasp in the middle but it wasn't going to happen. Removal was simple enough, didn't hurt. However, they didn't work for what I needed."
1.0,This dress is described as polyester but it is made of cotton. It’s clingy and not like described!
1.0,Break in a day
1.0,I ordered this product and was extremely excited to get it as I work in restaurants and wanted to add a bit of flare to my tie clip game. When it came in the fork and knife were bent into a 90 degree angle. I gently tried bending it back and got half way before the clip snapped in half. I would not recommend this purchase
1.0,"Arrived with 1 arm off. When I put it back on , a lens fell out. Returned."
1.0,Horrible. It broke as soon as I placed it around my neck. Very cheap material.
1.0,"I had ordered one of these on amazon before and it worked well. This one with this company, however, sucks. The edges begin to peel back within the first wear. I went back and found my original order was with “Trunkier Backless Strapless Bra“ and I recommend them over this company entirely. I would return if i could"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:26659b85ef810e4d70b0ebae7412c9ac]] The tourbillion gear doesn't turn. Not sure if it's just mine doesn't turn.
1.0,"These were advertised as fitting my glasses, but the lenses fall out when you go to wipe them down."
1.0,Did not like this product. The quality looked cheaped and was way too traditional. The process to return was quick and easy - kudos to customer service.
1.0,not anything like I expecte
1.0,"Got the watch, the snap broke within five minutes.  time slows.  not worth buying a new battery for it.  Wasted one cent and $5 shipping"
1.0,"I haven’t used this outfit yet but considering returning it. The package was suppose to have the dress, coat and hat. When I opened the package, all that was there was the dress and the hat.  When purchasing an entire outfit for a party. You expect to receive everything. Now here I go trying to find something else since I do not have a full outfit for my party."
1.0,The chain is way too long the charm is nice but now I’ll have to buy a new chain and transfer the charm over :(
1.0,"Sorry, but this is not made very well, I (wife) know the price should have given that away but to be honest I thought maybe it would be fairly ok, however the edges all the way around the bottom are very scratchy and the straps as well, and the materiel is very thin."
1.0,The socks have a seam right across the toes that forces it to rub on the toes when worn with shoes. I can't wear them with shoes. They are not designed very well.
1.0,"I ordered according to the sizing guide and the one shoulder arm hole is too small, the chest too big with the boning awkwardly placed in the center, the zipper is crap and the waist too small. I lift my right arm and my whole breast is out. Can't zip the dress with it on, can't zip it when it's off. *update* even after all my alterations, the dress was garbage. My zipper got stuck and busted all the way down so I had to be sewn into it and then during the reception the dress ripped in 2 more spots."
1.0,It<br />never change colors it stay blue or purple very disappointing  both
1.0,Material was very scratchy and uncomfortable. Style was boxy and unflattering. Color was so far off from what was pictured that I thought they sent me the wrong one -- picture shows a medium green; received an olive colored sweater that was so dark it was almost charcoal colored. Returned.
1.0,I love the color and fabric but the top strip was stitched so poorly I couldn’t even wear it. I returned it
1.0,Way too small. Fit me like a shirt
1.0,I didn't expect the earing to be this small.  One of the back piece also came broken......
1.0,The glasses were not what I expected then on top of that they were broken and no case to secure them in ....The cost of the glasses were 315.00 dollars!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!
1.0,terrible quality and wrong dimensional grid
1.0,Love the look of the earrings . Unfortunately I can't wear them because the arrived broken.
1.0,Broke the first time I wore it
1.0,"This is flimsily made, the color isn't even close to what I expected. The front panels are super long, and the panty area is so narrow that I'm afraid to wear it in public. I'd send it back, but the shipping was going to be more than the price of the bathing suit."
1.0,"Not working as any gloves should be. I wear it at around +5 - +10 degree of Centigrade (+45 - +56 .Fahrenheit) even when they are dry. Sure, it is somewhat waterproof, but they don't warm your hands at all. When I took them off, I felt that my hands are much warmer without them at that temperature. So, just don't waste your money."
1.0,One of the earrings came BROKEN. The water droplet part cracked from the silver plating :(
1.0,Did not like the quality of the fabric at all.
1.0,"The dress was beautiful, however it was too small."
1.0,completely fell apart after a few weeks
1.0,"This thing is about a foot long,and the print takes up the entire mask, so no way possible to wear it with sheep displayed like in picture,unless you literally wear it all the way over your face."
1.0,"It is not leather, mine was with rounded golden buckle - it is made of PU. Be aware!"
1.0,Wide in the torso
1.0,to small seller warned that they are small
1.0,Very pretty bag but it was just too stiff!
1.0,Got the size 3 for my 8 yr old but almost for one time use. Not worth the price at all as far as comfort and longevity is thumbs down. He splashed in a puddle so one shoe stopped working. The wire to turn on the lights is where u pull your shoe up so that got torn off. Didn’t last a week.<br /><br />My other sons shoes lights still work but the cushion inside wears off to which is just plastic. Not comfortable but he wears them when he can’t find his other pair of shoes.
1.0,They are definitely see through. I couldn’t walk around and just be normal in these. Also came with a hole in the crack. I tried another from this company got the same size just different pattern and way too big. Requested a refund and have heard nothing.
1.0,They advertise multiple pictures of the size of these being large. Absolute rubbish. They are maybe 1.5 in. DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT THE LARGE EARINGS ADVERTISED in the pics.
1.0,Necklace is well made but it isn’t leather or close to it . It is a corded fabric material
1.0,this was a real shame .I was looking forward to wearing these shirts but when they came even though they were tagged XXL they were almost a childs size or an adult large. So i had to send them back.And instead of reordering them my hesitancy made me go elsewhere.Such is life. Thank you for the opportunity to let you know what happened.JamesSpiazzi
1.0,My husband is 6 foot tall and it barely made it to his waist. Belly shirt for sure!
1.0,"Absolutely horrific! Cheap. A child must have cut the cut outs? Not hemmed, raw edges frayed. Want my money back. Do not buy. Bad workmanship. I can’t anything good.wrong color orange not purple"
1.0,"Cute design, but the hoop was very big. Not an everyday casual cute."
1.0,Material was very poor quality.  Thin cheap fabric and see through. I’m very disappointed.
1.0,"References/sizing suggestions were misleading! This dress fit tight all around. No loose sleeves. No flow at the waist line. It is beautifully made. Soft material with stretch to it. However, the plaid design got distorted when it stretched over my bust. I was looking for a dress that fit loosely not tight, with more flow at the waist.<br />Maybe this works for someone else."
1.0,"Plastic is very brittle,they snapped after only a few weeks"
1.0,Order a much larger size than you normally wear. These run really small.
1.0,"It looked good on me, but I found the blur on the right. I had to return it to the store. I would give it 5 stars, but it is one, sorry.☹️"
1.0,I purchased the titanium 20g hoop but received a surgical steel one. My skin is sensitive and I can only wear titanium so I'm having to send it back.
1.0,AMAZON made good and overnighted me a pair of the same lined in Silk instead of cashmere so I got the lady's present day before Christmas.  What could be better?  She loves them!
1.0,Writing is faded not bright enough.
1.0,they sent it to me broke!!!! and the battery was dead!
1.0,"Even though a great price, the lenses appear to be imperfect and they give me a headache each time I try to wear them."
1.0,I ordered a dress that was supposed to have sleeves and a belt...I got a spaghetti strap dress that fit bad and came with no belt. This will be going back...
1.0,"This hat arrived with a bent brim,loose stash and also has a faded mark on the side. It looks like it has been worn.<br />Spend your money elsewhere."
1.0,"Not what I expected at all. Material feels very cheap. I'm normally a medium, but ordered a large to be comfy..they're tight lol also colors aren't what they show. Will be returning...bummer! :("
1.0,"It broke automatically, only had it one for a day"
1.0,It runs big and I'm 5'2 and weigh about 136 pounds.i got a small but there was no extra small so I had to return it
1.0,These are very cheap and will not hold shape
1.0,Very very small.  Especially around biceps.  Impossible to put on
1.0,Horrible quality and to small
1.0,I was very excited when I stepped onto the grass and my heals didn't sink into the grass.....but I also had to walk on pavement and small gravel and that is when the problems began. The plastic is so thin that my heels broke through the protectors. I am just lucky that the heels weren't ruined because it was difficult to pull the heel protectors off as they had worked half-way up the heel. The product needs to be made with stronger plastic.
1.0,The stop is way too small to cover calf with clothing (because who wants wet pant legs).
1.0,"Washed the shirt twice, and it shrunk to the point it fits my oldest child."
1.0,The sorority lettering g is backwards.<br />I cannot wear this scarf.
1.0,Do not buy this umbrella!  It looks nice but it is hard to open and close.  It literally flies out of your hands whenever you press the open button.  I have 2 gashes on my index finger as a result. I had to throw it away.
1.0,"Bought brand new n they came like this,  ordered XL n came xs, used,  n torn,  I miss placed it n can't send them back,  my wife probably threw it away because it look like homeless man socks"
1.0,Manufacturer Really??!! The top fits nicely. The pants are the problem…..They’re too short and they do NOT fit like leggings. They’re supposed to be fitted and tight at the bottom of the pants at the ankle. Instead they flare out which make them look even worse. Why would you half step on the pants!?? Very disappointed. Thought about taking to a seamstress to do it correctly but why should I have to pay additional money?? I’m returning.
1.0,"This shirt is really cute... for 10 mins.... at min 11 this sis starts riding up like bored shorts down a water slide until it reaches its final destination around your neck like an adult baby bib. Trying to renegotiate it back to a semblance of modesty can only be achieved by completely removing the garment. Hit that reset button ma'am, you got 10 mins until lift off."
1.0,You'll pay $2.50 a piece for about 2 cents worth of material that is disintegrating by the time it gets to you.. Save your money.
1.0,"They are smaller than pictured, came in damaged, the paint feel is unpleasant and unevenly painted."
1.0,Order canceled
1.0,Dont look as good as pictures
1.0,It's kind of like a shirt your mom had to make for a school play or Halloween costume that wasn't going to be seen up close.  Gave it away.
1.0,"This shirt is NOT as pictured. It's ORANGE not Peach and very SHORT, not long as seen in the picture. The fabric is very sheer and cheep,<br /> and has a bumpy texture. Thankfully it's free returns!"
1.0,Based o  reviews I was hoping these would work and not slip. Normally when i buy less they last a few wears and then start slipping because of being stretched out. These slipped on the first outing. Horrible product.
1.0,Horrible wrong size not happy!!!!!
1.0,I was excited to get this. I needed for a bracelet I had. I was so disappointed when it broke right away. The clasp broke and the only way I could use it was to open the one ring and then close it with oilers.
1.0,This hat came in a envelope the hat was completely crushed flat. Do not buy this product.
1.0,I wanted tabi socks I could wear with regular shoes so I can come home kick them off and slide into flip flops. These are too thick for the regular shoes. Other than that seem fine but for me useless.
1.0,"This dress is huge! Really disappointing,  the small fits like a large! Had to return:("
1.0,"Definitely worth a lot less than selling price. It was so see through, thin but very breathable. I had to return it."
1.0,VERY UNHAPPY as this was to be a gift for my daughter this coming weekend.  Now I'll have to go find something else.
1.0,Tore on first time of use.
1.0,"Horrible dress, horrible color, super long, doesn’t fit right, total disaster, returning this ASAP"
1.0,Not worth the money. Earrings immediately broke
1.0,The dress did not work for me. The seller is a third party vendor and therefor the dress can not be returned through amazon. It has to returned directly to the seller. I returned the dress almost three months ago and never received my refund. Do not recommend buying from this seller.
1.0,Bottom  fit good but top is more like a size dd bra ... and i dont have small breast either
1.0,Buyer beware!
1.0,Cheap and very  light like a Peice of Aluminum Foil. You can barely see the colors.
1.0,"Shopping online is just so convenient, but this product is a prime example of why you should not buy clothes online. From the photo, it looked like the shirt was similar to the Portofino Shirts from Express, which I absolutely enjoy wearing. I received the package, felt and saw the clothing material, put it right back in the packaging and sent it back. The material is rough and flimsy, and my coworker who saw me open the package mentioned that it felt like a 'cheap jersey material.' My expectations were NOT high because of the price point, and it still disappointed me. For $15, you can go to Ross/TJ Max/Marshalls/Nordstrom Rack and buy a much nicer quality shirt than this disappointment, so don't waste your time and money."
1.0,This item wasn’t my style so when I went to return it they charged me 10$. Bad way to do business
1.0,I ordered the 5-pack in the larger size 9-10 men. I received a 4-pack in a smaller size. I returned for replacement and still got a 4-pack. The quality is okay. Thinner than I expected. Don’t order the 5-pack.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:3317f2a117315759d5f4a0ca949dcd9e]] El color Es diferente a como se ve
1.0,Gets tangled super easy
1.0,This is and feels more like a robe than a sweater! Have not even wore it was going to send back but ran out of time.
1.0,"The edges are sharp and uncomfortable to wear. Ordered 2 size 10 rings and they are different sizes despite being labeled as the same size. Only intended for fashion purposes, but an uncomfortable wear to say the least."
1.0,Completely worthless for driving. Can just be used as regular sunglasses.
1.0,I washed them one time and they shrunk from a 2x to a xl. I didn’t want to use them as hand towels.  Wanted to wear them. Don’t buy!
1.0,No me quedo como esperaba pedí mi taya mediano .y muy grande
1.0,Based on the pictures I thought these were a pair of earrings as it does show two. Now I’m just tossing it in the garbage as one does me no good.
1.0,Just go to a jewelry store
1.0,The product doesn’t look as good as the picture looks like someone drew it on with a sharpie not worth the wait
1.0,Mala calidad del material de quebró en el primer uso.
1.0,"Zippers broke on largest and medium cube. All on the right side of the cube. Very flimsy product. I went for the price, gambled and lost."
1.0,"Just purchased this and received it today. It was perfect length for the arms, but it was severely short. I cant wear it at all. If I'm able to get about 8 inches longer I'd be fine with that, but I would like a refund at this point. Very disappointed because the shirt is so cute."
1.0,"Dress fits okay, but not as cute or flattering at all compared to pictures. Tie around the waist looks absolutely nothing like pictures, is wicked short like it belongs with a dress 3 times smaller. Tie so short can't even tie it in as bow. Looks stupid with the dress and dress is very plain and boring without."
1.0,Came with a bad smell.
1.0,"I was so excited to receive this necklace, but was so disappointed when it arrived. It took a very long time to arrive too.<br /><br />This necklace does not look exactly like in the photo. The colors are not as vibrant and it looks incredibly gaudy.<br /><br />I gave it away. Also, the earring posts arrived bent!<br /><br />Do not bother. Save your money and time spent waiting."
1.0,"Cute idea for the dress, however, the quality is lacking. Not the most flattering."
1.0,my child along with another child were both cold.  This doesn't prevent water from seeping into the skin.  unable to return passed the 30 days limit
1.0,Don’t buy. The magnetic hasp came loose on the second day of casual wear and it’s now LOST! I wasted the money
1.0,"I ordered the ruby earrings and they are not ruby-colored at all, they are a light pink. I am returning them."
1.0,This is not an adult sized cap
1.0,If itsits meant for a baby or toddler then why can my 6 year sister year them perfectly they are advertised  wrong
1.0,I don’t like it at all. It looks really cheap. Both of the screws on the glass came somewhere loose! Not worth the money. Don’t get it
1.0,"This product looks good but is trash! I ordered two, gave one as a gift. They both worked great for about two days and then started strobing uncontrollably and would not shut off without pulling the batteries. I sent them back and received two replacements hoping the first was just a dud, nope. The replacement didn’t even last a day before doing the same thing. Don’t waste your money!"
1.0,The dress is beautiful  but it has alot of static and sticks to your body.
1.0,Really liked this item but came with air bubbles in the front ordered a replacement with hopes it wouldn't have the same problem...eeh I was wrong had a bigger air bubble...sad returned both for a full refund.
1.0,"I wanted to love the shorts.  Everything was great to me. The length, the feel, and the waistband. I had to return because of the inseam being way to long."
1.0,I got size 7 for my boy that wears 6 and still too small. Pants were too short!
1.0,"The pictured item was not what I received.  Instead of a &#34;watercolor-like&#34; blend of these colors, I received a typical Oriental silk scarf with distinct outlines of each of the flowers-----nothing like the scarf pictured.  Would not order from this seller again because of this deception."
1.0,Made in an A line design and very large!!! Which made the belt didn't fit correctly either.  I personally didn't like the way it fit.
1.0,very small rings
1.0,These are NOT SUEDE as described. They're made of a sueded microfiber and done as cheaply as possible. Go ahead and pay more to get better quality. These are an epic fail.
1.0,"One of the earrings beads are strung so tightly they've all bunched up & look awful. However, they're also too big for my preference. I'm not returning them because I've decided to make the ""good"" earring into a pendant. I love it!"
1.0,"Quality is very cheap, plus it took several weeks to arrive and was super oversized"
1.0,"this product doesn't make sense, just a regular piece of material, no instructions."
1.0,Didn't last. Barely putting it on and came apart
1.0,"Beware of sizing. I’m a pretty average large (American large), and I’m 90% positive that this is an Asian large. This was more like a smaller medium than a large. Returned."
1.0,Not worth the embarrassment of putting it on and having it fall apart right away.  I would not recommend the product
1.0,"Unfortunately, this item looked nothing like the photo for it. I purchased the long, to the ground black coverup.  It looked like it would be long to the ground and flowy, instead it came right to the top  of my knee. I ordered up a size and it was very small. It wouldn’t even come together at the front. I would need about 3 more inches to tie the little strings in front to close it. It almost felt like it was made for a child. I’m not tall, (5’5 and 120 lbs) so I don’t understand why the fit was so off."
1.0,The fabric was not stretched at all. The bottom was too small and top was too big..
1.0,Color dark brown in pictures... light brown received
1.0,Did not get what was pictured very disappointed
1.0,"Did not appear as the picture shows, it wasn't as detailed or as shiny, I sent it back.  Didn't seem worth the cost to me."
1.0,I'm an 8 and the XL was so tight! Not comfortable at all. Probably better for someone smaller than an 8.
1.0,Don't waste your money!!!!
1.0,Bad product the writing was completely cut off
1.0,Fell apart after 2 weeks!
1.0,Writing on my boyfriend's account. This dress was way too large and just looked frumpy. I am 5'4 125 pounds 32B and got the smallest size available.
1.0,Laser tattoo removal cheap and not safe
1.0,"I know these didn't cost much, but frankly I threw them away. They are not even worth the cheap price. Don't waste your money."
1.0,The material and the size are not what it appears.  I am incredibly disappointed in this item.
1.0,"The price just seemed too good so I had to try them out. Fit is decent. I’m 6 foot and a thick 215. Always a lil challenging finding something that comfortably fits my legs and rear. So for 10 or 12 bucks no big deal. I can easily deal with the fit. What was disappointing was the rear pocket zipper didn’t last one opening before it came off the tracks. So now rear pocket won’t close. This was after one wash in cold water and delicate, once removed from the wash the seems on the compression shorts on the right leg has completely come undone… don’t waste your time or money."
1.0,"This is a scam, although the image shows the full kit with flex shaft and lubricant this is only the brushes for three times the price. Beware!"
1.0,Y’all listen when I tell you these rings are miniature. They are misleading!! My baby is one and they are still to small for him. The wings are not for adults more like newborns and the feathers stick you so be careful if you do decide to purchase them for your newborn. For real y’all listen to me! These wings are super super small! I’m returning them because I can’t use them. Big disappointment!
1.0,"Bought a little over a month, wore it once and now the color is bronze all the silver is gone."
1.0,"Ugly awful ,nothing like picture"
1.0,Cheap... Would not recommend at all...
1.0,The design is not as shown in photo. Bottom is straight and cinched. Uncomfortable fit.
1.0,"First off, its not silver. Its cheap and broke as soon as I tried to put it on. It took forever to get. Do not buy! I am sorely disappointed in this cheap garbage."
1.0,"I was very upset when I tried these on.  They looked really pretty but for boots that are wide calf, I couldn't even zip it past my ankles.  I'm returning them."
1.0,The umbrella didn't hold up at all with a little bit of wind. The mechanics to bring it up and down broke.
1.0,Lend has already popped out. Very flimsy product but light as a feather.
1.0,"The material shown and the material that I received was not the same. I normally wear a large-xlarge. I read in reviews to go up a size, so I ordered a 2x and it fits like a small. The material extremely snug and it is not flowy as described."
1.0,"Nice material, but too tight for me. I have juicy calves."
1.0,It’s hard to see in the picture but there is a big area where there is a defect in the “pearl” and it is peeling. Super disappointed.
1.0,This ring looks like it came out of a gumball machine
1.0,Its not even a month and my bracelet is fading and geting rusted
1.0,I would send back if I could!
1.0,"This was even cuter than I expected.  This set is very well constructed and the pants are very slimming. However, it began to fall apart as I wore it."
1.0,I year old kids are not so small. Is it for 1 month old infant. Make them bigger. or refund money.
1.0,It's pretty and flattering from the front but if you have a butt beware it is far too short in the back.
1.0,The shoe destroyed the bottom of the costume and the ties were too short.
1.0,"this dress looks nothing like the picture. it is an ugly pink color, not red. it fit poorly, too big on the top and has no shape to it.it hangs. save your money!"
1.0,"Complete garbage. Plastic, glue coming apart, random strap that goes no where! Requested return and no response from seller. This product is a joke! Not even a gag gift."
1.0,Not a fan. Lace very dull
1.0,This item is advertised as cotton reason why I purchased it ; the inside is not. I'm allergic to synthetic fabrics .Will return.<br />What a waist of time....
1.0,"Not the nicest material!! And came with stickers on top of the brim ,, with left marks on it! Very very cheap material! And hard as a rock .."
1.0,The product is over priced. I paid extra for personalized gift bags but instead received white labels with the messages. I Expect to be ripped off a little on the internet but this is purely insulting.  Don’t waste the money.
1.0,It's an ok dress.  Their medium looks big for me.  I should have just ordered small instead.  I wanted to return it but I'm too busy.
1.0,Junk. Looks like it came from a gum ball machine. Poor quality. Ring came broken!
1.0,Great looking charm but the chain turned yellow shortly after purchase. Only worn once.
1.0,Bought 4 of these and they all broke. They attach with a magnetic clasp and they just fall off. Extremely disappointed
1.0,Disappointed. Not cut right. Poor quality.
1.0,The stone fell out and no the 3rd day of wearing it. Do not buy this ring.
1.0,This shirt is huge! Sizing is way off! This was a large and according to the sizing chart should have fit.
1.0,"I was hoping for some quality. But to me, these glasses seem no better than yellow-tinted plastic. Unfortunately I waited too long to return them."
1.0,"This isn't even a &#34;blazer&#34; it's a very very thin jacket--hardly a blazer. I ordered it in rose, thinking it would be a nice muted mauve color like the picture shows and it's more of a bubblegum pink in person. Very tiny, very tight in the arms and a total waste of money."
1.0,"Look like keychain holders, could make these myself for 5 cents or less, very irritating to fingers, very thin and bendable, not worth the money."
1.0,The material of the shirt is of very bad quality and smaller than spected.
1.0,I loved these the first month! The shape is not what’s pictured and a bit wider than all my other size 2s but still able to wear. The color was vibrant and now they’re white/clear. I don’t know why but it makes me assume it was fake coloring that just wore off 🤷🏼‍♀️. Super bummed.
1.0,came to me broken when I got it
1.0,"DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU ARE SURE!!! Very lightweight, almost see through. I was very disappointed with the quality and tried to return the items in which the company wanted me to pay return shipping. Paying $10 to return $20 worth of product is absurd. I’ve disputed with my CC company. Shame on you!!!"
1.0,"Extremely disappointed in these &#34;gloves.&#34;  They look nothing like the picture and not as described.  They are not warm, they are not &#34;superior quality,&#34; they are not &#34;winter gloves.&#34;  If you are buying these thinking you'll have some cold weather gloves to shovel snow you will be very disappointed.  They are very very thin cotton &#34;gloves.&#34;  Without exaggeration, I can honestly say that regular brown jersey gloves would afford much more protection than these.  Thes might be good to slip over your hands before putting on your real gloves."
1.0,Took them off and they came apart smh
1.0,"These show yoga style, high waisted, tight fitting yoga style pant. What I got was thin, eleastic waist band, big pajama pant product. Even the material is not spandex.  Very disappointed. Do not buy."
1.0,"Got these shirts, opened the box and was instantly disappointed. They felt, and look cheap. Instead of begging for a refund I just donated them to goodwill. Not worth it"
1.0,Super cheap - cheesy - do not buy
1.0,No made for average sized American woman. And that’s a pity. Missing a huge market!
1.0,Horrible fabric. Snags and runs on everything
1.0,Don't like the flavor!
1.0,Very disappointed. Used only for a week and they broke. They’re so fragile. Right temple broke off so easy.
1.0,Had black males on it. Looks nothing like the photo.
1.0,Sooo disappointed.  The hat is supposed to be newborn.  It is way too hugh!!! It fits my 3 year old perfect.  Also the bottom has a crochet button sewed on but no holes. So I had to pin it together on the newborn!! Not satisfied at all
1.0,"They run very large, a 5.5- 6.5 feel like an extra wide 7.5."
1.0,I hated the fabric…I didn’t even try it on. I opened it to feel the fabric and sent it right back to the store.
1.0,"Poor quality material, feels like a paper. I am very disappointed ☹️"
1.0,Is not evenly hemmed.
1.0,"Broke after a week, dainty and weak."
1.0,Fit is weird & uncomfortable
1.0,Didn't realize they were so small. Ended up sending back
1.0,"My wife has a very small head, yet the hair band broke as soon as she put it on. Very poor quality."
1.0,"Complete junk! I just received mine in the mail. When I tried them on they were rusted like someone may have already worn them and returned them. Jewels were missing/falling off. I get it, they were $13, but I wish they were at least new and not already worn! Ridiculous!"
1.0,Cute costume horrible design. Daughter could wear to school because she couldn’t get it unzipped for the bathroom.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:95e04e96e4bb67ed5603a47471913b41]] I bought this because it was a cute print and had a smaller band. The little tabs you insert the strap into to keep it in place broke off in less than a month. Yes it's inexpensive but less than 30 days of regular wear and it was done for.
1.0,I received this and the pants fit but the top was too large So i returned this and ordered a smaller size. I received my second order and the color of the shirt is darker than the pants. Not happy at all. Ive never had trouble returning anything through Amazon until now.  Ive now been charged twice for this suit that i really dont like.  BAD BUSINESS
1.0,I should have listened to reviews! The blue is the exact color of scrubs. I returned it.
1.0,No es lo que esperaba a razón de que es de goma total y no genérico
1.0,Not worth the money. Hard to put on and material isn’t good. If you bend it wrong and have to rebend it gets weak fast. Color was already changing after a day wearing. Also the metal dogs in your skin because it’s hard to flatten.
1.0,Wrong color never buying again. Would NOT recommend. DO NOT BUY THESE BOW TIES.
1.0,Takes brute force to open the earring; then virtually impossible to close once they are in the ear. A very bad design that makes them impossible to wear.
1.0,"When I received the watch, it had no holes in the band, so we had to go to a jeweler to have them use a leather hole punch and when I had finally started wearing it because it got holes, I realized the time was inaccurate and when I went to change it, it didn't even work. The time is permanently wrong and the way to fix it is broken."
1.0,"I wanted to love this- the material is nice/etc, but the buttons literally pop open the second you put it on. Save yourself the embarrassment 😂"
1.0,Clasp broke off. Didn’t even make it on my wrist. So disappointed.
1.0,"Oh no.  I️ just arrived in Europe from the U.S. and when I️ opened my luggage, the contents spilled out because the inside partition zipper (separating the 2 sides that open like a book) has broken.  Now I’m out of the country with a nonfunctional suitcase which was not overly packed.  I’m requesting a replacement or refund when I️ return, but in the meantime, this flawed luggage is complicating my travel.<br /><br /> I’ll repost the response from the seller."
1.0,"Broke within a week, would not recommend to purchase."
1.0,Not what I expected...it fits me in most places however is is super clingy on my butt and I don’t have a huge butt. Also the slits on the sides go all the way up to almost my butt. It is definitely not appropriate for me work as a teacher.  I returned it.
1.0,It broke and can’t be repaired
1.0,"I think the glossy look of the black on this top looks cheap. Also, fit bigger than expected. Returned."
1.0,when i got them they were flat and couldnt puff them up had to buy from someone else.
1.0,I just put the earrings in 30 minutes ago. I get to work and the B off of one of the earrings is gone..lost never felt it come off..a couple worker had to tell me..ugh so disappointed
1.0,Ordered a size 6 for my daughter and my size 7.5 feet were swimming in these.  Way too big.
1.0,This pair of shoes was extremely painful and cut my feet on the first wearing even though I had pantyhose on. I’m not wearing these again
1.0,They are to flimsy & loose
1.0,Kinda scratches my wrist.  Very cheap looking.
1.0,"If you would like to be cheated from a seller, then order this one from ATM FASHION WORLD. The actual item is not at all similar to the given photo. Twisted band is supposed to be dark red, instead it's ugly red. watch strap is also not similar like photo. Watch itself is so poorly made, that the glass will be broken any time. The image is definitely photo shopped."
1.0,Coat look like a plastic trash bag material
1.0,"Gave it away, didnt like it"
1.0,does not work
1.0,Update:  they are all falling apart.  Not worth the money.<br /><br />Purchased for my 3 year old on sale for 8.99.  Clip on earrings always hurt a bit so she’s a little weary but I tried them on and they’re not bad.  They have the rubber backing that helps.  Very cute designs.  Worth the $9
1.0,"I don't know why everyone is rating this highly. The fit was poor, the material was scratchy. Had to return. Wouldn't take even if was free."
1.0,So the arm holes are super tight and small and the back of the dress it’s just a tie string part but it does not fall well to tie. The breast part one side is bigger and one side is smaller. The waist fit as it should. Really can’t see this fitting anyone properly.
1.0,"While I love the color lavender, this said it was white. I got it in the mail and it’s legit light purple….took weeks to arrive and it’s purple lol"
1.0,I’m very upset with this product!<br /> it has two  Male snaps /instead of male and female. On the neck connection so you can’t hook  it together
1.0,"These were old and had lost most of their stickiness. I know these earrings haven't always been the best, but these were somehow worse. Designs were very cute though!"
1.0,Was for walking.
1.0,Wore them once and one broke
1.0,I don’t know why this is advertised as a tunic. It’s just a regular length shirt.
1.0,"Not at all what was pictured. This is not a leather belt, but a stretchy weaved rope thing. HIDEOUS. I got this for a Halloween costume thinking I could get the 1990's goth look. What I got is a miserable attempt at the 1980's stretch band. Returning this. Not what was advertised at all. Picture attached.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01N6RNWQ8 Genuine Bonded Leather Studded Belt Strap Waistband Fashion Mens Womens Buckle Black | Black & White Checker Large]]"
1.0,turned my finger green
1.0,Another product where I cannot understand all the good reviews! These panties were extremely uncomfortable and rode up in the back big time! Complete waste of money.
1.0,To big im no like😞
1.0,"NO button...plus a small hole in the crotch. These are not quality, they are error garments. Save yourself the trouble and buy them from an actual store."
1.0,I bought this dress and haven’t worn it yet. I put it in the wash and was going to wear it today for the first time to find that it had ripped. I’m sure bummed because it was so cute. Definitely disappointed.
1.0,Had pieces of jagged metal along the stem of the piece. Pretty painful.
1.0,I ordered an xl and it was TINY!my friend is a size 4 and couldn't fit in it!!!🤦‍♀️
1.0,God reason it didn't cost much because it isn't worth anything.  Will be going in the trash
1.0,"One arrived broken, one seems new. This consistency among the reviews should raise some eyebrows. Seemed like a no brainer with the price and but its highly likely you'll receive a broken one based on the reviews. Good luck"
1.0,it was broken when i received it.
1.0,These shoes were not made for humans. The fabric across the toes barely touches the top of the foot and so my foot is sliding around inside the shoe. It would be dangerous to wear this shoe. The seller only offered a 20% refund without having to return the shoes and suggested I gift them to a friend. If you want to break your ankle this is a good deal.
1.0,Too big and long for average size users.
1.0,"This shirt is supposed to fit sizes Large to 2X.  I typically wear 1X.  It was gigantic.  If you are at all busty, the shirt will not hang down."
1.0,Wow... runs VERY small. Buyer beware.
1.0,actually broke on me
1.0,To tie dawn the toes so is no at lease a little open
1.0,"Breaks easily, wouldn’t suggest getting this."
1.0,These tore across the front below the knee on the first day That I had them. Did not bother getting a refund because they were relatively inexpensive.
1.0,"The first thing I noticed was how cheap it looked and very flimsy.  I had to use bread ties on the corners to hold the hat in the thing. I washed a hat and it did not come out of the holder but had I not put the bread ties on the sides, I am sure it would have come out.  I sure would not order again and definitely would not pay almost $8 for it.  Not worth it."
1.0,"Not good all, these belly rings had flaws. None of the bottoms come off. The gems stones are loose and falling out. Just over all bad quality."
1.0,"The part that goes over your foot is weirdly small, completely inflexible, and SUPER uncomfortable. It's like they got the measurements for the top and bottom (toes vs top of foot) of the strap backwards. I can barely get my feet into these shoes because the top strap is so tight and won't let the top of my arch into the shoe. The arch strap also ends RIGHT over the peak of my arch and rubs the bone on that area.<br />FYI I'm petite, have small feet, and have NEVER had a problem with shoes that are too tight on the top like this.<br />These are so uncomfortable they're basically unwearable. The only positive is that the shoes arrived weeks before they were supposed to."
1.0,They broke so easily! Couldn’t withstand laundering either
1.0,It is kind of cheap strap made by pu leather that will not good to use for long time. Return it rightaway.
1.0,I was very unsatisfied with the product. I had the first watch inoperable and requested a replacement. I read the instruction booklet to see if it was my falty error; However I operated according to the instructions twice and still failed at having the watch work. It looked like a great watch but untrustworthy on having it reliably work the first time
1.0,I PURCHASED THREE OF THESE ONE FOR MYSELF AND TWO FOR MY DAUGHTERS THEY DIDNT LAST A WEEK THEYVE ALL BROKEN TOO CHEAP AND FLIMSEY!
1.0,Cheap fabrics for the price. Feels terrible against skin  NOT SOFT!  . This company spends too much money on advertising campaigns and not nearly enough on their product.  Don ‘t buy !!!
1.0,Una marca tan importante no puede fabricar un reloj tan disminuido en su presentación.
1.0,I ordered these but didn’t get them bc Amazon prime “lost my package.” Sucks bc they look so cute!!
1.0,Arrived in pieces
1.0,Broke after 15 minutes of wear!
1.0,"I ordered a large, may wanna get a size bigger cause I couldn't fit mine."
1.0,The openingjis extremely small.  It is. Binding and will affect blood circulations in the ankle area.
1.0,This is a super thick unbreathable material. I bought it for my pre teen son who loves Call Of Duty and it’s huge on his face and huge on my adult face and my face isn’t small. I don’t know how anyone could tolerate wearing this for even 5 minutes let alone any longer!
1.0,"Have to return these pants.  Too small although I ordered a Size 8, he cannot get them above his knees"
1.0,This bracelet is sized for a child.
1.0,Poorly made and disappointing. Don't order this mask!!
1.0,Ordered the pictures belt in size 36.<br />Received a different reversible belt size 46.<br />Promptly returned
1.0,Not happy I won’t buy anymore
1.0,This is not iridescent. It is a print of what iridescent fabric would look like. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Functionally, they do what they’re supposed to (when they aren’t breaking). They’re spikes. Not a whole lot to them. But like another reviewer here, I had one shear off at the threads in a race. Couldn’t get the threaded part out. It ruined my shoes. I expected better quality from SIDI. I’ll try another brand."
1.0,Instantly fell apart. The pin that holds the pivoting latch fell out of the hole while I was taking it out of the package! Apparently the pin is too small for the hole. I plan to fix it myself since its not practical to return it. Poor quality control.
1.0,"This is not the same product that is pictured. There's no loop, or the difference size of Velcro. This is not meant for a plus size person."
1.0,This was not waterproof. I got wet through the jacket. Only the parts that were not directly touching the jacket was sort of dry.
1.0,"I love the way this looks and fits. BUT the seam split down the side on only the second wear! Not a fit issue at all, the fit is even a little loose. Very disappointed in the quality, it could have been great."
1.0,"I loved it! Light weight perfect for work. Then I washed on delicate, let it air dry and the fabric on the seem started pulling away. Either the fabric or the thread rotted and gave way up the back"
1.0,if I could put a negative 5 star rating for this watch i would. You know what honestly out of a possible 5 star rating. I give this piece of zhīt a negative -100 star rating. It doesn't even work i open the back of it to see if there was a piece of paper or plastic between the battery and the device to see if they did that to save the battery for the buyer but there was nothing and the inside you could tell was cheaply made. Got it 2 days ago  and the second hand hasn't moved once. SMMFH  don't buy this watch.
1.0,"Looks good,appears to be  well made, but has ZERO support, even with a low impact dance class."
1.0,"The product had all the pocket space I was looking for but it was so cheaply made it probably wouldn't have lasted a good week. Had no double or triple stitching and the single seams were coming apart. The nylon zippers were horrible.  If zipping from one end to the other, the zipper would pull apart. The cheaply lining crinkled so much it caught the attention of my cats. Would not recommend."
1.0,"It's skinny around the thighs, the material is very cheap, and no pocket room. The back pockets are fake and it off i wanted to keep anything in the pockets i guarantee that the pockets would rip"
1.0,Very bad interns of fit. When I wear loafers the rear part of the socks always stands up and I have to manually pull them down. Wouldn't recommend.
1.0,"thought this looked really cute in the pic.  stated comes in plus size..  Sleeves were very tight and narrow except at the wrist, which belled out and were super long.  The reindeer design is barely recognizeable.  it was horrible. I wouldn't even rate 1 star but I couldn't submit without doing so."
1.0,The &quot;One Size&quot; is an extremely small size. I couldn't even get them on and my hands are small. Returned them.
1.0,The picture and sizes indicated they were adult.  When I got them they were toddler.
1.0,The battery stopped working like a week after we got it. It's never started again
1.0,"I wear a large, I ordered extra large because I like a loose fit, the extra large was way way to small, I thought it might have been a child's size..... A person who wears a small MIGHT fit into an extra large....."
1.0,Made out of paper
1.0,30 minutes into gardening with a brand new pair of gloves. Definitely not trying these again. They also run small.
1.0,"This dress looks horrible on me! Nothing like the photo! I'm 5'11&#34; & 225 lbs. Large is long enough, but dress too loose at bottom.  Got the green floral one that looks different from the others but is apparently made the same. Inside of dress is white, seams don't line up, and my split is in center, not on side and basically doesn't show from too much mayerial. Color is dull and looks like something your grandmother would wear to bed. Sorry, just not the sleeping gown for me!"
1.0,Way to big I returned
1.0,"It was much smaller than I expected, so I had to return it."
1.0,This product was awful. It was made for a small short person and should be a 2xxl<br />never again.
1.0,Wore these twice and they broke as I was putting them on the third time. Very cheaply made and not worth the money. They should have spent less on their ad campaign so they could actually manufacture a quality product. Do yourself a favor and go buy a better procudt at the Dollar Store.
1.0,"Terrible quality, nothing like I expected, wanted to return it and got just under$7.00 back!!!! Would never buy from this company again."
1.0,Waste of money. 😑
1.0,"The pajamas were cute and soft, although a little smaller than their sizing chart led me to believe. What really got me though, was that securely sewn inside the top were tiny little bra cup inserts. There was no way they were going to fit.<br />Now, if they did somehow fit you and you managed to keep your breasts in just the right place, maybe these pajamas will benefit you greatly."
1.0,The “i” is partially missing and part of the rainbow is coming off. I haven’t even worn or washed yet! Just took out of package!
1.0,They are nice style and good fitting. Just can't breathe at all in them. Luke trying to breathe in a bag.  Would return but already washed and when I tried it on I had make up on.
1.0,Arrived broken. Will have to send back.
1.0,Didn't fit it was way to small.  I ordered an XL. I gave it to my 11 year old she's a small girl and it didn't fit her either.  Looks like a t-shirt on her
1.0,This product was too small and the belt was missing for the robe. I will be returning this product.  I could not believe the belt was missing!
1.0,"Does not run true to size.  Poor quality, poor design, unattractive fabric. Just ugly."
1.0,The socks were delivered with a large hole in the feint of the left thigh. I wish I had taken a photo! It’s somewhat comical in retrospect.
1.0,Terribly made...the first pair ripped in multiple spots as I put them on and a second pair ripped while wearing! They were the correct size and everything. Very disappointed.
1.0,THIS BELLE IS SO DECEIVING.  I finally got it on somewhat.  IT’S NOT AS WIFE AS IT APPEARS AND THERE’S LOOK LIKE IT GOT A LOOP TO ADJUST THE STARTING POINT.
1.0,"Wrong style..had to return; it was short hair, I wanted long hair.."
1.0,It does not work at all -- makes absolutely no difference.  What a waste of money!
1.0,this is good for people that like having the inside filter fold up inside the mask and become uncomfortable
1.0,The material was faded and very wrinkled. There were loose threads everywhere and the stitches were loose and uneven. Very poor quality
1.0,"First off, the size chart is way off. The material is like felt and can’t be washed. Very disappointed."
1.0,Junk.  Amazon is turning into Wish.  :(
1.0,ONLY 1.  NOT 3 like the ad says.  False advertising for you to buy them.
1.0,"ABSOLUTELY GIGANTIC.<br />I ordered a size medium after reading all reviews, really hopeful this was going to be a great purchase.<br />I am 5’7 and there is at least a extra 12 inches of pant legs dragging on the floor. Let’s not forget how cheap the material is.<br />SO DISAPPOINTING"
1.0,fell apart and fell off in the water
1.0,Couldn't tell much difference. Didn't fit well; too small.
1.0,This locket is ridiculously small. I purchased it as a gift for my mother and was extremely disappointed in how small it is. You can't even get a small enough photo to fit into it.
1.0,"Could not even wrap one good time, need to make longer to be beneficial"
1.0,"Such a waste--it's a very nice sports bra, fits well, has good support and I love the color choices. Unfortunately the zipper pulled apart the very first time I zipped it!! I am by no means well endowed so it certainly wasn't because I stretched the zipper beyond reasonable expectations. And I just noticed similar complaints for the Senchanting Yoga bra--it appears the zippers they use in their products have issues. AND the tag attached  (see image) says &#34;...it is better to dry clean&#34;, &#34;Great for waist training&#34; (what the heck???), and &#34;Do not expose to sun.&#34; REALLY??? A sports bra that you have to shield from the sun and then dry clean after each use? Needless to say, I sent this right back. Thank goodness for Amazon Prime!"
1.0,Sleeves are extremely too long
1.0,Junk.Not at all what came
1.0,"Very small, thin. I returned."
1.0,Color and quality not like pictures.
1.0,"I loved the colors and pattern on this dress.  I am middle aged and thicker in the middle, therefore I prefer looser dresses.  This was fine, but a little clingy in the torso. The sleeves/underarm area were much too tight, and I have a small bust area!"
1.0,"Bought these as a gift. They had a stain on them and just came wrapped in plastic. No tags, or anything so it looks like I bought them used."
1.0,Description said 2020 but I got keychains that said 2019. Couldn’t even return them via Kohl’s drop off. So disappointed.
1.0,It looks more like a large than Xl
1.0,The image quality is trash. 24x36 shouldn't be an option if they can't stretch the image without compromisinh quality
1.0,Was not what I expected. Super cute online but not a fan of the under shorts.
1.0,Very small and fabric is practically see through AND on top of that they haven’t refunded my money and I returned this 2 weeks ago.
1.0,Disintegrated after about 2 weeks wear
1.0,"The product listing says Applejack Cutie Mark Patch, the pictures that popped up when I was buying it and putting it in the cart were of the real Applejack cutie mark, but what I received was the Rarity cutie mark-3 blue diamonds instead of 3 red apples for APPLEjack. Sometime after the buying and shipping notices I received, the picture online changed to the 3 blue diamonds, which is what I received. But the product description is still Applejack. I haven't had time to start the return process yet, but it better be easy. I had to make a crappy homemade version of the cutie mark for my Halloween costume & it fell off 10 minutes into the party I went to."
1.0,the thread used is very itchy  the material keeps rolling up
1.0,"The top was very poor quality. The seams were not finished properly and it was too small. It is supposed to be &#34;one size&#34; and I am a size 8. If it was too small on me, it won't fit very many people."
1.0,Cheapest piece of crap on Amazon
1.0,"It fits really tight. When trying to get it over my locs, it started ripping.. so I tried the other one.. and it ripped.. so I went for the third one and GUESS WHAT.. it RIPPED. Would NOT recommend"
1.0,"I am not happy with this purchase. The color was not gold, but silver and didn't match the necklace or bracelet I ordered. It did arrive before Christmas which I contacted the seller about, unfornately, I don't want to give it to my sister since it's not the right color at all to match. I would return it, but the price is not worth the shipping."
1.0,Fell apart almost immediately. So disappointed
1.0,"The item is made with cheap material and shrunk by at least 30% when I washed it. I did not dry it. Ordered 2 sizes up in an attempt for it to be slouchy like in the picture and once it was washed and air dried it does not even fit over my shoulders. Before I washed it, it was still more boxy than the description shows."
1.0,Very poor product! I was wearing it while working on some towel hangers in my bathroom and it slipped off and fell 2 feet before breaking into pieces
1.0,One earring goes way over to one side.
1.0,fits strange and a waste of $
1.0,"Can't give the items a rating because I as not able to use them. I liked the color and design, but they did not properly offer protection, the masks are too small, more fitting for a child's face."
1.0,"The dress itself was ok. The bra part was a little weird. But their customer service is non existent I have been trying to return this dress since December (its now march) and even though it says free returns it is not free. I had to pay to send back to their US address. Even though tracking shows it was delivered to them they are giving me the run around, saying they haven't seen it in their warehouse. It's a scam. It's not worth the hassle so u better be sure u want this dress bc returning is impossible. Update: they've refunded me. But out of the $75 I paid for the dress they refunded me $30 with no explanation."
1.0,it looks so cheap
1.0,There are very tiny wires going into the battery pack. One wire was not connected to the battery pack making the whole thing inoperable.
1.0,A small is huge - should have xtra small option- not enough time to return since it was a gift i bought in January for february birthday
1.0,The necklace was broke when it got here the ring was too small I ordered a size 7 I don't know what size they gave me it was not at 7:00 it was too small and one of the stones and the earrings came out lost it first time I got to wear them
1.0,These are a lot tighter than the older pair I have. The lines in the sock tighten to much around leg and foot.
1.0,"A few years ago I lucked into buying some Body Glove Kona flips while on vacation that have been fantastic with fit and durability. These new flips, Shoreline, meant to replace the Konas appear to be the same oddly shaped Chinese cheap flips that you see a lot. these days It's like a squeezed elipse shape that isn't the shape of my foot at all. They do not fit my feet well or conform to your foot. I've tried them for a couple of weeks and ended up throwing them out. I went with a super cheap (~$7.00) pair of Athlefit flips that I can tell immediately fit better and are probably as good or better quality. Dear Body Glove, I wish you'd kept selling the Konas."
1.0,"The sizing of these shorts is inaccurate, they run smaller than advertised. Curiously a strap like you might see on a life jacket has been added, not sure why.<br />The Shorts in general seem to be looking for the balance between comfortable Board shorts and cargo shorts.<br />The result is an over all weird product."
1.0,"I received my scarf and it had a spot on it as if it was dirty, it was out of stock to exchange it so I washed it on delicate, as there are no washing instructions attached. It already began to come apart from one delicate wash and I did not dry it. It was also noticeably less soft.  Cute but very poor quality, would not see this product lasting even if you did not wash it."
1.0,Band wouldnt lock correctly to watch. Causing it to disconnect from watch and break on the ground
1.0,Is well to big on me...<br />Not happy at all.
1.0,"Terrible appearance, looks awful and the lace has large strands hanging off where lace is sewn onto fabric. Terrible purchase at any price."
1.0,Returned because dress was transparent.
1.0,Didny like
1.0,The chain broke off the first time it was worn.
1.0,"Way too small. The description says these fit up to a 36-inch waist, but if your waist is over 28 inches, don't buy them!!!"
1.0,"Perfect out of the packaging, but then you wash it and dry it and it is now too small.  The pants shrank about 6 full inches and the shirt is no longer loose. If you buy don’t dry!!!"
1.0,"Awful proportions and even though it wasn't tight, the dress rides up as you walk."
1.0,"Really was just not an attractive dress! I prefer a loose fit, but this one was bad. Really did not fit like the picture at all. The neck tie was to small in proportion to the rest of the dress. I returned it promptly."
1.0,"There should be a way to leave 0 stars. I ordered this dress and another one very similar in style from this company both dresses had to be sent back due to horrendously poor quality. The stitching on this dress was unalined so much so that there was a big 3-4 inche whole also there are like 8 panels to this dress so there are seams every 5 inches or so. The dress also fits very poorly it stretches to fit however befor even putting it on the white parts of this dress are see through.<br /><br />once it stretched over my body it would honestly be unwearable all together. All the way around this is just a company that obviously cuts corners to make these dresses as cheaply as possible and all the way around you can see that in the product. Although the dress looks wonderful in the pictures I believe it is a picture of the original they were copying because the real dress itself is absolutely horrible.<br /><br />Do not bother there are other far prettier dresses available from good companies and dresses that are completely wearable for less.<br /><br /> Also I did receive this product for a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.<br />I review all of the products that I order honestly, regardless of discount. I hope my review has helped you in some way"
1.0,1 wear and they are broken already👎🏼
1.0,Dislike...  I thought it was a Michael Kors....It looks cheap.....
1.0,"Very odd fit. Very short on the top, doesn't come down far enough on my head. Would not recommend, especially since there is no free returns"
1.0,It was way too small...
1.0,I ordered a large in women's.  Wouldnt even fit a 12 yr old!
1.0,"These are very heavy on the back so it makes the earrings sag, which makes the front jewel part point to the sky."
1.0,It was too small at chest area
1.0,Had this belt for a week and it’s already peeling around the holes.
1.0,"i received the ring before delivery date, but when trying the ring on it was way to big. i sized the ring it was a 12.5 / 21.8mm i ordered a 10 / 19.9mm. the sticker on the ring said 10, but it wasn't. im wondering if all the sizes are this way. i really like the ring as i can only wear stainless steel or 14 karat gold. need a non expensive sturdy ring to wear while working.."
1.0,"I really had high hopes for this dress but sadly this wouldn’t even be appropriate for a street walker. This dress is a size too small and is cut to the cheek with no room to sneeze. What is impressive, is that the sleeves genuinely look like they were woven by a giant tarantula."
1.0,"Extremely Long, but surprisingly small at the waist. I ordered a large, I am 5ft 6. The only way this skit would fit on my is if I wore it as a dress from my armpits to the floor. Wow."
1.0,"I ordered a size to big for roomy comfort, the dress is VERY small, it's about two sizes too small."
1.0,"Poor quality, will not buy it anymore. When I put it in my finger, it broke in one second."
1.0,"Love the length, but that is all I can review on these. Every strap has broken and they are made of a weird blended fabric that rips like tissue paper. These are garbage."
1.0,This is most definitely not for a 6m-1yo. Way too large. Also not happy that the window to return was 30 days so I am stuck with socks that are way too big for my 7 month old. She won’t fit into these until she is a toddler
1.0,Not worth the $12.99 price tag and only for one clip. You can purchase a harbinger clip for only a portion of the money and get better quality.
1.0,"This are normal glasses. I really thought, due to the previous comments, that these might work but they don't! They just turn everything yellow: back lights, front lights, street lights. Not a single glare is removed. Not worth it for me, sorry. I had Lasik about 10 years ago and I'm not sure if my eyes are different but don't waste your money on this."
1.0,"The fabric is horrible, neither close to the picture, Don't buy it. Don't waste your money."
1.0,"Please don't waste your time, money, or hopes. This dress could have been beautiful. The cut and the design are beautiful but the execution is terrible. The material felt so cheap and the dress itself was see through and far too small. If you are looking for a dress that looks like more than what you paid for it, this is not it. You won't be fooling anyone."
1.0,Did not keep hands warm at all.
1.0,Loved until washed.
1.0,lot of pink and white. Should be labeled as girls
1.0,Too shinny
1.0,Way too small… order 2 sizes up
1.0,"I ordered this necklace on March 15, 2015 and it's now April 13, 2015...and the order tracking still says &#34;It's on the way&#34;. Even though it's cheap, I was hoping to still get to see what I paid for."
1.0,Normally I would wear a 1x or 2x so I bought a 3X and still didn't set way too small I would definitely recommend going at least two to three sizes bigger than what you wear
1.0,"The arm holes were too large and the bottom seam at the arm pits poked out to the sides, like too much fabric was sewn together there. Plus the fabric was cheap looking."
1.0,"LIGHT GREY COLOR:If you want to sparkle like a unicorn then get the &#34;Light Grey&#34; hat.<br />No, seriously, this is a second hat I'm purchasing from this company...<br />The black hat is totally legit, fits great, item is as pictured on the product page.<br />But the the &#34;Light Grey&#34; hat is different, for whatever reason they used a silver (shiny and sparkly) string for the mesh part of the hat.<br />It literally sparkles, if that wasn't insulting enough they included a &#34;free&#34; sparkly bowtie in the package.. WHY?<br />There is no mention of the silver string (or the bowtie for that matter) in the product description, and there is absolutely no indication of such a thing in the product pictures.<br /><br />I hope they will read this review and reply, I hope they simply made a production or shipping mistake..<br />I will be buying another a few other colors to check how they are made.<br /><br />BLACK COLOR: The black one has my vote so far though. Accurate pictures of the product, fits well, doesn't sparkle unlike the grey one. Doesn't feel cheap like the other review stated. I recommend the black hat.<br /><br />NAVY COLOR: Bought a &#34;Navy&#34; hat. It's not NAVY! It's more of a purple then navy, the pictures show a different color! VOBOOM should really take more accurate product pictures, if I could leave another negative review I would, but it's not letting me."
1.0,This is not what you see in the picture. You get a half of a wrap skirt. It is a sarong for the beach or pool. I would never wear this anywhere else! Returned False Advertising
1.0,"This is NOT a spinner ring and NO 9.25 stamp. The ""spinner"" is clearly welded to the band.<br />Tracking from India not updated so can not go through proper channels."
1.0,"These have horrible plastic factory odor which does not come off. Tried washing them twice and the odor does not come off. Even worse made the laundry machine smell for a while too. Terrible purchase, cant believe amazon would sell this."
1.0,It is inferior product. don't buy it
1.0,Small was way too large and long and the fabric was thin and shapeless. Very cheesy.
1.0,"I ordered the six to nine months and it was too large. So I re ordered the 3 to 6 and it was the same size, and too large for a six months baby. Nice style but the sizes run too large."
1.0,"I didn't even have them for a week and they broke, very cheaply made."
1.0,Terrible bra. Fasteners are tough to secure. Not good fit at least for me.<br />Perhaps for women with smaller cup size.
1.0,This trench coat was one of the worst clothing buys on amazon.com  Not good quality at all!
1.0,They are way bigger than I thought they would be. Also it took awhile for them to be delivered.
1.0,Does not have sleeves as it appears it does. It is basically a scarf that you throw over your shoulders.
1.0,Stupid
1.0,"The measuring chart is off, be warned. I bought a small based on what the chart stated and it's WAY to small (I don't have big breasts, I'm a B). I couldn't close the clamp comfortably, it was super difficult and it ripped on the side. It's a very cute bikini, good quality for the cost, but buy a size bigger"
1.0,"Very disappointed for the quality of the item, broke in the first viewing."
1.0,They sure did look nothing like the picture
1.0,Infected my ears. Flowers fell off
1.0,"looks like a dan blocker tall hat.  probably good hat if 4"" shorter on top"
1.0,The fit was for a 7 year old
1.0,I ordered large in this skirt but it fit like an extra small.. there's not enough stretch in it to fit.. I'll have to give it away.
1.0,"This was supposed to be a two pack of cups, only got one!!"
1.0,"Very cheap fabric, almost see through. Pull string on hood broke within the first couple hours of wearing. Do not recommend. Extremely overpriced."
1.0,"I'm both disappointed and livid with this product. I was wanting a pretty lace mask that wasn't sheer or see through, because we have a freaking pandemic going on. Reviews were good and it looked like it was legit, it just arrived and the material is mesh and lace; no barrier or even filter to keep any respiratory droplets from getting in our out of the stupid thing. Absolutely ridiculous. I wouldn't be so annoyed if it would have been advertised as what it is, instead it claims to be cotton, which it clearly is not."
1.0,"Looks, hangs, and fits nothing like the photo. Don't waste your money!"
1.0,Washed by hand and hung dry still shrunk up to where it doesn't fit anymore
1.0,Stopped working 60 days
1.0,"Doesn't seem like something that will hold through time.<br /><br />Anyway, it arrived too small"
1.0,Cheap made. Don’t waste your money. Sent back. I would give it 0 stars
1.0,"Color & Pattern: The front of the shirt is the same as was shown in the photo from the seller, but the back was not (I specifically ordered a shirt without stripes, yet I still ended up with stripes). The “red” the is not actually a true red, but more of an ugly pinkish red.<br /><br />Quality, Cut, & Material: It’s mostly polyester, so I wasn’t expecting much, but this was crap. The bottom was cut crooked on both the front (the bottom of one side was 1/2” shorter than the other) and the back (which is highlighted with the stripes). The stitching was messy and the threads were long and hanging out at every seam.<br /><br />Fit: I am pretty busty on top of being broad chested and I typically wear a L/XL, so because this is a button up shirt I ordered a 2XL. It still pulled at my bust and is not true to size (this fits like an XL). I did like the length of the shirt and the sleeves as well as the placement of the cutouts for my shoulders.<br /><br />I’m returning this immediately."
1.0,Awful. Half of the design doesn’t show up at all. Not at all like the picture .
1.0,The necklace is nice but the metal gets my neck really dirty from the chain
1.0,I bought this for my 11 year old daughter. She has used it for 3 weeks & the strap is already torn.
1.0,Med alert
1.0,Broke after trying to take it off
1.0,Great price but very uncomfortable. Snagged on my arms and clothes. Magnet did not hold very well either
1.0,"I returned these the day after I received them. They look very cheap, and as if the little flowers will start falling off. The color is dull, unlike the picture which makes them look like a nice, bright red. I don't recommend these."
1.0,The chain was messed up.  Embarrassing that I gave this as a christmas gift.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:1155bf21ebcf140add9369dc7291fc65]] ***NEVER AGAIN**** Dress fit really tight on arms, breast area, mind you I'm a petite woman normally a med. Slits were still semi sewn together had to separate in some areas no big deal. Bottom of the dress which should be like a pencil style dress was literally saggy and did not fit tight at all. Most slits barely visible."
1.0,"these gloves are made so thin and cheaply, they tear and split easily. Not worth half of the cost. Taking advantage of the difficulty of purchasing this type of glove during the current pandamic. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE!!!"
1.0,"First wash , the material shrieked"
1.0,Stone immediately  popped out. Now the necklace is useless.
1.0,Still have a glare with oncoming lights
1.0,"No pockets! Not cotton, as described in the title. Actually there’s no cotton at all. It’s polyester & rayon. Quite heavy all around."
1.0,These are very cheap. I could've bought these from a dollar store.
1.0,Too small for a size 10.
1.0,"This pin has no grip at all, totally useless. It was wast of my money. I would not recommend anyone to buy it."
1.0,"No se como hayan cortado y cocido esta prenda, pero es muy incómoda.<br /><br />Las piernas son extremadamente delgadas y separadas. Se bajan mientras vas caminando.<br /><br />Son bonitas, pero incomodidad no vale la pena."
1.0,I got a large according to the size chart. I should have gotten an XL I am screwed now because I don't have time to return it and wait for another because I have an even I need this for and I have no money for a new one :/
1.0,This was way too tight for my 7 year old and wouldn’t even fit my 5 year old.
1.0,The chain pictured in the image was not what we received.  The image shows a ball chain and what was received was a very thin chain.
1.0,"Bought late July last year for our boat. Made it through August, didn’t use them until this year, and now they broke just putting them on my face. Only got a couple months of use out of them. Looks like a repeat issue that others have had as well."
1.0,sad
1.0,Sock was way to long and the top elastic band was way to small. I'm 6 foot tall and average build. I could not ware this sock.
1.0,The fan that inflates it didnt work.
1.0,No pins no tool cheap quality rubber. Would not buy or recommend
1.0,Skirt was ugly olive green. Not Kelly green as pictured and in the movie. Returning.
1.0,"Love smart wool socks. Saw gloves I assumed they would be lined with smart wool.<br />These are the biggest waste of money. Nothing warm about them. Horrible for winter.<br /> Very unhappy with smart wool products on Amazon. Socks aren’t the same as you can purchase in store. Same price, lower quality.<br />Done with smart wool"
1.0,Muy mal producto.  Me salió defectuoso
1.0,These glasses absolutely do NOT glow in the dark
1.0,"After wearing once, they stretched and are no longer wearable. After about an hour, I had to tuck the waist band into my bra to keep it from falling Down.<br /><br />I bought them because they were cheap, but considering I cAnt wear them a second or third time, I definitely suggest getting another brand before these"
1.0,Horrible! Missing one of the hearts and the silver looks like they have already been worn and chipping.
1.0,These skirts are very  very small. This sizes are based on China sizing not the United States
1.0,"I generally take a LG, XL. I purchased a 2XL and it barely fit. Runs super small. Am returning.  Poor quality fabric as well, made in China.  That was not stated in the description."
1.0,"Beware,  logo silkscreen,  not sewn!"
1.0,Cheap and nasty.  Nothing like the picture
1.0,Looked nothing at all like the picture.
1.0,high waisted. You have to pull it down constantly and it runs small. The good thing is that material is stretchy and u can make it usable.<br />Also the cut of polka dots at the waist line is terrible. It makes the dress look weird like is not even.
1.0,I'm a small-med...but this was like 2xl..way too big and unable to wear it...disappointing
1.0,Fingers are super wide. The fabric isn’t shiny either like the photo shows. It was fine for the photo shoot I did though. You get what you pay for. Next time I’d splurge on some higher quality real latex gloves.
1.0,"So small,couldn't see them on me"
1.0,It was broken when it arrived.
1.0,I wore this twice and one of the bands broke. Have not been able to fix it.
1.0,Defective
1.0,The mask literally arrived broken
1.0,This broke right out of the package. It wasn't even worn. Very disappointed.
1.0,Doesn’t look anything like the picture. Cheap material and end up being high waters. I’m only 5’3 so I never have that problem
1.0,Didn't like the quality and the fit
1.0,too big & heavy
1.0,This came in an envelope so it was totally crushed; should have been sent in a box.  Even after I fluffed it it still appeared much cheaper than the one pictured.  The feathers are not full.  They appear to have been plucked from a very sick bird.  Don't purchase this item.  It also seems dirty.
1.0,These are not what I had hoped they’d be. I have other lace shorts similar but these were just saggy and frumpy
1.0,WRINKLE MATERIAL want my refund
1.0,"Save your money. This dress is not at all as pictured, and is an itchy large sack with head and arm holes."
1.0,"The embroidery on the front is to small to read. The cap is tall like a trucker hat, but fits well."
1.0,"I ordered a 3T, which looked more like 18 months. The fabric was 100% polyester and which is not something I would put on my 3 year old (especially when warm outside)."
1.0,The picture makes it appear to be a domestic product when it is actually coming from China and may take up to 45 days to arrive.
1.0,These are adult socks. Will not fit a child. They just put the same socks in packages that are marked different prices.
1.0,I’m 5’10 178lbs with a 34” waist. I bought the medium Size first and they fit like an XXL so i returned and bought the XS. These pants are HUGE!! I had to triple check the tag just to make sure they’re really the XS. These fit nothing like the size chart and are so baggy they look nothing like the photos!! These must be knockoffs of an actual product that exists somewhere & they simply STOLE THE COMPANY’S PHOTOS.
1.0,I was unhappy with both the quality and craftsmanship of this item. Size guidelines were off. I would not order from this site again.
1.0,the product is really bad in the part of the threads.
1.0,"No matter what I did when I put it on it just became very wrinkled, in a bad way not in a cute way. I would not recommend this top."
1.0,"This dress looks like night wear in person cheap material, would not recommended, wash it now it looks like a night top."
1.0,"Too loose, it doesn't stay on once my phone is in it."
1.0,Wasting money ! Never worked !
1.0,"Not the best in sizing ordered all colors... I did order up... some were too small while others fit just right. They are not sown together well either, one of the straps came loose from the other side of the material."
1.0,"The chain is not as long as the description states and the watch was dead out of the box. Just flat out doesn't work at all. Like other people have said, if you need a prop for a short film or a play or a skit it's okay but if you actually want a working pocketwatch look elsewhere."
1.0,"It barely came past my knees, despite measurements indicating it would be long enough. It fits my 7 year old better than me."
1.0,Very cheap. No class. Very poor quality
1.0,Liars. Not 100% cotton & never received black gloves at all. Never again.
1.0,"Very pretty ring, but the tiny stones just fall out. Lost one stone in just an hour of wear. Returned."
1.0,I am very disappointed with the purchase. Material is terrible. Probably recycled. Very thin fabric full of clumps and different shades of white and blue. I am afraid it will not hold after first wash. The pants are already see-through with weird lines that are weaker than other looms. Waist of money.
1.0,"This is an awful product, just wore twice and it ripped apart. Bad product for the price, if I haven’t wore it return it right away."
1.0,It come so small
1.0,"This bracelet is pretty, BUT EVERY TIME I WEAR IT, IT LEAVES A BLACK CIRCLE ON MY ARM. I tried cleaning/polishing with a silver cleaning cloth. It did not help. I have NEVER had this problem with any other piece of sterling silver jewelry in my life, and I've worn many, many pieces.<br />2/4/19 After 4 sessions of 20-25 minutes of polishing, this piece no longer leaves the black circle on my arm."
1.0,"Sent this right back.  Its the density of a T-shirt and isn't the same as one I already have that is thicker fabric with a detachable larger bow. It does run true to size, maybe a tiny bit larger unlike my other one that runs small.  It's not even as pink as the photo. It's not hot pink, it's baby pink and the whole point of the purchase was the color. Im glad I had another to compare it to. Returning was easy though. Maybe if I didn't have the other this would be worth it. Im mad I bought shoes to match it and it's not the right color."
1.0,I will take a pass. Appropriate for a toddler. Ridiculously tiny. Sent for refund. Too Bad.
1.0,My nephew love it. Went to walmart the day before to get wrapping paper to wrapped this hat. Saw it at walmart same hat for $6.
1.0,I scented the wooden bead then I went to attach my keys and it immediately broke
1.0,"Fabric is fine, however there are no buttons— which truly should be explicitly stated. If I were to simply knot the straps, I’d effectively have 2 tail-like appendages hanging from my chest. Not a great look at any age!"
1.0,words came off not long after used
1.0,Pretty bad quality. The ‘valve’ looks like a cheap piece of plastic and I doubt it works
1.0,"For a $20 tie, I’d expect it to last longer than two uses.  Please know that I am VERY careful with everything that I own.  Thank you for reading this."
1.0,"My daughter is over the moon excited with her costume! It's a little snug in her arms, but I think I may have bought the wrong size.  But it look just like the picture!......so I thought this was a good buy....my daughter worn it 2 times and it was falling apart! She only wore it a total of an hour! I had to patch it up for the real trick or treating. But it didn't make it to the end of That! Not happt!@@"
1.0,I really wanted to love this sweater - the color block style is so cute.  But it looks very cheap and loosely knitted to the point that you NEED to wear a tshirt under the sweater because it looks almost see-through.  I returned this product since I was too afraid to wear or wash this garment; it looked like it would fall apart.  The colors are amazing though. Stitchwork was awful.
1.0,"I have ordered several packages of these tube face masks, was always delighted with the selections i received.<br />The ones i received today were a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT.  THEY WERE VERY DRAB, dull dark colors. Most were adverting a company or product .two were just alike.  I checked the order I  made and did not see even one that you had pictured.<br />Again VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED.  THEY WERE ALL UGLY."
1.0,"This dress is not what I expected - I thought it would be more linen-like, but was a cheap polyester, The neckline was weirdly very high and thee shoulder straps weirdly short and not adjustable."
1.0,Cheaply made...terrible quality...would never buy these again
1.0,Don't get it.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:12e018f3071d1755217c2f49a4ab3479]] This dress is advertised as a flowing style dress, but this skirt is incredibly fitted. There is no way to loosen it without damaging the skirt entirely."
1.0,"Very disappointed, received this item yesterday with a hole in the back collar. The whole things is huge for a small and fits like a garbage bag. And it looks more like a shaggy rug than an actual sweater."
1.0,Not cut properly. I'm a small and had to end up trying a large and the bottom still doesn't close properly. Asking for a panty show. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Did not snap easily for young children.  Would not snap with ruler showing
1.0,"Title states five pair, I only received two."
1.0,Bought this as something I thought I would like.  Very thin and flimsy.  Would not recommend to anyone. Sorry!!
1.0,I have had the bag for about a week and the strap broke off bag.  I guess that is what I get for the price I paid.
1.0,Very unhappy. Too big and piece that goes through the ear looked almost rusted—not shiny gold like the rest of the metal.
1.0,"This bra is not for women, but more for girls. The flimsy padding bunches up and you spill-out under the<br />arms. Very unattractive. I am returning it."
1.0,"Handles came off with first use, sole separated after 1 month."
1.0,They were cheap plastic. Other Body Candy earrings are much nicer.
1.0,Idk why the size is not mentioned. Im 192lb and it was too tight and small
1.0,This picture is very misleading... Dress does not look the same.  If you're  tall this dress is not for you.  The glitters fall while putting on dress and it has a course texture.
1.0,Was nothing like the picture.  Short not long and poor quality
1.0,"Very heavy fabric, I can't imagine that the wrinkles would ever come out of it, and there was nothing flowy about this dress"
1.0,"After this purchase was made, I Found these same beads at major department store. Its actually a craft bead that they sell in quantities of thousands for under ten bucks. I paid more than that from this vendor for a handful, passed off as bird bracelets. However I will say that they fit my zebra finches perfectly and served their purpose in helping us identify them."
1.0,These gloves were not sewn very well or they were sewn with thread that was substandard.  Before I even put them on I noticed a hole in the thumb web area.  These are horrible gloves for the premium price.
1.0,"First time i put it one to see if it fit, it did, but when I was taking it off it broke, waste of money."
1.0,Felt like I put in a trash bag. The dress was too big and just hung on me.
1.0,They broke on me in less than a week. But very great full Amazon gave me credit for them.
1.0,Broke almost instantly after hitting the ground
1.0,"The material was kind of cheap:/<br />Sent item back<br />But it fit well, just the print didn’t look right"
1.0,Cannot even distinguish the pattern on the earrings’ image/design
1.0,It stops the charms like it suppose but the color is changing on it to a bronze color I don't think that is normal
1.0,"The XL fit my 17yo, 6’2” lineman son...until I washed it. It now fits my 13yo, 5’4” son. I washed it inside out and it looks like it’s been washed a million times. I wish I could return it because this was a waste of money."
1.0,This t-shirt shrank about 2 sizes after drying on low heat.
1.0,My grandmother passed a year ago my mom is having a really hard time still so i bought this for her so she could always have her with her but i chose the mom design and it came as nana was disappointed i even checked to see if i made a mistake but on my receipt it said grandma idk what happened
1.0,Cheap and seller is dishonest.
1.0,"I'm a size medium/large so I thought with a one size fits all I would be safe but nope it's very small. There's no labels on it, it's light but it would fit a thin 10 year old.  It fits me but it looks nothing like the pic the draw string is in the middle of my breast and if I pull it down the back goes up.  I think it probably comes from China and its China's one size fits all.  It's preppy and fabric is fine like thin polyester but doesn't look anything like the picture on me.  If you are a size 2 through maybe 6 it will probably fit nice but I'm like a 10/12 in American size and this did not fit well at all.  I have to stop buying clothe from Amazon #1 they remove or don't accept customer review and #2 they are becoming like those cheap on line stores (where clothe is concerned) like Wish from now on I'm making sure if I buy clothe it's from a brand I know.  This review might get deleted but it's the truth."
1.0,Bad material quality.
1.0,Watch just randomly stopped work. Replaced batteries and still nothing. Will be byuying a new brand.
1.0,"Only covers half calf length, uneven compression, and sock keeps slipping  down to ankle.  Caution, product will restrict blood flow."
1.0,Wasn’t what I expected; nothing wrong with it. I thought it would be softer and not shiny.
1.0,Product is cheap I get better glasses at the gas station for cheaper
1.0,Not holographic!! Solid cotton mask.
1.0,"They are super soft but being that they are hand wash only is a huge problem, after 6 wears  the bottom ripped as it’s so thin of jean material. Super cute and soft just not worth the money in my opinion."
1.0,"Is way too large. It also didn’t come with shady to tie around my waist. I bought it for a costume so, I’ll be fixing it."
1.0,"Poor quality and the seller did not back their product. Do not buy, if it’s not right you’ll be stuck with it."
1.0,Ok I finally wear this product for a week. the last morning I had it in it started to swell it hurt so much I had to take it out and let my labret piecing recover. BAD EXPERIENCE!
1.0,Cheap and broke when I pulled it out of the plastic bag
1.0,"I'm disappointed with this piece. I'm usually very adamant about reading the reviews, somehow this one got past me. Looking back at them now, I wouldn't have ordered. For good reason, it's so short!!! The model picture is VERY misleading. Honestly, it will be difficult to pair with anything it's an awkward length. I'll keep working with it and see if I can figure something out, really hate the hassle of returning/exchanging things."
1.0,These are the worst bras I have ever purchased. The wires on the sides are very stiff and are uncomfortable. My return window has closed and these are going in the trash.
1.0,"We purchased this from a different retailer. After two wears/washes, the decals have started to peel off. Big bummer as my daughter loves this suit."
1.0,Cheap. They look like they have a wide waistband but it’s an illusion. Just thin elastic around the very top of the waistband. They’re shiny and just look and feel cheap. Too loose in all the wrong places.
1.0,"Nothing like the photo. It's enormous everywhere but the arms where you almost can't fit them in the holes. I'm 5ft. 2 and 119, I got a small which is normal for me; so it certainly not a normal sizing issue  It's from China and they ignored my return request. Please do not waste you time or money on this dress."
1.0,"The gloves were okay, I have small wrists and they were nice and tight. I wore them for about two hours and the thumb had already started ripping away from the rest of the glove on both hands. The cigarette holder was a piece of trash and when I received it, it was bent and the pieces were falling off the ends."
1.0,I'm 5'5 and this dress was too short. It came above my ankles and looked very awkward. Returning
1.0,I don’t like them at all there is no stretch at all. They aren’t anything like the first pair I ordered
1.0,"I really wanted to like this bra, but the cup size was way to big. Ordered an A cup and although it said A it was really like a C cup. I couldn’t wear it because it was bulging in the wrong spots. I threw it away."
1.0,"Believe all the previous reviews. I gave this the benefit of the doubt and was proven wrong. This dress was terrible, Amazon should pull this seller. The “hair thing” from previous reviews is still accurate and disgusting."
1.0,It is very small im asian but its still small for me I ordered medium
1.0,The size I ordered was XXXX4L. The box was also labeled the same. My wife is five feet two inches and very skinny. The briefs would fit her but not me.
1.0,"TERRIBLE.  Not lined, see through.  It's like panty hose!  Cute for a romp but not for swimming or going out.  Unless you are into complete see through outfits, I would go for another bathing suit.  I ordered one on from another vendor and it is the most amazing suit I've ever bought.  Avoid this one!"
1.0,"Bought watch in April of 2017. Beginning of June 2017 Crown cover fell off, By october of 2017 Battery was showing signs of weakness, December 2017 Battery is completely dead, Ordered Burei's own watch tool kit for the case wrench, but alas cannot get case off to change battery. Contact customer support and get no response, contact again in January, and February of 2018. Here we are March of 2018 still have received no response, no return call and no way to get this junk they call a watch running again. Avoid this brand like the plague unless you just enjoy throwing your hard earned money into the incinerator!"
1.0,Arrived with the crown fallen out. When stuck back in it wouldn't adjust the time displayed on the hands. Obviously wouldn't be waterproof.
1.0,Gloves not cotton lined
1.0,The material felt cheap and the dress made me feel like i was wearing a tent.
1.0,Magnet for clamp stopped working after about 5 wears.
1.0,"I have been told by my podiatrist to wear Crocs due to plantar fasciitis. I do well in my home with standard ""clog"" Crocs as slippers. I had surgery for this problem in December and I was hoping to find a pair that looked more like shoes to wear to work or out. I read the reviews of this shoe and thought I had found it. Not so the case. They look good, but, at least in my case, they were tight at the heel (causing excessive amounts of pain) short in the length (which made my toes hurt) and just so uncomfortable I could not walk for several hours after wearing them. Not what I was hoping for."
1.0,Put the hat on the baby and the bow already fell off. Clearly they are cheaply made. Bummer because they are quite. Money down the drain :(
1.0,doesn't work very well
1.0,Wasn't what I thought at all. I returned these
1.0,I ordered a XL but fit like an XS....
1.0,"I recieved in pieces! It was broken and no way to attach, complete crap"
1.0,"WHEN I REC. THE ITEM, THE SANDAL DID NOT HAVE A SUPPORT, OR SOLE, THE SOLE IS JUST TO THIN, FOR THE COST I PAY FOR IT,  SOME STORE THAT SELL THIS TYPE OF SANDAL, HAS MORE OF A SOLE, AND SUPPORT FOR THE SAME COST THAT I PAY FOR THIS SANDAL.  THE COMPANY SHOULD TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THIS SANDAL NOT HAVING AN SUPPORT, AND THE SOLE IS VERY THIN. I WEAR SANDAL EVERY DAY LIVING IN FLORIDA, THESE SANDAL WILL LAST ABOUT TWO MONTHS.  (WARNING)THEY ARE SO THIN, YOU CAN FALL DOWN, AND BREAK YOUR BONES."
1.0,Broke the first week I had it
1.0,It had  dirty  spots  not happy
1.0,I only wore this for a couple days and I noticed it was turning my ear green
1.0,"If you're not picky go ahead and buy your exact hat size  (there is no play in the size). But i ordered this and had it replaced a few times because the quality control in insane. Every single hat had an issue with the bill being sewn on lopsided, askew or off center."
1.0,"The rings turned after one wear, glad I didn't spend more for them!!!!"
1.0,NOT BUILT FOR PLUS SIZE WOMEN!!!!<br />So pissed about this order.
1.0,"Was so looking forward to the tortoise color and black 2-pack Barricade Polarized oval fit over sun glasses.  Never received them, disappointed in Michigan."
1.0,Obviously not a USA size.  Could have fit a child.  I really wish Amazon could/would put a warning label on these items.
1.0,"I ordered a medium, usually a M/L, I don’t like my clothes super loose and it is basically like a dress on me and goes to my knees. I’m 5’5"
1.0,Really faded and shrank after washing.
1.0,"Yup, they're light weight; Other than that they have no advantage whatsoever over an ordinary steel ring. The square stock makes it difficult to slip keys on. Keys or accessories w/ small round holes won't turn freely instantly making your key ring bulky and unwieldy....And, if you slip a thick, plastic coated key off 2-3 times the material becomes fatigued, stretches and leaves a gap. Junk. Save your money."
1.0,Wallet did not come as pictured...the logo is literally backwards. You have to hold it up to a mirror to read it...
1.0,Poor QC do not buy.
1.0,"Ordered 24"" chain and received 16"".  Quality fair. Would not recommend"
1.0,"Very poorly made.the O'Neil patch on the front fell off during shipping,it shipped in a bag only so it was broken in several places when delivered."
1.0,"It doesn't look like the picture.  It's really flimsy material and see through. I was expecting a more sturdier outfit and something not so light and see through. I'm very disappointed in it. It is very wrinkled. Now I know to never by clothes online, you never know what you're getting.  Pictures are deceiving."
1.0,Can't wear due to the size of the stud going into ear. If you have stretched out holes buy them they're beautiful if not... hard pass. Sad to have to return them.
1.0,"THE REASON I ORDERED WAS THE CLEAR BACK STRAP, AND BESIDE THE MISSING CLEAR BACK STRAP NOT IN THE PACKAGE THE BRA IS EXTREMELY TOO BIG IN THE CUP.  IF I ORDER SMALLER THE BACK STRAPS WILL BE TOO TIGHT.  ONE OF CUPS IS ALL CRIMPED UP AND CAUSES IT TO NOT FIT PROPERLY AS WELL IN THE CUP.  I AM RETURNING AND WILL NOT BE ORDERING THIS AGAIN!"
1.0,Not what I expected bag looks more gold then silver and too plastic feels like color will rub on your clothes that’s how it looks...
1.0,It was way too small...
1.0,"Broke, fell apart after 2 weeks."
1.0,The fit was great but it needs to be in petite size.
1.0,Waste of money & time. Wouldn’t stay on bridge of nose.
1.0,Fugazy!
1.0,Dress comes to mid calf. Not nearly as long as advertised. The product description and pictures are misleading.
1.0,"These glasses are “polarized”, but they’re not set at the right angle. Instead of taking away highlights, they GREATLY increase them, so when you’re driving, you are super distracted"
1.0,This is so cheaply made. The hood is tiny and has no structure like in the picture. The shirt also offers little stretch and is very short in the arms and toreso (I’m 5’6) and it’s too short.
1.0,This watch is a LEMON can't set it except for the alarm. Its not worth sending it back. I threw it away after 3 hers of trying to get it to work!
1.0,Way bigger than my normal size and really bulky
1.0,these make it to dark while driving at night. they dont fit over my glasses either. I don't use them.
1.0,The material stands out like a tent.
1.0,Did not match photos
1.0,"RIP OFF! Came with no instructions. When I pulled the cord like I was instructed to do,it came right off."
1.0,This product looks like denim in the photo however it is flimsy fabric that is not attractive
1.0,"Longest wait for the items and not satisfied with the product.  Good thing is, is that they were really inexpensive so even for one night, it was cool, but I probably wouldn't wait a month to receive it again."
1.0,It peeled coating in a couple months junk
1.0,This boots did not fit they run small and the are not a wide size..
1.0,The fit was awkward all over but with pleats that made no sense and did nont lay well at all. I had to send it back.
1.0,Way way to small. U got to order it like 2 sizes bigger. Couldnt even get my other arm in. Very disappointing. Really wanted a dress to wear for the day. The waist is not stretchable.
1.0,"Earring is super cute and fit in my daith perfectly, but it didn’t latch closed so I lost it within a day. You get what you pay for"
1.0,Threw it straight into the trash. The fabric is so disgusting. Not flattering. Feels like nails on a chalkboard
1.0,"The finishing wasn’t great, thread hanging out. Also, it seems to have shiny iron marks all over it. I don’t like it."
1.0,This hat fits like a kippah. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,This bracelet really is beautiful. Too bad it doesn’t fit. My wrist is exactly 7.5 inches and the bar doesn’t fit all the way across. And it curves awkwardly so I can’t even pass it off as a regular tennis bracelet.  My wrists are not fat at all so my only conclusion is that this bracelet was made specifically for people with tiny wrists. I should have read the description more carefully I suppose.
1.0,"I wish I took a picture of it before I threw it out. It broke on in less then a week. I noticed the tiny bead on the floor, looked at my ankle, then on the floor a few feet away, it came apart. I was a little heart broken. . I wouldn't waste my time in buying another"
1.0,Easily stretched out to not fit properly within weeks of purchase.
1.0,"Yes, they are very inexpensive and striking in color.  But the strap material stretches a little but the main thing is that the adjustment buckle slips!  This makes it useless!  Sent them back."
1.0,Zipper was broke and I’m stuck with them due to returns at UPS
1.0,Very very cheaply made
1.0,"Where do I begin, too big for a human head, did not make masks adjustable, but too big anyway! They fall off the face and not secure on the chin. Returning them!"
1.0,"Snagged this as a super cheap deal for my husband (an extra large) and this thing is so tiny (short) that it might fit me, a 110 lb girl with a short torso. I may try and wear it around the house or something"
1.0,broke first day.
1.0,"As recommended I ordered one full size larger.  My orthotic insert fit perfectly.  However, there was not enough height in the toe space to accommodate both my orthotic insert and my toes."
1.0,Not happy will be returning these. When I took them out if the bag the plastic rubber piece that sits on the side of your nose fell off -I hadn't eve put them on yet<br />They are not as large as I thought they would  be and are too loose and fall from my face
1.0,"The size ran Very small, and looked nothing like the photo. I sent it back."
1.0,Cheaply made and didnt even close to fit. I would say closer to xl in size and not 3x
1.0,"The dress didnt fit as expected or as show in in pic.  the skirt is of a heavier thicker material, while top of a t-shirt material and I did not like the combination."
1.0,Not even close to size
1.0,"These glasses were either a different strength then advertised, or defective glasses. I returned them and went to Dollar Tree instead. Their glasses work fine."
1.0,Net was bent and I couldn’t shape it to look right.  Threw it out
1.0,"These would have been so cute, but they were completely see through. I returned them."
1.0,Son lindos y buena calidad pero no son fáciles de poner ya que son muy grandes
1.0,Material is very flimsy was not what I expected.
1.0,Super weird fit
1.0,Very cheap  material.  After. 1 week  the.  Plastic  aro. Broke down
1.0,"This pajama set fit perfectly when brand new. Size small was spot on for my varying size 4 or 6. The material is soft and thin, yet breathable, which is what I look for in pajamas. After 40 minutes or so of wearing them, they had stretched and looked sloppy, particularly in the bum. Then after just one wash, I discovered this hole in a seam. Not worth the price to me. You can get something at Walmart for the half the price and better quality."
1.0,"It’s ok, you get less than what you pay for. Colors are very dull, wouldn’t purchase again"
1.0,The shirt is completely see through
1.0,Very cheaply made.  Broke second day I wore it.
1.0,It fits for a child's wrist and not for a grown woman's wrist.
1.0,Ordered this March 16…Let it soak to clean it and this is the color it changed to 😡😡
1.0,"very flimsy, not worth the dollar."
1.0,Terrible I washed it once on a delicate cycle the sweatshirt has all pilling over the item it looks terrible. I wouldn’t buy I tried to contact the seller no response of course.
1.0,A hole in the socks after wearing them once.
1.0,"I’ve only had this a week and worn it for 3 days, I notice a stone has already fallen out. Not high quality. Pay more for something better."
1.0,"Real bad print, looks like a shop grease-rag"
1.0,"En el seguimiento general que se le realiza por el sitio web indican que fue dejado en el buzón, pero no fue así, este no fue recibido por mi parte."
1.0,Very cheap looking.  Looks more like a costume. Don’t go by the pictures. It’s nothing like them.
1.0,I thought it would be great just put my fitbit on last night and now it will not come off on one side. Would have been a nice product but it's to heavy to wear all the time. Now I'm going to have to take it somewhere to get it removed. Complete waste of my money
1.0,I did not like the cut of the shirt
1.0,I was really excited to get these on a Lightning Deal. I bought the champagne color and they were beautiful. My only problem is that the sunglasses are completely crooked! One lens sits much lower on my face than the other. I wish I could exchange them (hopefully not ALL of these sunglasses are crooked) but Amazon doesn't allow exchanges for Lightning Deal purchases... Returned.
1.0,Glass frame is small and does not reach ear or sit comfortably
1.0,Wrong color.  I was expecting a white hat instead I've received a beige.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"The zipper broke when out in it on the first time. I had safety pins to hold me together, thank goodness. I wasn't in the mood to pay to send it back and didn't figure anything would be done tbh."
1.0,It's way to hard to pinch open to put it on my sweater. Cute but can't use.
1.0,Don't waste your money. Poor fit and quality. Crotch ripped out on  job a month after purchase..
1.0,"I did not like it, very big, and it is not soft at all, too rough for me"
1.0,"I normally wear XXL. I’m used to sizing being inconsistent in the larger sizes and figured it might be a squeeze. But this is just ridiculous.<br /><br />The belt and jacket are both like 6-8 inches too small to be fastened/zipped, maybe L size (not XL or XXL). The arms of the jacket are so tight around and short in length I can’t even move my arms, like they are for a real elf. The leggings are stretchy so they fit, but are so thin you can see through them. The shoes are just thin shoe covers, which is fine. The hat is low quality but fine for a costume.<br /><br />If you are smaller maybe it would fit ok. If you are larger forget it. Bummer for me."
1.0,Please be aware this slipper does NOT come with a rubber. Very upsetting.
1.0,This item is very thin material and see through! I do not recommend purchasing this
1.0,The straps are really thin likely to break easy
1.0,"The color is the only good thing about this button-up. It's itchy, the sleeves are short, and it makes you look boxy and bigger than you are.  When I bought it, it said free return and when I wants to return it I was going to charge me a ridiculous amount to send it back. So I just kept it I would have lost out on money anyways. It also had a funny smell when I got it out of the package."
1.0,Tail would not inflate. Very dissatisfied.
1.0,not mine
1.0,"Ring was much smaller than I expected, sizing was incorrect, the name on the ring was so tiny you can’t even read it, and the birthstone is so tiny you can’t even see the color. The pictures they use are a false representation of what you are actually getting. Don’t waste your money on it."
1.0,It was cheaply made
1.0,"All three tops are not the same size. The purple one is to small, the light gray one is tight in the arm pits and chest and arms, the dark gray fits perfect. I wish they all were the same size."
1.0,"These socks are so thin, and so tight!  And this coming from a very thin person.  If you you have calves at all may the sock gods have mercy on your circulation... These socks are for looks and not practical as athletic socks. They won’t absorb sweat and they will not keep your feet warm either. They’re just going to make you look sporty."
1.0,"The pants were great when they arrived. The price was fair and features of the pants were great. They fit well and looked exactly how they were advertised. However, after a few uses, the button has already fallen off. I have some craftsmanship concerns for these jeans."
1.0,Never have had an issue with masks not fitting before. These were ridiculously small. Looked cool though.
1.0,I received one with a broken zipper so I couldn't even use it.
1.0,Too small and hurts nose.
1.0,Doesn't stay clipped.
1.0,"The color of the hat is much darker than it shows in the picture.  Instead of moss, I call it a UPS brown color."
1.0,"Color started chipping off after wearing for a day.  Black ones (which are the ones I really looked forward to wearing) were “stuck” together by the paint and chipped when I pulled them apart. Due to paint chipping, my nose was getting irritated. Basically, the only ones I could wear were the silver ones that didn’t have paint....so ONLY 2 out of 16!!"
1.0,I gave it a one because the strings already broke. So now I am buying something that is going to last.
1.0,You would have to a small pre-teen or a child with no muscles at all to be able to fit this dress.
1.0,A little large and the design was different.
1.0,"I've only had this ring for a few months. The silver is coming off, it looks like a cheap copper underneath. I'm very very disappointed. Please don't waste your money."
1.0,I was expecting something soft and cotton. What I got was a polyester garbage bag. Returned without trying it on.
1.0,"Extremely disappointed. Advertised as sterling silver. However, the latch is not sterling silver. They are nickle. I have a severe allergy to nickle. Wore them on Friday thinking they were real and within two hours my ears were bright red and full of puss. Luckily I took them out before the rash moved down my neck. Nickle should be advertised people can have severe allergic reactions to them."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:7e7bf8a05c38f740b92b5d4f72005290]] Got for my son and as soon as he tried to put them on they broke. Extremely disappointed.
1.0,Yikes. Warning! It’s red poop! If it wasn’t for that I would give this a good rating. It looks nothing like the picture. It’s a bright red.
1.0,This mask ripped at the split as soon as my son tried it on..pure trash!
1.0,I wish I could say something nice but all I got was an empty envelope!
1.0,Wasn’t expecting meshy dry fit material
1.0,It was too short knee length.
1.0,The glue holding the leather into the metal clasps (which I thought would be nice) came loose after a few hours wearing.
1.0,Damn near impossible to get your cards out! Uncomfortable in back pocket.
1.0,Not worthy just one use all the stones fell down
1.0,The kept falling apart.  The back pieces fell off within 30 days of owning.  If there was a better way to adhere the two pieces I think they would be of good quality.  I realize they are ends of bullets so it did not really bother me but for ones who do not like heavy jewelry these are not for you.
1.0,Fastening ties pulled away from the body of the bracelet.  Not happy with the product.
1.0,These are basically linen cloth.  Kind of ruff and shorts are see through
1.0,Love the outfit but it was way to long
1.0,This not the same purse that is shown in the picture trying to find a way to get ahold of the sell no luck . Don’t buy if you want the exact product . If you want something close to this product it’s fine
1.0,Terrible. Socks shrunk after first wash.
1.0,Light weight and look nice but Speakers distort and crack even at moderate volume.
1.0,"The sizing is off with these leggings. I’m regularly a small in leggings & these were way too tight on my waist that it would roll down & while the mediums fit better on the waist, it would bunch up way too much behind my knees. I’m really tired of brands that make the waistbands so small & act like everyone has small waists and huge butts! If these had more give in the waist I would’ve loved them. Neither small or medium fit well."
1.0,Not what was described. Color is no where near what’s pictured. Shoe itself is cheaply made.  No point in returning because it’ll probably cost more than the sandals did. I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,This sht look like a damn rug with sequins I’m piss this is one of my bridesmaids dress. 2 sizes was the same other 2 is ugly
1.0,FAKE.
1.0,Extremely thin. Not at all what I expected. Runs small with very little give. Wouldn't be caught dead wearing these in public.
1.0,Fabric is so thin and of poor quality.
1.0,The dress got toured out in one wear.very cheap quality
1.0,This belly ring turned different colors after two weeks and leaves marks on your skin around the area it rubs
1.0,"Order what I THOUGHT was a child's 8. These things are HUGE!! they will not fit a chil, more like a teen or small man"
1.0,Not a good length too wide on tights
1.0,"My foot slid right over the front or off the sides. The “fur” is slick. Also, flat footbed, if you are someone who needs support, these won’t work. Returned."
1.0,"This hat came very poorly sewn. The pieces of fabric matched up so terribly that the hat was deformed. Also, There was an NBA tag inside an MLB hat... so, it was obviously a very poorly created knockoff. We promptly returned the item. I would NOT suggest purchasing from this seller because you have no idea if the items are going to be real or not."
1.0,"This says lifetime warranty and that it will cover repairs etc. But when my chain got broken accidentally by my dog, they denied my request saying that they don't cover accidental damage. Tell me how else is jewelry broken?! Unless it is a ring and the diamond or stone falls out, most chains or bracelets break accidentally. They say they have a plan that covers accidental damage, but it isn't listed on amazon. DO NOT BUY! I bought for in a time of need and they won't cover my $400 dollar necklace because my dog jumped up on me and broke the link. I am cancelling all 6 of my contracts with them and never, NEVER EVER buying from them again! I DONT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!"
1.0,"I'm an Amazon. Just under six feet, with swimmers shoulders and legs like a giraffe. Idk who designed this garment, but they were VERY serious about covering up the boobies with yards of material. Not so much interest paid to making the skirt portion, which is similar to a cloth for a baby doll crib."
1.0,this must be a joke  -this does not make any strap smaller - this is an extender - but first you are insulted by ridiculous instructions that make no sense.  quality is so bad.  if you need to make your strap tighter enough to merit spending money on a gadget then you must need it a good amount smaller - which the only way this might possibly work to make it smaller is by stuffing the entire side of your bra in this clip that as a result bunches the entire side in it and makes the bra lopsided.  in fact i am not sure i would trust it not to rip my bra lace.
1.0,Ordered two sizes bigger based off previous ratings and was even more disappointed.  I liked the style but too bad the sizing was so off.
1.0,Returned immediately! Material is so extremely thin and see through. No way I would put my son in those pants. Didn’t even bother showing them to him. I would advise not to purchase.
1.0,"Did not last long, carbon fiber casing has already fell apart smh!<br /><br />What can do you to help me out???"
1.0,Threw it away after weari it 2 days. The shiny metal changed color and turned brown. Don't bother...
1.0,Was very disappointed in the fit!
1.0,"I had a really nice one for many years. This was a light, flimsy from China."
1.0,"this is not at all cotton, description is a lie."
1.0,Extremely small. This item was too small for my daith. I will be returning
1.0,"no room for growing belly, not really maternity fit. It was more like fitted yoga pants."
1.0,"This is FAKE! Not Black obsidian, red plastic beads!! Held up to light and 100% fake!!  Will report to Amazon!!!"
1.0,Wrist opening is very large. Finger openings are only big enough to fit a 10 yr. old's fingers in.
1.0,"The clip on the back says in bold letters ""made in Korea"" which is not on the pictures listed. False advertising."
1.0,"The quality of the product is poor. Went to put on the sock and the moment I went to pull it up, it ripped. Wouldn’t recommend because of how easily it gives away while trying to put it on."
1.0,These looked cheap
1.0,"Broke and fell off somewhere. Lost forever, only wore it once."
1.0,"please note, these run extremely small"
1.0,"Very cheap, fingers went thru fabric. Run Large"
1.0,Avoid buying
1.0,This is a fake and very cheap quality item Watch band that is NOT worth one penny . Do NOT buy . You will be wasting your money
1.0,"I have the bright pink/purple gear fit and this was a perfect match color wise. However the band is flimsy and from the start it would come unlatched while walking, sitting at a desk, etc. Today the piece that latches it on completely FELL OFF. Sooo frustrating since my original band lasted 9 months and only needed replacing after my dog chewed it. This one didn't last a month with normal wear."
1.0,"This thing ended up in my drawer, I might pin it down on my pillow case when I want a silk pillow case effect.  But if you are looking for a great scarf to wear at night to protect natural African American hair texture, this is not it; firstly, it won't stay on.  Will find another use for it, but disappointed wasted my money on this buy."
1.0,Junk not worth the money!
1.0,My necklace turned black and I was so careful not to get it wet.
1.0,I was expecting someting better
1.0,I forgot I ordered these 2 dresses and I did. It receive them.
1.0,I didn’t like the material. The ruffles and the dress were both too big.
1.0,"Cheap feel, the paint came off and stained my wrist. The “leather” came apart after a getting installed."
1.0,"Arrived early and looked cute! Threw it in the closet and when I got around to wearing it, it had a huge hole in the side where the stitching isn’t present. Super disappointing."
1.0,Waste of my money. These backings don’t work at all. Save your money.
1.0,"Nice outfit not true to size , runs extremely small"
1.0,I got a totally wrong size! Size 44 is way too big for me and it's so unfortunate because I was looking foward to wearing these trousers next weekend for an event. And having them taken in is expensive. Also the inner lining is turned inside out at the slit end so they look weird worn. The stitches on the inner part of the trousers is outside. Its a mess at this point.
1.0,Very cheap looking. The bottom ring heart design isn't really there and the top ring stone is way thinner then the metal holding it in place which makes it look weird up close. Will not buy again or recommend.
1.0,I ordered these as a present for Christmas and when I opened the package one of the bangels were made of cardboard that started to unwrap. Crap if you ask me. Glad I knew this before I gifted them to my mom. Waste of $
1.0,No liner between the boot tongue and the actual boot. Snow infiltrates easily. Do not recommend this boot to anyone who plans on playing in the snow for long periods of time.
1.0,The metal piece around the cleaveage area was uncomfortable and not adjustable
1.0,"I have several Nike Dry-Fit, Aerobill hats and this one is made with very flimsy, easily wrinkled material. the fit is subtly different. It has a buckle strap, no Velcro adjustment, no swoosh on the back like all others.  Poor quality. I strongly suspect this is a COUNTERFEIT Nike product."
1.0,I got it and the stitching was horrible. I’m sure if it wasn’t for the the stitching it would have worked for Me.
1.0,You should probably go up a size or two.
1.0,"These are not what i thought they’d be. They’re cheaply made and are made in China. It’s my own fault for thinking these were converse (i must have not looked at the title). I bought these for a friends new baby and didn’t bother giving them to her. Instead i put them in a yard sale because i couldn’t return. If you buy them without high hopes, you should be fine."
1.0,broke after one time wear.
1.0,Muy mala calidadd
1.0,"The band would not stay connected to the watch...so disappointing.<br />Other reviewers said this, but I had hoped the problem would have been fixed! NOPE!<br />Don’t buy it!"
1.0,"Las medidas de este pantalon son horribles.<br />Pedi un tamano small y soy talla 32 y te quedan como para un anciano de 90 anos.<br />Entre este pantalon y los pantalones de payaso no hay diferencia .<br />El inseam de este pantalon en size small te diria que es como de 10 a 12 pulgadas.<br />El largo del panatalon desde la cintura hasta el final te queda como de 3 a 4 pulgadas por debajo de la rodilla .<br />Nunca havia visto un pantalon con medidas tan horribles como estas.<br />Si estas buscando ajuste y talla ""FIT"" este no es para ti.<br />Si tienes 90 anos o mas y no te interesa los ajustes puede ser que te guste.<br />Si quieres parecerte un payaso ve por el.<br />Tan pronto llego lo devolvi."
1.0,"These earrings looked so much larger in the picture. They are very, very small. You can’t really see the design or stone in them. They are definitely a child’s earring."
1.0,"i can't even return it because i have to pay shipping.  way too tight.  normally a 2x, bought 3x( biggest it comes).  took way too long to arrive- several weeks"
1.0,Gem part of earring kept falling off the wire.
1.0,"They strip pretty much immediately, not happy."
1.0,Itty bitty charm. So nit worth the money.
1.0,"there for one was no size chart and only one size, and it didnt show the size. but I gave it a try.. the martial is very cheep and not comfy, its not stretchy AT ALL, and you cant move your arms around. it looks amazing in the photos but is very bad. i am 5''3."
1.0,Way to small! It’s like kid size! Don’t waste your time or money
1.0,"Very disappointed at how cheap the fabric looks and feels.  The red I got looks nothing like the picture,its see through, shiny and even the buttons are smaller"
1.0,Middle part would not go past my shoulders or hips. If I size up it will be too long and puffy. :( returning
1.0,"I put four coats of this stuff on my all suede vans, and it did nothing to help waterproof them. I’m afraid to use them on better suede boots I have because I don’t want it to change the colors or texture of the suede."
1.0,"One of the straps that goes between the toes broke after only 3 days of wear, had to send them back.  They did have the Croc comfort.  My old Crocs have been very durable, they are my full time summer flip flops."
1.0,THREW IT IN THE TRASH
1.0,Can not use my phone while wearing them
1.0,I dislike the way it fit.
1.0,The dress was very thin quality and too tight. I ordered an XL and I wear a medium to large. It was still too small. I didnt like it. I want to send it back but it took to long to get here and may take too long to get the refund. Not a happy camper!!
1.0,"This was way smaller than I thought, I really was thinking it would have been a little bigger. So I was kind of shocked when I got it."
1.0,"The material started to pill within a week. Even though they are only a few weeks old, they look very worn."
1.0,These pants were way too small and very cheaply made.
1.0,Arrived damaged-  Sac Silver can you please contact me? Looking for a replacement still.  Thank you!
1.0,Ordered red received black. How happy do you think I should be. Not worth the trouble of shipping back. It also dose not look like a quality product. All ready in the Good Will box.
1.0,Got an unreadable dial
1.0,Much smaller than advertised
1.0,Cheap flimsy material
1.0,Not mixed sizes ! Only two sizes super long and short one
1.0,"It simply does not work, was a waste of money, unfortunately I can give it back,  it was meant to be a gift and was a shame ."
1.0,"We like this brand a lot because previous models have endured the hard task of being used by a child. They lasted more than 9 months with a use of 70%, however this model that looked very good and he loves it, did not last more than 4 weeks to present wear of the material, damage the buttonhole of the cord and to detach the tip."
1.0,"My daughter wears a size 10-12, regular girl clothes. I bought this outfit in size 14-16 just Incase 🙄 It's still small on her! 😡 It is to much of a hassle to send it back!!!!"
1.0,"This dress makes no sense. Perhaps I got a poorly made one, but I was definitely disappointed, especially after reading so many good reviews. The material is terrible. It feels soft and looks nice, but it is so unbelievably clingy in all the WRONG places. The top portion was weirdly too big and it gaped at the shoulders and armpit areas. The skirt portion was FAR TOO CLINGY, despite the loose fitting design/appearance of the dress and just not flattering at all. Definitely not what I expected and returned it immediately. Do not recommend this dress. For size reference, I'm 5'4'' about 125 pounds and I ordered a small."
1.0,"This dress was literally the cheapest thing I've ever laid my eyes on. No tag... like at all. Literally couldn't tell the front from the back. And for $40, I really expect for it to not be completely see through. Returned."
1.0,The fabric is of very poor quality. It feels like a rain jacket.
1.0,"For a large way to small even a size small would be like a little girl size, too bad, I really liked the look ,so cute"
1.0,"The material was not that good although it was listed as slim fit, the fit was extremely small."
1.0,Material very cheap feeling won't wear it. All wrinkled looks horrible very disappointed 😔
1.0,These are so cheap. Thin plastic material looks terrible.
1.0,"Looked stained and the chest is for an A-cup. The gaping was ridiculous. Low quality, returning."
1.0,Sleeves clearly asymmetric and overall too small. Will be returning.
1.0,The lemon green is more like a neon yellow
1.0,Did not match picture at all.  Buy the cheaper ones.
1.0,I gave this product one star because one of the eyes on the owl was glued on wrong the earrings don't look as nice as they do on the picture
1.0,broke after one wear lol
1.0,"Wore this once, washed and there were fuzz balls all over the front!  It looks as though I’ve had this top  for years after one wash."
1.0,"This product is VERY CHEAPLY made, plastic parts &#34;chain detail&#34; and &#34;brown fringe&#34; at bottom right is a &#34;wad&#34; of plastic.  Item is more like a child's toy.  Would not recommend this product."
1.0,Terrible quality. The middle button came off the very first time I wore it and they didn’t include a replacement.
1.0,The  necklace set looks the same as in the picture but it has got a faulty make. The metal wire used to join the necklace pieces is sticking out making it unable to wear. Returned the product
1.0,The fabric was very cheap and thin. It was sized very small.  Not acceptable for work at all.
1.0,"I purchased this item because I have another one from a different seller that I like, but they didn’t have the inscription I was looking for. This one was disappointing; mainly because of the color. The item I received was very light purple... not even close to the beautiful rich purple color shown."
1.0,These are way to big maybe due to 4 way stretch..would probably be scared to even size down for fear wld still be too big
1.0,The size chart is useless as the product is WAY too big. And I don't care for the material used.
1.0,Shredded after one wash.
1.0,"I was so excited when those arrived. Leather, nice looking, exactly what my 5yo needed for this fall.<br />Until he came back from the playground complaining that both zippers kept opening.<br />So those will be going back and now I am at square one, searching for quality fall shoes..."
1.0,It was not sturdy and came to me smashed. It looks like it would have been nice though.
1.0,Returned the purple pillow. It’s not purple.... it’s pink
1.0,Product is made cheap and is a bright red not a dark romantic red like in the picture.
1.0,Sizing to small
1.0,Fingers were cut short. Trying on the gloves was like crawling in bed and someone had short sheeted the bed. Yuck!
1.0,Came broken. Dead battery. Does not work!
1.0,"They’re warm, just...not actually suitable for touch screen. Used them once, didn’t wash them beforehand, and they don’t work well as touch screen gloves on EITHER side of the finger tips (tried both, just in case). I wouldn’t buy them for that purpose again, or at least with that expectation."
1.0,"The colors are nice and they are light weight, unfortunately 3 or the 4 pair have broken. All of them have broken around the frame and the glass falls out."
1.0,Sounded fake.
1.0,Didn't work.. every time I tried to plug the mini-pin from the camera to the drone it would not go in.. It kept bending the pins and I double checked the pin configuration and the instructions and I was doing it correctly. I am not trying to be crude but the manufacturer should be ashamed. This was the biggest piece of junk I have ever encountered.
1.0,"Edit: Changing to one star, the screws on the wrist band fell apart within two weeks and it fell of my wrist. Love the design but the build quality is terrible. Going to have to return it (luckily it broke within a month) and find a product that works.7<br />Seems perfect for the price, liking how it looks much more than the original band. Wonderful that it comes with a band removal tool as well, couldn't be happier with the experience."
1.0,Cheap material. And ugly!!!  Would never recommend this item. Terrible.
1.0,I guess I can’t even get that upset….I had a promo code and only paid $4 for this anklet. It literally started changing colors in 4 days. 🙄😣
1.0,"I ordered the ribcage jean in ""Noe Fog"" and they look nothing like the photo. The jeans that arrived are more of a solid royal blue and came with no new clothe tags/stickers on them...WTF??"
1.0,Very dissapointed!!!! Just got today! NOT RED!!! The color is hot pink. Will not be buying necklaces again on Amazon... This is the second one I orderd and it was terrible. Don't want to have to go through returns and exchanges. Guess I will let my daughter have them for dress up instead. :(
1.0,Not even close too being size as advertised
1.0,"To tightly wound, not flexible at all. I had to throw them away as the one I was trying to put in a shoe ended up with a big loop in it and would not longer thread."
1.0,"I am 5'3, 145 lb and fit into a size M for most dresses. This however did not fit at all. It barely fit around my torso (I am a 34D) and yet was too long. I returned it and will not purchase a replacement. So disappointed because the print was so pretty."
1.0,Slightly small. Took way too long to be delivered.
1.0,The Florida emblem on the front was brown not black. Looks really cheap in person.
1.0,"Cheap Shiny Fabric, Not Stretchy, Freying & Loose Stitches, Chintzey Elastic, Not true to size whatsoever. I am 5’3 150 pounds. Typically 27-28 waist and 36-37 bust. I tend to wear mediums or larges in general so when I ordered this I bought both sizes to see what fit better. NEITHER fit. I couldn’t even get the medium past my thighs. The large I could actually put on though it too was tight but one wrong move and I’d have busted a seam. Also the fit in the chest is so wrong. When wearing the large you could practically see my entire bra. I’m not sure how someone could successfully wear this. It’s not what any of the positive comments were like at all. I feel like I got an entirely different product then what the positive comments, reviews, and description suggested."
1.0,Looks horrible and is turning my skin green!! :(
1.0,"Much smaller then thought so very hard to put stuff in for a airplane ride. But have, found other uses for it.<br />It is a cute bag though. Would not buy again."
1.0,Zipper broke in 2 seconds with barely any pressure
1.0,They do not keep my feet warm. I was expecting they would.
1.0,Save your money. Quality is poor. Fit is super small. I'm a small. Ordered a medium for an oversized look. Made in China - mailed from china and the shirt was like a kids sized shirt. The company refunded part of my purchase because a return would be too expensive. Very poor quality. Not like this picture on the web.
1.0,Cute but cheap.. Screw wouldn't tighten for the back part of the earring and kept falling off. Had it in for a week and it fell out 4 times. Could find the backing the fourth time to put it back in. Had to put in my old earring until I could buy a different replacement.
1.0,"Would never buy these glasses again.  I had them less than a week; really liked how they looked on me, but within a week, one of the ear pieces fell off.  I guess the screw came out and was lost.  It's so tiny they it would be hard to replace.  Don't recommend them."
1.0,"The top in reality is a huge, batwing style, stiff long sleeve shirt designed for spongebob square pants. The bottoms are soooo skinny. I’m 5 6” 125lbs and even I think the pants are too tight"
1.0,I returned this it was useless to me:(
1.0,"Don’t order, impossible to return if it doesn’t fit, they won’t give you a refund unless to pay for shipping Which end up being as expensive as the dress itself"
1.0,Poor construction. The lettering isn’t secure and started coming off and catching on everything that it didn’t scratch.
1.0,The material was horrible the fit was terrible
1.0,"Everybody note. If you are buying this product from a seller other than Amazon.com, you might receive a fake product.<br /><br />I purchased from the seller called 101Targets and received this products after one month (since I am currently living in China. It took about 8USD to transfer from US to China.)<br /><br />What I received looked quite different from a genuine product. Immediately I contacted the developer Cocoon info@cocooninnovations.com and they said it was a FAKE product. Amazon has decided to refund me and I have reported this seller to their team for further investigation.<br /><br />If you have received your product, please compare it with the picture on the description. It should be a fake one if you find:<br /><br />1. The organization of the front side is different from the listed pictures.<br /><br />2. The back of the product is made of nylon and have a bag and chain on it.<br /><br />3. There's a website on the instructions called Grid-IT.CN, which is actually a fake website. I could not find any product there. This is another evidence that I think it might be fake.<br /><br />The back of the product is different for most of you to distinguish since Amazon does not provide its photos, neither does the official website. But I found it for you.<br /><br />The fake one: [...] (the back is made of nylon)<br />The genuine one: [...] (the back is made of leather)"
1.0,"Wrong color, I received the black belt instead of the brown"
1.0,It looks nice but it is supposed to be an 8 inch bracelet.  Not even close.  It looks like a child's bracelet
1.0,"This dress was very disappointing. It is made of cheap, thin fabric that is wrinkled. The empire waist is cut very high so if you have an A cup it might work otherwise the seam is too high."
1.0,Not even remotely as advertised. Thank goodness for free returns. Was blah and baggy and huge and plain and unfitted.
1.0,Respectfully I needed this shirt for ministry. It was way too small.  I ordered a size 20 the largest size and it fit like a size 14. I could not wear this in my wildest dreams . Way too tight doesn’t even stretch.
1.0,"I love them-they are so fun!!  I bought them for my daughter as a stocking stuffer but  they did no arrive in time.  Anyway, i love them and will send a picture of me wearing them to her and, yes, I'll get her a pair. The reviews said they could fall apart so I will be extra careful."
1.0,This is a freaking toy. Forget this. I'm sp angry. I was expecting the real thing. They lied. I took it out and this is the crap that I paid over $35 for? No. This is a rip off
1.0,The grabber doesn't even grab the card it just slips off the card. Not happy at all
1.0,"This shirt was ridiculous. Nothing like the picture. May have been made in a 7th grade home-ec class by a very uninterested student. Great for a laugh, terrible for a shirt."
1.0,Cheaply made uneven seams looks nothing like the pic.
1.0,"We have had them a couple months now as I really wanted to test and see how long they would last. They are awesome. They come with a remote to control the colors and modes, there is also a button right inside the shoe that allows them to change it themselves. They are very brite and my son LOVES them. Everyone always stops us and compliments his shoes and wants to know where to get them. I highly recommend. If anything changes I will update this review. Thanks<br /><br />Update: after about 1 month and a half lights on one shoe starting going out. Today the right shoe will not light up at all. Very upset, I feel they should have lasted longer then this. Also product flaw, the button that controls the colors/modes are located on the inner part of the shoes so as my son walks and bumps his ankles together it changes/turns them on/off. If they were located on the otter side of each shoe you'd have better control. They are a good idea, just could be better and didn't last long at all. :("
1.0,I thought it was two in the box... one ladybug doesn’t worth the price.
1.0,"Bought the same size. But obviously the blue pair are not a Large. The blue pair I just got today are a small with a Large size tag sewn into the pants. I couldnt even get one leg in and I'm a seamstress to all my cloths, because I'm short and have to alter all my cloths. This is way off in measurements to the tag size."
1.0,Dry short. And I’m only 5ft 3
1.0,Poor quality - zipper broke in less than a week. Relaxed it and the new one did the same thing
1.0,It literally twisted upwards on me with every step
1.0,"Very cheaply made and very wrinkly....very disappointed with this. It also took a long time to receive and only after I sent a couple of ""reminder"" emails. Came from China...."
1.0,Lo pedí talla M y me lo enviaron talla L extremadamente grande
1.0,Cheap . Broke before I could even put them in. Such a pity as they are very pretty
1.0,"This ball marker’s magnet is very weak.<br />I took this picture so it will show how weak the magnet is, and it barely stays on the base. Probably I’ll lose marker somewhere soon.<br />Unfortunately I dumped the packaging, so I can’t return this item. I wish that I could return this crappy ball marker."
1.0,Material fades very easily
1.0,"I was so excited to see that this hoodie was on Amazon. I've looked for it for YEARS! Imagine my disappointment when this crap was delivered. Nothing like the picture or description, the zipper isn't even diagonal, it's crooked center. The patches have single stitch on it and hanging off. It came from China and it's horrible quality. Don't make the same mistake I did. Save your money."
1.0,Never used because they smelled so bad and had sharp edges. When you breath in the plastic sucks into your mouth
1.0,Broke in one day of use.
1.0,"The design is flattering and stylish, the material was ok, however I ended up returning it since I kept getting a lot of loose fabric on my armpit area.  It looked bad.<br />I hope they fix this mistake."
1.0,The touch ring Never five the HR.
1.0,Broke already sad
1.0,"Pretty, but turned my wrist green"
1.0,"Terrible quality, cheap fabric and its printed, not woven design."
1.0,"This material is way to thin, very cheaply made and you can see through them"
1.0,I would not even give this one single star because this is such a waste of money.  This tape is even a quality lower than any cheap sticker that comes off and does not stick for even a second. I regret buying this and wasting my money on this.
1.0,Cheap tshirt that shrinks the first time you wash it. Super disappointed.
1.0,Do not buy this band.  It snags everything you wear!  The band is short too.
1.0,Shrunk to unwearable with first wash and air dry.
1.0,This watch didn't come with a charger
1.0,cute ring but they dont make it smooth on inside and it hurts after being in your finger after awhile
1.0,"Initially I these were great. After wearing them once, I have already decided to return them. The hardly rise above my butt and go all the way up my stomach no matter which way I wear them. The crotch part doesn't reach all the way up to my body so I feel like im constantly tugging at them/pulling them up all day. After one wear, holes practically lining the seams! They are the right size, that's not the issue, they're just crap. Save yourself the money. If you want a good pair of black leggings check out LuLaRoe."
1.0,So My first time hand washing and air dry the sweater and the letters are already starting to peel off.
1.0,Ordered 2 sizes larger than I normally wear so they would be loose.  When i got them they looked to be extremely smaller than what I had ordered. Needless to say these got returned the next day.. uugh
1.0,pretty but bad quality :(  rusted within a month
1.0,Received as a gag gift .......... missing diamonds on the bottom.
1.0,"Not even close to the picture, very bad quality"
1.0,Very small. Bent one of the earrings trying to get the back on. The backs do not fit either earring.  Do not buy.
1.0,Horrible all around. Ordered an XL and it fit like an XS. The material was paper thin and had holes at the seams. This is not worth ordering.
1.0,It broke right when my friend put it on. So EMBARRASSING! Do not buy this product!
1.0,"DO NOT ORDER - Hopefully, those of you who skim the reviews like I do before purchase will take heed of my warning. As an avid Amazon shopper, I'm deeply disappointed in what I paid for. This dress is cheaply made and not true to size. I ordered a 2x and what I received was nowhere near a 2x despite the tag stating it was. It was a medium-large at most. I ended up giving the dress to my sister b/c I did not want to deal with the hassle of returning it. My sister is a about a size 8 in dresses and it was a little small on her. She is roughly 5'5 and it rarely covered her butt. It is not flowy as shown in the picture and made of thin material.<br /><br />Do not buy. If for some reason you still decide to, go up 3 sizes."
1.0,Too small to put on with a hip surgery
1.0,Two of the three were broken when they got here. I like the one that isn't broken but its hard to take out as well. Would not recommend.
1.0,The words run off the pendant so you can't even read it. Very disappointed as it was to be a gift. I had to return it.
1.0,Really pink. The seams are huge and stick out well pass my daughter's leotard. They ripped in no time.
1.0,"Not a fan of these sunglasses, the lenses are narrow so they don't cover my eyes very well and the frame sits far from my face allowing even more light around them! Wish I wouldn't have wasted my money on this item."
1.0,this product was way to small for my daughter i ordered a 4-5 T and I received a maybe a 18 month size. Not impress
1.0,Absolutely a waste of money. The 'pivot' point broke in just a few uses rendering the glasses dead! Don't bother.
1.0,Broke after wearing it for one day. Had to send it back on pieces
1.0,Cheaply made. If this wasn’t as inexpensive as it was I’d return it. It’s literally a cheap hat with a poor quality Curious George image stuck onto it.
1.0,"I normally love colorful koala yoga pants, they are amazing. But for whatever reason the tie dyed pants are completely different. I purchased a total of 3 pairs and returned all of them. They peel horribly after wearing 1 time!  I neglected to take photos before I sent back. If your looking at buying this brand, I definitely recommend them they are great, however stick to the other colors & designs NOT THE TIE DYE, they are awful."
1.0,Cheap fAbric.
1.0,This is fake
1.0,"Would have probably really enjoyed them, if some of the flowers weren't broken or not even attached to the frames."
1.0,They were so bad they all broke.  I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,Broke almost instantly.
1.0,"I wear a size 2x or 20. I bought a 3x to make sure it fit, since it says it runs small. Not even close!! This is more like a women's medium. Very disappointed!"
1.0,Garbage. It’s a piece of elastic with flimsy clips. Fell apart when trying for the first time.
1.0,"Very cheaply made, definitely not leather"
1.0,The leather is broken thru the inside layer I don't think it's going to last long. This is a very inferior product.
1.0,I threw it away!
1.0,It was a keychain and not a bracelet as promised very disappointed. As it was a birthday gift....
1.0,The jacket was to big it was a large and I ordered a 2T
1.0,The neck of the shirt completely came off after only one wash!!!! Very poorly made strings hanging everywhere I just tossed the shirt which sucks bc I liked this outfit
1.0,Not a wrap dress.
1.0,Charm is fine but clasp broke 1st day.
1.0,"The patterns are nice. That said, it is not silk and the advertising is not deceptive but outright as lie. They have multiple tags on the item stating it is silk when it is not."
1.0,"First of all, I didn’t even receive the item I ordered. I ordered the dark blue dot color and received the mint blue with dots (which is funny because that one supposedly doesn’t have prime shipping). Second, it has scratches and picks in the material, not to mention some stains. The main emblem is also crooked. Overall, the quality is shoddy. Thin, flimsy material. Not happy with this purchase. Wanted to use it for my Disney trip next week, but I’m returning immediately. Granted, this is a cheap item, but it wasn’t worth “saving” the money."
1.0,Would have loved it but runs too small
1.0,I have to return this. the magnetic clasp doesnt hold.
1.0,breaks at clasp have ordered 5 and all broke terrible clasp this is not right
1.0,"One star because this is not the sweatshirt I was expecting based on the photos. The color in the photos is way more of a blush or dusty pink, in reality this is bright, highlighter pink. I also was expecting a different texture based on the look in the photos but this is really just an average Walmart grade bright pink sweater. I was going to return but the seller takes the cost of shipping it back out of your return and it was not worth it to me. The sweatshirt still fits and is comfy enough. I’m just disappointed because it was not the color/texture I was expecting. At least I’m working from home right now so it doesn’t matter what I wear. Would not wear this color out of the house tho as it is just not my style."
1.0,It's poor quality. Looked pretty ugly. Doesn't fit well. Makes you look out is shape. No shape wear can fix it.
1.0,Being kind giving it one star awful would not recommend for anyone period!!
1.0,very disappointed.  cheap looking.<br />Sending back tomorrow.<br />Gail F.
1.0,Wouldn’t know because I was sent a computer chip for who knows what but it wasn’t for a bracelet!! Very upset as this was suppose to be a gift
1.0,The center was not line up with  the bill
1.0,Too thin not flattering at all
1.0,Way too small! Not for a woman maybe a small child.
1.0,Only received 2 tops
1.0,Takes up more space than if I just put my stuff in ziplocks. Not practical
1.0,"No is for samsung gear s2, wrong information. And return cost me the same of the product. Trash."
1.0,not even sure what this is supposed to be or who would wear it. I used the belt for a different costume. the hat is silly and has nothing to hold it on.
1.0,"Unfortunately the quality of the shirts is very poor. I ordered 12 shirts and they were all of poor quality. I ordered at the end of 2019 and the quality of the shirts was good. I don’t know why the quality of the shirts has changed, but I know it will be the last time to order shirts from them."
1.0,"I know this is a cheap kids costume, but it is really poorly made. The serging on the sleeves and collar are so loosely sewn that they are already freying without every being worn yet. The headband is complete garbage. The ears slide all over the band and when my 2 year old actually has the headband on her head the ears stick out so it doesn't lay flat on her head, it just falls off."
1.0,"Caming diferent color and  duty with  black  spots  and smell  wired, I don't  like  it"
1.0,I ordered these in ivory but they were yellow when they arrived. I tried to wash them to fade the bright yellow color but no luck. Disappointed.
1.0,I was disappointed the real brand iconic luxe fits well and is way more comfortable accidentally got this one
1.0,El material es de muy mala calidad. No se parece en nada a la foto.
1.0,"Not chromed like in picture, looks ready to rust. Chain does not lay flat.  Not worth it.  Best part of purchase was the fast free delivery and easy return. Thanks Amazon Prime."
1.0,I ordered an XL for my sister who is just slightly taller than me. There is absolutely no way it’s an XL! It fits like a small-medium. She gave it back to me. Super disappointed since it was for her birthday… I’m not sure how everyone else is having a great experience and I ended up with something way too small.
1.0,Looks nuthing like the pic
1.0,Oh my how horrible nothing like the picture !!!! So chessey looking not like the picture  horrible don’t order !!!!!!!!!!! Fits good looks cheap and ugly not at all at alllllll like the pic!!!!! Not even a star just had to put one to save others from waste if there money!!!!!
1.0,"Dislike, string broke after a few months"
1.0,Never worked. Wouldn’t clasp shut
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:376bc032662345d89fcd4fdc9569d9b1]] The hook to attach the strap to the glasses is not adjustable. These are for glasses where the end of the arm is thicker than the rest of the arm. For glasses where arm is slim from hinge to tip, these slide right off. See attached video."
1.0,Seal fell off after just a couple of uses. Bad adhesive
1.0,Sizing is inaccurate and a strap was not sewn to one of the shoulders.
1.0,These shoes are horrible and apparently poorly made.  They got holes in the toe area in a matter of a fee weeks after arriving.  Never have had this problem with any of his other shoes.  I sent the seller an email about this and they have yet to respond from me.  Will never buy anything from this seller again because he doesn't respond back if there is an issue and his product did not hold up
1.0,This item is very cheap. It popped as soon as I wrapped it around my waist.
1.0,"Ordered a medium, but item is way too small."
1.0,Didn't fit even though I purchased the size that I would normally wear.
1.0,Hole formed in seam on first wear. Ordered a size up and still came too small. Fabric quality isn't as great as I expected from merino. Overall disappointed and will never buy this brand again. My cheap store-bought underwear are more comfortable.
1.0,I am not impressed with these glasses -  I don't see any difference if I can gather info together I do plan on returning for a full refund.<br /><br />Didn't meet my expectations at all!!!!
1.0,This item broke the first day we received it. The metal was rusted and looked like it had been used.
1.0,you can see the casting lines
1.0,I am so disappointed it is as if a Democrat make this mask and made it so the message would not show when you wear it.  the mask has pleats and the message does not show like the false advertising on the website.  Avoid buying this until the fix the product defect.
1.0,I actually loved this watch until a month after the eligible to return date when the watch completely stopped working :( I attempted to contact the seller with no response... It could very well be that I got the one faulty piece and the rest work fine who knows. but i am rather sad that this purchase is money lost on my part...
1.0,Made out of bad material. Itches!
1.0,The Mask Did Not Sit Comfortably On Face. Too Big.
1.0,This is not the product I ordered. I ordered the Arsenal scarf and got a Germany scarf
1.0,5’2” 108 and small was huge.
1.0,"I bought these with the intention of actually wearing them, well that went wrong. I put them on and instantly realized the person these are made for isn't human.... they give you a wedgy and plumbers butt at the same time, and God forbid you have actual genitalia because they will not allow you to have it fit without discomfort. Frankly if you're wanting to torture yourself, buy these, if not, buy just name brand."
1.0,Necklace I was insuring was returned.  No need for it.
1.0,There are no ear loops or spots on the mask for ears what so ever as shown in the picture of this item while the material is nice this is not what was described and shown
1.0,Poor workmanship--first erring broke before using.
1.0,"I was extremely disappointed in this item and the communication with the seller. I requested my money back and they did not respond. The item runs very small is extremely poor quality the bottom of the dress isn't even hemmed. They surged the bottom and left it completely unfinished. It's very sheer, much more suited to be a nightgown. I would not recommend this item or seller. Take your money elsewhere."
1.0,"Bought this dress as a swim coverup. It fit great, UNTIL WASHED. Wore it one time, received compliments then washed it and line dried it. It shrunk at least 2 sizes. I can no longer even get it over my hips. Unfortunately my &#34;return time&#34; has passed so I'm stuck with a dress that's WAY too small. Buyer beware."
1.0,Poor quality and not cute
1.0,Had to return the ring the stones feel out
1.0,They do not stay in place at all
1.0,The cheapest material for a T-shirt
1.0,broke and came apart first time wearing
1.0,very nice thanks
1.0,"This is simply a disposable, one time use product. These look good at night, but have zero durability.<br />The wires are not insulated. Only a thin enamel coating over bare wire. Twisting the wire around spokes causes short circuit and the lights fail quickly.<br />A string of battery powered Christmas lights would be much more durable."
1.0,"The shirt would have been great.... if the print on the front wasn't crooked,  this was the first time I ever ordered clothes on line... not pleased at all"
1.0,Loved the shoes but returned them because amazon's price was much higher than Neiman and amazon refused to pricematch.  Hence the 1 star.  The boot itself is beautiful but runs 0.5 size larger.
1.0,It is entirely to large for what I wanted.  The only part that is leather is the suede flap.  The hardware is cheap looking and the overall bag is not worth the price!
1.0,Fits like crap
1.0,"These are NOT computer glasses!  They are just cheap reading glasses, not designed for anything more than 8 inches from your face.  What a waste of time and money!"
1.0,"The ring does not hold its size at all. It is easily stretched while just wearing it and not taking it off. Not a good choice, get another ring."
1.0,"the fabric is VERY thin and cheap, and the sizing runs about 2 sizes too small"
1.0,"it looks nice but broke the first time I wore it,"
1.0,Very cheap and terrible fit - puffy in the front.
1.0,"Material very thin, color looks very different almost clear very translucent the fit is flow and just weird. I couldn't get a return through the seller they offered 1/2  refund from seller so I ended keeping it and trashING it"
1.0,They broke the first time my son put them on!
1.0,I wear a large. Thus wrap around is HUGE. Way too big. It also is very uncomfortable. The Velcro sticks up and scratches me. I would never buy it afain
1.0,"If you love the nostril burning unpleasant smell of PVC glue,  then this mask is for you."
1.0,This watch did not even last 1 day<br />I kept wearing all the time to ensure it gets wound but will not work.<br />Had to return - gladly seller refunded full amount.<br />I guess with this price you can not expect a quality automatic watch.
1.0,"button hole was way too small for button. Outside of US, cost more to send back than the product. Very dissatisfied."
1.0,broke after 2 weeks
1.0,Too small. Became ankle socks
1.0,Poorly made and sized.  The material is very cheap.
1.0,Chain is really fine and the whole thing looks cheap.
1.0,Poor cheap quality. Super thin material. More like a long sleeve shirt than a sweatshirt. You would need a sweatshirt to go over it.
1.0,This is not authentic!! Cheap material used
1.0,"I ordered this band to replace a Genuine Seiko Z20 Band, however it does NOT fit properly. Although the lug dimensions are correct at 20mm — this band is wider overall than my Seiko Z20 original & the flared portions of this replacement band are very-much wider than the watch lugs (approx. 4mm wider than the corresponding portion of a genuine Z20 band). Besides looking odd when installed, those flared portions catch on my clothing & also made installing the band difficult.<br /><br />The band does appear to be well-made, but — for my purposes — it's unusable. If you're shopping for a replacement band that looks & fits like a genuine Z20 watchband, you will need to look elsewhere..."
1.0,"Cheaply made, tight in the chest area"
1.0,wrinkles and size is off
1.0,Material is way too thin
1.0,Is not the same color
1.0,Won't do the job. Was returned.
1.0,Item is defective when received.
1.0,Broke in 2 days
1.0,I ordered the 8’ inflatable for my yard and received a Halloween costume. 😳 I had to double check myself and see if I made a mistake when I ordered the inflatable and I didn’t. I ordered the correct item pictured.<br />I’ve never had a amazon order messed up until now. Very disappointing.
1.0,"My son loved this lunch box, and It didn’t even last 2 months! He’s so sad!"
1.0,It doesn’t look original.  I kept it but was disappointed
1.0,Material is like a swim suit and the fit is terrible. I returned it right away.
1.0,I really love these pants but I have ordered them twice and I order the small and they send an XXL. This has happened twice and it’s very frustrating.<br /><br />Edit: three times they’ve sent an XXL instead of a small. Total bull.
1.0,Gross uncomfortable 😕
1.0,3sizes too small
1.0,Bought an XL it felt like a medium and the material was very thin.
1.0,"I ordered these because my feet sweat in my shoes during the winter, the socks become damp, then my feet become cold from the moisture. These were advertised as a solution to just that. They did not prove to be so for me. In these socks, my feet still sweat, the socks still become damp, and my feet still become cold from the moisture."
1.0,"Super cheesy and flimsy. Felt like it was going to fall out when in the nose since it was so short, not much to hold it in there."
1.0,"The bra cups were permanently wrinkled. They smelled of chemicals and the tissue packaging that filled the cups looked like they had been left wet. The bra and package look like it was ran over by a car and left in someone’s attic for a decade. That bad! I ordered a 38C and I received what looked like a 34B with the wrong tag placed on it. There was no salvaging it. If worn, you would see the horribly wrinkled cups thru any shirt. I gave it one star because the color was nice, but don’t buy it. It’s a big disappointment. It’s not even worth the effort of returning it."
1.0,quality is horrible. i've ordered 3 necklaces from this company about a year ago and they were great. i'm not sure what happened with quality control. super dainty and cheap chain and name plate is SOOO thin and would bend so easily :( not happy at all. even the box they shipped it in is not the same. it was some cheap printed cardboard box... wish i could return. (1st two pics are from my order a year ago- cannot even compare to the junk I just received!)
1.0,The dress has no tag and smells of deodorant. Clearly it’s an old and worn dress send to me. I am extremely disappointed.
1.0,Not what I expected.  It's nothing like the picture
1.0,Can't  wear it too large
1.0,Horrible mask was too small
1.0,It may have fit me when I was 5 wouldn't even fit over my head. Giving this to a friends 10 year old
1.0,Material is thin and clingy
1.0,Horrible!  So hard my grandaughter could not wear it because it hurt soo much. Complete waste of money!
1.0,"Weird material, I sent it back-recycled plastic feel.  It was so sheer I never even tried on so I'm not clear on the size or how it ran."
1.0,I have been a size zero for many years and have worn various brands. These are NOT sized correctly.
1.0,I like the material and the style but the sizes that I ordered were too small by 2 sizes. I had to give them away.
1.0,White was dingy even out the package..
1.0,I will have to return it back as the bag has faulty zipper
1.0,"Terrible quality. I wore the shirt for the first time today and halfway through work, I discovered that there is a hole on the side seam. This hole is unfixable and is about 2 inches long. Luckily I had on a bra, or I'd be giving everyone a show."
1.0,nice design but bad stitching quality.  this shirt will fell apart after couple washes.
1.0,"not a good fitting garment,  far too small. cheap felt like material."
1.0,I didn’t like them they were broke
1.0,"Not appropriate for an adult.  In the picture it's shown with a nice drop.  There is no drop so even with an extender it just looks wrong.  Disappointing for American west.  I think the reason it hangs wrong is how lightweight the cord and the silver are.  Both parts of the necklace are the same length.  I tried to attach pictures, not sure if they show."
1.0,Cheap material i wear a large bought a xl and it didn't fit
1.0,It look like the rats had ahold of it and chewed holes in it. if I know that was going to look like a rat's nest I would not have bought it
1.0,"Just got these today and as soon as I took them out of the package and felt how thin they were, I was disappointed.  Then I compared them to a genuine Oakley lens and these flex and twist like they're half the thickness (and they kind of are).  I put them into the Oakley M frame and they fit fine.  Put the nose bridge on and right away can tell the sizing is off.  The bridge fits on there but the lens cutout for it is a bit longer.<br /><br />I'll update this and when I use them for riding within next day or so.  I don't think they will be very impact resistant at all though.  I already ordered a genuine Oakley replacement lens because this is the second generic replacement lens I tried and disappointed with."
1.0,"It’s a beautiful design with mirrors and color is vibrant. BUT.. the color rubs off on skin and other clothes. Be careful! Not satisfied only for that reason, unfortunately had to return it."
1.0,"Waaaaay too long, but the design was pretty cool.<br />I'm 5'5"" and ordered a medium. The length reaches down to my knees. When I tuck it in, it looks like I bulged😕."
1.0,"I thought I would be one of the lucky ones, but I wasn't. I bought an extra large just in case (even though I'm usually an adult medium), and even then it is pure s***. For one, it's spandex, not cotton. Two, it should be considered a child's small. And three, I ordered black, it's definitely navy blue and see-through because it's so tight."
1.0,What a joke.  I bought 3x and you will need to be the size of a 5 year old.  Rip off
1.0,"Perhaps these are designed for smaller faces, as I could not get these goggles to seal around my eyes. Tried everything. Most goggles, you just press on your face, and they stick due to vacuum seal. Skirt around goggles was too long at the nose. Skirt material had dry texture. Bottom line - I couldn't get these to seal, so I returned them."
1.0,Cheaply made stones missing and snags clothes
1.0,No me llegó nada de producto nomás disen q es perdió ni me ofrecen solucionarlo
1.0,Impossible to wear- looks like it’s made to fit a 5 year old
1.0,Style doesn't look like the picture. Runs very small. I ordered a 3x fits like a large
1.0,"The poster came in bent in half with the middle of it just bent, making it ripped a bit and creased. I didnt know that's how I was gonna receive it.wow."
1.0,ORDER UP!
1.0,Poor fabric. Poorly made
1.0,The jacket came in a repackaged box and was missing the hoodie. This is a very expensive jacket to be missing a piece.
1.0,I loved this shirt. I was so excited to get it. The sleeves are rolled up and sewn which i do not like. But I cannot wear this shirt because the neck of it is so stretched. I’ve washed it and folded it instead of hanging it and the neck is stretched and folds up like a stretched collared shirt. It is horrible. I am disappointed.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:f416327e2ca1b82cfa4d7b3079798291]] It
1.0,I must've blacked out reading the description.  This joker is really like some straight up cheap 70's polyester; not the kind of material you'd expect for a track suit
1.0,I ordered size 12 because that's my shoe size. These are more like a 10. They do not fit at all.
1.0,Got the shields and was disappointed in the size. I tried one on and did not even come close to fitting. These are made for a kids head. I even had my wife try it on and the shield came right up to her nose. She is only 5’4 and small.<br />If you buy this hope you have a very small head!
1.0,"Very poor size chart. Has a hole in the pocket. I should have bought large or XL. I hate repackaging, returning, repurchasing with different size... Yuk."
1.0,Only received one point it appears in the ad that you receive them all!
1.0,material too thin...no lining & print was wonky.
1.0,"Not but lifting.  These are see through,  thin junk.  Don't waste your money.  They took forever to arrive and it's a huge disappointment"
1.0,Ok so I ordered a 4X because I wanted an oversized sweatshirt the packaging said 4X as well and I got excited because every other sweatshirt I have ever ordered online was size small when I ordered it over three sizes bigger than my actual size but the hoodi turned out to be about a size large ripping people off
1.0,"If these are 100% bamboo than I'm Shaquille O'Neal. These are cheaply made plastic sunglasses made to LOOK like bamboo. Don't be a sucker, find some legit ones."
1.0,"returned.. ordered xxl and still too small, looked like a size 5.."
1.0,I bought these same fangs last year and they are horrible. The fangs do retract but you have to use your tongue to move this flat plastic piece right in the middle of the fangs. The plastic piece was constantly rubbing up against the roof of my mouth and it hurt. They are impossible to talk in and they constantly kept falling off of my teeth. It was a waste of money.
1.0,The stones where falling g out of it from the start had it on for an hours and 8 of them fell out all in all not worth the money I wasted
1.0,"I returned these shorts due to odd fit. The shorts have 2 different kinds of fabric which might have worked well if they were vertically oriented; however, the mesh fabric starts on the hip and then moves diagonally across the front. As a result, the shorts hung and moved oddly on my body. Lastly, the legs on the pair i received were slightly different lengths."
1.0,No me gustó no es plata el producto
1.0,"I bought this outfit in size (L). Because I’m a large. Biggest mistake everrrrr. This thing is like a sailboat on me, you could fit 10 people in it. There size chart isn’t true to size at all. Please sisters buy two sizes down from your size. Thank me later."
1.0,Didn’t even embroider in the colors I requested.  This kind of defeats the whole “personalization” purpose huh?  🤦🏼‍♂️
1.0,Item arrive frayed near the pockets.
1.0,"Bottom came HALF empty<br />Dont buy it, its a scam"
1.0,"The band is pretty. It will not hold its sizing. As you wear it, it stretches larger and larger. Money wasted!"
1.0,"This product was not as advertised. The fiber content was listed on Amazon as Rayon, and lace. The actual product is 95% polyester and 5% spandex. It feels like plastic and the lace is scratchy. I will never wear this product.  I would have returned it except that I was called out of town unexpectedly due to a family emergency and my return window passed."
1.0,Didn't work for me!
1.0,"Looks nothin like the pics. Product got no shap . Fabric is gross, like sweater material. Thick and fuzzy on the inside."
1.0,"It ripped after one wash! Also, it has not shape to it"
1.0,"Terrible, huge, lines are jagged, poor craftsmanship."
1.0,Received flip flops today for my granddaughter's birthday and I did not receive the correct product instead of unicorns I received a pair that said mermaids - since her birthday is tonight I am going to take them and see if she likes them and if not then I will be returning-  kind of disappointed as it was the last item to put in her birthday bag to match unicorn bathing suit and beach towel
1.0,I couldn’t believe the price they are charging.  This belt and it’s materials should be like less than 10 bucks.  Plastic super thin and it’s gonna break and the quality?  Well not much to say there.  Save your money and get one of those nylons belts with the metal buckle.  This thing is worthless.
1.0,Looks cheap..
1.0,"This product isn't what it's labeled: ""V28 Women's Cute Socks with Owls Pandas Tigers Foxes Various Pattern Mixed Colors"". It is children's sized-socks. We ordered as a gift and will have to return them as they are much too small. Very disappointing."
1.0,"It is too small. I used the sizing chart. I want my money back, please (in return for the dress). It’s marked a size 12 in the garment."
1.0,"This is a knock off product, cheaply made, doesn't fit correctly. It's a shame that Amazon allows this. So beware.... You have been told!!!  Update: I contacted Wiley X, they have informed me that they are not affiliated with Amazon at all. I told them it was a sealed package with Wiley X logo. They told me it was not there product."
1.0,This is hands down the worst dress I've ever purchased. It was sewn incorrectly and could not be untangled to accurately put it on. It was also ripped at the seam in the back. Total and complete waste.
1.0,"The large fit me as expected, but one of the pockets ripped off on the first wear with only a few pieces of paper."
1.0,I returned these immediately. The lenses don't curve at all so the glasses just go straight across and don't look flattering.
1.0,The pictures show an adorable 1 piece.<br /><br />The item that came was 2 pieces.
1.0,The box came damaged with Stickers on it and I'm missing a few pieces out of it not happy with this
1.0,Bought this for my husband and it didn't work.
1.0,The crystal has already fallen out of one of the hickies. :(
1.0,This blue glitter plastic filling wave ring is flawed with the metal and the glitter filling on the ring.. has a nasty looking jagged spot that sticks up and another with a dip with no plastic blue glitter filling this gap and no print of 925 stamped anywhere so not sure if it’s even sterling silver.. will return and not worth 1 dollar.. it’s China crap don’t buy
1.0,"I only received 3 face masks instead of 4 pc. Also, it did not meet my expectations as to what it described. I’m very unhappy because the masks you show on your Ad look so perfect and well made but it’s just the opposite! The wire for the nose poked my skin because it was out of the fabric and the threads are still hanging making it look so cheaply made! I’m not going to the Post Office again just to return this. Will just give them away if someone likes them."
1.0,This Keychain broke before having for even a week. The screw came loose and the Keychain opened. This resulted in lost keys.
1.0,Can not see design when worn as a mask.
1.0,It shows glittery band and its a plain band. No glittery anything.  Picture shows glitter ring for watch face. But nothing. Just a band which wasn't cheap.
1.0,Seller has not refunded money for a product returned over 2 weeks ago. Size was not accurate.
1.0,"This is NOT a dress for any woman that is taller than maybe 5'5''!  I am about 5'8 and I put this on and even lifting my arm 1 inch and my WHOLE butt was completely showing!  It is the shortest &#34;dress&#34; ever!  You would have to be very petite and short to wear this as a dress.  It might make a great shirt for us tall girls, but even then the quality is bad!  The sequins were flying off as soon as I got it out of the bag.  I do not recommend this product at all!  I returned it immediately for a refund."
1.0,"This band does look to be a sleek choice, but mine came unlatched and I dropped my watch out of my vehicle while driving through a parking lot. Not a good day."
1.0,Dress is too small and I got a size larger than what I wear. I will be returning the dress blouse and blazer.
1.0,Not again
1.0,"Said 10.5, was not, much smaller - returned."
1.0,Didn’t  the fit too small bought 2x short nor did care the material
1.0,This is a cheap knock off.  It has a solid wire design that you can bend but they are not foldable as the description suggests.  Showed up earlier than expected but still not even worth the $5 they cost.
1.0,"I bought this jacket in an XXL for $45 and is probably worth $20.  At the time it had no reviews. The XXL is more like a medium. It has one layer. Which is one I wanted.  As far as waterproofing goes,  I have no idea as it went right back in the package."
1.0,The bottom is a cardboard box which means you have no way of washing this bag.
1.0,I did not care for this mask. It was very itchy and  ended up in the trash.
1.0,"I bought these to pull thistles, but the thorns and prickly parts went right through them. No more protective than regular fabric gardening gloves."
1.0,Everything on this things started falling apart within 8 months or so. Two of the number marks fell off and the trim around the date fell apart too. I reached out to Bargains N More to let them know. Never seen this happen to a watch and I'm a big collector. Had bought this for my dad. You get what you pay for I guess.
1.0,Terrible quality on the stitching
1.0,It doesn't stay on and makes your face sweat
1.0,"The necklace looks nothing like it does in the picture.  I know its costume jewelery but it looks terrible, i sent it back."
1.0,This is giving warm feeling. The bad or worst thing about this item was not staying in your ears. I got pull to my ears every 2 minutes. 🙄
1.0,While the dress is in my size I enjoy a much looser fitting dress. Definitely if you are like me but a size up!
1.0,Worst item I’ve ever purchased. Do not recommend for anyone. Can’t breath with thing on.
1.0,"This shirt was small enough for a 6 year old.  XL maybe in China but not here in the US, what a joke.  now I have to pack it up and send it back.  Not happy at all with this vendor or item."
1.0,"I gave it away, it was WAY to small. Thanks for nothing..."
1.0,The size 6-7 fits my daughter in length (she turned 6 today and is the shortest in her class) and there is enough room for a soccer ball in the body part of the leotard.  Adorable print though
1.0,Love the shirt but to small if u have boobs
1.0,"These fit VERY small, I suggest 1-2 sizes up than your regular size. They also sent me the wrong color. I received red instead of fuscia."
1.0,This is so small it would be lucky to fit a child. Well made for what it is but don’t expect to wear it.
1.0,"The fabric is little harsh and thin, not good quality."
1.0,This bracelet will tarnish.
1.0,"Awful, cheap material.  Very poorly constructed. Fit was totally off. This came with attached straps, that hiked up the neckline, and the front hem of the dress. So, not even strapless, as featured. Fabric was also not flowy a pictured, just heavy and ugly.  Length was too short/not as pictured. One of the worst, most ill fitting, low end garments I've ever encountered THE WORST.  DO NOT BUY."
1.0,Very poorly glass cut and nose area
1.0,One 32 days in and these have ripped. I don't even wear them daily or in harsh conditions.<br />Really wish I could get my money back.
1.0,"Este es un producto de mala calidad , no recomiendo sus compra"
1.0,"Being a ""sports"" mask, I bought this to use at the gym. About 30 seconds on the treadmill and the mask was already falling off the edge of my nose. No matter how loose or tight I make it, it always managed to work its way down my face and off the end of my nose. Super annoying.<br /><br />Wearing it while lifting weights was equally annoying. It's pretty hard to breath in this thing, to the extent that I was getting light-headed. Also, the design is pretty poor. The filter doesn't slip inside the mask, it just slips between the mask and your face making this mask itchy and uncomfortable to say nothing of sweating directly all over the paper filter.<br /><br />This mask would work fine as overkill as the grocery store, but as a ""sport"" mask, it's unusable. I'm returning this immediately."
1.0,"Very cheap materials. One of the soles ripped off within a few weeks of wearing them. I didn't expect great quality for $40, but these are extremely flimsy."
1.0,Poor quality.  Fabric wrinkles and looks cheap.  SHRUNK when washed.
1.0,"Thin material, doesn’t fit. Can’t be returned because you have to cut a hole in the top to fit over the top of the umbrella."
1.0,"It did not work for me 2 months... after I purchased it, I regret it.."
1.0,"After one wash the lace looks like trash. Also cut is weird in he too, makes my boobs look smaller yet somehow make them peek out too"
1.0,TERRRRIBLE. It doesn’t look anything like pictures.
1.0,"I'm not sure if it was a manufacturing error, or what happened, but I only actually received one bracelet. The other 2 were super long, like maybe the machine didn't cut where it was supposed to.  I emailed them twice, and never heard back anything from the company, so I just returned the items for a refund"
1.0,"This package was delayed 3 times, then everything was missing but the sweater, very disappointing, it's going back!"
1.0,The silver portion went dark in no time.
1.0,That it's still in the box cause it didn't come with the pic show chain it was a cheap broke chain was not satisfied.
1.0,"These shoes are so cute. However, the bow fell out from the shoe within the first 5 minutes of wearing them! Returned."
1.0,They do not work at all I plan on sending them back it was a waste of money.
1.0,I never write bad reviews but I want everyone to know do not buy this hat. I really wanted a white benz hat so even though I didn’t see the best reviews I gave it a shot. This is the cheapest hat I’ve ever seen! I wouldn’t even wear it to workout in.  It also had finger prints all over it but that wasn’t even the worst part. I didn’t even attempt to give it away I was so embarrassed. Garbage dumpster fire!
1.0,Opened or snapped with the slightest pull.
1.0,Just not what I was expecting. The materials go together well to me. Both materials were  cumbersome. Cute design wrong materials. Sorry.
1.0,I ordered these socks and I received a bracelet for men! Very disappointed!
1.0,If you wear a large size buy a xl or 2x to fit a large size
1.0,"This honestly didn't have any affect for me and my fiance. I bought two, both wore them for a while, and then didn't wear them for a few days and felt no change. First day we felt something positive but we believe it was the placebo affect because we read the great reviews and what it does, so we went in thinking it was going to do all these good things for us. Sadly after day one we felt nothing. His that I bought actually caused his skin to breakout after 2 consecutive days of wearing it, and it caused blisters to form because he's allergic to nickel and has sensitive skin. I want a refund and would not recommend this product."
1.0,This is nothing more that a piece of fabric with a few beads stitched inside. There is no cooling whatsoever. I bought it to replace one I had purchased at an outdoors store that was awesome. I guess I'll have to go drive to that store and get another one. This one is a waste of money.
1.0,It was very streched out and the laces were falling apart
1.0,Beautiful style but poorly made due low grade material (unstretched) & zipper.
1.0,"Very flimsy, broken within 24 hours"
1.0,"Nice wuality, but the hem on the leg is too short - as soon as you sit they roll up and do not stay flat, showing a line when you stand."
1.0,"I really love the quote but....Should of ordered from a veteran owned company. Hat fits small sizes, poor quality screen printing."
1.0,Cheap material will be sending back
1.0,"The white turban was too thin, cheap material, but had some elasticity. Not worth the price. Don't do it.  I had to return it."
1.0,"Poorly constructed bag. Made of cheap material. Bought this bag for a trip to Asia and it fell apart within the first 2 days I used it. Zippers came off first, then the straps and lining ripped. Not worth the money."
1.0,The lining is WAY TOO SMALL
1.0,Had to return it.  Didn't fit the phone andied all the button spots & holes were slightly off.
1.0,"Broke as soon as I put it on. Cheaply made, you’re better off going with someone a little more expensive but with higher quality on Etsy."
1.0,Spring broke.
1.0,I really liked the product it was very comfortable but the clasp broke after three or four uses. Would not recommend to purchase.
1.0,I couldn’t get it to charge or turn on. Had to return it
1.0,Horribly hard to get in--I gave up!!!!
1.0,Front & Back?????
1.0,DISLIKE THE RING I GOT WAS FAKE SILVER COATING PEELED RIGHT OFF
1.0,Too small..
1.0,"One glove was ok, the other so small I had to cut it to get,y hand in"
1.0,"I've been buying YLA for 3 years and I'm familiar with their product line and fit.  The quality of their products have dropped off a cliff.  These short didn't last 4 weeks, 8 trips to the gym.  Stitching came out and now there is a hole in the back.  Where the stitching came out wasn't under stress, its simply cheap quality.  Save your money, look for a better product, these won't last and YLA doesn't stand behind their product.  I'm extremely disappointed in quality and lack of response to me reaching out to them about my experience."
1.0,This is not a one size fits all. It runs very small. I am returning it.
1.0,I bought the bag as a bridesmaid gift and could not use because the picture and writing was upside down.
1.0,Gave these two tops to Good Will.
1.0,I orden February birthstone and received a blue stone. I believe that's March
1.0,No. Just no. I received a heavily tarnished item (scratched and darkened). The item does not look brand new although it came with a fancy box. Looks like a returned item and I will also be returning it. I didn't even bother to try it on.
1.0,When I received the case it was cracked. I thought that it would be more durable than this. I need to send this back and I don't want an replacement. I give no stars for all categories.
1.0,"They tear easily.  First day my kid wore them and there was a hole... then the second day, same deal..."
1.0,Horrible. Ball does not stay on. Constantly falls off. Very annoying
1.0,"I bought this purse and not long afterwards a strap broke off while at school, and I had to sew it back on. The bag smelled absolutely disgusting when I got it, but I tried to overlook it. Then the inside of the purse started to come unstitched. The part that’s supposed to hold the belt strap together came unstitched as well. The zipper broke off, the siding on the leather started coming off, and the film on the purse, when it was delivered, was peeling off."
1.0,"So disappointed, but unfortunately they did not work for my husband's particular co!or blindness. We will be returning."
1.0,The concept is good. But the reality is they don't stay tucked in. They shoulder pieces must be continually checked throughout the day so you don't look crazy and raggedy.  Anyway. They will work if you sit absolutely still... Don't move... Don't raise your arms.
1.0,The hood tore the first time I put this on. THIS ITEM IS TERRIBLE!!! I bought it to wear to opening night of Star Wars (I was Leia in Endor) and this thing was in pieces by the end of the movie. BOOOOOOOO
1.0,The padding comes forward too far and made me look “super odd”(like a large camel toe). The shorts are not wearable due to their awkward fit.<br />I am a 5’6” average/athletic female and the fit was not what I expected. I am not sure if the problem would be solved if a very tall and heavier female than average female wore them.
1.0,Cheap! There were empty spots all over this!
1.0,"I originally ordered an XL in red and it was too big for me. I reordered the L in Navy and while the size fit perfect, I was sent the wrong color!! I was sent Black. Ugh. I have an event this Saturday and the incorrect color so returning abs rebuying AGAIN is not an option. And now they’re out of NAVY!!  Super frustrated."
1.0,Not a very strong magnet
1.0,DOES NOT FIT TO SIZE!! 10/10 do not recommend. Had to return x3 times before I finally decided to keep my refund.
1.0,"Not the color depicted in the photo, which shows kelly green color. One received was neon green and I already own that"
1.0,"The material is thin, flimsy & the product is cheaply made!"
1.0,carbon fiber peels very easy
1.0,Two of the watches didn't even work when I got them. One died after a day. Hard to set time/date.
1.0,"This took a long time to arrive and is way to big for petite frames. It falls off my shoulders.  Not happy with this at all, but I'm not going through the hassle of a return."
1.0,"The fabric is poor quality, thin and cheap. I laughed when I opened the Amazon package, it looked like an old rag."
1.0,"This is a one size fits all product and it was way too big on me. I ended up having to use safety pins just so the “blouse” part didn’t hang down to my stomach and show off my bra in all it’s glory. Every part that was elastic was super big but not even like it was stretched out or anything just sewn without cinching anything in mind like the sleeves are supposed to be cinched around the wrists so they’re poofy like in the product picture but mine came and were so big they hung like Elvira sleeves or kimono sleeves. Then the hips fit me perfect, for reference I have small hips so for the chest to be oversized and the hips to be small I’m just left like “who was this made for? Dolly Parton?” If you buy this just be prepared to DIY some alterations and if you’re a curvy queen I’d recommend finding another costume or alternative for the skirt part. Wouldn’t buy again, wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,"We had previously purchased singers' masks from Protec and those were great. These weren't what we wanted, but Protec masks are in sharp demand so we ordered. Ended up getting a refund, thank you, because we can't be giving out masks that aren't safe. Thanks, but no thanks."
1.0,HUGE...this wouldn't fit a normal person
1.0,Came broken very cheap not worth it
1.0,Not much thicker than a t-shirt and sized almost in kids sizes. Really really undersized. ( the 2X I received was about a men's medium in all honesty)
1.0,"Don’t buy this!!! Normally a M but ordered a L knowing China sizes always run way smaller. First off the top is not sewn as shown in the picture (no cross crossed fabric), second there is not enough fabric across the chest area for anyone with breasts. I am NOT large chested - 36 B - and half a boob was sticking out on either side. I measured the fabric... less than 10 inches across the chest. Go ahead and measure if you can’t picture how inappropriate this would be to wear in public. Also tight length-wise but that was the least concerning. Because I liked the pattern and style, I ordered an XL to see if there would be more room and coverage... it was the EXACT SAME SIZE. I put them both on twice to make sure I wasn’t crazy. Obviously returning. Total crap."
1.0,I ordered small and its huge.
1.0,"I purchased these socks as a gift, and if you notice at their site they come in a lovely gift box which I really licked, when they arrived the box had been smashed because it was only wrapped very thin plastic."
1.0,I was so excited to be getting this. As soon as I took it out of the package I knew it was cheaply made. I wore it to town the next day and the globe just fell off! The clasp on the chain broke AND it didn't come with the binoculars. I would not recommend this item to anyone.
1.0,crappy looking
1.0,Cheap cheap. Do not buy. Material ripped while trying on.
1.0,"I liked the design and fit of this band but within a day of wearing it a thin white/transparent film began peeling away along all of the edges. It was very noticable and ugly, so I had to return the product."
1.0,It broke the day after I gave it to my niece
1.0,Quality of construction was poor.  Pleats are poorly made making the fabric bunch up on the bodice. Disappointing.
1.0,I bought these as stocking stuffer for Christmas. Unfortunately 2 of 4 colors had holes in them. They came individually wrapped with instructions of how to use it. (each color) and then packaged into one package. I did not find out about the holes until the recipients told me about it. (how embarrassing!!!).<br />Although the quality of the materials used are on par with other vendors selling the same type of product. I will not longer trust nor buy anything from this vendor due to their poor quality assurance controls for products as simple as this.
1.0,This is the second one I got and it broke once again. The first one broke within 2 minutes of me putting it on.
1.0,Advertised 5 different colors.  Came in only pink.  Bought for family vacation.  The guys won't use them!  Waste of money!
1.0,I like hippie
1.0,The white one was perfect . But the Black was broken.
1.0,"These hurt almost immediately! I thought that it was because it made my earrings thicker. After two days, I couldn’t take the pain anymore (it was getting worse) and took them out. BOTH coverings had split! No wonder why my ears hurt so badly!"
1.0,Both broke the first time wearing them! :(
1.0,Poor stitching as the sole looked like it was coming apart whne received new. The horn also was halfway coming off.
1.0,"This is the second suit I have ordered off amazon.  First suit fit as expected.  This suit seemed decent quality so I wish it would have fit and worked out.  I ordered a size 36R for my son.  Jacket was huge and looked like he tried on one of my jackets.  With that in mind, I tried it on.  I wear a 42R and it fit me, but was a little short in the sleeves or I would have kept it.  I took him to the store and got a jacket he could try on.  The jacket at the store that fit, you guessed it, it was a 36R.  Since this suit was a 6 inch drop, the pants were a size 30.  Those fit him and were true to size, but since this was a set, all had to go back."
1.0,"I did not like this product. Too late to return it. I don’t know what kind of material this is, it itches and irritated my skin. The 2x was too tight especially the arms. Oh just to let you know I washed it several times and it still itched. I will never buy again."
1.0,"Purchased an XL, and actually purchased a second XL for my Sis ( it hasn't arrived yet)<br />Just got mine today.  Way Way too small.  I order XL because I like my hoodies big and baggie.<br />This is more like a childs XL.  I might give it to my 8 year old granddaughter.<br />There is no way I can even get into this one.  I gave it one star because I love the print on it."
1.0,The print rubbed off starting the first day and by the end of the week was almost totally gone. Dont waste the money.
1.0,"Didn’t like the color once I got it, stretch was ok"
1.0,Ugly ugly!!! Lost my money!! :-(
1.0,Not a good fitting shoe.  Cheaply made and does not hold your feet in.  Feet keep sliding forward.
1.0,"This product is horrible.  The seam at the toes is melted together and then pressed together, resulting in a thkc hard seam that presses into the skin and is hurtful and pressed into the skin.  It is NOT sewn together to form a smooth seam."
1.0,The waistband doesn't work at all. What's the point of underwear that doesn't stay put?
1.0,The photo  makes it appear as if the camera will be loose and comfortable hanging down near the waist. The camera was  mid way of my waist and arm pit.
1.0,The product looks nothing like the photo. The pants were wide leg instead of leggings
1.0,Horrible quality of images. Pixelated doesn't begin to explain it. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Cheap looks,feels,Is very cheap<br />Looking,Is cheap.<br />Please don't wast your time and money. This set even hurts around your neck."
1.0,"Material sucks, cheap polyester, not soft at all, takes forever to arrive"
1.0,Es una porqueria. No sirve en lo absoluto. No lo recomiendo.
1.0,Haha...this definitely does not look like this picture.  Its judge and falls and looks like a hilarious giant lips ...definitely not what is shown
1.0,i hate it!
1.0,It’s ugly
1.0,Every pair of earrings came in broke  I glued them back together  Dont buy  Cheaply made
1.0,"This hat is awful. It arrived flat and folded, and it has been impossible to restore it to its appropriate shape. Do not buy it, you will be disappointed."
1.0,"I read the reviews that said this fell apart quickly and even with the 1st use. I purchased it anyway since it had a great price, quick shipping,  and I knew I could repair it. However, it came not only coming apart, but bunched up and wrinkled as if it'd had dried in little ball. I steamed it, and will have to try to glue it while trying to re-clamp the clamp. Definitely not a ready to use without worry product. I feel badly writing negative review, but can't help that that's what happened."
1.0,Not well made. Seems stiching was off.
1.0,Runs very small. Gave it to my daughter
1.0,"I wish I had a photo of what I received versus what is being advertised because it was almost comical. I had purchased this with the intention of using it for my daughter’s Halloween costume. For the price I didn’t expect broadway attire but what I received looked like a silk nightgown about 2 sizes too small. The detail was NOTHING like the photos. There was no dimension, just a short sleeve dress/gown with printed designs and Mirabel’s name was so tiny you could hardly make it out! I’d definitely keep looking if you’re considering this one.."
1.0,Way too tight and extremely hot!
1.0,Have to wear socks to keep them on. The air pad in the heal is ridiculous. These slippers are neither warm nor comfortable.
1.0,My 8 year old wore these for less than two months before the fabric started to fray and wear out and the tread was worn away. Poor quality and did not last. I’ve already had to buy new ones.
1.0,These are advertised as compression fitting.  They are not.  They are very thin and do not support anything.  I might as well be wearing a sleeveless T-shirt.  Definitely will not worth the price and won't purchase again.
1.0,Not sure if it was meant for a child but is was way to small and according to the size chart I had the correct size
1.0,Very bad way to receive this gift for my wife. 2 of 4 items came broken. There’s awesome but now I have an incomplete gift
1.0,Cheap and cheesy fabric. Ugly.
1.0,this came to me with a HORRIBLE chemical smell and even a night outside on the porch didn’t clear it up - I had to return it
1.0,"Fit was as expected, however all the straps broke upon trying them on. I started the return process yet I haven’t heard anything back in 2+ weeks... refund STILL NOT ISSUED."
1.0,I ordered two of these one for me and one for my husband. My husband’s was fine but mine came within the little holes to hold the “buckle piece in place so there’s no way to secure it on. Only options involve returning it but unfortunately I’d have to pay $8 or drive 40 minutes away to UPS. Disappointed.
1.0,Just no 4 me
1.0,"I love the necklace and what it stands for but it must have nickel in it, I broke out all red."
1.0,"I previously bought the beige and navy blue versions. They are great. The black ones however, are horrible. For some reason, they are made out of a completely different material that is not as stretchy or form fitting. They are slippery, uncomfortable, and slide down through the day."
1.0,"This ring came completely tarnished and discolored, unable to shine it up with polish rag."
1.0,The ring does not latch. The top will not stay together
1.0,Came in a small mail envelope!  Hat was folded up into a triangle and now the brim of the har is completely bent and has no shape.  So dissapointed!
1.0,lace parts are so hard and cause itching.
1.0,Got a hole after 2 washes.
1.0,"The suggested sizing was way off (I'm 5'9"", 36-29-41 fairly average proportions, so things typically fit me pretty accurately), and even if it had been the correct size the construction of the dress was just... just no. Bulky, not slimming or correctly built. Speaking as someone who has designed and made a lot of clothing in her life, I can tell you that the layers were done extremely roughly and without finesse, so they overlay in a very bulky way.<br /><br />You have to pay for returns, too, so be cautious..."
1.0,Terrible jumpsuit.
1.0,The earrings are way way bigger than shown on the model. Also the gold color is super gaudy
1.0,"This item is not true to size, please do not purchase."
1.0,"I ordered 3 charms for my 8 yr old for Christmas and 2 of the 3 were damaged and the 3rd just like the others was poorly made. The You Are My Lucky Star charm was completely illegible, chipped, and rough. The clasp on the Mouse Charm was welded shut but was in the best condition of the 3. The Lollipop was just poorly made. Do not waste your money on these!"
1.0,Material very cheap looking
1.0,Too small and the tie is horribly flimsy
1.0,Bought for a gift. One of the stones fell out.
1.0,Was excited to get these but they are awful quality. Every single pair has immediately shredded and run as soon as I put them on.
1.0,I was extremely disappointed that the watch stem pulled out the minute we tried to set it to current time.
1.0,I would love to review as soon as I get it. I ordered it Sept 9. Ha!
1.0,I just got the luggage today they  are more like soft plastic shell then a hard plastic shell! Not close to being worth $500 good thing I got them on a promotion for $105 I would return them but don’t have the time because I have to traveling soon. Hope they hold up.because I don’t think they have a warranty
1.0,"I loved this sweater when I first got it; however, every time I wear it, the slightest brush against it causes snags and not the least, the sweater grows...it just keeps getting back get and bigger on me!"
1.0,Product was cheaply made. Very disappointed
1.0,"Ad copy seemed to say these were ideal for my low arches, but when they arrived, I could see and feel how high and hard the arch supports really were. I returned them unopened. I've had other similar inserts and knew these wouldn't work. Sigh. Should have known buying without looking and touching is problematic for this type item. I was hoping to avoid the expense of having orthotics made but I must reconsider because I need to fix this plantar fasciitis."
1.0,package Arrived empty
1.0,The XL was like a small.  Also a completely different style was sent.
1.0,Instep too tight
1.0,Its too small it did not fit
1.0,"I thought the cap was really cute,BUT very small. Unfortunately this cap wasn't a good gift for my brother."
1.0,"Poor quality, not sized correctly per the labeled product."
1.0,Very low quality linen and fabric had a bad smell.  Description listed it as &#34;the finest quality&#34;. Didn't find this to be the case as it was so thin and sheer I felt it would have torn when worn.  Also much too sheer for the occasion I needed it.  Returned for refund.
1.0,"Bought this for my wife and presented it to her for our 35 year wedding anniversary.  When she tried to put one in her ear, the stem broke right off (and she was not reefing on it).  Pretty disappointing!  8&#62;("
1.0,Belly button ring broken in a week
1.0,They call this cloud slides? Not even close. 👎🏼
1.0,I didn't think they would be see through but the fabric is so thin you can see everything. Not worth buying
1.0,I purchased these gloves to use at welding school.  I have been in welding for 1.5 years and this is the first pair I have used that had a hole after a week and a half of use (7 usage days).  Will never order these again.
1.0,I bought it for a Xmas present  and  sizing is way off  ordered a XXL and fits more like a large
1.0,Broken as soon as I pulled it out of the package with dust everywhere.  Do not buy.
1.0,Absolute garbage and you can’t return them which I didn’t realize. They are extremly tiny and make your ears itch.
1.0,Would not recommend for larger heavy breasted body. It has no support and gives no shape. Would not purchase again.<br />Very disappointed.
1.0,"The eye pieces seem incongruously far apart. When different age kids (preschool to 4th grade) and adults tried them, they all had the same problem where the goggle pieces cut into their tear ducts. Returned these for regular ('non-kid') Aegend goggles which we love and have multiple pairs of for kids and adults."
1.0,"These earrings look very cute, but broke within five minutes of wearing them! One of the stars completely flew off the chain."
1.0,I bought these in the winter but didn’t start wearing them until the summer. I wore them just a few times and the buckle broke off! Very disappointed. They say the return window  closed
1.0,"Hands freeze every so often, works about 30% of the time."
1.0,Second time I've ordere this sweatshirt. The first one was too large and this one was<br />too tight and after one wash zipper broke.<br />My son is so disappointed!
1.0,Zipper broke after 1 wear. My son was very disappointed.
1.0,Disappointed that the red colored item arrived just I. Time for vacation but it’s and orangey rust color.  Sending it back.
1.0,"Dress runs very small, got a size larger, and it was still too tight the sleeves are tight , just not a good fit bought three of them returned all of them, very disappointed but beautiful dresses."
1.0,It wasn't what I expected. It isn't a clear gel. It is foggy gel sandals. I am not happy with my order
1.0,"Returned this product, they do run small and the material is horrible"
1.0,The sandals were way to wide for my foot & were pretty stiff - sent back & it took over a month to get my refund & had to email & complain to get it!  Don't recommend!
1.0,Terrible band. It is so stiff and uncomfortable.
1.0,"Very thin, made of cheap material, unlike the ones I had purchased previously. Will not purchase again."
1.0,Didn’t stay on my little ones feet
1.0,The pants were initially too small and not true to size. After losing weight I was able to fit them. Three holes developed within the pants within an hour of wearing them. I would not recommend purchasing these pants.
1.0,Turns your finger green within seconds
1.0,This was a disappointment. Its just a plain clear case with a sticker on it.
1.0,Get ready for some stanky feet.  These things don't breath at all and your feet will be sweating in no time.  That stank will make these things pretty smell within a few days to the point where every future use will make your feet stink..even if you aren't sweating.
1.0,White shirt arrived out of package spotted grey spots front AND back.<br />NOT worth returning it’s a cheap rag.
1.0,Don't waste your time on this unfinished crudely made thing.
1.0,Arrived battery dead 😏
1.0,Walmart bathing suits do not fade this fast.<br />2 times in a hotel pool.... same hotel we go to once a month.... never ever have i ever had such a horrid bathig suit.... 4 children... and it was 4 times the money.... horrid
1.0,Not any better than other products. Crack within a week of receiving.
1.0,This hat is very poor quality. Not at all what I was expecting. Do not buy.
1.0,I ordered the 9 month onesie  for a 6 month old girl. It shrunk after one wash and would fit a 3 month old. I don’t buy cheap stuff. The only reason I bought this is  because of the cute saying on it.
1.0,The item is barely wearable... but not as pictured it comes across as cheap. The bow in the front is stitched wrong and can not be tightened or adjusted . The pant are not high waisted as shown in the picture.
1.0,I bought them for my 3 year old and she lost them the same day.
1.0,"The sizing chart is very incorrect to the point that this is fraudulent/false advertising. This is a medium on someone who is 5'8""."
1.0,This did not look anything like the picture. Cheap looking. Very disappointed. Was supposed to come with a spider web. There was none. Will never order from this company again.
1.0,I bought a 3x Because I wanted baggy to wear with leggings. Ended up offering to my 9 yr old niece. It’s so very small. Horrible fit.
1.0,Poorly made bracelet. First one came unraveled the same day it arrived. I ordered a replacement which has already come unraveled in less than a week. Unfortunately not worth the money...
1.0,Quality is horrible and the 4x is like a large...flipping ridiculous
1.0,Pretty bra but gives no support whatsoever a wasted purchase
1.0,It was too small.  They made it look bigger in the picture.  The only thing i liked was the fact that it was sterling silver!
1.0,"Cant Set the Date PERIOD. I have watched the videos, and read the instructions. There is a mechanical problem inside the watch.<br />this is the 3rd time I have complained, and the company has yet to resolve the issue"
1.0,Black color was chipped off a little on one earring and the stud had a sharp edge to it
1.0,"This was way to short and sexy for me! I’m 5’6, curvy thighs and butt with a b cup chest. I was going for more of a sweet princess look and this was very sexy. If you’re wanting sexy this is your dress!"
1.0,No instructions on how to use or how to change batteries.  If you ask for refund they charge you a 30 % restocking fee.  Unfortunately I ordered 5 of these to give to my girls.
1.0,"Ordered XXL & that was what’s in the label,  but must be either for kids or a small xxl person"
1.0,"I received the pants and the waistband had to cut holes in it and the elastic was not connected, rendering them unwearable.  It seems the elastic that is in the waistband it hardly enough to go around anyone's waist. I will be returning them."
1.0,"Ordered my size, much too small!! Sized incorrectly, could even get my foot in the shoe. Do not recommend! Will not purchase from this retailer again."
1.0,"Quite disappointed... I expected a multi colored earrings like te picture indicated.  These are very light weight and ""costumish"" in appearance., I wouldn't recommend.."
1.0,Poor fit and doesn’t wash well
1.0,Problem is you can get them elsewhere for half price.
1.0,"Edit 5/21/22 - lowering review from 3 to 1 star. Terrible quality. Wore it for the event and both green and pink stones on the hand part fell before I even made it to the party.<br /><br />Original review. The item is beautiful and exactly what I wanted.<br />However, the chain for the part that goes around the wrist is beyond tiny. I have very small wrists. For reference, I always need to have bracelets shortened and can fit into kids bracelets. This one was way to small for my wrist. I'm keeping it but now I have to spend $10 on getting a set of extenders."
1.0,It’s a super cute pin but when I received mine it was overfilled with the enamel and you can’t read the letters.
1.0,😖😫😭
1.0,Had does not look as pictured. Spandex silk material. Material doesn’t form to the underside of bill. Overpriced for the quality of this hat. Do not recommend!
1.0,The dress is paper thin. Not as expected.
1.0,https://www.amazon.com/Beautife/b/ref=w_bl_sl_ap_ap_web_17416418011?ie=UTF8&node=17416418011&field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=Beautife<br /><br />This sweater is poorly made in CHINA.  I ended up waiting about a month for it and when I received I gave it to goodwill.  It is not worth $5.00.
1.0,These broke after a few uses. We had to pay return shipping for a defective product. Will never buy this product or use this seller again.
1.0,Not what I expected at all.  Returned
1.0,Este nunca llego
1.0,DOES NOR FIT SAMSUNG GEAR 20MM!!! I had to cut into the band to make it smaller for the watch latches and it works fine now but if you do not have someone handy to make the tiny cut it is a waste. It looks a little rugged now but i love the material for working in the hospital. It is very easy to clean
1.0,Returned because the material looked cheap and the sizing is way too small.
1.0,Unfortunately the insignia has ALMOST dissapeared!
1.0,"Bad cheap stretching fabric so light see through it is as if wearing tracing paper. I bought a slip dress to wear wear underneath OMG made it worst, every single seem, dimples, voids of everything you will under will show as a hot mess. People: my cellulite, my underwear, my bra, the slip all transposed their outline under this fabric AND the void of my belly button, the gaps in my pubic area...wrost the longer you wear in the day the fabric loosens as if in boiling water ...my cleavage was exposed...so every 5 minutes i have to do a quick check and pull up...infortunatly all this happened as i was out and about. I will have to shorten the shoulder strapes to accommodate...buy a size down will make the tracing effect more horrible...i bought an xl, I'm 5'8"" and about 200 lbs, EVERYTHING giggles like jello with with this dress...it will be perfect if wearing for the beach where your body is expected to be exposed...oh and it catches so the bottom looks like velcro pulled yarns out...this is only the 2nd time i am wearing it..."
1.0,Yarn was coming apart within a day from around the ponytail hole. Don’t waste your money!
1.0,"Awful sizing, awful manufacturing, don't waste your money.  These are not to true to size and the piece that fits between your toes is very irritating. Also, the buckle is WEIRD!  It is NOT a standard shoe or sandal buckle, it has a weird clip that is supposed to attached to the buckle on the side.  Please don't waste your money."
1.0,"bought one month ago , it don't close anymore ,"
1.0,Fell apart within a month. Would not recommend.
1.0,"Very clunky not what hoped for, gave it away."
1.0,"I wear a medium or large, I know sometime sizes run small so I got a XL and it was to still to small. I like the look of the shirt, but to small. Just thought anyone that wants to order this shirt should know how small it runs."
1.0,Arrived with  missing stones and  clasp opening is sealed shut.
1.0,Smelled really bad like chemicals
1.0,"garbage, product came ripped and stretched, don’t waste your money"
1.0,These sneakers were a gift for a 6-year-old's birthday.  They lasted for 8 weeks before they fell apart (see picture). They had normal wear for that age child.  What a disappointment!  He had been really pleased when he received them.
1.0,"I HAVE BOUGHT THESE BEFORE AT A LOCAL STORE.MY FIRST PURCHASE WAS FINE,SOFT,DECENT FIT.THIS PURCHASE WAS AWFUL.THEY WERE NOT SOFT,NOT COMFORTABLE WITH A BAD FIT.WOULD NOT BY AGAIN WITHOUT CHECKING THEM OUT FIRST."
1.0,My necklace broke within an hour of first putting it on.
1.0,Item too big and did not like material.
1.0,Did not fit to small
1.0,Material very poor quality..Sizes run at least three sizes too small.DO NOT ORDER!!!
1.0,Sad to say they looked cool and I even purchased a 2XL and they’re still way too small! Gonna have to keep looking 😞
1.0,Supposed to be purple came yellow
1.0,Item was returned.
1.0,"Fit great, love the design, cheap material, my son wore it one time and it looked like the other reviewers pictures. I took my chances and wished I hadn’t of. Such a waste of money."
1.0,If I could give this 0 stars I would. I couldn't even try the dress on due to the nasty black tarry mold like stains in combination with whatever the heck else was stained all over this. This is what the dress looked like coming right out of the packaging. I have never had anything like this happened. Pulling out the dress it felt grimy and sticky. Ugh. So disappointed.
1.0,"I wear suspenders daily, and these unfortunately did not make the cut. Broke on second wear. Cheap construction.  Cannot even recommend for the occasional wearer since it broke so quickly."
1.0,"The very first day, I washed my hands and put them on.  A little water got inside the goggles, and I used a tissue paper (soft!) to wipe it up.  WOW! did it get scratched fast!!  Now I can't see through them nearly as well. Very unhappy!"
1.0,"Inferior, crappy product to be returned."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:c5270f6b23841aa31dd4d1162a58334e]] it's crooked, bad quality"
1.0,"LOVE, I needed a work bag and this is perfect. My only complaint is that the zipper came w the black smudge on it. The color is also more brown then &#34;gray.&#34;<br /><br />UPDATE: hadn't even been using the bag for a month and the metal part of the strap broke while I was walking down the street carrying it. 😩"
1.0,I was seeking white socks.  Imagine my surprise when they turned out to be multicolored selection.  They will be donated to charity.
1.0,Wore it for my sisters baby shower for the first time ever yesterday. Broke without catching onto anything...cheaply made and lightweight poor quality. Would not recommend.
1.0,Flimsy don’t waste your money. It won’t last a week.
1.0,Seems like a good deal but these are poor quality and definitely not for long term use. I bought them because I was having an MRI and 3 of the balls for the 14g rings broke on day 1. So far the 16g rings seem a little sturdier. Ultimately they did their job for one day but I wouldn’t expect anything more from these rings.<br /><br />*Follow up* don’t even waste your time with these if you need to use them for longer than a day. Terrible quality and a lot of them severely irritated my skin after being in for longer than a day.
1.0,"I buy the size I wear, but its WAY too small. Not happy."
1.0,was a mother's day gift for my mother in nursing home.  Washed it before giving it to her.  I should have returned it. very dissapointed
1.0,They are smaller then they were described and hard to close and lock security. I know they didn’t cost much but they could close tightly.
1.0,horrible quality and I ordered a 2xl it fits like a medium waste of money
1.0,"I thought this would be cute for an event, but the material was pretty cheap and despite the sizing recommendations here, the bust was way too small. May be better for a less curvy figure."
1.0,"I am sorry to ruin the great review score but I just received these boxer briefs and comparing them to well know children's brands, they can't really compete. They arrived in a very cute packaging, but when I took them out they had a stiff, waxy feeling to them. Clearly I am going to wash them before using them, so will see if they get softer (update: they didnt get softer). Another con, they don't have the front pocket opening .... Well, at this age they may not even use it, but other brands have it.<br />I wouldn't buy again.<br />I bought an L size for my 35 pounds boy. They fit a little tight. I would have gone a size up.<br />If I change my mind and end up &#34;loving&#34; them, I will update my review, so far it was a waste of money, my son hates them."
1.0,Returned. Not what I needed. Ordering at night when one is sleepy isn’t good.
1.0,Cheaply made. Not soft.  Feels like get.
1.0,this hat arrived broken and I am writing and do not respond I do not recommend
1.0,This is not true to size. It not even close to a 3x. Fits like a 1x. Not happy with this purchase.
1.0,"i found the material used for this product, very similar to those reusable grocery bags that you buy for a dollar. the price is high for a reusable grocery bag. Don't even try to pick up the bag with a bike in the bag, mine ripped the first time i lifted it."
1.0,"Not just too small—Size chart is wrong, item apparently made out out of parts on machine that mixed up inches and centimeters in same garment! Some parts might fit, but hem is child-size, etc.. Epic fail—PLUS they only provide a 40 percent refund!"
1.0,"They appear to be great out of the box, but after 5 or so wears (each rather casual and low-distance) the shoes have begun falling apart and wearing away. A waste of $20. I would return them, but the window is closed at this point. I hope the seller will make this right."
1.0,Not true to size. About 2 sizes too small.
1.0,"I did not like that they were very small.  Some would only fit a child, much less someone with long hair."
1.0,"Very thin fabric. The sleeves have an elastic around the wrist and is very small, and I have small wrists. The sleeves are somewhat short so the elastic rides up your arm and cuts into your skin cutting off circulation and very uncomfortable. I'm 5'2&#34; and small build, so I ordered a small. A medium would probably fit better but the feel is cheap and I wouldn't bother to get it in another size. The collar isn't centered with the rest of the top and pulls to the left. I just would look elsewhere for a blouse as this one seems very cheaply made."
1.0,I never post reviews but I felt like I should on this one....So yeah! You can tell this is nothing like what they were selling. I was so excited about this sweatshirt. I have been looking at it for months. I finally bought something for me and not my kids.  I wanted this sweatshirt alot bc of the bottom loop in front/back. It has 2 slits on both sides and the material is more like a latex stretchy and the color is supposed to be black but it's more of a navy color I try to get a picture close enough that I could show you to. Nothing like the picture at all!! It feels ok. Nothing special/soft. After wash it may be more scratchy is how close it mostly feels than soft & comfy. This will b returned
1.0,"Colors nice,.....WAY TOO SHORT<br />I REALLY DIDN'T WANT A CROP TOP.<br />EEUUU.....CHINESE SMALL PEOPLE<br />NEVER AGAIN"
1.0,SO I'M NOT SURE THAT TO DO WITH THESE.  THEY FOLDED THEM IN THE PACKAGE SO THEY ARE CREASED IN THE MIDDLE.  THEY CURVE AT A 90 DEGREE ANGLE.  I HAVE HAD THEM UNDER A HEAVY SURFACE ALL AFTERNOON AND IT'S NOT HELPING.  THE FEATHERS DON'T LAY FLAT ANYMORE.  WORST PART IS THESE WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT HAD THEY JUST PACKAGED THEM PROPERLY.  THINKING THEY NEED TO BE RESENT.
1.0,Sent wrong sock pair - the two didn’t match
1.0,"Earrings sent were marked as sterling,  but my ears immediately itched and swelled up after wearing these. 4 hours later, I had to fight to pull them out of my now bloody ear. I've always been able to use sterling silver without issues.  This reacted exactly like nickel.  It doesn't even look like sterling.  Also, more importantly to the product,  they look nothing like the product description photo. No one can even tell they're Hello Kitty. Seems like another case of bait and switch where a seller starts selling a better product to get good reviews then switches to a cheaper version. I've included a photo to show how different my pair are to those advertised."
1.0,I returned  it  didn't like it
1.0,I ordered the striped pattern and was so disappointed. The dress is not lined and the fabric is nearly see through. The stripes looked faded too. It’s just poor quality so I didn’t even bother to try it on. I would not recommend this dress. I would give it zero stars if that was an option.
1.0,Tried putting them on a standard olympic bar. Broke immediately. They are clearly too small and not elastic to lock. Very disappointing.
1.0,turned green the first day
1.0,"These glasses were not made well. I gambled poorly on them, as the hinge was not connected well at all. Boo. Hiss."
1.0,More like a costume jacket. Ultra thin. Not well made. Very big.
1.0,"Didn’t fit right at all, I even went up a size the chart suggested. So I returned it."
1.0,"I bought these exact socks a few years ago, and they were fabulous. They were comfy and lasted so long - fabulous quality. The replacements I bought are HORRIBLE!!! The non-skid letters and dots on the bottom of them immediately start to fall off the very day I wear a new pair. I bought these mostly for comfort and safety, but the non-skid stuff will be gone within a few wears. I feel ripped off. :-("
1.0,Sleeves are no where near long like the picture it's awkward in the chest and hoe it sits on the shoulders and then very baggy in the waist.
1.0,I LIKED THE PICTURE ONLINE BUT IN PERSON THEY WERE DIRTY AND LOKKED USED AND RETURNED MERCHANDISE. SMH
1.0,Too small and scratchy
1.0,Never could find my size but I really liked this shoe. Looks as if this type of Nike Shoe runs a little small.
1.0,I did like it at all. I didn’t have time to send it back and believe that missed return deadline<br />THE PURSE STRAPS BROKE WHILE CARRYING.. I was at church and very embarrassed.. it didn’t look like the photo in the listing.
1.0,I'm 5'9'' the croch was by my knees very disapointed
1.0,This product was not had advertised. From the shoulder to the bottom was 9 inches long. The material/pattern is EXTREMELY different. Nowhere close to a waffle knit and there is a wide band/hem on the bottom of the sweater. It’s bizarre.<br /><br />I am returning this.
1.0,"This dress is at least 3x smaller than advertised. It barely covered my butt. When I tried to return it, the price to ship it BACK TO CHINA"
1.0,This hat was bent and not made straight from the beginning.
1.0,They are too thin debacle in the center they do not fit everything in the portraits
1.0,Pure trash. First one had tech problems after a week. Got a new one and that had the same issue. Pure trash.
1.0,"This is not an effective way to secure your Tesla key.  Unfortunately, we lost our key while on a hike.  I changed to swim and the key somehow popped out when I put my wallet down, the rubber was torn.  Keyless driving feature didn't work either and I had to spend $500 to tow the car home.  It may look cool but it is not effective at performing its only task."
1.0,This shirt fits very odd. It doesn’t line up on my body like the photo and does not look very cute on. I was disappointed.
1.0,Gloves developed holes after one use. Poor quality material.
1.0,It runs very large!
1.0,I don't know why but can't get Kirkland jeans. I bought these because the ones I had fit so well. These pulled out like a skirt might. Not what I was expecting.
1.0,This is super thin and the neck is too small to be off the shoulders.
1.0,I purchased this keychain for a friend and the front logo fell off and was lost...He happened to mention it to me and I was a little bummed about it...Like I gave him this really cheap key chain....Soooo I ordered him another one...He was so excited to receive it etc....Well the other day he was over to visit and got his keys out and guess what... Same thing the front logo was gone...it had fallen off and was lost!!!....I have waisted my money on 2 of them!!!!
1.0,"The headband was missing and there are dark stains on the sleeper.  For the price which is on the top end of what i would pay for a newborn sleeper, this was a very poor value purchase.  I will improve my review if the headband can be delivered and will deal with the stains."
1.0,Both earrings fell apart. Could not even wear them. Necklace is still intact.
1.0,"Cheap & poor quality a waste of money, wouldn’t recommend or wear"
1.0,The dress size is way too small. I'm a size 6 and bought and 10 and the dress could not fit. I then purchase the dress again in a 12 and the dress still could not fit. Upon returning the dress to the sender I was being charged $75-79 to return the dress back to China.<br />Which isn't worth it if I paid the same amount that it would take to send it back.
1.0,"fit is way too small and sleeves are too narrow, no stretch at all<br />The sizes listed do not match the dress size i bought. It is sitting in my closet ."
1.0,This is nothing like the picture this is a very small credit card body purse !!!!!! No happy
1.0,I wear a size 10-12 and could not get the size XL on above my knees.
1.0,Sizes are not as advertised!!!!!! This item runs very small. I returned it and I would not recommend buying these items.
1.0,"I hate to give it a negative review because it was my fault for not reading the material list, but I just didn't like it. It would be great if I was a dishwasher. But I also didn't like the swish-swish-swish sound it made. Honestly, a garbage bag will be just the same."
1.0,Extremely small compared to size
1.0,"That is not Crowley, it's Bobby"
1.0,This is a costume. It is very cheaply made. Feathers flew everywhere when I took it out of the package.. I will be returning. It is very very small.
1.0,"These compression socks were so tight I couldn’t get them off.  They were terribly uncomfortable and my legs are NOT fat, or big.  I had to cut them off.  Could NOT even get my fingers in them to roll them off."
1.0,"This company is a random-clothing-generator... beware.  :)  I bought a set of these shorts months ago, and then lost a lot of weight so I wanted another.  Went to &#34;my orders&#34; so I'd get the exact URL, clicked on the smaller size... and got something that KIND of looks like the first pair I got.  This one, however, lacks a front zipper -- yes, I DID re-check that it claims to be MEN'S shorts -- as well as some &#34;khaki&#34; fabric that might be better characterized as &#34;mustard&#34; in color.  In short, it's a good reminder that buying clothes online is a serious crapshoot."
1.0,quility is not good
1.0,Tool broke when I tried to use it. Then when I finally got it how I wanted it there was a wire sticking out which snagged the sweater I was wearing so badly I'm going to have to throw it away.
1.0,The picture is very vague and difficult to see.  It does not look like advertised picture.  Avoid this item.
1.0,to exposed but decided to keep but looking for a better one
1.0,This is made out of cheap crappy cotton. The sizing is totally off. The XXL is maybe the equivalent to a Large and it stretches out at the bottom and looks terrible after a few hours of wearing it. The logo that they put on the back of the shirt pulls off like a sticker.
1.0,Who sends a hat all folded up in 4??!!! I was unable to get out the fold marks so I sent it back. It was a real shame because the hat was cute. I loved the heart shaped holes on each side. Oh well. Got one just as cute at the store on clearance for $5.99
1.0,Found these to be super fiddly and kept dropping the backs.  The stud broke off from one of the earrings as I tried to remove the back!  Returned the item.
1.0,"i wanted different color nose rings to go with my outfits. safe to say i hate these!! the color comes off after a few days of wear and irritates my piercing. will not be purchasing again, huge waste of money."
1.0,Arrived broken after waiting three weeks for delivery.  Cannot be repaired.  Will request refund and not reorder.  Buyer beware!
1.0,"Sooo it’s a great wallet but then the chain popped and now I lost my wallet, it was attached to my work I’d and now I have to figure life out without a debit card in these trying times."
1.0,They are not that easy to put on or take off. They are no better than the ones you can buy much cheaper
1.0,Was so excited to get these today to try them on. They were always crocked and or one side (MY right side) didn't seem to have a tight grip/fit. I think I wasted my money on these.  I'll stick with my neo glasses.
1.0,"Terribly disappointed with this product. I wore these gloves only twice - both times while driving. After the second wearing, the left thumb seem tore. Sent back for a refund. I will search for a better product."
1.0,"It was very small , husband didnt even get to use it"
1.0,The plastic was flimsy and broke while cinching down the straps. On the flight out it came loose and was hanging off the bag when it came to baggage claim. on the flight home i was trying to tighten and it snapped with a little more than light pressure.
1.0,"What a huge disappointment.  The pendant is very lightweight giving it a really cheap feel.  Also looking at the stones used, these are cheap imitations that don’t even look close to real stones.  They look like cheap Swarovski crystals.  The price definitely does not match the very low quality."
1.0,Both earrings are missing a cubic zirconia and on each side in different places...  very disappointing because otherwise they look really pretty on her
1.0,👎👎 it was like lingerie not a dress 🤦‍♀️
1.0,"The top is a bit short for my mom bod. Also the material is itchy, stiff, and not warm at all so make sure you wear another top underneath."
1.0,Careful when ordering! Fits way to small
1.0,Horrible product. Returned immediately
1.0,"A beautiful dress, very flirty, very dainty and I myself was a bit large for it. I would recommend it for a tall thin person. But it made me look twice my size."
1.0,Cheap !! Not at all like the other tees we have gotten. Trying to return but having to wait 3 days to get approved.. don't waste your time
1.0,This romper did not fit well at all.  It was too small but the crotch was too long.  I usually always wear a large and this fit like a small with a long crotch.  So sad I had to send back.
1.0,"I have other progressive reading glasses that work all right, but these actually distort vision and do not help with reading at all."
1.0,You guys got me good with this one..Horrible!!
1.0,"I WILL NOT PAY FOR RETURN SHIPPING AS THE DRESS WAS NOT AS REPRESENYED, WHICH IS NOT MY FAULT."
1.0,Cheap back broke off when I took the back off
1.0,No la recibí nunca
1.0,Revised review... amazon has taken care of my refund in a very timely fashion.  I would purchase this product again.<br /> received this item and it smelled like mildew. Left it out over night and it did not go away. Product returned
1.0,Ordered a size larger than I normally would have because I wanted a very loose fit. The dress was loose which was what I wanted but it was wayyyy too short. I have to wear it with shorts to prevent flashing everyone and the belt ripped apart the second time I washed it. I do not recommend this product.
1.0,"They are so thin they tear easily, they are very tight on the fingers and my hand is not big, it does not cover the wrist area. Not even worth what I paid. I would not recommend this item.  not good for nearly anything I would want to use them for."
1.0,"I purchased the off the shoulder dress and it is not at all like the dress shown in the pic.  The hem is straight and does not curve up on the sides.  it comes to the knee and it is very frumpy.  The fabric is very cheap polyester.  Definitely going back, not worth $24.99!"
1.0,The lavender is PURPLE y'all. Eastery. Springy. Purple. Nothing like the picture.
1.0,"Beautiful. However, I got two right sided warrings. They arw flat on one side, textured on the other. Holes are tapered, so I couldn't just turn it around. Tried contacting seller and got no reply. The area for earlobe was very small, barely fit me."
1.0,"Sold it. Despite picking the correct size actor the chart, it was way too short and tight for me"
1.0,It's very small! Is a gotcha
1.0,"These are a disaster. I would really prefer to speak to their customer service rather than write a bad review but I cannot find any contact information. I bought these for my Dad. He just gave them back to me because the zippers would not work on the ankles. I ordered these specifically for the zippered ankle. I tried and the zipper just came apart. I could not get the other one down at all. Because I got them back late and i was out of town, I am one day too late to return them so I am just out the money They are completely useless and I would give them no stars if possible."
1.0,They didn't work the way I thought they would.  The electric part was not comfortable.
1.0,"I like the bright colors, but there are swastikas on all the socks. I dont feel comfortable wearing them because of that.  I wish I would have looked closer at the patterns but never in a million years would I have thought that a company would have put something like that on a sock. Plus,  they are hard to put on because they are tight."
1.0,It doesn’t even fit on the bracelet. The hole isn’t big enough to fit the bracelet through it.
1.0,"Tried using these for fishing, These glasses had poor clarity, compared to my buddy’s Walmart pair. Sent them back"
1.0,This is way too big and heavy to wear around your neck.
1.0,The connectors are too big for the luxe.
1.0,"Well, I just received this dress.  Straight out of the bag I noticed.... white dog/cat hair ALL over it.  Are you kidding me?! What else might be in/on this dress?! I’m assuming I got a dress that was returned by someone else.  I’m going to throw it in the freezer for a week or two (in a baggie), before I wash it.  That’s ridiculous."
1.0,I gifted it.
1.0,Quality is fine but this is HUGE. At least 2 sizes too big. Ordered a medium.
1.0,Flimsy and not well-sewn.  I threw it away!
1.0,"These cloths are terrible. On a fairly clean pair of glasses, using these cloths will smear the lens. Don't bother ordering. You'll waste your money"
1.0,"Product not at all as pictured!  I realize it was very reasonably priced, however the photo looks as if there is a strap going through the buckle and that the buckle is 3 dimensional, it is not!  Also shows the toes do not turning up which they do not and the color of the buckle print is a dull muddy purple."
1.0,Runs EXTREMELY SMALL. Not good quality. Will send back.
1.0,This material is CHEAP! Not at all the quality it appears to be in the picture.
1.0,"Way too small. There are no buttons to secure the dress. I know this is a wrap dress, but the dress did not wrap to cover my body. There is a snap at the top where the fabric meets at a V, then the tie at the waist. If the dress were maybe two sizes larger, it may have fit better. But the size small was way too small and gaped between the snap and the waist tie. The fabric is pretty cheap and wrinkles easily. Would not recommend. Will be returning."
1.0,"The actual color is not as peachy as the photo.  The material was thin and weak.  The size was too large.  Although I was able to return the blouse, the cost of return shipping was 3x the cost of the blouse.  I ended up donating the blouse to charity."
1.0,All the clothes that I bought are 2 small!  😭<br />I tried to get everything correct!!
1.0,If I could give this zero stars i would. The print is off the material is terrible and i followed the size chart and recommendations and i still was swimming in the dress!
1.0,"I bought slippers from this company several years ago and really like the product.  So I figured it was time to get new ones.  Big mistake.  This company has gone down hill.  The sent me the wrong size.  So I have called them 5 tikes.  Not once does anyone answer the call.  I have left numerous messages, but have yet to get a return call.  I like the slippers but it is not worth the risk of getting a bad fit and being stuck with them.  Avoid."
1.0,"Title says it all. Cheap material, arrived missing 3 buttons (included but not attached to the jacket) 3 or 4 sizes smaller than advertised. Absolute crap. The 40 or so dollars would be better invested in the raw materials needed to make one yourself."
1.0,Love spanx! They perform but these had a hole in the toe after the first wearing. Very disappointed!
1.0,"Total waste! Not worth your time and money. Ultra-thin breakable wire attached to bells can easily bend loose and snap off collar, possibly impaling your pet. Bells are over-priced with added ridiculous shipping. Returning them back. They are unsafe.<br /><br />I planned to return these, but the store instead preferred to only refund me back $7.50 and kept their expensive shipping ($6.42) I paid for to themselves which most likely the bells are worth much less in value than what I was originally total charged... a whopping $13.92.  Please do not make the mistake I did and avoid this vender or you will be ripped off."
1.0,Very Disappointed!!! The Skull print is WAY to large; you cant even tell what it is when wearing it. Additionally they are cut Too Big and slide easily off your face. I will definitely start paying more attention to customer reviews before ordering anything else. 😩😢
1.0,"Nothing like gifting a broken necklace!!! This was a gift for my grandmother, when she opened it and tried to put it on she noticed it was broken. Quiet embarrassing!  Beautiful necklace, not worth the money tho. Currently waiting on a replacement and refund!!"
1.0,Way to small even though I ordered a larger size. Arrived in a plastic bag type package Therefore it was very wrinkled and it smelled much like cigarette smoke.
1.0,The bill of the hat was too big looked funny on me
1.0,Bought for my handicap son & he’s with twice and already fell apart!<br />Too bad they seem to keep legs warm
1.0,Dress was very small and thin. The material did not hide anything. Disappointed in the product so I returned it.
1.0,"This dress is just weird.  Padding at chest, but when I have a bra on, the padding rests at the inside of my breasts!  Very large arm holes and super long straps."
1.0,Really unstable. This umbrella bends like gumby in the wind.
1.0,Was broken in the bag ☹️
1.0,Cute skirt but not white!  I ordered about 4 different white skirts for a All white event tonight and NONE of them are white. Althobits cut? Immpissed it’s not white. I’m returning
1.0,Me mandaron 8mm☹️
1.0,problem making return
1.0,Were not worth it! Flimsy...nose pieces are weak definitely not worth the money!!!
1.0,Returning this item! This is lightweight and very shiny. Not your typical sweatshirt fabric. I needed something for warmth and this won’t work.
1.0,Fabric bubbled at belly and crotch.
1.0,Not made well. Mine came with hole at seam.
1.0,"This is crap. It broke after a week, the beads came off after it snapped."
1.0,"After reading reviews I ordered larger but received an enormous dress with strange dimensions. Just sent it back not wanting to have to guess what size I really needed. The fabric was a bit rough - for the price, not a surprise."
1.0,I ordered navy but this came more purply navy...looks cheap.  It's boxy and came a wrinkled mess.  It's short...no way this is dress length as described.  The material is cheap but the color is a complete turnoff.  It's definitely not navy.  I chose not to ship back and was given 20% back.  :(  I won't be dealing with this merchant again.  Very disappointing.
1.0,Color not even close. I ordered wine colored and got pink (photo compares top to my wine colored skirt). Other reviews mention one strap being longer than the other...that is true. They are also sewed on crooked and the material is like a swimsuit. I’ve tried a few other products from this company at the same time...all were a disappointment and got returned. I would save the time and money if I were you.
1.0,"After 2 months of use I've now almost lost my Fitbit multiple times because the strap will disconnect from the piece that holds it. Either the spring for the pin is too weak or it's not seating correctly. I've almost lost it on the bus twice now (lucky heard it hit the floor or it'd be gone) and once in the snow (didn't notice, luckily found it outside my door.<br />It's a great looking band, I do like it for how it looks. But considering how expressive a loss this would be, one that probably would not be reimbursed, I can't really recommend this band."
1.0,"Very cloudy looking, the picture shows them very bright and clear. Not so!"
1.0,"Doesn't stay snapped together, keeps falling off my arm"
1.0,"This shirt is not what is pictured. Cheap made, you can see through the material.. I usually wear a medium in womens and ordered a xxl and it was too short on the torso. Stitching is crooked and strings sticking out everywhere."
1.0,These lasted one session  and tore. The company ignored my email!
1.0,Horrible stones were missing I returned it don't waste your money
1.0,Polarization is nauseating.  reflects whats behind you.
1.0,Not what I thought it would fit like
1.0,I did not like anything about this dress material is so cheap the sleeves look terrible.
1.0,"Honestly, I didn’t like anything about the stiffness around my wrist, color, and quality of what the seller calls leather, it looks and feels like fake leather and didn’t smell like leather. I’m not wearing this band on my watch."
1.0,I wear a 2X so I ordered a 4X because I wanted it to be big. I could not even get it on because it was so small.
1.0,"Hi,<br /><br />The top fit fine but the bottom was way too small.  Not True to size.  Very disappointed.<br /><br />Kathy"
1.0,Thin hoodies not worth the $29.00
1.0,Couldn’t use. Nice looking though.
1.0,What it did to my finger after some time of use.
1.0,The skits says it’s a women’s skirt. I ordered a large and when it arrived it looked to be a child’s size large. Returning because of sizing.
1.0,"Definitely is a brighter purple than shown, the fit is  boxy, and the sizing is way off. Or at least it was for me! Really sad it didn’t work out because it looked super cute online!"
1.0,The watch's battery I think is dead. Yet to find a battery see if its working.
1.0,Got what I asked for
1.0,"I ordered these snoods specifically to match costumes I’m doing for a play. A nice variety of colors was shown, but instead I received 2 black, 2 blue, 2 pink, 3 orange, one each pink, white and green.<br /><br />At most I’ll be able to use two...so beware!"
1.0,"I was really looking forward to the chockers, and first of all, they where put in the wrong mailbox and it was the first package I've ever ordered. Also, almost all of them broke in the first couple of wears. I really was excited for the one I'm the middle that looks like you tie, but it came torn apart and broken. Very disappointed :/"
1.0,"I saw this on Etsy.com, exactly this one. I ordered it for my fiance and it wasn't the one she had been drooling over on Etsy for days. I should have paid more attention, it was an awful buy and cost a little more than the one she wanted, which was of much higher quality! She lets our daughter wear it when she's being good."
1.0,"I really liked the look of the watch, however this one was defective. After giving it an initial winding, I noticed it had stopped running after a few seconds. I tried manually winding it again as well as moving the watch side to side to see if that was the issue. Nope, in fact I found that it stopped running right after the crown was screwed in. The second hand would move very slightly back and forth and not advance normally. This one was sent back."
1.0,"It was delivered promptly, and was in perfect physical condition. No scratches, nicks, etc. Was kinda heavy on the wrist, but it has magnets inside, so I assumed as much. Rubber strap was fairly comfortable. I didn't like which ball they chose for minutes/hours, but meh.<br /><br />And here's the bad part. It just stopped being magnetic. I wore it thrice, and put it back into an actual watch case. On a pillow, ffs. When I attempted to wear it again, the center ball was no longer magnetic. Rendering it nonfunctional."
1.0,Looks very CHEAP!
1.0,"I usually don’t give many bad reviews, but this too is awful. Looks like it was put together in haste. Good top to wear around the house cleaning."
1.0,The back was broken when I received it. They were unwearable.
1.0,"Way too big., baggy. No time to send back."
1.0,One of the two arrived broken and there is no way to fix it. Poor quality.
1.0,It doesn't not look like the picture. It feels and looks cheap. I usually don't give bad reviews but I'm just being honest..........
1.0,Do not buy. Cheap material and way it was sewn made it look of low quality
1.0,I bought two sets - they both completely shrunk after the first wash and dry! I made sure to follow directions and still these are ruined!  One worse than the other- see the difference in the pics.  My daughters won’t get one wear out of these. So dissappointed!
1.0,Ran small.  Not true to size listed
1.0,"These are the most uncomfortable things I have ever put on my feet. The straps are twisted and feel like razor blades digging into my feet. The size is way off too. Heel hangs off the back with way too much material sticking out at the head of the footbed. Some folks are saying these are counterfeit. I don't know if they are or not as this is my first pair of Havaianas and definitely my last. Garbage in, garbage out."
1.0,Don't buy!!  The ankle portion of fabric is too small- can't even get them over my feet. I wear a size 7 shoe. Something is terribly wrong with the pattern design. I ordered a medium. I'm 5'7 and 118lbs. I can't return them either. Not a happy customer
1.0,"I foiiowed the size chart pick it larger then the chart and still to small.my son is a lg ,I order a xxl in there size and still it was a md"
1.0,"Ordered size 6 for my daughter, measurements waist 24” and chest 25” and fit was just a bit too tight around the chest. Waist was ok.  Color was as expected and dress is very cute. However dress was stained right in the front, just below the bodice. She was very disappointed."
1.0,The zipper was broke when it arrived. I have never received a damaged product but have read where other people have. I was shocked!! It’s suppose to be brand new!! I could not even try it on!
1.0,I got a size up for my very petite 12 year old and the top is ridiculously small. The material is that satiny polyester crap so I can't even tell you it's a nice material she can hand me down. I got a set for my 8 year old that fits her just fine. All that tells me is the sizing is haphazard and careless.
1.0,fell apart in less than a week.  i want a  refund or another one
1.0,"The material was beautiful and I wanted to love it.  However unlike in the picture, this dress has NO shape whatsoever when put on.  It's like sack with a tie for the waist.  Returned"
1.0,This band does not fit my Samsung Gear S2 classic! Very misleading!
1.0,"The shoes fit great, and they work nicely. But my daughter will not wear them. Where the charger comes out, hurts her ankle. She gets big sores, and blisters. She wore them for two days and now won't touch them. Big waste of money."
1.0,Garbage. Waste of money and do not fit.
1.0,"These are incredibly ugly glasses. They're very small, they do not wrap properly on a male head, and despite the fact that the lenses are awesome, they look cheap. Buy a different pair."
1.0,Unable to tighten enough to work.
1.0,"Shipping took like 2 months and several emails.<br />Runs a little small.<br />Not very flattering for curvy girls.<br />Thin, cheap material."
1.0,"It was broken when I got it, looks cheap."
1.0,Should have listened to reviews. One small elastic ban at top that cuts right into you. Very uncomfortable. Luckily I chose a different color and only received 2 pair instead of the 5 or so i wanted.
1.0,The seal did not work properly
1.0,Purse arrived with a small rip that ripped into a bigger one after just two uses.....
1.0,I must of missed where it said infant sized hand scrubber cuz I can’t get my hand in it to wash my kid.
1.0,Much too small and the brim was not as wide as the photo makes it look.
1.0,"My son put it on and cold not breath , he did not used it for Halloween"
1.0,Flimsy see through ... and somewhat shiny
1.0,"When I received my package, the only thing that was in it were the glass tops.  There were no earring backs included.  I was very disappointed."
1.0,this material felt cheap. I read reviews before buying and knew to buy a size up so I got a large but the product really was about a xsmall.
1.0,Ripped a week after I bought it
1.0,The mask is fine but you must use very small-faced people in the photo.  It does not fit!  It's clearly the size for a teen.  BUYER BEWARE
1.0,"It was very thin? Looked cheap, I sent it back"
1.0,"I was confused about the description versus the picture of the item, but bought them anyway. This was a gift for my daughter.  I was surprised that the ""earrings"" I thought I purchased were actually a single keychain/zipper pull/backpack clip.  The item is adorable and seems to be good quality.  It is just like the picture.  If it was advertised as a keychain, I'd give it 5 stars.  As earrings, 0 stars!"
1.0,"The buckle looks beautiful, especially for ""Bones"" fans. The material is bad,<br />It broke down after just three years, and I certainly had not been wearing it that much!"
1.0,They do not work do not buy them.  If you do your fault you have been warned
1.0,Not even close to the size we ordered.  But labeled as if it was.
1.0,Beautiful top but I ordered xl and had to give it to my neighbor that wears extra small. Arms are tiny and just made very small.
1.0,"sizing is grossly inaccurate, at least 2 sizes smaller than stated size, very disappointed"
1.0,Not enough padding!
1.0,Extremely too small for the size I ordered. Can't even wear it.
1.0,Dresses have a piece of foam in the cups that is not secured and in all three dresses is now a wad of foam that I will have to cut out and re-sew the dress myself. Not appreciated.
1.0,"Horrible plastic costume hat. Only wear for a cheap  bad costume. Was a mess and smashes up when I got it, but even all messes up you can see what a terrible hatbit is."
1.0,The hat was not at all what I ordered per their description & picture
1.0,Larger than expected. Returned item immediately and cost me an additional $23.65 to send to LasVegas NV
1.0,Chain was broke when I received item
1.0,"I ordered a 3T, which looked more like 18 months. The fabric was 100% polyester and which is not something I would put on my 3 year old (especially when warm outside)."
1.0,Do not buy this dress at all. My wife bought this dress as quantity one but they sent us 2 pieces of the same size( charging $15 each) and none of them fit. Very poor material.
1.0,Sweater looks cute and fabric is soft but runs extremely big. I ordered a size medium and it seems like and XXL.
1.0,The band is thick and cheap and mine ripped a week after I got it. The stop watch and light function didn’t work when I got it and was very hard to set the time. I would not recommend
1.0,"This dress is cute but I did not like the material at all, kind of itchy and very staticky. The fit was odd in that the solid black top part hit just below my bust and it threw off the fit of the skirt."
1.0,Sleeves are too long. Do not buy unless you want to pay to get the sleeves altered.
1.0,"Runs about 2 sizes smaller, poor quality, it had a whole in the stitching by the bottom tag"
1.0,"For reference, I’m 5’8 and 170lbs. Most of my weight is in my stomach and thighs. I bought this thinking it would be flattering as it looked like it flows out.. it does not. There’s nothing loose of flowy about this sweater. I had ordered an XL for a baggier, looser feel and it fit more like a medium and wants to hug every roll you might have in your stomach. If I lost my momma belly, it might not look too bad but overall disappointed. So to those women thinking of giving it a shot, try to different sweater. What they are advertising is not what you actually receive. That cute sweater in the photo doesn’t exist."
1.0,This thing was horrid and they wouldn't do anything about it or refund my money unless I paid to ship it back to them. It isn't anything like what they claim. Don't purchase!
1.0,Have only had them for a few weeks and the stainless steel is already showing through the gold paint.
1.0,stem came our.  It is useless
1.0,Very strange fabric and too tight around the ankle
1.0,"Sadly, I found these extremely ugly, saggy, and way too big."
1.0,"I am currently dealing with a very bad reaction to this shirt. While it says it is 100% cotton, there's certainly more on there than they say. It's halloween and I'm going to get to spend it all looped up on antihistamines. Would not recommend. Will not repurchase. Learned a lesson too, don't trust Amazon retailer products. This has NEVER happened to me before and I don't really have allergies. Whatever is on this shirt must be gnarly!"
1.0,It was so thin that it would not have offered any more protection than a simple tissue!!!
1.0,The fit extremely small
1.0,It feels like a polyester type of a dress instead of a cotton dress
1.0,After about month the watch band started to separate quality of it is not good
1.0,Like to get another color this color looks to cheap. Plus it fit big
1.0,so very tiny that I won't be wearing them!
1.0,"This was incredibly tiny, a waste of money."
1.0,Big & tacky looking. The clicker is enormous.
1.0,Would not work with my Fitbit. Very frustrating.
1.0,"Box was nice and dusty, pulled out the glasses to have someone else’s piece of hair & all finger prints on the lens. It must’ve been a return. How disgusting"
1.0,"Arrived broken, the adjustment strap was torn. I probably would have returned it anyways, the entire hat shape was a bit lumpy and.. off."
1.0,"I would not recommend buying this bag, or any bag in Tumi's CFX carbon fiber collection, as they are all susceptible  to the same defect by design:  The carbon fiber weave has a plastic film over it, which is incredibly vulnerable  to peeling, cracking, bubbling, and wrinkling. After just two or three months of gentle care, you will notice the same symptoms all over your bag.<br /><br />I have had this bag replaced twice, due to Tumi being unable to fix the issue. I am now sending a bag in for a third time, to have it &#34;repaired&#34;. It's a shame that huge defect like this can make me not want to use it, because otherwise it's a fantastically built and sturdy bag. Tumi just made a poor choice in the carbon fiber material."
1.0,I ordered my normal size and I was stuck in this dress.  There is zero stretch to the waist and I had to get someone to help me get it off.  It looks cheap too.
1.0,The mask was a disaster. There was green paint all over it. The quality of the other painting was very poor. I would not recommend this product to any one!
1.0,I ordered my size but they fit loose. Dont look or fit right.  They seem to run the sizes bigger than normal.
1.0,Easily broke after a month
1.0,Looks homemade - not what I expected  😟
1.0,"Returned item,. Not good fabric quality.  Very disppointed."
1.0,Fashionable but cheaply made.
1.0,not worth the money they charged
1.0,feels like plaster.  Horribly constructed.  Unbendable so unable to shape to face.
1.0,Ordered this for my wife it is way too small it looks like it would fit a 2 year old would not recommend if I could give it a negative five stars I would.
1.0,Cheap made.  When the back of the earring was put on the post bent down.
1.0,"Too small, flimsy and some of them had holes in them. They were also very hard to pull apart."
1.0,"Sorry but theses sweaters feels like putting on a piece of cardboard, it is not comfortable and easy to wear."
1.0,They broke so easy. I had them for like 2 days.
1.0,Picture orange back got blue really.
1.0,"Very flimsy and cheap. Every time you insert earring in and out of opening, they bend. The post is long , so you have to really pull back far to get it in and They r now about to break because of bend. This happened only after wearing it 3 times!!!"
1.0,Too thick. Wore it for 90 min and i think i got carbon monoxide poisoning.
1.0,This are so thin as soon as I pulled them out I knew it wouldn't work. But I went ahead and tried them on and all you saw was my underwear!
1.0,"Absurdly not true to size, can't return items as they don't offer the normal amazon return policy.  Don't waste your money.<br /><br />XXL is still to small for someone with a 32 inch waist.  $37 to return to Canada.<br /><br />Ignore this product and company..."
1.0,These pants were 100% see through - I will be returning
1.0,I have this item 1 star because it’s thin! And It’s see-through... like u can see everything ....so it’s a NO! Will be returning sucks cause it’s cute ... but unfortunately sure anit wearing it!
1.0,"The color of the dress wasn’t the same, the fabric wasn’t nice (not soft) and it runs very small."
1.0,Top runs way too big and shapeless.  Sleeves did not stay cuffed. Material is not chiffon as described.
1.0,"I initially was pleased with this pretty charm. However after a month, the rose gold had rubbed off the ends where it touched the other charms on my Pandora bracelet and pretty had turned to ugly. This does not happen to my genuine Pandora charms. Fortunately I noticed it just before Amazon’s return window closed, and I returned it for a full refund. A different charm I bought at the same time from the vendor did not have the plating rub through until the week AFTER the return window had closed, so I was out of luck with that one. The moral? You get what you pay for, and if it seems to good to be true, it IS too good to be true."
1.0,Don't know yet
1.0,This ring came broken- it looks & feels cheap like it’s from a 50 cent machine.
1.0,"The size was perfect, material is nice and stretchy but the zipper is not the best quality. It would get stuck every other time I tried it on. I need it for this coming weekend and I finally found a pair of shoes to match so was trying it on one last time and the zipper just broke on me. Now I have 3 days to find a new dress."
1.0,The worse sunglasses I ever bought they are cheap plastic and very bad quality I would not recomend this to anyone
1.0,Lens was scratched when I opened the package.  Returned and reordered.  Those also had a scratched lens so I returned and didn't reorder.
1.0,"Hooks are flimsy, cheaply made."
1.0,"This dress is neither cotton or linen. The description is misleading, false advertising. It is made from a cheap synthetic fabric, the sleeves are far too tight, it is very uncomfortable"
1.0,Pads slide while riding. Very disappointed
1.0,"I absolutely hate this necklace. Please know that the pearls are extremely huge and the fabric of the neclace is inferior. It's about 8 times the size it appears to be. I would give it a 0 star, but that's not an option. They should arrest the manufacturer."
1.0,"this was a love/hate moment.  perfect, and as pictured, but miniature in size.  even though i was generous in estimating the size i ordered, it was impossibly small."
1.0,You cannot breathe through this
1.0,"I ordered this dress in a 2x because based on the reviews, they say it runs small. I'm a size 16-18 or xl and the 2x fits. It's not too tight, it's more of a fitted look with a little extra room to spare. However, the quality is horrible. The stitching is really bad, loose threading at the bottom of the dress, black stain on back of dress and no tags. The dress was too bad to even donate; I just disposed it. This was the last dress they had in stock in that size and color, so I didn't reorder another one. I don't think I would anyway if they did have it, because it looks cheap to me."
1.0,"Along the neck line of the dress the pleats were sewn together, like a wrong piece got caught in the machine. Almost like it was intended to have a V-neck but was off centered. The seams along the sides were not strait. One seam was toward the front and the other in the back. The seam going down the back was way off center as well. The hem line on the bottom was not even. When looking strait on it was longer on one side than the other. Dress was cute but was disappointed in the quality of it."
1.0,The packaging of the sign was very low quality.  The sign had several dents and it does not hang well on the wall.
1.0,"Very shoddily made, fell apart quickly."
1.0,There is no white on this shirt. It came out PINK! Its going back. Yahtzee is not PINK!
1.0,They ripped almost immediately - I had guests over and covered everyone's shoes/boots to help with the lightly wet ground during an Easter egg hunt.  They ripped on everyone - even folks with limited activity like me.  The kids' ripped as soon as they hit the grass.  Mine ripped when I was delicately putting them on before I even went outside.<br /><br />I would say a waste of money if you plan on walking around at all.
1.0,"Ok, if your imagining that the picture is how these are going to look on you just DONT. they are super sloppy, the most strechable part of the socks is the ankle, and you know how everyone loves a loose-goose floppy saggy ankle area.. the tops of the socks have been made in such a way that there's zero strech or give in them,which is so strange considering the wide width ankle area.  So if you order these just know that unless your foot width, knee, calf, thigh are all the exact same circumference (for example picture your legs being test tubes) they probably aren't for you..."
1.0,It only lasted three weeks. Then started to break. I have a small wrist too. But it sure was cute why it lasted got a lot of compliments just not good quality at all.
1.0,The sticky stuff falls off without even an hour.
1.0,"I ordered linen and received polyester. Cheap, wrinkled stuff."
1.0,Send them back wasn't for me
1.0,"It is just a seamless rather small amount of material with raw edges that I think may fray later.  The pattern is only on one side (not reversible) so, when worn, one has to carefully adjust it in order to only show the side with the pattern. Overall, a disappointing item although I do like the pattern (accurately shown on Amazon).  If I had not paid so little for this, I would have returned it."
1.0,Nothings
1.0,Cheap  It reminds me of jewelry I used to get out of the gum ball machine
1.0,Really big and weird fit.  Had to pay postage to return it:(
1.0,Way too dark. Can't see through these
1.0,I was so excited for this dress but the fit is quite weird. its long but too tight in the chest. stay away.
1.0,It was to small for my head
1.0,"I ordered one that said ""True Friendship knows no distance"" and got one that said ""true Love."" I can't exactly give that to my buddy. It was also pretty flimsy and felt like it would break quickly."
1.0,Worst buy ever! Nothing like how it looks. Material cheap looking. The whole thing is just horrible.
1.0,Bought this those product with high hopes it would protect my information when I was traveling out of the country. The attached strap broke on the first day of use at airport check in.  So now I'm on vacation with a wristlet with no strap. Very disappointed.
1.0,It was pretty for a month then it was rusted and almost destroyed my watch. I had to bring it to the apple store to remove by force. Don’t buy.
1.0,Material of pants is different than pants pictured..
1.0,"I ordered the vibrant ""blue & green"" tie dye, and what I received was a wadhed-out, pale blue & YELLOW shirt, no green at all! I checked the packaging, and it was labeled blue and green, so I guess I won't try to reorder it hoping to get the right color. It was inexpensive, so I'm keeping it anyway. But definitely NOT the awesome, vibrant colors pictured. (I would order again if I could be guaranteed that it looked like the picture.) Very bummed, was so looking forward to this"
1.0,2xl smaller than the xl
1.0,"i do not like to give bad review this is terrible i am not little girl not take care my,stuff got it  yesterday break to  two pcs today not even 24hours"
1.0,"One half of the the bow on the left shoulder came off, holes down the back middle lower seam. Material is not like the other three dresses I have ... (same dress, different color) I have orange, purple & navy."
1.0,The gloves I ordered are not what I received. The gloves I got are horrible! The tear so easy.  I ordered the 3 ply darker blue gloves and I received no ply light light blue gloves that rip either while being put on or minutes after wearing them.  Not happy.
1.0,Does absolutely nothing for health.  The elastics become loose after a while.
1.0,I knew I wasn't buying a quality tie but what a piece of trash.  I wouldn't buy this tie if were selling for One dollar.
1.0,Muy molesto atrás uuu muchisimo
1.0,Muy cortos y caluroso. Los bolsillos muy pequeños
1.0,Love the hat. Just what I was expecting.
1.0,"Should have returned it when I first received it. Tried it on when I first received it and thought a simple design , but I was having problem releasing the belt. Maybe it was my problem so I decided to not to return the belt after starting a return. Took it on a trip, went out for evening. After finishing a great dinner headed for the restroom and the belt buckle wont release. Yep, trapped in my pants. Am I going to have to cut my belt open? No knife. Back to my hotel room, dancing all the way. In the room I am looking for some stiff enough and small enough to release the buckle from the belt. My wife to the rescue, got out her nail clippers and manages to get flap holding the belt to lift up and release. I do not recommend this belt unless you have a tool kit near by."
1.0,Not a good buy
1.0,This is supposed to be an xxl and it fits way to small. More like a medium. I would like to exchange for a bigger size if possible
1.0,"This a a very beautiful bracelet however, the website show the bracelet as blue but what I received is a green bracelet."
1.0,"The velvet felt lining on this headband did not keep it in place in my hair. I used bobby-pins to hold the area where the wide meets the skinny elastic, and still the top moved around. Was distracting to constantly have to readjust."
1.0,"Bought these shoes for my nephew. Shoes look great, lights work fine, but thr wheels. The left shoe is perfect, right one has a broken wheel. Its pop out but when you try to skate it goes back in so its impossible to skate. For $50 i expected a better quality"
1.0,"This shirt had a hole in it when I received it, the strings were loosening and I didn’t want to add on to that one hole with the strings coming loose, I decided to let y’all know, do better!! I just wasted my money!!"
1.0,Not very quality bent as soon as received
1.0,They all broke within the first week. Very cheaply made. Would not recommend.
1.0,Didn’t like them! Very cheaply made! Looks and feel cheap!
1.0,I had such high hopes for this sweater.  It is the ROUGHEST fabric ever! It is absolutely horrible. There is no way I'd want this directly against my skin. I personally don't recommend.
1.0,One of the worst things I ever bought! No! The worst thing! I can't think of words to describe how bad they are. I hope I'm able to stop someone from wasting their money on these pieces of garbage!
1.0,Used it for a few weeks and it is falling apart.
1.0,Totally different from the description
1.0,"What I received looked nothing like the pictures or description. They're cheap wool gloves. Can't be used as liner gloves because they're too thick, and certainly not silk."
1.0,"I also had the same experience - loved the looks when I bought it, wore it for a few weeks, and it just stopped dead.  Of course this was just before a vacation trip so I wasn't able to call the company and get refunded.  Now the window has closed for returns.  Buyers beware - if you buy this watch, be prepared to return it right away if it doesn't work!"
1.0,Description said 95% cotton and 5% spandex<br />The actual dress felt weird when touched and indeed it was 95% polyester and 5% cotton.<br />Please don’t fool customers like this. Returning straight away.
1.0,"Loved this at first, but the clasp connecting ring failed at the third wearing and I almost lost a very valuable pendant. When I contacted the seller, they promised to replace the chain. I was very pleased, however, nothing ever came of it. Do not deal with this seller."
1.0,I did not care for this item at all.  The color was completely off and it feels like a gunny sack.  Awful.  I could have made a better top in my eighth grade home ec class.
1.0,I had it 7 days and already broke very cheap made
1.0,Don't waste your money does not stay on face just falls off. Poor quality would give zero starts if I could
1.0,Only one glove works
1.0,No<br />I was expecting better Quality
1.0,cheapest of cheap sunglasses ever. I didn't expect much since they were only a few bucks each but a few pair were broken upon arrival and a couple more broke within the first day or two of use. The ones I have left are basically single use glasses at this point as the plastic is so brittle that they feel like they're about to break even just putting them on. Bad purchase on my part
1.0,The material is not something you would want to wear in the summer. It’s not breatheable. I am returning it.
1.0,Latch broke within one week - unable to fix
1.0,"I have only used 2 of the belts so far and after just wearing them two-three times they are already falling apart. the top covering is coming off.  I will not order these belts again.  Very disappointed.  Next time I will go locally to find a better belt.  They were low price, but you get what you pay for on these belts."
1.0,"The material is like a Jersey material. I purchased it as loungewear I’ve the summer, but it runs large that it fits me like a moo moo."
1.0,Way too pig for my wrist. Poorly made. It looks cute though
1.0,ugly product quality
1.0,Too small and design faded when you put them on
1.0,Nothing like pictured
1.0,"The material was not as described, size not as described, seller will not return or refund"
1.0,Shrank in the wash and now is the size of a shirt. Wasn’t even able to wear it.
1.0,Ordered a size 13 junior and couldn’t even get them up over my hips.<br /> Seller promptly refunded my money.
1.0,The bass clef design was just a sticker that was stuck on to the key ring and came off the first time I used it. Very disappointing!
1.0,they were dried out when they arrived and broke when putting them on
1.0,I got the biggest size they had because I was afraid it would end up being a little small. I received it & it was extremely small! Didn't bother trying them on
1.0,"Appalling.  Who would buy this?  I would never buy from a company who sells offensive products. I gave one star because something was required to post.  Truly, no stars is appropriate."
1.0,The fit was kind of boxy
1.0,"Very disappointed, it was broken when  I opened it Trash! DO NOT BUY WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!!!!! THIS PRODUCT SUCKS!"
1.0,"I didn't like how it looked, the material looks like felt. It's too stiff. I didn't like how it fit me."
1.0,I tried to put it on and the flower fell off.
1.0,I returned this as soon as it came in the mail.<br />1. Arrived late!<br />2. It looks like it was designed for a child!<br />I’m 205 pounds but I wear a size 12-14.<br /><br />Do not buy!
1.0,This item arrived cracked in several places. Dont bother ordering.
1.0,Not easy to put in
1.0,"I never write reviews.  This took 3wks (21 day) to receive.  When I received the hat, it was flat as a pancake...zero shape to it. Unfortunately, it went directly in the garbage."
1.0,I wanted to like these very much. I have probably used these a hand ful of times and was about to order the larger size for my Costco shopping but then they started falling apart. The zipper pull fell off first. Easy fix. Then the lining started to tear. I was so bummed. I was about to tell my moms group to run out and buy them. I'm glad I didn't. Bummed I wasted my money and won't be buying the larger ones.
1.0,"Quality of product was fine, but it runs small. I am a small-med and purchased medium. I would have exchanged it for a large, but in principle I am not going to chance it since I am so annoyed I have to pay for return shipping. What use is prime? Amazon... at check out, tell me that it's not free return!"
1.0,"It's a beautiful key ring but it fell off the ring within 5 days of using and it's lost. I'm saddened :( If you buy this add some glue to the screw on ball before using. I didn't know this and it worked it's way off, really bummed!"
1.0,Ill fitting
1.0,"I ordered the dress in burgundy and it’s more of a bright red. Fit is funny, I ordered a size up and it fit everywhere but in the chest."
1.0,The quality of this shirt is not good and the seller cut off the tag so we can’t see the size of this shirt.
1.0,Very disappointed.  Great price and delivered in timely fashion. Due to extended travel plans I couldn't use the watch for a few months. When I started to wear it I discovered it ran VERY slow. I went to a jeweler and had a new battery installed but it was of no help. The watch continued to lose time within the first hour or so.
1.0,"We had early Christmas last night with our daughter and son-in-law.  I had purchased these earrings for my daughter off her amazon wish list.  She was thrilled when she opened the package, and immediately started putting them in.  The first one broke right off the vine.  Needless to say we were all very discouraged and will be returning them.  Not sure we'll repurchase, because we have absolutely NO assurance it won't happen to the next pair."
1.0,Primer día que me lo puse primer día q se me perdió el broche se desprende de volada devén mejor eso tengo uno parecido que ordene en otra parte y el gancho es mejor y este se desprende muy pronto solo lo use 1 día y ese mismo día se me perdió no lo pude encontrar
1.0,They shrink to less than half their size after washing.
1.0,"cheap, cheap, cheap it broke in like 1 day it feels like a painted plastic thing"
1.0,Horrible quality is so poor not worth even a penny I want refund my money it’s looks like garbage not close to the item that is on the picture !!!  Amazon I would suggest you not become an ebay !
1.0,After the 1st wear the fake leather came off and there are holes in the front of the shoes. I purchased 2 pairs and they are both useless. What a waste!
1.0,"Too small. I bought as a gift, and when they didn't fit her (shoe size 11), I  tried them (7.5 shoe/skinny calves). Did not fit me either."
1.0,Beautiful shirt it was just what i was looking for to do a photo shoot for my 45th bday however this shirt ABSOLUTELY DID NOT FIT AT ALL WAYYYYYYYYY TO SMALL I ORDERED 2 JUST INCASE OF THE FIT ON ONE OR THE OTHER
1.0,It looks cheaply
1.0,This product was a bit poor in quality.I don’t feel it will be good for keeping my head warm.
1.0,Package included 2 links that were two different sizes and one could not connect to existing band leaving it unusable
1.0,"The sock tore in one day, tried to contact seller no response"
1.0,So very small that i think its a childs size. I don't think i coyld fit it on my cat its so small. I think that the sizing is for vhina and not The USA . ive returned more than ive kept. Adjusyed sizes are important AMAZON  . Please jump on and fix tbis problem.
1.0,Way too small.  Ordered an Xl
1.0,This dress is totally see through!!! Material is very thin.
1.0,"I already threw the one pair out. They are horribly made, they came unraveled instantly - as soon as you put them on. Waste of money!"
1.0,Disappointed in the size. Not very useful item
1.0,"Material was super super cheap, seams were falling apart when I got it. Also the front is so high you can see EVERYTHING. Had to pin it, why would it be made and sent with such a glaring error?"
1.0,Band is short and not  comfortable even when worn  in largest position.<br /><br />Will not buy another one from this vendor.
1.0,Will return it
1.0,Absolutely terrible even for the price. Never used and thrown in the garbage so no one else would have to deal with it
1.0,"I’ve waited for over 3 months, I never got my order👎👎👎👎👎👎👎Really bad🙄🙄🙄"
1.0,"I just put these on and wore them a few hours while watching TV, and they somehow have a hole in the bottom.  I'm pretty disappointed in the cheap quality and not cheap price."
1.0,Don’t buy. Not worth the money<br />I’m a small guy and didn’t even fit my nose. Falls off after about two seconds.<br />Try a different product<br />Don’t be fooled by the pictures
1.0,"Cut, sew and material was different than other prints of same dress in other prints. If the dress and materials are different, than sell them on different pages!!!!!"
1.0,Not good....it fits too small for your face....and the material os very cheap...
1.0,Didn't fit. Looked super fake and cheap.
1.0,Trash! Do not buy! Way too small for my wrist and made of extremely cheap plastic and velcro. This thing should of cost 50 cents. Broke on my 2nd day of using. Stay away
1.0,The body of the coat was fine but the sleeve are way short. Mine was like a xl body with size small sleeves attached. Coat is very thin. Pictures make it look thicker than it is. Material on inside of coat is very soft.
1.0,"Extremely small, and poor clips"
1.0,It broke easy and I have still not received my Amazon gift card with my money on it after I returned it two weeks ago
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:251f395f8f336fa54c92565fd8aab6a0]] I’m going out of town, and don’t have time to return it. Just disappointed had planned to bring it with me. No this is not a vacation, all business."
1.0,"Seams ripped first time use just stuffing with clothes. Unfortunately, I missed the return period by a few days. I have to sew manually to temporarily fix because I am going on vacation in a few days. I don't know how long it will last. Too bad the color was beautiful."
1.0,Pictures are far more impressive that the dress.<br />You get what you pay for.
1.0,Ring is very cute but it broke after wearing it daily for a month. The wiring for the top half of the circle came undone and was very sharp and left a scar on my finger.
1.0,Color doesn’t match the picture at all. It’s a baby blue.
1.0,"Got them in today, and already sending back. not very soft to stand or walk in. too firm."
1.0,Wind goes right through this thing. &#34;Ventilation system&#34; is just a bunch of holes and gets wet within 5 minutes of being outside. Neoprene is super thin you would think its fabric. Actual &#34;neoprene&#34; is much smaller than picture. So you end up with a wet non windproof mask.
1.0,"When it arrived, the thread was already pulling at the hem. It’s cute but so cheap. Wouldn’t recommend, I don’t think it would last even a hand wash. Returning"
1.0,The color white is the white it’s a cream color i am mad
1.0,One of the snaps is broken
1.0,Returning overall way too big
1.0,"It doesn’t fit my face at all.  Nor does it fit my wife’s face.  If it fit, it would be great.  But, it’s rigid plastic so it won’t conform to our faces.  The soft silicone part conforms, but it just doesn’t fit either of us because of the fundamental shapes of our faces and the plastic part of the mask.  If it fits you, this will be a great mask.  Didn’t work for us."
1.0,DO NOT BUY!! Two sizes to small. Very long and the cost to send it back would be $200
1.0,I got the white and yellow the yellow was perfect but the white came with stains.
1.0,"Ordered a pretty spring floral band for my Fitbit versa. I love the band itself, but the slide on the pin broke before I could get it attached on one side. I was looking forward to wearing it versus my everyday gray band. Disappointed 👎🏼"
1.0,"The battery did not work. The watch was beautiful, but it did not work."
1.0,"The nose bridge was a painful extension to the 4 small clasps and pinches your nose immediately on fitting this to your face.<br />I wrestled with inter changing to the small and Large but, Nothing.<br />Very painful and not the worth of having goggle if there going to hurt you.<br />BE WARNED"
1.0,"The insoles fell apart on the first pair and got a replacement, this is the second pair that lasted about a month and did the same thing."
1.0,"I am very disappointed, the shirt is too small although I wear a size small shirt.  I ordered a large, The arms are tight, and I couldn't even get to button the shirt.  I think  think this shirt is an extra small with a large label."
1.0,Horrible queda enorme aún siendo mi talla
1.0,Stiching/spandix Frayed along the entre hip and leg area after first wash.
1.0,The material is cheap if it stretch a bit it will tier wear it sewing together very disappointed it this is my first bad review with amazon.
1.0,Super Cheep Quality
1.0,"I was really excited to get this. However, the color is not as advertised. Instead it was closer to a bubblegum pink. I did try it on and fit well. Seemed comfortable. I wanted to send it back but my daughter likes the color and will probably be the one that wears it. But I honestly am not happy with this purchase. Not happy with how they advertised the color."
1.0,Cheap material that curled and made pills as soon as it was washed. Now i need 20 words to publish ..but yesterday it was fine
1.0,I returned the item
1.0,"First, I will say that this is definitely a beautiful band.  I was really excited to put this on my Fitbit Versa, however while trying to put it on, the part you push in on to get the pin to fit broke almost immediately.  There were several replacement pins but each one broke as I was trying to insert them into the watch face.  Needless to say, without the part you push in on, it is impossible to use the band.  Very disappointed with this purchase and will be returning it."
1.0,"The product material is cheap and the plastic zipper has no integrity whatsoever.<br />The first time I put on the jumpsuit was to wear it to a family dinner. However, the zipper split immediately and I could not zip it back down to recombine the teeth. Eventually I had to tear the zipper apart just to remove the suit from my body. Spend a little more money for something that will actually withstand more than a one time wear."
1.0,"Really uncomfortable. Useless, just a bunch colored plastic. Didn,'t even send the colors it showed."
1.0,"Muy bonitos los saturnos, pero el metal es muy alergénico y se despintó en el primer uso. El color tampoco está bonito, es más cobrizo que dorado. El material del metal se ve muy barato."
1.0,Does not hang flowingly like the picture! Fit is very small. Will be returning this blaxer.
1.0,"This is a very poor design and even if it wasn’t already broken, I can’t imagine it would have lasted  for a single use. This little pin is what holds the strap to the goggles?! don’t buy these, trust me<br /><br />Update: I managed to modify the strap attachment for the goggles so I could use them. I just got back from attempting to snorkel, the distorted view out of these goggles underwater was so bad I felt like I might go cross eyed.<br /><br />I have no idea how these goggles have so many reviews and such a high rating, I feel there is something very dishonest about all this, I can not emphasize enough how terrible these are. I’m not interested in a return these are going straight in the trash where they belong."
1.0,"When I got these in the mail, and tried them on. The bars are extremely long and it looks really bad! Don’t buy these unless you have a super huge nipple."
1.0,"This hat smells so bad! I washed it in two separate loads and it smells like something died in formaldehyde. I threw it out! Eh, $13 bucks “Thems are the breaks”  when you gamble with China. No tags on it…. They got the number of strips right though. Trash!"
1.0,The sleeves were way too tight. It cut off circulation to my arm. Unless you have tiny arms do not buy this top.
1.0,The straps are a stretchy cord like material and felt really uncomfortable. A little tighter than I’d hoped and the fabric wasn’t as thick as I’d expect.
1.0,feels weird - too big & if you try to dig with those claws the glove slips around
1.0,I was so hopeful.. material is funky. I returned it.
1.0,"They have a seem that touches your feet, most uncomfortable thing ever. It tore parts of my feet within 100 feet of walking. I wear reefs exclusively but these are horrible."
1.0,Not bad at first but the band will stretch over time. Mine stretched within 2 months of daily wear. Recently I’ve notice a rash on my wrist where the metal clasp touches my skin. I’ve never been allergic to any metal so I’m not sure what’s going on here.
1.0,Don't waste your money on this. Fell apart within hours of wearing.
1.0,"first time experimented with an unknown brand and my experience on the first day itself proved my decision is wrong.<br /><br />Sole is good and it will give good grip on the wooden court.<br />Insole is hard and while playing it will put lot of pressure on your toes. I'm a right handed and my right leg toe around thumb area pain a lot.<br />Shoe cushion under laces is also big, it is not a major concern but we can feel it while tying lace<br /><br />When I gave the same feedback in an email they suggested me to return(but this will not work for me as I used the shoe for couple of hours) and buy Geckor model  it seems like an updated version if anyone want to try.<br /><br />Other recommendation is to replace insole."
1.0,Not so good at all the first day I receive it broken.
1.0,"I typically wear a small. I sized up two sizes to a size L after reading the reviews. It was not wearable because it had huge, unreasonably cut armholes that left extra fabric gaping in the underarm area. The top fit ok otherwise. Returned it. It was a shame because the neckline was pretty."
1.0,"These are super wide at the top and with the way they velcro close, there is no way to make them tighter. They lasted less than 30 seconds on my daughter. Wasted money"
1.0,"THE  QUALITY IS POOR, SIZE IS NOT EQUAL TO WHAT WAS ORDERED."
1.0,Absolutely Disgusting!!! I was sent a worn and returned dress. They even shipped me the last owner return label. Deodorant stains and all! Beyond disgusted
1.0,"Beautiful purse BUT they say it’s one color and you receive another one. In my case I wanted it black, as it said in the description, but I received it beige, as it said later on the order."
1.0,Fits strange. If you have really wide hips this dress is not for you.
1.0,"good looking, comfortable and good price.  Been wearing these for only a week and so far holding up pretty good.  Will try to come back and update if anything changes in next few months.<br /><br />04/19/2017: after wearing on and off for few weeks, one of foot is already starting to come unstitched.  changing 4 stars to 1."
1.0,"This dress took 2 months to get to me and it is absolutely horrible! Material is that of a Halloween costume! Finishing looked ripped, all in all worst money spent!"
1.0,Much much smaller than normal women's size.
1.0,Beautiful but it was missing the band. So sending me a replacement
1.0,"I was excited to use this shapewear after an initial try-on; it was slimming enough for the bodycon dress I wanted to wear. However, I was highly disappointed to see the very obvious pantylines no matter what I put on. My search for good shapewear continues."
1.0,They really don't look good with any kind of shoes. Don't bother buying.
1.0,Product came to me ripped.
1.0,Its a much better watch than I thought. I've had it for a week and hopefully it doesn't break. it broke the second week lmao. it's a nice watch but it doesn't do good I'd I have to buy a new one every week or so.
1.0,"Not made to size, bottom was much smaller than the rest of the shirt. It can't be worn as shipped."
1.0,I waited too long and I'm missing parts
1.0,Too small in size
1.0,I purchased 8 of these all in different colors. They fit very cute and feels very comfortable but they are way too long! It’s like they were made for someone 6ft tall which is frustrating because the outfit really is cute but I look like a clown wearing it. Lol waste of money unless I’m going to get them tailored. I’m 5”4 btw and I feel like this will be good for a woman that’s 6ft even when I have on heels the pants still drag on the floor.
1.0,Tooo big!
1.0,Very obvious they are leggings.
1.0,"This necklace came broken and when I fixed it, it just broke again. I wouldn't spend my money on it."
1.0,Material is thinner than I expected and the sweater fits me very well but the logo is off-center by an inch or more
1.0,Received the wrong color in the mail.
1.0,"These are super thin knit leggings with printed on gold &#34;stitching,&#34; &#34;belt-loops&#34; and screen-printed fraying/holes on the legs. While the description does say &#34;faux&#34; jeans, they do not look like the pictures...almost like they took a picture of real jeans or jeggings and printed it on cheap knit fabric.  Definitely in no way attractive."
1.0,One of them was broken on receipt.
1.0,"It says this skirt is for women, it's a better fit for a small girl. Skirt is very short and very see-thru. Even the underslip is see-thru. Tucked and shirt in and could still see it. Very disappointed."
1.0,It looks good on the computer. But when I received it. I'm not impressed.
1.0,Not<br /> For me
1.0,The wire came out. The fit was too big
1.0,"It was not to my expectations. It looked substandard for the price. Also the earring prick was at the very top instead of being in the middle of the ear stud, and so it was bad fit and did not look good when worn."
1.0,Very thin and feels cheap
1.0,"Does not fit correctly, the stitching is all messed up on one hand"
1.0,Product was much too big for the description.  Not in great condition when received.  Unable to use these for the purpose that I bought them for.
1.0,Too large for size S. My daughter was swimming in it!
1.0,"First the order took a small eternity to get to me additionally, its not the same length as pictured at all not not only that. Its made of very cheap material zipper broke right off the bat a I sent it back."
1.0,"Extremely poor quality. Looks nothing like the photo. DO NOT BUY, unless you want to look like a bag lady"
1.0,The item came damaged with rips and tears but my daughter just wants to dress up so trying to explain it needs to be returned isn’t an option I definitely recommend a different option if you are going to buy this they have Many other options
1.0,Do not buy these if you have large feet. Not sure they would even fit the lowest end of the size range. Just missed the return window (my fault); now I'm stuck with them.
1.0,Great necklace but why pay more. You can buy from me for just $5. 😁
1.0,They are not polarized!
1.0,The metal accent on the bag are all rusted and the inner lining smells rotten fish.... I'm thinking of returning it but I'm afraid I won't get full refund and I do not want to pay anymore shipping fee.. goodbye to my payment... I'll just donate this purse/hobo bag and never order items that comes from China! This item is a big cheat!
1.0,Too bulky. I bought a Kuiu instead
1.0,This bag is just for show. Do not expect to be able to carry much in it.
1.0,"Bought these to replace crocs from last summer. Wore them to conference and daily wear. They hurt and I had blisters that I did not have with crocs. Super cute, but not comfortable."
1.0,Poorly made. One pocket is bigger than the other and they're huge.
1.0,Came broken. The white dot was broken off.
1.0,"The sweater runs WAY too small. I ordered 2 sizes larger than I normally wear, wanting it slouchy and oversized. It was too small around and the tops of my arms wouldn’t even go all the way in the sleeves. There’s hardly any stretch either, unlike other sweaters."
1.0,"Not for small babies, A string got caught around my babies toe it almost cut his toe off!!!!"
1.0,my product arrived with the antlers shattered and I had to glue it back together for my father’s day gift
1.0,Quiero saber que pasó con mi pedido pues me aparece que ya fue dejado en el buzón de mi residencia pero donde vivo es un apartamento y hasta el momento no he recibido nada
1.0,"Ok.... If you're already skinny,it may be for you.  But, if you are bigger and trying to lose THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.<br /><br />I just rolls up or down not staying in place.  It could also be about 7 inches longer around and about 6 inches taller to really hold everything in place. Talk about a TERRIBLE Muffin top. And even if you didn't have one before you will with this thing on.<br /><br />I really wanted this to help me reach my weight loss goals BUT it's a FAIL!!!!"
1.0,Remember you get what you pay for!
1.0,foot part is too long and doesn't completely come up behind my knee
1.0,"Purchased as a Christmas Present for my husband.  He loved the bag, but it is already falling apart and it appears that policy it would have to have been returned by January 31.  I guess they have no warranty"
1.0,Buy 3 sizes bigger than you think. It's easier to bring in than out.
1.0,It got really bent out of shape
1.0,"It came hard as a board.  I kept pulling on it to get it open. The add says generous fit.  I wear a a large to extra large and it barely come to touch in the front.  I was very upset with it and I was so looking forward to it.  The color is nice, though"
1.0,VERY CHEAPLY MADE; CHEAP PIECES.  WHAT IS WORSE IS THAT IT WAS MISSING A PIECE.  THE CHOKER IS TOO SHORT AND MADE FOR A CHILD'S NECK.
1.0,Horrible quality. on first wearing the belt stained my pants.
1.0,The magnets on these are not strong enough to stay in place on ears. I returned them.
1.0,I bought two of this long sleeve v neck shirt the pink one was ok but the green one looks faded and full of stains and ripped all around the neck.I will throw it out what a waste of money.
1.0,This is a one size beanie hat.  It's brim is a cotton fabric but the rest of it is a plastic material.  It's not very pretty and it makes noise when you touch it because it's plastic.  It fits my head but it's just a strange looking hat.  It needed more cotton and less plastic.  The plastic could have been on the inside areas of the hat.  It keeps your head warm but it's really not attractive.  It looks like a grocery bag on my head!  I don't like it.
1.0,Did not fit or look as in picture. Shoulders pull. Would not recommend.
1.0,Terrible way to small and terrible fit
1.0,"I liked the material of the dress, but the dress looked really bad on me. I did get the dress in a timely manner."
1.0,This sweatshirt  is much thinner and not as well made as ones I've received in the past.
1.0,These are huge. Way longer and larger than the photos show. Not cute at all. Poor quality and don’t fit snug either. The magnets are not strong enough. Am returning my order. Garbage.
1.0,Uncomfortable and ugly. Would like a refund but the cost to return it is $6.
1.0,"I was so excited about this pocketbook! The design was exactly what I was looking for! When it came in it smelled so strong of fish that I couldn’t even leave it in my house. I decided to try and air it outside, it was out there for days…never got any better. My husband ended up throwing it away since it never got any better. No need to return it since it was so cheap and wasn’t able to be used anyway. I would check out other options!"
1.0,"Not as cute as pictured. The olive green strip among the white, beige, and brown doesn't fit with the rest of the color scheme and is very jarring. The sheer overlay is also ridiculously cheap, the sleeves are humongous, and the hem is not asymmetrical as pictured. I couldn't return this dress fast enough."
1.0,These jeans are horrible quality was the worst I've ever seen don't waste your money buying this product.
1.0,Don't buy soft'n style 3 pc. Rubber color Applicator set
1.0,"Returned it immediately. I ordered an S, and I am 5'7&#34; and 128lbs. Fits horribly."
1.0,It’s a lie. For $100 bucks they say it’s a blend. The tag says 100% polyester. My amazing husband purchased this for me and when I saw that it was just polyester it’s a complete rip off.
1.0,This dress is of a poor quality material and looks nothing like this picture. Very disappointed. I feel that it is false advertisement.
1.0,Not a true 2XL. the sleeves are not the size needed for a real 2XL woman.
1.0,They are to small its not stretched material  like it says it is
1.0,Please do not buy these.  Save your money :(
1.0,Ribbon design faded in like a week
1.0,I was sent a lousy Gildan hoodie. This is a scam
1.0,"The items are fake , will be sending back for a refund."
1.0,"I opened the 1st package and used it 3 times and the clasp broke already, rendering it unusable. Just opened the package with the 2nd one. The clasps are very small so not all ear straps will fit in it. So I've only used it on thin straps."
1.0,It broke just barely bending it.
1.0,The material was not the best quality
1.0,Not what I expected. It would not stay in place and I almost lost my watch. I tossed it I  the trash. The magnet would cling to everything but my watch band.
1.0,"Worst quality, nothing like the pictures, took about a month and when finally arrived I was very disappointed and mad. Horrible quality!!"
1.0,"Bottoms are disproportionately long and huge, I’m 5’1”105lbsand the bottoms are too wide on the hips, and almost reach my boobs! Compare to a normal size S hipster bottom I took a picture of, I hope you can tell the difference. The top is cute so I’ll keep the suit but will toss the bottoms."
1.0,My son has used these only for sports for the last couple of weeks and they are already falling apart at the seams. I am very upset !
1.0,"I couldn't even get these all the way on – they wouldn't go over my calves. If you're at all athletic or curvy, these are not for you!"
1.0,"I ordered two hoodies a black and camoflouge, the black hoodie came perfectly in tact, but the camo hoodie came ripped around the neck area, and I just wasted $20 on a hoodie, it's a good hoodie but beware it these hoodies seem to have bad stitching!"
1.0,"These are very thin material and stretchy. It would not stay around my face (I'm a woman with a little extra weight and a round face). It stayed okay on my husband's face. But the material is so thin, I think these are a bad idea for masks. Even if they stayed on, they are worse than no mask at all, because you might engage in behaviors that you wouldn't do without a mask, yet the mask would seem to offer little to no protection."
1.0,". . . at least not for an adult. The image is deceiving as it fits like a standard knit cap - no slouching possible. I can only assume this is displayed on a very small child's head stand. If you're wanting something that will look like the picture, keep looking."
1.0,Super small. Suitable for a young child only
1.0,A zillion times too small....this is like a A cup? Not measured correctly.
1.0,"The fabric was too stretchy and thin, it could not lay well with anything in it.  Love the idea but this one was returned."
1.0,"They supposedly have a cashmere lining, but I've worn cashmere and it's never it's like this before.  Do not recommend."
1.0,First I would like to say that the buying process form the merchant was top notch. I'd made a mistake on the first order and they helped change it for me. I finally got my prescription filled for the glasses and wore them for about 2 weeks. Then the right arm just broke off! And I am very good at taking care of my belongings. But even with the utmost care these frames are extremely fragile. I would offer up a recommendation to stay away from these frames. And opt for something more robust and sturdy. Especially at the price point they are sold at. Would however purchase from this merchant again.
1.0,the case is too big for my phone so I can't use it.
1.0,Dress came with a gross stain.
1.0,"Bad odor, not wearable."
1.0,"Returned it, I didn't like it at all.  It's much smaller than I expected and did not hang very nicely as pictured.  It is not one piece but in 7 separate pieces which most of the time hang crookedly.  Not for me."
1.0,"These boots look great, but they are terribly made. The first time I wore them, a piece that holds the show laces popped of as I was tying them.<br />As far as the fit, they are too big on my feet. Around the calves, they are too small. I was disappointed because they were supposed to be wide calf boots."
1.0,Fit was significantly smaller than expected and we can’t use these. Also the glitter got EVERYWHERE just from taking out of the shipping box to try them on. Returning.
1.0,This states it is an infinity scarf but isn't. Very disappointed as I only wear infinity scarfs. I loved the design and it is the perfect material... so disappointed because I love pandas.
1.0,I bought my normal size and it is not only skin-tight but also so short it could be a crop top. The scalloped sleeves remind me of little girls' frilly socks. The material reminds me of little girls' socks. Looks nothingggggg like the photo. Don't buy!!
1.0,There are no pads. Just lace. They are useless without q strapless. Bad buy.
1.0,It's just a glove<br />If I wanna use my iPhone im oblige to take off this glove<br />What I want it's a iglove not reguler one
1.0,The purse is heavy and the handel keeps coming off the shoulder. I retuned it
1.0,The watch does not keep time.<br />I had to replace the original battery after two weeks.
1.0,They do not work.
1.0,You can’t wear anything with cleavage. Didn’t realize the tag shown in the picture goes on the top of the breast. Pulling up to give you a lift look. But I can’t wear a dress with straps. Point of a strapless bra is to not show straps.
1.0,Looks stained with spots of dark urine.
1.0,The sizing is all wrong
1.0,Was looking for real prefolded diapers and these were not them.
1.0,"They're a little tighter than expected, but I like the material. A little restrictive but not too much. I like the Adidas version of these better. But the thing that really makes me hate them is the pocket on your butt crack. It's literally a horizontal pocket at the top of your crack. I mean, what were these people thinking?11"
1.0,EXTREMELY HEAVY AND HARD TO FASTEN
1.0,"I was terribly upset to open this bag and find that it is NOT as pictured in photo. It is rather thin and for this price i could have bought two like this at walmart. In fact theirs would have been better quality. So i would not reccomend this product.  Just not quality, thick or well made."
1.0,The skirts are way too long.  They fit perfect in the waist but the length  was not only hitting the floor but dragging on the floor.
1.0,Literally so heavy impossible to wear. Might rip ur earlobe... don't buy
1.0,"I bought this same sweater under a different brand (Ninfort) and it was better quality. This one the sleeves are way shorter and hand cuffs are sewn on which has no stretch (rather than a continuation) and uncomfortable. The biggest thing I’m not a fan of is the pink is not a soft pink as pictured, but rather a bright bubblegum pink (which some people may like, just not for me)."
1.0,This is awful! Fabric thin and very cheap looking. So called beads were glued on! Don’t buy from this seller! You pay all postage on your own return. Amazon should be ashamed for selling such shabby products!
1.0,"This shirt came with stains, numerous loose threads, and was deeply wrinkled. Do not buy it."
1.0,We got 2 pairs of under armour and a pair of lucky brand xl! It was weird
1.0,This isba huge play on society. I dont care what your manipulated science facts are saying. If someone thinks masks work they have never actually had to rely on them.
1.0,The skirt runs real small. What ever size you are order up like 1-2 sizes up. The skirt is also very slim and tight on the body. If tight is not your style do not order this skirt.
1.0,one sleve ripped off after only one wash
1.0,Product arrived with a dead battery; returned it.
1.0,The charm snags on everything! You can’t put your hands in your pocket.
1.0,Too.light weight. Expected it to be more like a hoodie in weight.
1.0,"looks and feels nice but the wrist band adjusting pins are all jammed.  spent the first ten minutes out of box trying to adjust it, bent all 3 pin remover tools.  i followed the instructions, which arent really clear on much other than there being an arrow.  no specifics on whether the arrow symbolizes removal direction or reentry.  will probably return"
1.0,Was to big to long but it is pretty
1.0,Outline of seams on the front of the bra show through on clothes.
1.0,Very disappointed! No hardware or directions. Was purchased off a wedding registry last winter and just opened it. Can’t be used. Waste of money!!!
1.0,It was cool looking but one of the bottoms to latch the wallet shut broke off after 3 days so i returned it promptly.
1.0,I was very dissatisfied with this product. The slits in the side were rounded and  ridiculously high. The fit was larger than expected.
1.0,I purchased these earrings based on the reviews had to return them. They are so small and they are very difficult to put on. They are tiny. And putting them on was a struggle that's why I gave one star.
1.0,"It looks really nice on picture, but when I received it and opened a box ....junk, looks very cheap like $2-3 thing. Returning."
1.0,Received something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the item in the picture.<br />Not even close.<br />Horrible.<br />Don't buy
1.0,"This nightgown/house dress looks cute in the ad, but I received a very wrinkled item that was several sizes too large and not what I ordered.  I am returning it.  Disappointed in Amazon lately."
1.0,Size up two sizes cause it fits very small
1.0,Day 1 seemed pretty good and I even liked the restricted feeling the waist trimmer gave me.  Day 2 already felt like the trimmer was losing shape.  Day 3 and the boning has already broken through the fabric.<br /><br />This was one of the cheaper options so perhaps it’s worth investing in better quality.
1.0,"Normally wear a medium top, purchased in large, way too small purchased again in XL still way too small!"
1.0,Was torn and next pain was small amd.the other one was to big.
1.0,"The necklaces are pretty, have a nice shine to them but are very fragile. These were purchased for my daughter and two of her friends and within hours, 2 of the 3 necklaces were broken. Don't waste your money or break your kid's heart."
1.0,the snaps already broke after one wear
1.0,Kimono is way too large. It looks awful on the body. Quality is ok.
1.0,This was nothing like this picture!!! The tie didn’t even match the suspenders!! Neither are even this pattern as shown! I was very disappointed!
1.0,"It says one size fits most .. I think they meant for anorexic. So girls if you have any kind of butt, do not get this. The hood is horrible. The beak sticks out into your line of vision instead of being more streamline. I'm going to have to add an actual hood and sew this thing to it."
1.0,Way too Small. Uppers were for two right feet. Hard to tell left from right by the soles. Heel covering much shorter on one shoe. Don't waste your time with these.
1.0,Waste of time did not fit and discolored quickly
1.0,Clingy
1.0,Ok...I've used several different tools to remove links from a lot of watch bracelets.  This tool is bar for the worst I've ever used.  Wasn't even able to remove 1 link before it bent.  Save your money!!
1.0,"Horrible material!! Not comfortable at all, not the least bit flattering. I’m a 2x but the way this fit I should have bought a 5x!!!! Way too small, looked like a cami."
1.0,"Opened my package, saw that it was pink instead of red, immediately started the return process online. I wish I read the reviews that all said the same thing."
1.0,THIS dress  came to me in poor condition. It has 3 stains on it  and I don't even know if I can wash  it to get the stain out or  not.  NOT HAPPY
1.0,"hot, ran small & not enough streach"
1.0,"Product was weeks late, although they issued me a discount!  Description says made in Korea, but when received label clearly has MADE IN CHINA....makes me ? If these are counterfeit."
1.0,"Smaller than pic and looks very cheap,<br />Do not buy<br />I can’t believe I paid this for 21$"
1.0,Super cute but bad quality. Within the first 5 minutes of wearing the shirt the seams on the bottom of the shirt had fully came apart.
1.0,"Disappointed! Only received 8, it was supposed to have 12. Package clearly says 12 and so does description before buying. If my kid didn’t need this for theater class this week. I’d be returning these."
1.0,I gave it 1 star because when I received the cover-up it was not sewn on the right side. I had to sew it up myself.
1.0,Waste of money don’t buy it.
1.0,Badly made top. Looks weird
1.0,The material was vastly different from what I thought. Very synthetic and thin. I thought it was supposed to be cotton-like. See through also.
1.0,"One pair fit like it should, one pair the leg holes were small and tight, one pair put on and ripped 2 holes in it.  Disappointed in the quality due to needing these for postpartum C-section care."
1.0,"I wanted to love it. I read the measurement information, but I couldn't use the zipper in order to wear the dress. I'll have to pass it along to a much smaller friend, I suppose."
1.0,I almost bought this until I learned it was made in China.
1.0,The zipper came a loose on the back on the dress. This dress couldn't even be worn. Very disappointed! Needed it for this past weekend's event.
1.0,Horrible the closure snap on wrong side. NOT RETURNABLE
1.0,"I wear medium. So I ordered xtra large, after reading comments...way too small, cant breathe in these. MADE FOR KIDS I will return..."
1.0,"Terrible!!! Cheap, thin  polyester material. Looks like child's small.  Can't wear it at all<br />Waste of money.  ."
1.0,"Still trying to use this purse... ordered over a month ago. Have spayed everything I could find, aired outside, inside, inside out. This purse smells so disgusting I can't even bring it in the house STILL. Do you let rats die in your bags before you ship them?? Everybody that has come over here has smelled this thing standing feet away from it. OMG. It's going in the trash today. What a disappointment and waste of money"
1.0,The lights quit working after 2 walks !
1.0,Measured this and its almost 10mm smaller than they described.  Will be returning.
1.0,Way too large.  Hard to remove wrinkles due to packing.
1.0,"After about a week, the hooks holding the purses began to snap off under the weight of empty purses. Save your money."
1.0,I need to return and re order
1.0,I am disappointed. The pattern on the hose does not match up while they are on or off. Will not buy again.
1.0,"The bag that came was different quality than the bags in the customer photos. My bag was incredibly ugly, cheap, and a completely different shape than in the photos. The handles were completely stiff and circular. Bag had an awful smell. I returned the bag immediately and would not recommend anyone to buy it. If I could give it 0 stars, I would."
1.0,these are very poorly made the plastic is brittle not a pair of glasses for everyday wear I have purchased several other Locs and they are made well.....and to top it off these glasses were twice as expensive as any others ive bought I would not recommend these glasses at all
1.0,"Returned, these are terrible quality, they might be made of plastic, and they bend the exact same way as opposed to mirroring themselves to look the same on each ear."
1.0,Can't wear it - waste of $$
1.0,The wires push out and show through the shirt.  Bad purchase
1.0,The reason for the 1 star is the threading on the pockets is of poor quality. I had to use fabric glue to keep them from ripping every time I pulled them up. Every time I pull them up I hear a rip somewhere.
1.0,They completely fell apart after the FIRST time wearing them! Stitches came unraveled and even when I tried to stich them back they STILL unraveled all over the toe! DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!!
1.0,"Oversized, is too say the least! I am 5'2"", 118lbs. I purchased a small and someone that normally wears a size 12, could fit in it. The length is way too long and the fabric is cheaply made. I returned it immediately."
1.0,Sleeves are short. Material is sus.
1.0,"Returned, very ordinary"
1.0,Looks cheap and it was broken.
1.0,"My first review goes to the &#34;Floral Pink&#34; version of this blouse.<br /><br />I purchased S and it fit a little tight, I feel that it is more on the XS size.<br />So if you are ordering a &#34;Floral&#34; version of this top, it might feel slightly tighter than your usual S.<br />This is a really nice cute little top.<br />Very girly, very flirty, light and romantic.<br />Flowers have a really delicate texture to them.<br />Really good for the price, I did not see any defects.<br /><br />After receiving &#34;Floral Pink&#34;, I liked it so much that I ordered two new blouses in other colors right away.<br />It was &#34;Sheer Pink&#34; and &#34;Sheer-white&#34; and it is definitely from a different batch<br />because the sizing of these two tops was different and much more roomy.<br />It felt more lake a larger M. I returned these two blouses, they were too big for me and not flattering at all.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />After wearing &#34;Floral Pink&#34; just ones the underarms area fell apart.<br />It was a day of humiliation!!! Just horrible! And I even paid to be humiliated.<br />I feel like my experience deserves something more than just dropping the rating from 5 stars to just one.<br /><br />OK, back to the story. I thought that it is just seams and decided that I will just fix it.<br />However the fabric continued to fall apart when I tried to sew the seams back together.<br /><br />Do not buy it!<br />Or if you did, take a cover-up with you just in case..."
1.0,Broke the first day I wore it.
1.0,It was already somewhat small but was wearable. But after I washing gor the first time I can't even wear it..
1.0,I felt it was in a junior sizing.
1.0,"I was excited to get this, just to have in my pocket.  It does look pretty cool.  I think the case is painted plastic, but it looks good . . . it would be hard to tell it from an actual metal case.  However, the number one thing a watch should do is tell time.  I wouldn't even care if it kept GOOD time.  But it doesn't work whatsoever.  The minute hand does not appear to be attached to the shaft . . . it just flops around the clock face, and sometimes get drug around by the second hand.<br /><br />This piece of garbage is going back.  Unless you're looking for something for show ONLY, don't waste your time."
1.0,Super cute but too heavy
1.0,These were the worst I've ever bought. Were a pain to adjust and made the whole process unenjoyable.
1.0,"I looked at a lot of pictures and friends actually ordered but in different colors and all had the band around the tummy look more seamless like. Unfortunately what I received was the kind where it has a thick elastic band on the inside which i know will start twisting with use. Very unfaltering and not comfortable to do any kind or workout, much less yoga. Wouldn't even recommend to walk around the house in these."
1.0,"Still haven’t received a refund for this! Poor product, not flattering on the bottom and not si3: right. Please refund ASAP. Poor service!"
1.0,"Ummm. You see what I ordered and then you see what I was given!?!?! Way to go, this was a Christmas gift. Not only was the color incorrect but as was the size."
1.0,It is dark blue not black
1.0,"my husband wears a x-large/xx-large.....ordered 3x-large and SUPER TIGHT!!! also, very low waisted. may have been okay if they fit"
1.0,"Definitely was not what I expected. The graphics was cheaply made with cheap materials. The graphic can basically peel off, and the “g” was not even done."
1.0,Bottom is very hard
1.0,GARBAGE !!!  Lose keys off it twice !!  Now its a paper weight !!  Waste of money !!
1.0,The package contains only 2 masks
1.0,"After wearing these for a couple hours, I got a bad headache. They have a lot of curve making them a little difficult to put on and also may have caused the headaches or just too much distortion in the plastic."
1.0,"Trash. Zipper broke after a couple uses. Now, all my stuff spills everywhere. Good idea, but very poor quality."
1.0,Already unraveling within 3 months
1.0,"This is the worst pair of yoga pants that I have purchased! Poor tummy control and the material feels very thin. See my photos. In the first picture, the black pair are from another brand and the grey are from this company. The second picture the top pair are from another company and the bottom pair are from this company. The waist construction is awful. Will be returning."
1.0,"I can fit the skirt but the sleeves of the jacket was way too small, it is not like a large at all."
1.0,It was poorly made and very thin.
1.0,I usually go through every before purchases however I didn’t do my research this time. This item is as bad or even worse than the previous reviews to mine.
1.0,Very uncomfortable... wouldn't stay in place and one fell out sometime during the first day I wore them. Very disappointed😣
1.0,"The socks have absolutely no stretch at all and are, therefore, completely defective. I could not even fit them on my arm. I bought them for my husband for Christmas and was about to wrap them and realized that they were like dress socks with no elasticity. The return window is closed . I will throw them in the trash. Sad."
1.0,The ring seem to not give a bling to it therefore I return it.
1.0,"seller sent a defective item!!!! broken zipper, cannot be used"
1.0,Save yourself the time and just buy the Oakley band lenses.
1.0,Doesn't seem meant for anyone over age 8.
1.0,"Cannot be sure if this is even real abelone shell, plus it is very thin on a thin piece of plastic not carved bone. Definitely not worth the price, stay away from this one."
1.0,The entire point of these shorts is the wolf. The wolf has no head.  :( completely disappointed. Will be returning
1.0,Sent back. Order a size larger
1.0,"These were impossible to use as readers, the area is so small you have to hold the frames and your head just right.  Not sure why all the great reviews.  Returned them"
1.0,This didn't fit it was extremely to small for me and to send it back it cost the same price that I bought it for.
1.0,"Flimsier than expected. Also, while the curved ends are the proper size for my Fossil Watc with a 22mm band, the band itself on this piece is narrower.<br /><br />I might have given it 3 stars, based on price and difficulty finding other options for my watch, except for the fact that not only are the pins very flimsy, but one of the curved ends was actually installed upside down. Unlike my stock band, which has pins for many segments and the end pieces that can be removed, the segment pins on this band won't budge. Bad for those who might want to adjust the length, while making it impossible to fix the issue if yours comes with an end installed upside down! Very poor Quality Control!"
1.0,Does not fit the Fenix 5s Sapphire.  Returning.
1.0,It wasn't what they advertised
1.0,I ended up returning these because my son cried and said they cut into his foot.
1.0,Broke in about 3 hours. Don't waste your money
1.0,I brought the same shirt in blue and it fit perfectly. This one a few weeks later and is to small.
1.0,Low quality material; does not look good when you wear it.
1.0,I chose only 1-star not because of the quality but because there were 3 small holes in the of the back panel. It looks moth eaten.<br /><br />However I do need to comment on the quality of this product. It's a very lightweight fabric stretch cotton. The seams looked well constructed. Holes not withstanding. I can't contribute to the quality of the product.<br /><br />I would have been pleased with my purchase if it wasn't for the holes.
1.0,My calfs are 18 inches but the knee highs are still small and will not stay up.
1.0,"Len's scratch to easy while in wife's purse, returned."
1.0,I bought a Sml and it's like a large.I'm sorry I ordered another one before receiving this one.
1.0,"Strap length way to long, cheap material.  Definitely not a sports bra, no support.  Returned!!"
1.0,"It's nothing like the Pic, very upsetting!"
1.0,These are so tiny even for kids sorry the cost is too high to keep for cheap also
1.0,Gives you height but no cushion. Hard as a rock. I appreciate the great customer service though.
1.0,Look a low quality and a artificial plated gold.  I think it would be breakable if worn it for 1 month.  The LED light is low dim.
1.0,did not stop glare
1.0,I wasn’t happy with this  The clasps we’re not attached and they turned a copper color. Also it doesn’t keep necklaces from twisting together
1.0,My ignorance.  Came from China. Too small. Obviously not paying attention.  Nonetheless.  Gave X large to someone much smaller stature.
1.0,"Did not like anything about this shirt. It wasn't the right size, it's definitely not navy blue and is so poorly constructed that in surprised that the price point is so high. I should be no more than $5, but even then I'd not buy it. I'm returning it Tuesday."
1.0,"I ordered the largest size they made (I think 4X, but I couldn’t even get it on.  So very small"
1.0,Horrible small misleading
1.0,It's a great
1.0,Really cheap looking.  Hurt ears
1.0,You cannot see very well through this mask. I do not recommend if you need it for Halloween or any other costume gatherings.
1.0,Did like at all.  Way too much stuff not needed on a bra
1.0,I used these glasses several times.  They are more trouble than they are worth.  It was actually more pleasant to not wear them and shield my eyes with a hat.  Would not recommend.  .
1.0,"I mean I am wearing size S,M but the size M that I ordered looks way to big. The material is nice and soft but that’s it. The size is incredible big."
1.0,Bought the three pack in large.  One fit a little snug.  That’s fine.  The others were so tight they were cutting off circulation and had hardest time getting them off and on to try them on.  Then the thumb holes weren’t the same size one was bigger while the other was way smaller.  Complete waste of money.
1.0,The logo peel off the first time she use it.
1.0,VERY DISAPPOINTED..... I received this on halloween...The zipper was broken and the arm is ripped. Not wearable and it says not eligible for return. Not fair!!
1.0,"I opened the box of earrings and immediately noticed that an earring was missing from the red earrings set. On closer look the earrings look cheaply made. I have other pave crystal style earrings and compared to those, this set is poor quality.<br />Not worth even $10 bucks. Don't bother."
1.0,"Nothing like the photo unless I was sent the incorrect item. Not a Maxi dress AT ALL. a short pencil skirt style. Very disappointed, however the color was true and very pretty!"
1.0,I was not a fan of the fit or quality
1.0,"I was expecting the earrings to be the size as in the picture, it makes them seem big. those earrings are so small my daughter can wear them and she is 7. disappointed especially since i paid so much to have them delivered."
1.0,"So thin, short, not worth the price"
1.0,I asked for yellow hoping to look like gold and it’s more rose gold looking so color description is not accurate.
1.0,Bought this for my mom for Christmas and she’s loved it! Dragonflies remind her of her mother that passed away. Here it is February and it’s falling apart. Not good quality.
1.0,Rip in sock
1.0,broke first day I wore it
1.0,Is not long like shown on the picture. Fit like a regular t-shirt. Pockets are awkwardly  high.
1.0,Material is too cheap. Pants were ok and shirt was too small
1.0,It came messed up. All bears were a big blob and couldn't tell them apart. It was terrible. Bad bad quality. I wish it had 0 stars.
1.0,Not compatible with charge 3 as stated.  Totally different straps then described and pictured 🙄.Can’t leave a no star review.
1.0,Horrible fit. Rides up into your eyes when you look down. Worst mask I've ever worn.
1.0,Was broken when opened as a gift
1.0,I was disappointed that the dress was small for it to be a x- large. I really wanted the dress for work because of how stylish it is. The dress doesn't fit as a x-large.
1.0,These shoes arrived wet inside the bag. There was moisture in the bag and they smell horrible like mold.
1.0,Cheap and ugly. They are not what I expected.
1.0,CHEAP!! This bag is not 20” long it’s very small. FALSE ADVERTISING! The quality is very crappy too.
1.0,The pin fell out so this product broke in about three weeks.<br /><br />I was hoping it would last me a while. It's just annoying because now I have to look for a new one and start from the beginning.<br /><br /> I'm really sick of poor products.
1.0,can't read the face and it's continually dropping hours.
1.0,There is brown leather on a belt that should have black leather. These guys do not a good fashion sense.
1.0,Too small for my face. Very hard grasp and painful on my ears. Can’t be used for my glasses. Do you have a larger size?
1.0,Overpriced swiss watch should be a lot less.its basically  Hamilton khaki with a dome
1.0,"These don’t even look like cats. The picture in the description looks like cats but in person they are so tiny they just look like a little crystal. Also did not get the gold I asked for, got rose gold and I don’t like rose gold."
1.0,Only thing I like is the sheer part but it’s very cheap material
1.0,Made for daddy long legs.
1.0,"I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!  I have purchased clothing from Amazon in the past and loved it, however I recently purchased several items, and was not happy. The dresses especially this one are made  with very cheap material and do not look as they do on line. I hate to return, BUT THESE LAST SEVERAL ITEMS PURCHASED WILL BE RETURNED..... PLEASE AMAZON USE QUALITY MATERIAL!"
1.0,I was very excited to receive this bag as it is the perfect size for quick weekend getaways - the second time I used it the stitching from the strap to the bag ripped - very disappointed of the quality.
1.0,The material is terrible! and the color did not look anything like the picture. It was more of a neon orange.
1.0,no glitter misleading. just cloth
1.0,Bad salesman
1.0,"I’m 5 10 and I’m 260. My upper body is usually a large or X large. I tried the shirt on and it was tight fitting. It has very little give, meaning not a lot of stretch. It is not true to size. It is also comes like a crop top when I put it on. I got an X large. I have to send it back now. Ugh I think if the garment was true to size it would look nice though."
1.0,"I just received these earrings today and they are worthless. The largest of the three is almost too small and the other two sizes are impossible for any normal human being to use. I spent an hour trying to put the large size set on, only to end up with a bent twisted mess due to the flimsy material from which these are made. If you are a woman with fingernails don’t bother, they’re impossible to get on and close tightly. Total waste of money. Truly disappointed."
1.0,I did not like the material at all. To heavy
1.0,"I loved these pants they fit perfect, but the snap was not stitched in and came out the first time i wore them.."
1.0,"Poisonous fumes even after 3 days in the garage!  (Think spray paint and burning oil refinery.) Ladies, please don't expose yourself to these chemicals that cause migraines and who knows what other illnesses to save a few bucks.  I have now tried 6 different &#34;made in China&#34; brands and they all have the same choking, noxious fumes.  IT WILL COST YOU MORE TO SEND THEM BACK THEN THEY COST!  Just say no. Plus, they are not remotely comfortable!  Just say no.  You are worth the extra few dollars!"
1.0,"Great service, TERRIBLE PRODUCT. The closure design on these is terrible and makes the band unusable. It was impossible to open the clasp to put it on my wrist and then when I was finally able to do that I could not get it to close again. All 4 in my package were the same. As a previous buyer mentioned, I contacted Amazon to return this since they are a waste and they simply refunded me and told me to keep the bands-no need to return. The colors were really cute, it's too bad they are just pretty to look at and I can't wear them."
1.0,"A copper or other metal was visible on the bracelet where silver should have been. Overall, all of the metal was dull and antique-looking. Needless to say, I have returned the bracelet. You get what you pay for. It is hard to believe that any seller would foist this off on any customer, let alone an Amazon customer."
1.0,Rides up. Horrible bra.
1.0,Lasted two wears...you get what you pay for.
1.0,This is a thin shirt with no substance
1.0,The earrings are heavy their heavy the only thing I can compare it to is about the weight of a soda can hold a can of soda and then imagine them hanging from your earlobes.... Don't do it
1.0,I like having the cigarette case with Elvis's picture on it the only downfall is the picture does not stayed glued on I'm on the second time gluing the picture I'm hoping it stays this time would not recommend this to anyone
1.0,horrible quality...arrived broke! bubble gum machine jewlery!
1.0,"All the opposite as another one that we ordered, the sizes here run way to sam"
1.0,"Nice watch but...the quality control is faulty at the end of the assembly line as proof of the number of defective watches. This would be bearable if we accept to rely on luck and if Pagani respects the conditions of its guarantee. From my own experience (defective movement and dial that loses its indices) you should know that in the event of a problem Pagani will cordially ignore you, they have no consideration for their customers, they will not respond to your messages, the guarantee will not be not honored. Good luck...!"
1.0,Very cheap and much shorter then I expected or wanted
1.0,"withing 3 days wearing it one of the stone fall off, im sad because i loved this pendant"
1.0,False advertisement! Online description shows 95% cotton. Received items both tags show 95% polyester.
1.0,Extremely poor quality.
1.0,Hi. I found it very small am not able to use it
1.0,Hot garbage. Too small and made of cheap material. Do not buy.

1.0,Product was made in China.
1.0,"This item broke after only 3 weeks. If I coud give it zero stars, I would. It is super thin."
1.0,I bought a small. Pants way too big and top too small. Not worth the money at all
1.0,"Runs WAY smaller than the size it claims to be. My thin 9 yr-old typically wears size 7-8. Because of reviews, I ordered size 8-10. Way too tight! Makes no sense."
1.0,junk jewelry
1.0,Socks got runs in them first wear and the colors are off to be called rainbow
1.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; and 140lbs, this sweater was shaped like it was made for a cardboad box and was immediately itchy the moment I put it on, almost like a wool feeling. Requested a refund as soon as I put it on."
1.0,Too small. No give in the fabric at all. Also they are very short and cut boxy. The lace itches too. I returned.
1.0,Shows hard plastic with mesh eyes in add go rubber with no mesh floppy junk would not recommend
1.0,Ordered in early September. Still NOT here! AND I was given a bogus tracking number to boot.
1.0,"Tightest things I've ever had. Terrible to get on. I had to cut the top and the toes off, making a sleeve, to be able to wear them for a hot minute, and I  prayed I could get them off.  Way too small. Don't get these. They are torture devices."
1.0,I wrote a bad review on this item and retract that statement.  This dress was exactly wat I wanted. I will buy from this vendor again!  I apologize to vendor for first review.  I got compliments right away. Thank you
1.0,"FALSE ADVERTISING! This was marketed as a compression garment. A very important quality for me. Only to get it and find out that the size is way way off. It was way too large. I ordered the small and it fits more like a medium/large. But the worst thing about it is that this NOT A COMPRESSION garment. This is simply false. I am very upset about that. I wasted time I could have spent otherwise. I was going to wear this to the marathon I have this weekend! This is  your regular stretchy, made in china tank top. Also, it fits like a mans shirt. It doesn't have the slimer waist you get with womens shirts. Absolutely nothing special about it. Very disappointing! Stop with the false advertising!!!! Sell it as the regular work out shirt it is. This types of lies should not be allowed in amazon."
1.0,The lens were chipped when I received them.
1.0,Super chincy toy jewelry. Basically silver coloured plastic.
1.0,Car will not start with the cover on...
1.0,"Scented :( and way too small. Nothing like other compression shirts, much less give."
1.0,definitely NOT 1 and 1/4 inches wide. disappointingly small and over priced
1.0,I received a product that was a knockoff.  I received my Bvlgari watch and the date advances every 12 hours one day and the next day does not advance at all. I took watch to the Bvlgari authorized service center in my area and they confirmed my watch is a knockoff and the serial number was registered to someone 3 years ago and that watch is currently in service for a tune up and parts replacement.
1.0,"i thought it was a pair but when i received the merchandise, it's only one piece, i wish it was a pair so now how am i going to use it one leg and i have to buy the other piece and it will take another month to receive it because it took them at least a month to get that one piece."
1.0,stones were glued on improperly
1.0,The leather band broke on the first day. It is perfect for my fiancee's style but not worth purchasing again.
1.0,"Not a lot of quality on this hat, the symmetry is way off making it something of a waste of funds. Very disappointed."
1.0,"This bracelet is really cute, but broke with an hour of taking it out of the box 🙄"
1.0,"This is cheap outfit from China and has no type of fit or flare. Very weird on top too. Also, they are Prime but actually will not except free returns or exchanges."
1.0,"I ordered this sweater in a size large. It was so big, shapeless and floppy. The knit of the sweater was loose and the yarn was cheap feeling. If I wanted a cheaply made blanket I would have bought one. Save your money. This one's not worth it ☹"
1.0,I do not like.  just one wash lost a lot of quality
1.0,It’s extremely overly stretchy and see through. The end.
1.0,"Very poor quality.  Reminded me of a cheap Halloween costume dress.  It had a weird ""add on"" hem.  It was just very cheaply put together, had no shape.  Sorry I wasted my time.  I knew better but couldn't help myself."
1.0,Out of all of these only two were actually big enough to hold my tube of chapstick. And it's just the regular chapstick size tube.  The width of the holder just wasn't big enough. It was sewn too tightly.  Wouldn't recommend.
1.0,Could not even fit my tiniest of friends
1.0,Clasp broke within the first week. Bummer.
1.0,"Mmmm, this tie is the brightest, strongest color of blue possible. will be returning it. Other than that, did receive it quickly."
1.0,These leggings are not for for larger women.
1.0,"Fit a lot larger than expected. The fabric has an unpleasant, strechy, polyester feel. Sending them back."
1.0,This sneaker was stiff and unyielding. My 7 year old said the heal felt like it slipped out when walking even though the shoe fit when we evaluated it on his foot.  He loved the look and yet refused to wear them because they were uncomfortable.
1.0,Absolute crap. Couldn’t even get the balls off the hoops.
1.0,The chains look/feel very cheap and the lace was not firm.
1.0,Bad sweatshop quality. I’ll fitting cuts and wholes...do not<br />Waste your money
1.0,You get what you pay for. I received this dress today. Already got my return labels. If you want a dress for this $24.00 price then purchase it. Material is cheap.  It was not for me.
1.0,I didn't even order this necklace. I ordered something that's supposed to change colors when it gets dark....from white to green....with a different cat image also.  They send this like they think I won't notice.  HA!  Not cool. And this necklace??  Tiny with very small chain.  Might be suitable for a child. Returned it.
1.0,Don’t buy.  Lasted for 2 days.  The 2 rings that hold the watchband down broke.
1.0,"Ordered XL, fit is med. or smaller. poor workmanship. Seams not finished.  Returned it."
1.0,This was not a double eye case.  Just a hard case for one pair of sunglasses
1.0,"I got the recommend size for me (M) and it was way too small. I would have exchanged for the next size up, but the material itself was horrible. It wasn't even clothing material, maybe something better suited for a beach bag. Plastic rope-type fibers and it smelled like burnt rubber. Not recommended. Returned immediately"
1.0,"I absolutely loved the photo of this dress on the website. I was so disappointed when it arrived and it looked like a costume dress. Very thick fabric, heavy and ill fitting. Also, it runs very small. The color was a bright deep peach. Not at all like in the photo. I returned it immediately. Didn’t bother taking a photo."
1.0,Weird material ..I didn't like the way it fely
1.0,Post to thick to fit average size hole. Earring doesnt fit through
1.0,Loved this blouse. Well made. Fit was too small. So I returned.

1.0,The cap its short  and in the description show the cap its very large<br />Its not thrue
1.0,"arrived broken, had to return. cant imagine these would have held up well if they are easily broken during shipping."
1.0,"This chain is so thin and lightweight. I hate it. I bought this chain for a heavy pendant because it looked nicely made by the picture, but I was completely fooled. It will probably cost me more to return this chain than I paid for it."
1.0,"I’m a 36C with other bras, so I bought the same in this. VERY disappointed. Was expecting a nice push up to wear under a dress for a wedding but the bra I received had cup about the size of my fist. Trust me, this is a cheap and sorry attempt at a bra. Do not buy it. Will be returning."
1.0,"This item represents as one pair of earrings with 7 interchangeable stones. My first order came with one stone. I requested another order as this was not what I thought I ordered. The replacement order was the same, only one stone. Not good."
1.0,"This cardigan was not what I was expecting. I ordered a size up based on the reviews and it was way too big. The sleeves were baggy, the fit was in no way form fitting like it looks in the pictures, and it felt very heavy when I tried it on. Maybe if I would have returned for a size smaller it would have been better, but I just didn’t like it. I ended up returning this the same day I got it."
1.0,Amazing quality but wrong sized and placed in missed matched packaging.
1.0,"I purchased a pair a year or more ago and they became my favorite. I reordered from the EXACT SAME LISTING and what I received was the cheapest, thinnest, scratchiest article of clothing I've ever seen. Talk about bait & switch!"
1.0,When zipping shut the zippers pull apart.
1.0,Useless... for what you likely think ur gonna use it for.
1.0,The cuffs are very tight! They cut off my circulation!
1.0,Not feasible  for women with actual  breasts
1.0,Not a good product if you have a thicker nose. Looked weird and kept falling out.
1.0,Fit like a garbage bag and the hood was a strange shape so that it wouldn't be any use if it actually rained
1.0,Terrible. So thin and flimsy. Idk why I had to choose a size if it’s one size fits all? Smh that’s a little deceiving. I’m returning for my money back . Only gave it one star because it came on time.
1.0,too yellow looking
1.0,The fabric was sown incorrectly. The words on the front of the shirt were upside down and on the arms and the back were right side up. Made the shirt look very odd having the pattern sown upside down like that. I'm requesting a refund.
1.0,"Horrible, it will stain everything you own."
1.0,Very thin.. not worth the money
1.0,Nothing like pictured...dont waste ut money. It was too small and the fabric is rough and itchy
1.0,"I like the appearance. But at the back it says, cased in China?"
1.0,Bought these thinking they were new but obviously got a used pair.
1.0,At first my son loved his car glasses case and was so excited to take it to school. I bought these specific ones because I can clip them on his lunch box. Well after using it for 3 days the fabric has completely torn where it was connected to the clip and I cannot clip it on his lunch box anymore. So sad to say I'm pretty disappointed in this product.
1.0,not at all what it describes on the site. Not worth the coast at all.
1.0,"I ordered the size 10.5, I was sent a size 23! My son was so disappointed that the shoes didn’t fit him"
1.0,Product arrived with inside covering of leather strap pulled away from the outer leather strap.
1.0,"Beautiful dress, but it is not made for a woman with a good size bust! I’m a 38D, and there was NO way this dress was going to fit me. The slit is too large and does not cling well. I feel like it was made quite awkwardly as there is almost no length between the the waist and neck. I’m average size, BTW. 5’5, 168lbs, and I wear a size 10."
1.0,"I ordered these shoes twice.  They fit fine.  The problem we had were the lights.  The first pair that we got worked fine for 2 days.  On the third day, there were some lights that stopped working & some that turned a different color than the rest of the shoe's lights.  I returned them & ordered another pair thinking maybe this was just a fluke.  We had the exact same problem with the second pair of shoes.  I wouldn't buy them."
1.0,Was not cut as shown. Very basic square pattern and sleeves are short.
1.0,"What happened! The material is durable with stretch, but what’s with the color. They look like baby poop! These are not green:/ what a disappointment... was so looking forward to wearing these on my trip. Oh, and if u don’t like them it costs $10 to return them. Ugh!"
1.0,"I never want to write a bad review-- and this isn't a bad review, more than anything I'm confused. I did indeed receive black and white (2 garments total) pieces of fabric, but that's all it was. No instructions, no info-- just two scarf sized sheer pieces of fabric. Not even really scarf sized.<br /><br />I am not a big girl and there is no way I could ever wear this in public. Not a chance. My suggestion would be to wear a real halter top or a real bathing suit top. If anyone knows of a decent fitting halter top, please let me know, this won't support you or your chest. Maybe it's possible the company made a mistake cause this isn't what I pictured whatsoever."
1.0,It was too big and I ordered an xsmall
1.0,"This thing sucks, never even used it and it didn't work. Tried new batteries. Still won't work."
1.0,"Received this product and upon opening it and trying it on, there was only half of the zipper on the dress, which is included in the picture provided. The material was very very cheap, there were strings hanging off of the seams, and snags in the material. Very disappointed in this product and have already processed my return."
1.0,Dress came with holes in it and nasty white stains. It's really see-through outside of the holes also. Ran a little small.
1.0,"Too small, by at least 2 sizes."
1.0,I didn't like it at all it was terrible when I first got it it broke terrible
1.0,sent them back so many things wrong with them there are too many to list.
1.0,This runs really small had to return it.
1.0,Too small I thought the bear would of been Bigger
1.0,"Can’t get this product over my calf,  let alone my knee or my thigh and I bought a large."
1.0,These run big and the cheap material has very little elasticity!
1.0,Runs extra small. Prob fits a child
1.0,"Omg, i am so disappointed with this, i bought ut for a trip, after the first day i wore it i got lint fur balls everywhere it looked so bad, i tried to remove it but it was just too much!! It looked dirty and cheap the only good side was it was comfy and warm other than that i hated it."
1.0,"No shape, too wide, too long!!! bad"
1.0,Material is no nice looks nothing like the picture.  It was long
1.0,Never again.
1.0,I ordered the white and black polo shirt and just received the item and it’s white and navy blue. I am livid about this!
1.0,Returning the bracelet. Cheaply made.<br />The picture showed blue lapis with a lot of the stones showing some white coloration.<br />This is what I liked. What I received is a regular cheap lapis bracelet. Also very small.
1.0,I want to return this item it’s too small for me
1.0,"Not only was this dress significantly smaller than comparable dresses, the sleeves that were supposed to go until the wrist, only came until just below the elbow and did not look like the picture at all."
1.0,"This is really bad , sorry. Small is listed as having a 27.5 waist, It actually measures 24 inches. Burgundy is gathered at waist and not flat shown in photo. Buttons do not align correctly and it is a tulip cut at bottom. Very misrepresented."
1.0,Packaged arrived open with nothing inside. Very upset
1.0,Cheap only design on one side. Do not recommend
1.0,Returning. The quality of this product is terrible. The skirt seam to the main bodice is not sewn properly as there are noticable gaps.
1.0,Super diferente el color... no se parece... venden el articulo con una foto que no corresponde a lo que venden!
1.0,Cute shirt. Uncomfortable fabric. Bizarre sizing/fit. Not for me. Donated to Goodwill. Order at your own risk.
1.0,Came broken not far👿
1.0,Horrible fit . I’ve ordered many dresses off amazon and this is the only one that’s had to be returned.
1.0,This is a stolen image AND T-shirt design from my friends company called The Talking Shirt. This company needs to remove this.
1.0,"I was excited to get this skirt, it was not what was pictured and it was way to small. Don't buy this skirt."
1.0,Why are why men wearing a Juneteenth hat. It is the Independence for black people. Please stop
1.0,"Did not work, don't buy"
1.0,Nothing like the picture. The quality was poor and it was already starting to tear at the seems.
1.0,"I ordered a small and there's NO way this is a small, it's at least a large and maybe an XL. Not even close to as cute as the picture."
1.0,"Just like others mentioned, these came completely damaged and unwearable. Packaging was very poor. Would not recommend."
1.0,"Bad quality control. It seems the fabric on these dresses varies with the styles. The fabric is so scant on this dress, it barely folds over on the neckline. Very thin and cheaply made. It is not sewn straight. Sending back."
1.0,Junkie junkie junkie junkie junkie
1.0,Picture came off of the tag within 3 days<br />Bad quality
1.0,I thought this was a nice deal and was looking forward to receiving. Unfortunately there was a large black stain in the middle of the front! I tried to spot clean it with a drop of Dawn liquid and the nightgown color came right off! Can still see remnants of the black stain though! What a real disappointment!!!
1.0,.  buy. Gift that did not fit. Made for a small person
1.0,Wore slippers about an hour and stitching is ripping out. Very cheaply made. They have alot of nerve selling these for 25.99.
1.0,"The magnetic clasp is not strong enough to hold this heavy bracelet together. It kept flying off when I motioned with my arm. The welded loop that connected the snap part to the bracelet broke on one of it's many falls to the floor. I was going to replace the magnetic clasp with a lobster clasp, but it didn't last long enough to do so. I'm really disappointed because I love the look of the bracelet!"
1.0,Looks like I have bug eyes. Huge! Look like womens glasses.
1.0,"Thought I was ordering a SAK. Nope, not even close. Returned immediately. PAPER & PLASTIC."
1.0,Is this for toddlers?
1.0,The shorts were stoned in the inside as of someone already wore them🤮
1.0,"It is made with a cheap material and stitching is shoddy.  I'm a 14 and ordered an XXXL, the bottoms fits like a normal size 14 but the top not in proportion."
1.0,"Cheaply made, washed on time and unraveled at seams. In addition is was far too small."
1.0,Old people glasses. Narrow like part of bifocals. Shopping for glasses on Amazon is so unnecessarily difficult
1.0,"I ordered a blazer Jacket and I received  a shirt. I am not satisfied  with my purchase.  I thought  it was a jacket ,but it's more so a shirt."
1.0,Thaw shirts are not normal graphic t-shirts. The print is a plastic that is attached to the shirt. The design print makes the shirt heavy and uncomfortable and my daughter will never wear them. This was not a good purchase.
1.0,Poorly made broke after 2 days as well as began turning  the silver finish  was off in places
1.0,Dead battery/Does not work
1.0,"VERY VERY SMALL. Purchased XL so it would be very flowing and loose. I’m 5’7 with small chest and the bottom point in front barely came to my waist. If you are a petite size 4 and 5 foot tall, MAYBE the Lf3 style in XL will look like it does on the model. Otherwise, I wouldn’t recommend buying this."
1.0,"This shirt shows as an oversized shirt in the photo and is described as a loose fit crew.  I ordered a Medium expecting it to be oversized.  It fit more like a Small.  When I began the return process, the seller provided a note that reminded me that I would have to pay the return postage since it was shipped by the seller and not by Amazon.  So I have decided not to return it, but instead to find someone else who might be able to wear it.  I was disappointed, but not terribly surprised since the fit of of clothing sizes in general can vary so much."
1.0,didnt love these. a lot larger than i expected
1.0,Too small please let me return!
1.0,IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE AND IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FROM HALLOWEEN.<br />I WANT MY $$ BACK.
1.0,Bar too long for industrial piercing.
1.0,The are to heavy to stay as they should the slide sideways
1.0,Didn't like it at all!!! The dog charm fell off and got lost on the first day😩
1.0,Look amazing on screen but arrive like some rummage garbage. Look a cheap mess
1.0,the were rusting so much i HATE IT waste of my money never buy
1.0,Definitely not rose gold stud earring ...
1.0,It broke the second time I wore It.
1.0,Not worth even $5. Huge rip off.<br />Do not order this dress!<br />It looks like horrible clothes from Walmart.
1.0,Super cheap & ugly! Not as pictured ...
1.0,The piece was broken and three sections when I opened it. It is beautiful but what can I do if its broken.
1.0,This top is too big and baggy but I decided to keep it because the colors are cute.  Wish I hadn't!  The fabric is light weight and clingy and sticks to my leggings.  I am always tugging and pulling on it and am inclined to cover it up with a vest.  I really wish I had returned it from the start.
1.0,These slippers would have been great if they fit but they were extremely small. The size said 5=6 and the slipper was probably equivalent to a size 3. Very disappointed.
1.0,I washed one and let it air out for almost two weeks and it still smelled awful.  Plus they don't lay flat for sublimation and don't have enough curve to fit your face well.  An all around fail.
1.0,I was excited to get this watch. But now it stops working periodically and the inside of the face fogs up so bad I can barely read the time.  I love the way it looks but functionality is kind of important.
1.0,"The dress is beautiful, flattering, and so comfortable. The fabric is so soft and so breathable. Right off the bat, I thought the fabric was a little thin, and you could definitely see the line of my bra, but I just made sure to wear a dark red bra to match. You can't even sneeze on this material without it discoloring. Literally a raindrop hit it and it changed colors. I also didn't think much of it, I figured when it dried it would look normal, not the case."
1.0,Received a shirt where the tag had been cut out. Fit was very wide. And weird material. Seemed the shirt had already been shrunk before i received it. Donated this.
1.0,I should have read the reviews. Pins are too short and won't stay on watch. Almost list my watch several times. They should have included longer pins because it is clearly not for a versa 2. It would he nice if the seller for send longer pins.
1.0,The dress is cute and can be tied to fit your size but in accordance with how cheap it is...the fabric is just as cheap. You can see through it and is so thin it will fly up without question. Unless you wear a slip dress underneath this dress is not ideal.
1.0,Cheaply made and it did not fit at all.
1.0,Most of mine were my little pony. Not actually ok for my needs. Returned
1.0,This bathing suit is cheaply made and does not fit correctly.
1.0,"Not quick connect like advertised, the little bands to hold the strap in place are huge and loose, the strap itself feels very still and not really like silicone."
1.0,Don't waste your money.  5 of the 6 didn't work!
1.0,This fits SO weird.  Everything but the arms fit fine.  For whatever reason the arm holes are just way too small. Returned.
1.0,"I loved the way it looked, but it came unraveled after a handful of times of wearing it.  I didn't snag it on anything it simple just feel apart."
1.0,I give this dress zero stars! Quality is poor
1.0,Fits ok but the seams were sewn off. The dress like twisted and the zipper was not strainght. Did not fit my body shape. Returned
1.0,Letters are already peeling off I only got it day ago and they are sharp
1.0,These shoes are SO heavy! The glitter on them is not smooth at all and is extents scratchy.
1.0,Returned it for a bigger size
1.0,This shirt is a no go too small n poor material.
1.0,Nice color quality seems fine but really tight in shoulders. I wear a 2x and could not get it on at all
1.0,Really disappointed in the wallet. It does not hold money securely at all - lost $200 pulling it out of my pocket and almost lost another $40 later same day before I could get a new one. In addition any more then 3 cards in it and it’s as thick as any wallet I’ve ever owned.
1.0,"Cute, but very difficult to stay on your ear. I lost this the first time I wore it. Would not order again."
1.0,Did not like the fit on this shirt...poorly made - does not look like the shirt is displays..save your money!
1.0,Did not work at all
1.0,"If I had the packaging it came in I would send it back. It is pretty but very difficult to attach to the watch. It took me 10 minutes to finally get it to click on. Then to tighten it requires 2 hands but one is unavailable because one hand is attached to the wrist that is wearing the watch band. To tighten it you have to push the button, slide the ball & hold the chain tight. I do not recommend this band as it is frustrating!"
1.0,I have not been able to put the straps together.  I have tried everything.  It does not come with instructions.  VERY FRUSTRATING!!!
1.0,Very cheaply made. And it clings.
1.0,"I’m a normal size 8-10 and ordered an XL. It must be made in little/junior sizes. Got it zipped tightly in back, but shoulders way too small."
1.0,Was so excited when these arrived as they looked exactly what I was looking for. Super warm but terrible construction. I’ve worn twice and already coming apart at the seams. I bought two pairs in different colors and would have bought a third had they been constructed well.<br />Would NOT recommend.
1.0,It was child size way too small don’t buy
1.0,"Fabric is like a very thin tee shirt material with a stiff iron on applique.  Also runs small.  I ordered a large so it was roomy, not the case.  I do not think this would last well with one washing."
1.0,It broke on the first day WHILE I was wearing it. It’s cute but not sturdy.
1.0,"This seems way too small for an XL. I also bought an XXL and it was ridiculous large. It is a nice sit for the price, but the sizing is way off."
1.0,Couldn't get these up to my waist without pain in the groin.  Too short waisted and they run extremely small.
1.0,The metal is silver tone and I needed gold tone as shown; the stones are ugly and not blue green. I wanted them as shown to match a necklace that I own. I am very disappointed in this purchase.
1.0,Cheap junk fell apart first day I wore it.Save your money
1.0,"Disgusting! The dress was covered in animal hair (2 different kinds) all along the bottom! It was so bad, I didn’t even want to touch it or try it on. Not sure if someone previously ordered it and tried it on and returned it or was shipped like this from a seller. If I could give 0 stars, I would!"
1.0,"way to small, the xl looks and fit like a M"
1.0,"Trying to contact this company. I ordered a watch for my husband for Christmas. It is February 7th and yesterday at work while my husband was typing on the computer he heard a snap, looked down and the glass was cracked across?!?!? I don't even understand how that happens."
1.0,"size was very large, I stay too big"
1.0,"Like others have commented, these lenses broke apart when flipping up after just a few uses."
1.0,"Just for your information, Amazon's customers. ....You will wait for your order for months.............If I knew it I would have never ordered it. ."
1.0,They could of atleast shipped it in a box the bag had dirt all inside it bc the ziplock bag had holes in it I mean the hat is washable so it's fine but geez!
1.0,The zipper is gold not silver
1.0,The chain broke immediately upon wearing it.
1.0,You get what you pay for. That’s all I’m gonna say.
1.0,"Very soft and cuddly, my granddaughter loves them. They also washed up very well."
1.0,"1, a 2001 quarter is not silver. 2, never sand down a uncirculated coin because it then becomes worthless.  3, a holder must state US Quarters.  Foreign coins are not the same size as US coins.  I would not purchase from these people unless you get 100% guarantee.  Thanks  for the input as I am now not going to buy from these people"
1.0,Awful I got one that closes and the other is like a fixed clasp it won’t open at all and when I finally did open it with pliers it was just bending the metal.
1.0,"Please know that these tights are a light Neon green color.  I thought they would be darker from the picture.  Also, be mindful of their return policy.  I wanted to return mine but missed the window."
1.0,"Yes, I may have been tough pulling them up, but I never had socks rip when I pulled them on my feet.<br />The first time I grabbed and pulled, they ripped."
1.0,Ripped/ sowing came off
1.0,I didn't think it fit well the material was too thin.
1.0,No me gustó porque en la foto se ve mucho mejor que la realidad
1.0,"bot a plus size, this fits my tiny 7 year old granddaughter"
1.0,"For ten bucks you would think you would get a bit of use out of them, but that’s not the case. After removing from packaging and trying on, the clasp did not close properly the metal simply bent and broke. Not worth the money."
1.0,"Had to return, after reading the charging instructions, and putting them on my daughter to head out to a night event, when we went to turn them on 1 shoe wouldn't light up at all. They are very cool, but not happy my 6 year old ended up in tears b/c of a bad product; although I do understand this can happen."
1.0,came broken-very very fragile-save your money
1.0,Quality of cloth is very low. Color faded after 1 wash
1.0,Power Cord doesn't work...stoped working after 1 day...very disappointing. ..
1.0,Love the material. My sister gave me one of<br />These nightgowns.<br />But it was TOO SMALL.<br />S O I ORDERED THE 2X AND its still tight fora nightgown :(  and Im a size 14.
1.0,Cheesy
1.0,When I pressed this shirt it faded and was not a true 4xlt for big man
1.0,Seemed ok out of the package but after the first wash shrunk down to a size that does not fit. I should have paid a little more for a well known name brand.
1.0,This must be a sec it because the person is starting to come on Rado I've only used it twice since Christmas
1.0,Impossible to apply... The first film came off easily but unsticking the logo from the second film basically warped the sticker beyond saving. Both went into the trash.
1.0,The sweater was very short. The item I received is not what is pictured. Sleeves are shorter and it hung just below my but.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:c9a54cdfa28c2f43c30fb51d8b961ddd]] I made the purchase because it said real gold. There is no description of the metal underneath the gold. I can see rust on both ends. This can creat a rash.
1.0,Not crazy about the dress.
1.0,These say 12 but are not wide at all way to tight. Seems like a nice shoe other wise. Update ordered a 13 again not wide. Also it's the wrong boot!!!! Not slip on at all
1.0,"I'm a size 6, and this was small, didn't fit below belly button like the picture."
1.0,Too small<br />Was out of town and unable to try it on  or return due to being senior citizens and unable to travel.<br />30 days unacceptable return policy for this product.
1.0,"What I received is not a genuine Beyond Yoga legging. It's not a terrible legging, but it's not what I paid for and not what I expected. The color is brighter than the original Beyond Yoga I've seen, and the fabric is shinier and not as soft. I was pretty stoked to have found it at a discount,  but as always if it seems too good to be true, it probably is."
1.0,Wouldn't stay on nails.
1.0,"The little levers on the suction cups broke right after putting it on the mirror. So, unless I stand there and hold it for my husband it is sitting in the bathroom drawer."
1.0,This shirt I ordered looks nothing like the picture. It looks like a slightly large long sleeved shirt. It’s not flowy or loose at all. It was supposed to be one size and came in an M. I am a short and petite woman.
1.0,This mask has no glitter. It is an unattractive print. There were no filters included. It definitely represents false advertising. I’m going to try to return it.
1.0,"Fan literally worked for 3 seconds.  It came on when I first inserted batteries, because it was in the ""on"" position.  I turned it off and put the suit on.  I tried turning the fan on before I zipped up and... nothing.  Fan no longer worked.  I checked for loose wires, tried reinserting the batteries, examined the on/off switch.  The fan didn't even try to power on temporarily, like there was a bad contact or something.  It's just broken now for no reason.  I thought this costume would be worth having if it worked for just one party or other event, but I never even got the chance to try it out.  Absolute junk!  Avoid this one."
1.0,Couldn’t even try it. This dress arrived dirty and loaded with dog hair... I am severely allergic to Dogs. Not even sure what the dress looked like...it was put right back in the bag.<br />Very disgusting and disappointed
1.0,Item is very very small will not be ordering again
1.0,"Pretty costume jewelry.  The first time I got it the stone was cut crooked you.  Sent it back and had it replaced ed by the seller who was very nice about it.  However when I received the replacement something about it didn't look right to me.  It did the sparkle at all,  was just very flat.  So I took to be tested by a jeweler and it was shown not to be a diamond as stated. Just glass.  Returned it again. Seller denies this of course.  Maybe they honestly don't realize what they are selling.  Either way,  don't  by this if you are seeking a diamond do equivalent."
1.0,This was the most horrible bracelet EVER!!!! I was so disappointed! I bought it  for a friend for her birthday and she wore it for less then a day and 5 of the stones fell off!! This is very cheap!! I recommend you do NOT buy it! It's a waste of money!
1.0,Feels cheap was too small did not like
1.0,"The quality of the crowns, earrings, necklace and rings were like dollar finds. I bought for my granddaughter and since X-mas the only things left are the shoes and gloves. I wouldn’t recommend at all."
1.0,Terrible terrible! Not at all as decribed! Just dont waste your money
1.0,I was so excited when I recieved this product. I ordered 3 bow ties. They lasted all of 5 minutes.
1.0,"It looks nice when you receive it but as soon as you try it on it breaks. The bralette ripped immediately. Granted I am a bigger chested woman, but I ordered two sizes up because of this. It immediately tore apart. The underwear gives you instant muffin top even if you don’t have a lot of fat around your stomach/hips. The robe is tight around your shoulders and VERY short. The shorts are okay but they definitely ride up the second you move. I hope you like the feeling of a wedgie all the time"
1.0,This was a waste of money
1.0,"I've worn this shirt a total of 4 times. Last night it ripped on me! Would really like a replacement as I loved this shirt, but have no way to contact the seller."
1.0,"Update: It is now 9/3/17 and the ball end will just not stay on the earring. I put back on twice and just falls right out, not great quality.<br /><br />I used this for my rook and it took a good hour and half and lots of tools to get it in and the ball screwed back on. It's just so tiny, but once in it looks just like I wanted!"
1.0,First of all paid all that money to get it before 14th and it arrived late was nothing like I thought it would be.
1.0,Liked the band but wore for 4 days and print is rubbing off. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Was not navy blue at all.  Lighter washed out blue.  I would have kept it
1.0,"This was so poorly made that I gave it to Goodwill, hoping they can get rid of it.  It was a pretty blue, however."
1.0,nose thing keeps coming apart - had to buy a new pair
1.0,I dont  know the purpose of this item but it could not hold a single passport. Only good for change and maybe money. Ridiculously small.
1.0,Ordered a size bigger and still didn't fit
1.0,Material looks cheap & shiney it doesn't have much sex appeal to me!! I don't like it at all I'm upset!!
1.0,I love the concept such a great idea but the keychain and way to lightweight for the price i paid and the plastic piece keeping the photo in keeps popping out of it. It was very cheap.
1.0,"I ordered the green color and this was a top, not a dress, not even tunic length. I am only 5' feet tall so this says a lot!"
1.0,I thought I would try out these beautiful earrings however upon pulling out the wooden stick part to place in my ear the earring whole broke apart literally crumbled in a second on one side only.
1.0,"Received today and got 3 were broken right out of the box. So out of 5 pairs of different sized earrings, 3 different sizes are damaged and had empty brackets"
1.0,"Zipper broke off while trying it on for the first time. Even without it zipped up, the material is impossible to see through (which I was aware of and didn't mind), but also was sticking to my mouth whenever I tried to breathe."
1.0,Don't waste your time or money. The one I received looked like someone's toddler glued it together!
1.0,It completely came apart and was not usable after only a few uses ....and I only weigh 195.  I only used it to sit on for chores around my yard .....its not well made.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:b60c66e2fb481d83380f9524d47ff4a4]] Nothing like the picture. Not a swimsuit. Not lined. No padding. Do not buy
1.0,The glasses broke very easily and quickly.
1.0,They say you get three cases - I only received one.<br />Sucks.
1.0,Too small for size medium
1.0,Broke the very first time I used it as a dog leash.
1.0,False advertisement<br />False advertisement
1.0,"I do not recommend these earrings. I ordered the 8 pack but only got 7. Three of the pairs do not match either by size, color or pattern which you can see by my picture. I contacted the seller to see if they could fix the issue and I have yet to hear back. Wish I could give negative stars."
1.0,"I ordered two sets of vampire teeth from Dental Distortions this past October, being that I purchased the ""Orc"" teeth 16 years ago and loved them. The orc teeth are still going strong, even after reheating them a few dozen times. The two vampire teeth that showed up were very flimsy and the veneer didn't adhere to the melted plastic. I emailed them for suggestions and didn't receive a reply. We had to super glue the teeth to the plastic."
1.0,The bracelet part isn’t too bad but the charm looks like it came out of a gumball machine or cereal box or something. It seems like plastic with a paper sticker on it. The whole thing is worth a couple bucks at most. It’s being returned this week.
1.0,This looks good unless you have not washed it. Once you wear it and washed it. You will see threads are coming out of it from everywhere.<br />This is one time used cloth
1.0,Smells like mildew. Completely unusable.
1.0,"Soft, stretchy and comfy, but the seams ripped out on one of them after a single wash, before use. All of the other 3 have lose strings hanging out. I don't imagine  getting much use out of them."
1.0,"Update-  changed from 3 stars to 1...<br />my son wore these twice. Already, the toes are unraveling. I wont purchase them again.<br /><br />The look is exactly as described however they are so tight around the top of the shoe. They are very hard to put on and they hurt my sons feet."
1.0,This is waaaaaaay too small. And I ordered accordingly. So small that I have to give it to my very skinny sister in law there was no way this shirt was going to button.
1.0,The product was so pretty to look at but once it was on it got all tangled in the eyeglasses… very disappointed!
1.0,"Not happy with these. 1) there not adjustable (my husband is 6'3"" and need them larger), 2) the sizing doenst keep after washing( they shrunk) 3) 1 of 3 mask needed to be sewn because the seam split. The only reason I hadnt returned them is cause I cant find anymore anywhere else, and If i make them like i should have from the jump, their going back!"
1.0,"Run small, and are very cheap/thin.<br />Amazon recommended size small for me so I got a medium because I don't like tight things especially around my stomach. Th way they are sewn at the top makes them not stretchy at all really around the waist so they're not comfortable at all when you sit down."
1.0,Way too big for a small. Deceiving and the pink was more bumble gum pop....
1.0,"These mask will not make it more than one week.  They are like the $2.99 ones sold at the grocery store, but really makes me mad is the color of the blue one it is NOT NAVY... it is ocean, but if you need it to match a basketball uniform of navy blue then don't buy it. The ear loops are not adjustable but one size fits all. Did I get the item I ordered?"
1.0,Started tarnishing and turned my finger green by the third day.
1.0,These attract everything. They come out of the wash looking worse than they did going in. I had to throw them away.
1.0,"Too large in some places, too small in others. Gaps, gathers, reveals. Unwearable."
1.0,This would have been exactly what I expected if it were longer. It doesn't even cover my bikini bottom on the front. It is more like an oversized shirt than a cover-up
1.0,so big and really cheap
1.0,Looks absolutely nothing like the picture. It’s very small and itchy. It may look kind of cute with an outfit but you will have to wear long sleeves underneath or you will be miserable all day. I paid way too much money for junk! Complete rip off. It’s a bit disappointing that amazon allows sellers like this to take my hard earned money for flea market junk.
1.0,Not anti-fog I wouldn’t purchase again
1.0,Was wearing it and one day the band just snapped and broke.  Contacted customer support. Letting them know. They sent out a replacement band. The second one broke apart after three weeks. The metal holding the links together is cheaper and thinner than original stock. Not worth the money
1.0,One of the pins holding the band on snapped at work and the watch band fell.
1.0,"Even after trying 2 different sizes (based on chart), I found that there is no compression.  Too loose!"
1.0,"Item had visible seams showing and not accurate to picture, there were several creases on the bag as well from packaging. It feels cheap and not worth the price. Not happy"
1.0,Nice quality and fast shipping but dress had several holes in it. Had to return it.
1.0,The bag is not well made as to material and zippers. I guess the price is just about for what you get.
1.0,"First one inordered was stunning. Got a size 7. Looked exactly like pic.<br />Inordered one for myself in size 10 amd you could tell it was painted silver and was missing stone. Insent it back explaining the issue. Crossing my fingers I get a nice one for myself. Sometimes that happens. When you order two. One is real and one is fake. So frustrating<br />***_update_*** sent me a second painred ring! You could literally tell it was painted. I think they only have one or two sizes that are real and all the rest is fake and garbage. Not worth it. If you are goinf to spend 5$ put another 5 with it and you can actually get something really nice.<br />*then when inwrote to the seller wirh my name amd order number and ring tyoe the response I got back was<br />"" oh what ring did you buy?""<br />That was the entire email. I decided to talk it to amazon. False advertising and selling far age instead of whats promised."
1.0,My pendant came cracked and broke after two or three wears. Super disappointing.
1.0,The pic is very beautiful than the clothe itself...
1.0,Looks real pretty . But does not fit my wrist and I have small wrists.. very disappointed . I ordered two of them one is a gift I sure hope it fits my friend or I will be very sad..
1.0,The material sucks. They look so dumb
1.0,Are there authentic Brazilets? I don't believe they generally come with charms?
1.0,UGH...these are boring.. not fun ones<br />NOT THE STRING OF LIGHTS AS SHOWN ON MY ORDER!!!
1.0,The price for the track suits was good. I ordered several as Christmas gifts. They tracked as having been delivered on 2 orders. They never arrived. I do not recommend you buy from this vendor.
1.0,"Not as it looks in photo. It's a straight dress, not very flowey like it looks. And is much longer than the photos"
1.0,"This dress was ordered for my daughters homecoming dance. She initially loved the dress because of the color and that it had pockets. But when it arrived it was very crumpled up from being in such a small bag, the color was more purple than wine red, the zipper stitching was loose. Overall just do not think it was worth the wait and price. We had to go out and buy her another dress for her dance."
1.0,The look is sloppy and cheap. Very disappointed doesn't look anything like the picture
1.0,"Cute, but I am extremely disappointed. Unchain is so crappy it seems like it came out of a 25 cent machine"
1.0,I had to give this away because as a man who likes at least an XL size but prefers a XXL just incase of shrinkage this jacket was whoa fully undersized. I bought this same product from 2 different shops on here and both shops incompetently undersized to the point I need a 5XL to fit while only wearing a simple t-shirt underneath. THIS WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY & I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AT ALL!!!
1.0,"We are so bummed that this hoodie fit terribly small. It must be from China. My fiancé usually can fit nicely in an XL, but we got a 2XL (which is usually generous), and it was waaaaay too small! We didn't return it in time and seller didn't let us return it late. Waste of money. Move on to something sold straight from the NFL."
1.0,I bought this brooch as an accessory for my wedding taking place in December. It came in good time and I was pleased when I saw how pretty it was. But my pleasure was very short lived as the very first time I tried to undo the pin at the back it broke off. Such a waste.
1.0,"This product was overrated and not the quality I've come to expect from past products I've purchased on Amazon. The board was not magnetic, the mover pieces had magnetic &#34;tape&#34; and not magnets, half the mover pieces had the tape on backwards so they repelled, one of the white dice had two #3s, and one white mover piece had a red mark."
1.0,After the first wash I could not fit my foot in them. I wear size 10.5 men’s. The picture is my wife wearing them she wears size 7 women.
1.0,Broke after two days
1.0,"Does not fit the description.  Terribly made. It look its sweet time coming , maybe a year!? 🤔<br />Someone should have paid me to order these."
1.0,broke after none use not worth sending back
1.0,This bra is not very supportive and the band cut into my ribs all day and left me bruised even though I had it at the least tight. The cups do not fit well either. Will be requesting a refund.
1.0,It fit OK before I washed it in cold water and let it air dry....Massive shrinkage
1.0,"A medium was like an xl, way to wide"
1.0,Quality of fabric wads not good enough. It is T-shirt fabric. I wanted this dress for a wedding....
1.0,"Much too small even going by there provided size chart. Not a breathable fabric, not soft, just not worth the money. I returned immediately. I'm five seven 140 lb, and this made me feel fat. Do not recommend."
1.0,I ordered a 4x in hopes of it being to big im a 2x and it fits like an XL. Super bummed.
1.0,Thin. And weird
1.0,The outfit already has holes in it that we has to sew up ourselves in less than a week.
1.0,Fell apart after first use!! Waste of money and time
1.0,"I got these for my wife, who likes the nylon straps for her Apple Watch but complains that they get dingy and gross after a few weeks of daily use. I love my wife but I'm not spending $50 on an OEM Apple strap every two months! Thought these would be a good alternative at a much lower price point, while also letting my wife swap between straps easily. The nylon material is decent, and the hook-and-loop fasteners feel pretty strong; in this respect, these Makole straps are close to OEM. The weak point is the lugs where the strap connects to the watch -- these lugs are so loose that the watch has actually come off the strap when my wife moves her arms during a workout. I don't expect the fit and finish of an Apple product, but this is obviously a dealbreaker. The basic function of a watch strap is to secure the watch to the wearer's wrist, and unfortunately the Makole straps don't inspire confidence that they'll do that reliably."
1.0,Chintzy fabric that is CHEAP and sewn crooked. Sent back.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Came in the light color and the belt had a small rear in it. 2t had a gem line that dragged the ground. Nearly 3 inches difference between the front and back hem.
1.0,"I have been buying Casio watches for over 20 years and have been happy with their products. Until now. This is the cheapest one that I've purchased - the old adage "" You get what you pay for"" seems to apply. After 15 months it died. Casio Customer service advised that it was out of warranty.<br />No more."
1.0,Put bracelet on and it fell right back off. Broke in two. Never got to wear it. Disappointed
1.0,Size way too small.  Quality of material used was not good.
1.0,My daughter is 37” tall and 31lbs just turned 2 yrs old.  I ordered the 3T which she wears a 2T sometimes a 3T and this was way too small.  Then I had to return it since it was way too small almost equivalent to a 24 month size. They company charged me $5.99 to send it back.  I read the description to make sure I ordered the right size because I hate the nuisance of returning things.  Thanks company!! Your description was poor on your sizes and thanks for changing me to return the item.
1.0,This material is awful. And that’s the nicest word I could use without cussing.  Nothing natural about it. Now I know what the Mars rover found.
1.0,"While the material is light weight and stretches, it does not feel comfortable around the ears and clings to the mouth. Even though they have been washed, they still carry a scent from the manufacture.<br />Do not recommend for face covering for COVID protection.<br />Colors are bright; however, the cartoon characters do not look exactly like the originals."
1.0,The tutu skirt just keeps falling out. Within 1 wear two of the strips came out. Then the 2nd day another 2 came out. Very pretty dress but falls apart. Poor quality. I would return it since i gave it to niece for a present however she likes the look and wants to keep it. DO NOT BUY. WISH I COULD GET MY $$ BACK
1.0,Cute but clasps were bent
1.0,This necklace will break too easily.  It's very thin and cannot trust it.
1.0,doesn't fit shorts or way to shorts
1.0,"When compared to the actual color burgundy, the dress is actually more red. And the dress I received was damaged."
1.0,Broke the next day
1.0,"I like NOTHING about this product.  It is NOTHING like the description.  I paid $19.99 per pair, and it is worth about $.01.  The jeans are paper-thin.  They are entirely too tight - they are NOT relaxed fit in the size I ordered.  This is a case of false advertising.  The quality of the material is extremely poor.  This is only one of two Amazon products in ten years as a loyal customer that have angered me.  D NOT purchase anything from this vendor...;buyer beware."
1.0,"My daughter is 16, tall and 120 lbs. We got this for ballet practice and it was WAY too small for her. It would fit her 5 year old sister just fine on the biggest setting and her teddy bear on the smallest setting. I loved the way it was made and it's of good quality for sure but just way too small."
1.0,They're not polarized
1.0,These pants were way too large in the waist. The fabric was very pretty & they could have been super cute if the cut was modified to be a little more size appropriate.
1.0,There isn't a clear holder for your license
1.0,"I think these are super cute and if you only plan to wear them once then I say get them. I wore one time for a party, but don't find these practical for everyday use. Very low quality product like something you would get for free off of WISH app."
1.0,"This product is 3 days old and already ripping and falling apart. I mean I'd be happy with it if this happened after a year may be but right off the bat? $149 for a poorly constructed piece of junk basically. This should not have gone to market with this horrible substandard construction. Other than that, the vest does what is says it would do. But for the price point, the value for the customer is extremely lacking."
1.0,Do not buy this outfit. Very cheaply made. Yuk. I’m returning.... didn’t even try on... so disappointed!!!
1.0,Are you kidding me?
1.0,How do I return it. Way too big
1.0,Didn't even last a year.
1.0,"I normally wear 14 in dresses and I ordered XL but was sent XXL,  according to the label on the package, but was extremely small, was more like a 5/6 or medium in juniors in USA sizes. Fabric was definitely not the light flowy chiffon as shown, felt and looked like some sort of polyester/rayon blend material, but is not as advertised. The pattern was also very different than pictured. Immediately returned as soon as I opened it."
1.0,"After double-, triple- and quadruple checking the measurements on my heel I was certain this heel-tips were the right size but when I received them (several days after the latest predicted arrival date) they were too small and after measuring the tips themselves they were only 12x12, not the 14x14 I had ordered. I returned the product without reordering."
1.0,"really cute but way, way too small for a large"
1.0,I don't recommend.
1.0,The item was sewed incorrectly so that the lanyard does not lay flat.  It is permanently sewed twisted and therefor only shows the design on one side while being worn and is twisted.  Will spend time and money to fix myself.  Could have been made correctly as the item was paid for to be made correctly.  Don't trust it would be made correctly if returned.  What a pain
1.0,Broke as soon as I put it on.
1.0,Cheaply made wouldn't recommend for anyone
1.0,Very cheap quality<br />Stop winding every three or four hour on my wrist
1.0,The fit of this dress is so strange. The waist is very low and the skirt is very short on the sides. You can see my thigh on the side of the dress.
1.0,Sharp and impossible to close without bending it all to crap
1.0,[[VIDEOID:f463a156a8a6898df8378ada1893b54d]] False advertising! I want my money back. This is not what was in the photo. ZERO STARS.
1.0,I bought a size smaller expecting it to run big washed it upon reviving still to large. It's also very awkward on my body type (pear shaped) was able to gift to a friend who was more top heavy in a nice way.
1.0,Way too small even for my skinny kids... arm length short
1.0,my 12 year old daughter wore this a few times before the rose fell off.
1.0,"Although a nice piece of jewelry, it is extremely small and is stamped ""sample size"" on the box. The necklace arrived hopelessly tangled and after a couple of days we gave up trying to straighten it out. Not worth the price."
1.0,"First of all, I only received 1/3 shirts its supposed to come in with, AND the one is extremely poor quality. The stitching is all wrong, the sleeves are too long/fat and overall I am not satisfied at all."
1.0,These boots were horrible. They were made of cheap FAKE leather and didn’t look anything like the picture. They were flimsy and wrinkled.
1.0,They lie right in the description. It says two but you get only one. Unless they are being deceptive by actually meaning how many keys it can hold.
1.0,"NO, no, no this skirt looks soo different in real life it looks NOTHING and I mean NOTHING like the beautiful picture! The material is about 6&#34; too short maybe more. I took it out of the bag, tried it on and zip it was being sent back ASAP! The material is not really terrible but the pic is soo misleading! I was hoping to wear this to a wedding but it's going back...btw it fit fine around the waist it was just such a funny length! (I'm 5'6&#34; around 135lbs)"
1.0,"Its not worth it to buy,way too short for women height 5'6 tall..the quality of the material is very cheap far away from the picture."
1.0,broke as soon as I got them. a waste of money
1.0,"I liked the style of these glasses. However, they were too loose and slid down. I noticed that I was getting headaches when I wore them. I switched back to an old pair of glasses and my headaches stopped. Also, I don't think they are visually correct, I could not see clearly and kept having to adjust them."
1.0,Extremely thin material.  Returned the package as soon as I saw the socks.
1.0,Two sizes to small and I ordered a size bigger
1.0,"Not the size it tells u it is. Runs small, 18 inch is 14 inch and so on."
1.0,Wore twice followed washing instructions. Loved this shirt until today. I went to put it on and part of the eye had stuck together and removed the ink. Super disappointed.
1.0,Broke the same day im use
1.0,This is a cute dress - unfortunately it runs very very small. I ordered 2 sizes larger than what I normally wear. According to their size chart it should have fit me but it was still way too small. Needless to say I’m returning it.
1.0,Fell apart the first time I wore it. Very disappointing.
1.0,"completely useless. if you like flushing money down the toilet, this is for you. what a rip off! don't waste your time."
1.0,"Cheap product, I do not reccommend/"
1.0,These are definitely fake-they are flimsy and feel like cheap plastic from glasses you would buy at a dollar store. I went to the department store to look at them as a point of comparison and they are nothing alike. I will be returning.
1.0,"Wore this necklace a couple times, got it out to wear again and it was completely black. Anchor and chain both were black!! Took it to a jewelry store to be cleaned and they were unable to clean it. They said it’s low quality and not what it says in description."
1.0,It is real cheap. The picture makes it seem luxurious. Very bubble machine quality once it got here. I was very disappointed. Bought it to wear for my daughters wedding in December but am going to return it for something nicer.
1.0,"This necklace snapped first time I wore it , but the other necklace (red heart) still wearing that one day and night"
1.0,I recieved the pink camo pants early and i was so excited untill I opened the package. The camo is the wrong color and they are leggings not jeggings jeans like its advertised. It was also supposed to have pockets. Im VERY DISAPPOINTED. I dont think i will be ordering any clothing items from amazon again and i will tell everyone i know about this awful experience. I should have listened to everyone about not ordering clothes from amazon...lesson learned.
1.0,i out them on and everything was blurry. it was like a line was in the middle of the lens. not worth it
1.0,"Ridiculous add!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />It is some sort of a Christian &#34;faith&#34; shawl, not a Jewish praying shawl.<br />I returned it and was furious about it!!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,Keep looking don't buy. When it arrived it was out of its box and the band was scratched. I tried to remove links and bent the tool that came with it. The color is yellow gold as opposed to rose. I loved this when I saw it but highly disappointed. Just printed return label has been in my possession just a few hours.
1.0,"Cute shirt, nice material but at least 2 sizes too small"
1.0,Don't buy it. Cheap zipper and won't work shortly after you purchase it. The only thing I can use it for is to keep my credit and debit cards.  Otherwise useless for carrying a cell phone or loose change!
1.0,"These are plain, very very thin cottonesk gloves that do NOT have stitching on the back of the hand, like it shows in the picture."
1.0,Literally junk.
1.0,Should be priced lower because they are like pajamas
1.0,These bracelets look like something that costs $5-$10 ! I was very disappointed in the quality especially with the Christian message on it! I purchased 5 for my granddaughters and now I don’t look forward to giving them to them!!!!
1.0,They sold them stating they weee unisex. Nope ladies 100 present.
1.0,Does NOT look like the photo! Super thin. Not appear like other Sherpas! Will not buy again!
1.0,"I don't know where these folks learned how to size things, but I was totally irritated when they arrived. I am a thick girl who normally wears a 3x. I pulled these things out of the package and they were small enough to fit my teenage niece who wears a size 6. What in the world?? If you are plus size, do not NOT NOT NOT order these. The 3x fits like a size 6. They are cute, if you are small."
1.0,"Their sizing is not accurate, small is big. WHITE? for gardening? ugh. The coating feels funny and sticks to each other finger. I returned them, they said they would refund, but forgot. BRAVO FOR AMAZON!! They fixed everything."
1.0,The product was subpar and cheat material . I am very disappointed !
1.0,To small. Which it said half lenght
1.0,"Feels  like foamy , but definitely not leather, I don’t like it, looks very cheap to me."
1.0,Product broke when it was being installed. I would give it 0 stars if that was a option
1.0,"The color pink is way off , looks more like a peachy color ☹️.  And I bought my daughter 1 also. The color shown is not the color you get, yuck!!!!"
1.0,DO NOT BUY! Way to small and the material is awful. Do not buy
1.0,"Poor quality, 4 sizes too small, very dissatisfied"
1.0,Se despegó
1.0,Nothing about the picture is accurate. The toes don't curl at all like the picture. They actually don't curl period. The purple buckle is almost impossible to see and looks cheesy. I think the picture is false advertisement. This is my first terrible review. Very disappointed and misled on this purchase...
1.0,Looks like garbage
1.0,Wore it once and it broke in less than 24 hours
1.0,The shoe part itself was really big but really small around the ankle. Not happy with this boot at all. Also when shipped there was no invoice or instructions on how to return. Will think again before ordering clothing from Amazon.
1.0,It's way too small. Im 5'4 and it's basically to my ankles
1.0,The fabric is itchy and pills so<br />Quickly.
1.0,This is poorly made. The elastic is extremely degraded! Not worth it.
1.0,Ridiculously small. Try ordering two sizes up
1.0,"I am usually somewhere between small and medium, I bought a large because of other reviews. The length was fine, but the area that's supposed to fit around the shoulders was incredibly small. As soon as I lift up my arms, it pops right up. It's so small, I seriously think it could be a child size Large instead of an adult size. I'd love to see a photo of the model with her arms raised and the shirt staying where it's supposed to be.<br />Also, I agree with other reviewers that the fabric is almost swimwear-like and the small details of the design are poorly printed. Though, if it fit, I would keep it. The design is still cute.<br />I'm sad to say I have to return it."
1.0,Smells like rotten meat inside and out
1.0,My package came In today literally like this....
1.0,"I love the sun protection coolibar products provide, especially because my child hates wearing sunblock, but these are not a good fit. Bought a medium for my 53 inch tall child, whose very tall for her age, and the waist area is still 2-3 inches too long. She still likes the pattern and wears them. I feel they could stand to be thicker though, and at this point, we need to size up, as the legs are getting tight. However, I imagine a size large will have an even worse sagging problem.<br /><br />** If you found this review helpful, please click the helpful button below. Thanks!"
1.0,Doesn't magnetize like I thought it would
1.0,The red one broke after 30 days of having it and wearing it a few times a week. I wouldn't buy again. the quality is just not there. you get what you pay for I guess.
1.0,"I was planning on wearing this dress for my daughters renewal of her vows, it is see through, That's a Big No no"
1.0,The was a comfortable band but doesn’t last long at all!!! I didn’t even have mine for two months and it’s breaking already and I don’t wear it everyday!!! Wouldn’t buy another one!! Also turns color fast so it doesn’t stay pretty long!!
1.0,Was a lot smaller than that size normally is!!
1.0,"I ordered a small, and it was very big. However the more concerning issue is that it was 2 inches longer on the left side! How does that even happen?! It was a cute dress and I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it, so I had to get it tailored so both sides were even. I'm glad it worked out so well for other customers, but I  am very disappointed."
1.0,"Sadly these fell apart very quickly, really can’t handle use by someone in construction."
1.0,For a $30 short I expected quality.<br />Turns out that one leg was about 1.5 inches longer than the other one. Very noticeable on the rear side.<br />I will be returning this product.
1.0,not recomanded. black poorly painted with black cover over steel. low quality. not user friendly. not suitable for watch that measures heart beat because it can't be adjusted tightly...
1.0,Too little for any adult
1.0,"The fabric is nice, but it's far too wide and short. I take a 2x so I ordered a 1x based on other reviews. I could've comfortably fit in a large the way this thing is sized, however the large wouldve been way too short."
1.0,Fits tight as a shirt not even a dress
1.0,"Make sure you wash separately , cold water.  Colors bleed heavily.  Only single layer , could have been 2 and it would have given it some weight and shape.  Sorry wouldn't buy again , material is very light and stiff, the weave is loose. Haven't worn it again st my skin but feels like it would be uncomfortable."
1.0,I wore this once and a gem fell out
1.0,Way to small. Much smaller then expected
1.0,"It is a great concept and the light works really well and is useful.  However, I had trouble getting the umbrella to stay open the first use and on the second, it wouldn't stay up at all...  this umbrella needs Viagra.  I had to return it to Amazon."
1.0,"This visor is laughable. Don't know who made it but it was way too big and really stiff even if you had a fat head this would have been stupid looking.  Didn't send it back, just pitched it."
1.0,The product looks better in advertisement. This material is fragile and just did not measure up to my expectations.
1.0,Not worth the money it was too small for me and I ordered the extra large size
1.0,This is not returnable!  Just a heads up.  It is way to short.
1.0,"These earrings look like a little girls play  jewelry. The materials used are low quality, I am very disappointed."
1.0,I received a dress that looks nothing like the picture. ITS HIDEOUS!!
1.0,"I think if this dress was NEW it would be beautiful!! This dress is awful and gross! Makeup everywhere, patched up holes in original return bag with return barcode still inside!! Absolutely disgusting!!"
1.0,"Didn't look cute, made me look wide."
1.0,"There is one word which best describes this watch; cheap.<br /><br />First, let's talk about what is missing from this watch. The product page has pictures of a watch with white hour markers. The watch I received has small indentations where they would go, but no paint there. Additionally, the watch hands all have white paint on them, suggesting luminescence. There is none to speak of. Additionally, the back cannot be removed safely because there are no wrench notches or a pry area.<br /><br />Now, let's talk about what the watch does but badly. The crown is ridiculously hard to access because of the large crown guards, small crown, and uncentered design. The main selling point of the watch, the cat and japanese text, is skewed and has a clump of plastic stuck next to the word ""cat"". The watch case also comes with imperfections. The watch band is made from a rough imitation velvet, and this texture makes it really hard to put on and adjust. Also, for a women's watch, it is really large and overly thick for what it is.<br /><br />Overall, for $8, this is somehow a rip-off. When Casio is making functional watches for barely any extra, there is no reason to settle for this quality (or lack thereof)."
1.0,"Big swing and a miss...agh...This not Keto,it has canola oil...come on ...it’s frozen so youdon’t need all that...yuks...no vegetable or seed oils...only organic cold pressed unrefined coconut oil or organic cold pressed unrefined olive oil."
1.0,I'm not usually too picky when it comes to buying things online except when i recieve them in pieces. The ears of the dog shoes had fallen off as well as the noses and the holes werent even fully opened around the shoes worst craftmanship I've ever seen.
1.0,Sent this item back very cheap and runs small.
1.0,"I ordered this dress to have something long and versatile for different occasions. However, I was very disappointed when the dress I received was not the dress I ordered. The dress I received was not like the dresses shown by others or in the pictures provides by the seller. The one I received was a halter style dress that was long, thick and had no slit in the side. Although I would have considered swapping it out for the right one I was unable to contact the seller. Because of this I returned the item and received a return."
1.0,The clasp would not stay put. I was constantly fixing it so it would stay on. I liked the look. Just didn’t feel like my watch was safe on me wrist.
1.0,"Product wasn't as it appeared. . . . Not at all as I expected. Bottom half too short. . . Material wasn't what I expected. Read all  reviews before you buy. . . . . Doesn't show where you can exchange it either, if you so choose. Disappointed. . . ."
1.0,They anounced bright and shiny as real diamond... Not true at all. After one month ir was brightless
1.0,"Very poor quality.  The first time my son pulled it open, it broke.  Luckily, he is an expert with super glue.  I truly did consider returning it."
1.0,Insole came out detached immediately and fabric on shoes shredded after first few minutes of first wear. Very poorly made.
1.0,Too tight on 5 year old's head
1.0,"Love the shirt. It's super cute and fits well. Fabric is nice. The problem is that one of the sleeves has elastic and one doesn't. The one that doesn't just has stitching showing and looks like they forgot. I got one shirt like this, returned it and the next one I ordered was exactly the same. Wondering if they shipped me the same shirt twice, or if all these shirts have the same problem. It can't be the style; it's  just odd."
1.0,"DIDN'T FIT , THINMATERIAL RIPPED"
1.0,The hat is way too small. Will fit a child.
1.0,Broke in one day
1.0,"No era lo esperado, pensé que era de mejor calidad."
1.0,"First it was too small. Another coat, from a different company, same size, fit fine. This coat also had a VERY irritating crinkly plastic sound that reminded me of saggy baby diapers or something UGH, no way could I wear that. In the bag and RETURNED it went. EASY RETURNS"
1.0,It wasn’t quite what I was expecting.  A lot thicker and not as much detail as in the photo.
1.0,"Not what I expected, will be using it for a nightgown. I cannot wear this in the streets."
1.0,"Not impressed. I totally understand they're &#34;cheap rings&#34; and &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; but I would also expect for my child to be able to wear them for more than 10 minutes without having a green hand. Lots of duplicate rings, Very small. They look cute, but nobody likes green hands."
1.0,"At this price point, I was expecting better quality.  Should have known better with a random brand name.  These pants are a single layer of mesh which has no lining and very thin.  With this amount of material, these probably cost about $3 to make, so there is no way the price is worth it.  Will look again and donate these."
1.0,Too freaking short.
1.0,"Although these are so cute and seem well-made, they gave my daughter blisters on her toes and around her ankles."
1.0,They are huge and not delicate.
1.0,"It gets loose so much, I guess  you get what you  pay for.."
1.0,not that effective.  hands still hurt when I text on the cell phone or hold the cell phone.
1.0,"Cheap hat, doesn’t look like pic as advertised"
1.0,"This has got to be the worst product that I have ever seen. One of the lenses has a bulls eye distortion in the center so if you close one eye, the view is not bad, but still distorted. The big problem with these is they don't magnify enough to even make them worth trying to use. The other thing is, everyone who tries them says that they make them sick to their stomach, and I agree. Don't waste your money.."
1.0,This dress does not look like the one in the photograph.  Mine is sleeveless and has no peekaboo lace portions.  I ordered a size 10 and they sent a medium.  This medium dress is very big.
1.0,DEFINITELY NOT compression and they DEFINITELY do not run small.  I am amazed by some people's deception!
1.0,"This tee is cheap, poorly made, and looks nothing like the vintage/worn style in the photos. The neckline was bunchy and the image in the shirt looked more like a sticker. The material is also rough and seems like it would not breathe well. I returned this shirt as it was not what I was looking for."
1.0,"Unfortunately the oil it had been rubbed with had turned rancid. Therefore I returned the item, but it seemed well-made. I hope this was just one particular circumstance and uncommon."
1.0,Size was way to small to ware. I could not pull them over my butt.
1.0,I was disappointed when I received. The dress wasn't even folded in the bag. It was as if it was in a flat ball. Once laid out the wrinkles would never fall out. It was not true to size. It was about 2 sizes to small. Not good quality at all. And don't think an iron would work on many of the creases. It laid rolled up for so long.
1.0,Material feels cheap and an XL fits like a medium. Very disappointed
1.0,Was excited to get these but the boots felt so cheap. Not what I was expecting
1.0,not at all what it looks like online :(
1.0,broke after less than a week
1.0,"Description states length 60"". False, it was only 50"".  Returned."
1.0,Totally a ripoff of Bamboota's Groot Loops design. Save your money and buy her's; its better anyways. Google search Groot Loops Bamboota!&#34;
1.0,Seems very cheaply made. Feels like paper and is uncomfortable.
1.0,"This dress I received looks nothing like the dress advertised!  The material is super thin and flimsy. It appears to be a straight line, rather than the full and flowy as depicted in the ad.  Also, the dress on the model has very little to no white.  As you can see from my pic, the dress I received has a ton of white which I do not like. Very, very disappointed!"
1.0,They look nothing like the photo. They are very thin and the zippers do not work. They will not send me a prepaid label to return. They expect me to pay postage to send back shorts with no zipper.
1.0,"Had it for 4 days, zipper already tore with one pair of safety glasses"
1.0,Was not true to size and very cheap material.
1.0,"Waste of money... Probably will never wear it.  Unlike what it says, it wrinkles a lot too!"
1.0,Very cheaply made. Don't wear them.
1.0,These aren't good. I'm a very positive person so I wanted to like these pants but I can't. They fit like leggings in the legs but the waist is a joke. They doesn't stay up... You can't walk without pulling them up. Maybe if I had suspenders.... The pockets are useless (because you can't put anything in them because the waist falls down) and don't sit right. I can't return them because I washed them hoping the waist would shrink. I don't see how a smaller size would fit the legs comfortably while staying up 🙁
1.0,"These are very awkward shaped. Tiny waist, huge hips, really long. Unless you want to alter or tailor sweatpants, order something else."
1.0,I ordered a 2x  .. it was at best a med ! Very poor quality .. I gave 1 star because package  arrived very quickly .
1.0,"I don't think I can say much positive about this product. The noise it makes is very loud and almost ear-piercing. It's such a loud and hollow sound that the Doctor seems like he was regenerated as a chipmunk trapped in a tin-box. The voice-quote is so muffled that despite it's ridiculous volume level, my friend and I could hardly identify what was being said at first.<br />Durable plastic? Not so much. It feels very cheap and flimsy. I don't expect this to last long. Granted, though, it has only been out of the box for about an hour.<br />I would easily have paid 12 bucks for this at some silly place like Toys R Us- but 39 dollars and some change? Hardly worth it."
1.0,So cheap and ugly
1.0,"I waited weeks for this to come in the mail. Even though it was inexpensive I expected to get at least one wear out of it, but nope, DOA. Don't buy it."
1.0,Thought this necklace would be classy but the inside just looks cheap and plastic. The pictures look way better.
1.0,Did not even come close to fitting.
1.0,"I am normally a medium to large but ordered these in XL due to sizing and comments. I also don't like tight fitting clothes. They are cheap, polyester material. Sent back."
1.0,Don't order the &quot;burgundy &quot;. It's actually a bright red.
1.0,Paid for defective suit & upset that I can’t enjoy it! I hope they will make it right & replace or refund!
1.0,"Bunches up on the side without the tie and gives your love handle a nice extra poof. And if you don’t have love handles, this skirt will make you look like you do. So disappointed as it looks really cute in pics and I really wanted it to work."
1.0,"These are awful!  Just out of the packaging they were hard as a rock, the colors are so dark and look nothing like the ones on the box, they have a terrible odor, and they came in a huge clump.  Do NOT buy these!  And I can’t even return them because it says they are an item that isn’t available for return."
1.0,"When I receive the product at first glance it looks like nothing was wrong with it. Yet, when I look closely I could see the prints of someone’s toes! Do not order! Do not spend anything on these shoes!"
1.0,Super low quality
1.0,"I like the style of this top but the neck hole is way to small.  It was actually uncomfortable squeezing my head through the hole.  And, it was way too tight around my neck with the crossing fabric under neck too high and bunching up at neck.  I usually wear a small and ordered a medium.  The bodice and sleaves fit.  It is not proportional."
1.0,Waist of money it’s not water resistant
1.0,We love it. But the smell of pain was to strong I washed and got bad
1.0,"I take very good care of things, these ALWAYS were in the case if i was not wearing them. Leg broke right at the hinge."
1.0,I loved this bag but the zipper broke after only having it 6 months.
1.0,These gloves did not wear well at all.  Completely wore out in a few weeks of golf and split apart when putting on
1.0,"These pants are beautiful... if you're smaller than a stick!  I read the reviews that stated they ran a bit small and to order up.  I wear an XL with the fit on the side of baggy, so I ordered up. I ordered a 4XL, because I do prefer baggy and thought I would be all right.  I was so mistaken!! And certainly got my pudgy feelings crushed when I pulled out the pants and they are about a Medium size.  Again, they are really nice, summery pants for someone who is thin, just not for my size. Buyer beware of being disappointed!!!!"
1.0,Looked like a women's top
1.0,"The quality is so bad I cannot describe how cheap it feels. It’s thin, polyester. Bad bad quality."
1.0,Terrible fit. Not a shift dress at all.
1.0,Very Thin cheap material of Clothes. Don't buy it
1.0,"These are see through when you put them on. I am thin and they still stretched and appeared white and see through. I was disappointed, thought these would be so cute"
1.0,"When husband opened it for Xmas I was very excited it looked just like the picture.  He loved the feel of it it was warm, soft and light weight, but after wearing for 2 different days the material start to pill so it looks very warn out old. Very sadden by this ... in photo used a flash light so you can better see the pulling on it."
1.0,I could tell you if I actually had the product! Not a very happy person right now.
1.0,"Stones appear pink in photo, the ones delivered were white. Too large and cheap looking."
1.0,Not satisfied. Material is silky and small. Tight fit. Not what I expected
1.0,I was pretty excited to get these when i order them. Once i got them  i tried the out to realize these sun glasses are the worse ever. They fit tight on you and after a few minutes they get uncomfortable to wear. I would never purchase these again. I would not recommend buying these sun glasses.
1.0,The leather bleeds very easily
1.0,This is the second AIMANT watch that I purchased in the last week. The other did not work at all. This appeared to work properly until I used the chronograph feature. It advances 2 min for every 48-50 seconds that actually lapses. Rendering this watch useless. Really unfortunate because I liked the way this one looks and is designed. Not recommended.
1.0,El sierre estaba trabado y m quedó súper grande y era talla S además la tenía no me parecía bonita.
1.0,It is very pretty but it was way bigger than I had thought. It broke within two weeks of using it.
1.0,The Caucasian model wearing a shirt that starts off with I am black
1.0,"These suck. When I learn to stop buying from China. Fit great the 1st 2 times, however the crotch tore out of one after the 1st wash and wear, but after 2 wears and washes they have shrunk to point of looking ridiculous and feeling uncomfortable."
1.0,Material is so cheap and ugly. Not even close to what I expected! RETURNED.
1.0,Zipper already broke cheap quality with high price. Was hoping for them to last at least one season
1.0,Bought this in an XL so that I’d have a little extra room. What a joke. This thing fits like a bra..!! Don’t bother!!
1.0,Cheap material. Way too small. Looks like made for my niece who is 5 years old. Terrible!!!!!
1.0,"Beautiful product that does not work. Arrived working, never use,  and in less that 60 days stop. How is possible. A $20.00 watch will work longer."
1.0,Could not get them to stay on tight enough.
1.0,Not as impressive as picture
1.0,"Too small and shirt is not attractive at all, made of a very heavy material"
1.0,"If you are sensitive to fake jewelry don’t buy these. I put in one of the nose rings and within a few hours my nose was red, swollen, and sore."
1.0,"way too small, sizing inaccurate"
1.0,Loved the onesie but zip came broke
1.0,Not cashmere. Looks incredibly cheap and has lose strings all over the place. One of the worst buys.
1.0,"Wanted to give it five. Comfortable, nice stretch, high enough on my ankle, yes. But thin and somehow not $7 a pair. Maybe $4.50. You wont go wrong with these, if money is not a question.<br />Updated to 3<br />Washed them. They have no strength. One washing they look a year old.<br />Uodated after 5 washings<br />There stretched out some, not enough to fall off my ankle but they are going, in my opinion. Horrible no, just horrible for the price.<br />Updated to 1 star<br />Just bought 6 pair of socks at Odd Lot for $7.99. Look and feel better."
1.0,The caps did not fit unfortunately and need to be returned. I don't understand why this was advertised when it doesn't even fit in the first place.
1.0,"This product looks nice, the box feels of good quality, but the actual product it self feels like it belongs on a 8 year old that wants to look stylish but is not caring enough of their items to take good care of it. The plastic lens feels so cheap that it could get scratches shortly after usage. they could of sold crappier packaging and made the glasses better. There is no carbon fiber on the product it is simply a glued on piece of plastic with carbon fiber design."
1.0,"Used this product for the bottom of my dog's crate...just kidding! I need to though. Cheap material, see through and too big."
1.0,"They are finger/palm gloves, but still didn't fit. These aren't one size fits all. They should actually come in different sizes."
1.0,Made for VER large wrist and very poor quality. I bought two of these and one owl &quot;faith&quot; bracelet and all three feel apart. Wouldnt recoomend unless you want to use the beading.
1.0,These strange sheer 41/2 ft long hose are not tights or stockings.Their is no curvature for the foot.The waist band is a waste. I only knew what they were because 1 of 3 I purchased resembled a pattern I chose.Sometimes it’s best if things get lost in mail.May the rest of these never see the light of day
1.0,The bracelet came with many of the small stones off  laying in the bottom of the bag. It is unwearable.
1.0,Does not fit vívofit jr as stated!!!!
1.0,The pin to connect and disconnect the band from the watch broke on the first attempt to remove the band.
1.0,It's really flimsy and thin.
1.0,"I really wanted to like this bag and seldom leave negative reviews.  However when you purchase something for the ability to lock up your valuables and then can't use it, I believe they need to make a design change.  The only way I can get the grommets out to lock up the bag is with pliers, which I don't intent to take to the beach.  Therefore I always end up taking my regular beach bag...please make improvements somehow!"
1.0,This is clearly made very badly and is the biggest shirt I have ever bought expecting it to fit me.  It's cheap as s*** but very comfortable.  It doesn't fit anything like the photo.  It's actually shaped like a big square.  It just hangs off of you.  I wouldn't waste my money unless you were planning on turning it into a pillow or something with the fabric.
1.0,Not really size specific. I am size 16 and got XL  and it is very tight. Can hardly pull it over my head. Fabric is hot and itchy.
1.0,"Fit too small, see through shirt, tag at the back looks poorly cut off. Doesnt look new."
1.0,Way too small followed size chart large fits like a small maybe they sent twice wrong size but they grey is tiny
1.0,Disliked that the band kept popping off my arm
1.0,"i bought them for my boyfriend.  he wears a 10 and half, 11 and he said that they are narrow for his feet.  as if he needs a while when usually he does not need a wide in any other shoe.  i emailed the company with no response.  we will never buy these sandals again."
1.0,THESE ARE NOT BOSTON HEEL  PLATES! These are a knock off and are stamped Blakey.  Just look at the box that warns you to no accept knockoffs and only trust the BOSTON stamp. This is totally fraudulent and Amazon should no allow this seller to continue to operate. These are worthless and the prongs snap off and are chintzy.
1.0,"This bracelet is either sized for a woman or small child.  I knew upon opening the box that it wouldn’t fit.  End result?  I thre it in the trash!  On another note, WHAT’S UP WITH THE PLASTIC SPIDER that was also included????"
1.0,Cheap Plastic It doesn't look like the photos.... I wasted my Money 💰💸
1.0,"Like the looks of the band, unfortunately with a poor quality finish I have taken it back off."
1.0,"I didn't abuse it, but the face cracked in exactly the same location as others have shown with very little use.  This is a material defect.  It's cheap, but not good.  Avoid it."
1.0,"I bought this for a family member in a xx large. I opened the package when it arrived and was concerned by the appearance of the dress, so I tried it on. I wear a medium and it fit me, so definitely not a plus sized dress it is more like a large or a small extra large."
1.0,"This is not the mask advertised.  It's made of foam, not cotton.  It does not have adjustable earloops, but has flimsy solid ear holes that look like they will rip easily.  It is small.  The air valve is just decorative--a piece of plastic glued onto the foam.  I am really disappointed.  BUYER BEWARE!"
1.0,Buyers Error
1.0,"THE ONE WE GOT HAS TWO STAIN ON IT, LOOKS VERY DIRTY!"
1.0,"This product is a nice idea but did not work at all. The straps are too long even when adjusted to its shortest length. The straps can't be shortened enough to actually hold a bra up. Also, some of the rhinestones were either missing or placed incorrectly. It's very unfortunate that this did not work."
1.0,Fits more like 6 months when I ordered 0-3🙄
1.0,I think it looks very cheap and the band is way too big. I don't know who has wrists that large.
1.0,The picture is different then what I got in the mail. You can tell it was cheap!
1.0,"For me, this dress gets a 1 star because it is see through, unless that is what you are going for. The material is soft though."
1.0,"The product arrived before I spected, unfortunately they’re too small and I’m number 42 European size, besides been too small they are sleepers with shoe laces. Mostly plastic finish nice style but poor quality they don’t come in box just a plastic bag, is not worth it. I would not recommend these shoes to anyone. I’m returning them right now."
1.0,"C-H-E-A-P! Not worth the price, at all. It is not at all like described. I wouldn't take ethis javjet if it was free. How is it okay to sell such poor quality of products on Amazon???"
1.0,The dress was completely see through
1.0,Runs small. Very wrinkly
1.0,Does not fit to true size
1.0,It's not maroon or wine color at all. Its red like santa claus red. Dont waste your time.  Sent it back for refund.
1.0,"This product description and picture was so highly misleading. If there was a choice to give it 0 stars ⭐️ that’s what they’d get. The lining is very this, not at like the picture shows. Im very, very disappointed."
1.0,"Initially the glass was good I thought,, Oh My God, I really shouldn’t have bought this crap!<br />Please save your eyes from this non sense!!<br />People its your eyes we are talking about here, buy a quality brand instead!!<br /><br />I am getting weird headaches as well 🥺🥺🥺  now sure why, will keep you guys posted<br /><br />Quick Update: No more headaches btw:)) Feeling awesome,, Stay Safe y’all!! **Returned the item and Amazon processed the refund right away**"
1.0,My husband bought me this for our anniversary and it was so small. I love the beach and it would of been the nicest gift.
1.0,Color was darker then the picture
1.0,"Way to small and the color was not beige, it was very yellow. Not flattering at all"
1.0,"The fish back hooks are cheap and bent before I e en took them out of the package. When I put it in my ear, it bent as well. I imagine after a couple of wears they will be broken."
1.0,Had this less than a week and it fell apart.  Totally disappointed in this key ring.  Cheap and not what I expected. Piece of junk!
1.0,It was broken . the reason i didn’t sent it back it’s I didn’t know how to do the process
1.0,Item recieved DIRTY AND poor condition
1.0,"When my husband opened the belt, it was not reversible."
1.0,what a hell is this just a print paper with with a glass
1.0,I’d give these zero stars if I could. Arrived broken. It’s a shame because they are really pretty.
1.0,Y’all this is so bad pls do not Waste your money omg 😭☠️☠️☠️ It’s literally PRINTED. nothing like the pic DO NOT BUY OMG 😭😭😭I’m so mad 💔💔💔💔
1.0,"returning,  to narrow for my daughters hands."
1.0,This top does not look or fit like the picture shows it
1.0,"The brim won't hold any reasonable shape because it was folded up for packing and the brim is creased.<br />It looks like these are in the Amazon warehouse inside small bags, already folded.<br /><br />I included a picture of how it was packed inside a white bag labeled with the product name (Piecees Super Wide Brim Sun Hat) and a picture of what it looks like open on the floor. You can see the creases that the innermost folds have.<br /><br />As this is Nylon it cannot be ironed."
1.0,"Bought this for my 7 year old, it was so tight. Ended up giving it to my 3 year old, fit her fine."
1.0,Disliked that it came unsewed minutes before my daughters wedding
1.0,"The first one I ordered the time ran slow. Sadly, the replacement watch didn’t work at all. Disappointing."
1.0,TOO SMALL AT THE TOP.
1.0,Rings are way too small to even be worn as midis. Wound up giving these the my 5 year old niece.
1.0,"Great until the buckle broke only four months later. I gave it to my husband for Christmas and he enjoyed it while he could use it. I’m guessing the material is cheap if the buckle snapped after only only four months of use. He has other, similar belts that lasted years with regular use. I won’t be purchasing this brand again!"
1.0,I had bought a few pairs from Marshall's and LOVED them. I ordered a black pair and they were NOTHING like the ones I bought from the store. They were so thin and VERY see thru. I didn't even have to do the bend over test because you can see my underwear from me just standing normal. I had to return them. I'm really bummed because I wanted to order other colors.
1.0,I only got one pair in the package... Definitely will be returning.
1.0,"I ordered a medium, I guess it was large enough to fit a 6 year old. How small are the Chinese?"
1.0,Not pleased
1.0,Watches are no good
1.0,Poor quality not what I expected at all would not recommend
1.0,There is only print on one side. It was very hard to use due to color difference between front and back. Keep looking for a better scarf.
1.0,"I got these booties and they were filled with stuffing like what you'd find in a stuffed animal.  How do I know?  They had a hole in the lining and I could see it.  They were too small for me so I let my daughter wear them, she said they don't keep her feet warm.  She keeps wearing them anyway though, so who knows.  Definetly not down though, and that is what was most disappointing."
1.0,I ordered 2 pairs one navy one green... both same size the navy fit (uncomfortably but they fit) the green wouldn't pass my thighs 😒 not pleased at all...
1.0,You know you don't do leg day. You're a beta male who all women feel safe around. You are small and would fit into these shirts with ease. You go to the gym and stare at your phone with a check in of #gettingswole #gymrat while doing only one set of biceps within the hour. Me? I'm the other end of that spectrum. These shirts are tiny no matter what size. Returned immediately. Non alpha male approved.
1.0,Fabric is ok not see through. Unlined. Side zip of dress would only go up about 2 inches leaving 5-7 inches that wouldn't go up because it was that small. Obviously returning this.
1.0,"They are stylish but not sized for the US. I ordered 2Xl  although I wear Large, but they were still seriously small. I couldn’t even try them on. An exercise in Futility."
1.0,Doesn’t notify you of anything since it is not pressed against your skin. The Apple Watch much detect skin in order for it to stay unlocked. Ladies you can put it in your bra. T
1.0,"This is a tough, scratchy material. It's very fitted and hard to get on, even with the side zipper."
1.0,It was broken when I got it. Can't conplain too much because of how cheap it was. Hoping it will be an easy fix. The one side where the three chains meet was broken.
1.0,What a disappointment this was!  Made of cheap plastic and WAY over priced.  I’m returning mine.
1.0,The picture does not illustrate the way the pant hits the leg. they are cut at the calf not the ankle or lower.
1.0,Soooo small wouldn’t fit a doll but it came from the UK cost to return astronomical didn’t say that in ad
1.0,The product description is not true. This item is not for men. I am going to return this item.
1.0,The top has holes where the extender crosses the breasts and it doesn’t sit nice
1.0,"I liked the different style & shape of this necklace. But not for me! Maybe for a man! Also didn't pay attention to the fact that it is stainless steel, my fault!"
1.0,"This is a really cute dress, I just couldn’t get past the fabric!  It feels more like a reusable shopping bag than a dress."
1.0,"Broke within 15 minutes of opening, cheap device for its price."
1.0,"This might be great for someone else, but it made noise, and was just too big."
1.0,Beautiful but after one week a stone came out
1.0,"Not worth it, very cheap, rubbed against my neck and left marks"
1.0,"At least a size too big, no stretch, had to return."
1.0,Product itself looks great. Packaging was such that one of the links came broken.
1.0,This size XL in womens for my 11 year old size 00 daughter. Very disappointed. Extremely TOO SMALL
1.0,Doesn’t even fit
1.0,The picture is very misleading and self-explanatory. You only get one. So why does the picture show two? Other knife lanyards show appropriate # of items buyer will receive. The only way I knew that their wouldn't be two is because Benchmade lanyards and beads in a pair would be higher than $21.95
1.0,It broke the day my daughter got it and tried to put it on😡😡😡😡😡
1.0,"I've bought 3 times, thought it was bad luck, but it's just a flimsy product."
1.0,"Dislike that it wasn't better for breathing, didn't stick out away from nose and mouth more."
1.0,broke immediately
1.0,fake not moldavite
1.0,These boots are very uncomfortable. The angle to the inside. Small fit.
1.0,This was poorly sewn and the seams at the tops of the shoulders puckered making it look weird.
1.0,Found them too tight to get on. Ordered a larger size.
1.0,Very itchie and the glitter falls off
1.0,Clasp broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,"Too small, can't even wear it. Sizes are way off."
1.0,"Material is course, stiff and uncomfortable.<br />Box-shape until ruffle bottom, not flattering :/"
1.0,"The post isn't in the center of the circle which would be fine if my earring holes were misaligned! But, I guess I got what I paid for."
1.0,This vest sucks!!! It stopped working and no way to contact the company to get info
1.0,"I hate this hat, but my son likes it, so that is what counts, but it is so ugly and cheap looking to me.  What do I know?"
1.0,"This is NOT how it looked in the Amazon add. The mati/evil eye is supposed to be flush w the string. Mine is cheaply dangling from a little wire hook. I would not have bought it if I knew that. No guy will want to wear this.  Plus, they were all off of the cardboard and tangled. Even tho the price was low, save your money and don’t purchase this brand."
1.0,This dress was huge and it was the smallest size they had. I ended up having to spend 50 dollars to make it fit right. I should have just gone with a different seller.
1.0,"The slippers are not well designed. The sole is too stiff and the upper portion is both too stretchy and too small. At a result the slippers were not comfortable, were quite loud when walking on a hard floor, and slipped off my feet. A redesign is needed."
1.0,Goggles seem to be great. Love virtually everything about em. Except the nose piece cuts into my nose making them painful and unusable.
1.0,There is something  small hole in the butterfly
1.0,Not made for someone tall. I ordered two the same size and one fits smaller than the other.
1.0,"Omg.  This looks nothing like picture!!!!<br />Length.  Barely to hips.  What a lie.<br />Short sweater.  Thin, POOR QUALITY<br />More CHEAP POOR QUALITY PRODUCTS.  clearly not from USA Buyer beware.  DO NOT ORDER THIS CRAP"
1.0,I Ordered XXL. It was about a Medium US size. I would have really liked it if it would have fit;(
1.0,The slides were super cute (we purchased the blue unicorn ones). My daughter loved them. However after a couple months the glue gave out on both slides :(
1.0,it broke after only one wear
1.0,pattern is very pixilated and it fits really weird
1.0,"Not what I expected---sized very small and didn't have the quality or style that I liked.  Failed to do timely return, so donated it - never worn."
1.0,"Description is not accurate. Don’t buy this if you’re looking for a set of fake septum rings. Also, one of the rings had broken almost immediately after the package had been opened."
1.0,these bags are advertised as 2 large bags 2 medium and two small.  what arrived was 2 small and 4 very small.  You get what you pay for.
1.0,The tip of the arrow is way too square. Doesn't allow the bottom feathers to look straight when the tops not straight either. Better off with a rounded tip industrial.
1.0,Don't worth purchasing the cheap metal turn brown in less than a month I let them stay with my money.
1.0,I bought this and the chain has a knot in it when I opened it
1.0,Is not how it looks in the picture at all in color or fabric. The fit I am not sure. It didn't work for my body personally.
1.0,"This bra squeaked audibly when I tried it on and moved around. The sound is very noticeable. A bra should not squeak; that is for animals. ;-) It also fits small, as apposed to my other Wonderbra I own, which is the most comfortable and amazing bra I've ever worn. This bra is disappointing, as I was hoping for the same great quality of the other Wonderbra I have."
1.0,One sleeve is longer than the other .. horrible
1.0,Cheap little ankle bracelet. Same ones at Dollar General
1.0,i think its really nice but it broke like within days which sucks after how long i waited for it.
1.0,There was a hole under the arm in seam when I opened it.
1.0,THESE SAY FITS ALL SIZE AND IT BARELY PASSES MY CALVES
1.0,It fit like a bed sheet. Poorly made and the material is thin just like others have mentioned. I tried without the bow and it's just a poorly poorly made dress.
1.0,Pésima calidad
1.0,Keeps coming apart
1.0,Nothing like described. I sent it back.
1.0,I’ve bought a few cheap pairs of sunglasses off amazon and they never lasted long. I purchased these because they were a little more expensive and figured maybe it was worth it. These are definitely overpriced for what you get. The frames are wobbly and you have to be very careful when cleaning the leases not to pop them out. The film also just started to peel off and I have only had them for a few weeks. Would not recommend.
1.0,"Dress was well put together, color was pretty, but the fit was not for my frame.  I am a normal medium and the style and thin fabric highlighted every flaw - some flaws I didn’t even know I had.  I think on a youthful, thin frame this dress could possibly be cute."
1.0,Was soaking wet inside the clear plastic package. Nothing else in the box was wet. Very strange. The label has started to disenigrate due to the water so it’s a sticky mess.
1.0,"Just received this ring and I’m severely disappointed in it. It’s MASSIVE, and unfortunately looks incredibly cheap. I was SO excited to get this ring thinking it was a 1.25 carat size but in reality it’s closer to a 3 carat size stone. Just give... very sad and disappointed."
1.0,"The dress was simply weird and I had to return it. It had this mermaid cut to it that was not flattering and when looking at it from the front the area of the cut out didn't lie smoothly, instead it was gaping on both sides. I also didn't like the material, it seemed cheap and also like it would snag at the slightest touch. Being 5'4&#34; the dress ran long for me and if I'd kept it I wouldn't have been able to wear it out without wearing heels."
1.0,The black one faded within a month of wearing it
1.0,To Small For My Husband He’s 6”3
1.0,Too small in the chest--an ongoing issue with Asian sized clothing. If you are bigger than a C-cup this dress will NOT fit you.
1.0,Bought these for my wedding. Tried on and rhinestones started to fall off. Disappointed and waste of money.
1.0,This was not what I expected. The material was a SCRATCHY fleece and the padding was very slim. I returned after opening them.
1.0,"They are too loose unfortunately for me and my family. Colors, material etc are great but they just won’t stay up over my nose unless I put over my ears and way up on my head which is just weird! Need to find another solution unfortunately."
1.0,The size chart is severely off. The pants smell horrible. They don't come with any instructions for use or care. I'm afraid of stinking up my other clothes. But I am usually a L or XL and the 3XL hardly fits. Its so tight it feels like it has cut off your circulation. I do feel it  making the skin sweat a little.
1.0,got the biggest size & it still doesnt fit
1.0,"There no rhinestones on them, just<br /> engravings of rhinestone"
1.0,This does not fit a 22mm watch.  Package only includes prongs for a 20mm.  Will be returning.
1.0,I refused to wear it . I’m not sure if it was the color but it just looked like an old lady bra on . I gave it to my mom….. she’s 59.
1.0,"I wanted to be able to keep these but the amount of off gassing was ridiculous. I kept them outside checking on them, for over a week!  Then a few days inside. They still smelled just as toxic as the day I received them. If you are sensitive to chemicals please don’t bother. Whatever they are using should not be allowed."
1.0,Very thin and poor quality.
1.0,The first time I went to try and wear it the clasp broke. So I'll have to spend more money to fix it.
1.0,For the cost it was way to thin. quality was good but very thin
1.0,The pattern is cute but the material is like a shiny spandex/lycra material— would have never bought had I seen it in person!
1.0,"It's paper thin and cheap! 3 months after Xmas my gf brought it to me in pieces the necklace snapped and the ""gem"" fell out all in one shot. Would have expected better for the price tag but I know if you want this quality just go to Walmart at least you will pay a little less for the same quality."
1.0,Definitely not a true women's size!!!!!  A young physically fit woman maybe but not a 57 year old 5'. 7&#34; kinda heavy set but not obese woman.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Inside of the hood is silky feeling. Not warm and hard to stay on your head. I cut out faux fur and lined the hood myself.
1.0,"Very long sleeves, wide neckline, out of proportion to a regular body shape. Does not fit at all."
1.0,Too small. Photo makes it look large as advertised. Michael Kors Cindy LARGE?
1.0,Why not have them in a bag so they are not crushed? They should be round like the picture no?
1.0,This blanket is not the size advertised it is smaller and the picture is faded. I am not happy and would not advise you to purchase
1.0,The screw kept loosing the top. Was not happy with this product
1.0,Fits weird and not cute at all
1.0,Not received the gold colored inescapable
1.0,This was a great dress to wear one time. I moved my arms and noticed there was a huge rip in the armpit and I only had worn it for about 2 hours prior sitting down at a wedding.. I would make sure that you only need to wear it once.
1.0,One jhumka fell off at the first day
1.0,"Bad quality and wrong sizes, my daughter is size 9 and the size that came is 9 but very small to be 9. I do not recommend that I buy it."
1.0,"I have had this item for a few months, trying everything I could think of to remove the smell and it is permanent. Very strong odor of mothballs."
1.0,totally awful. does not look like the pic at all.
1.0,Returned. It looked nothing like the photo. Absolutely ugly and color was something that I don’t know what you could call it. Awful.
1.0,The fraidy distressed look  was not what they Jean's looked like when they came in.. looks like someone just cut holes in the jeans
1.0,Strap broke after being worn less than 1hr.<br />WalMart sells mock Crocs for $6 and they last longer.
1.0,"It is way to small and the material is way to thin and I could deal with the thin material but not when you can't even get it on and I wear a large shirt that is my size but this must be a JR size shirt or something, I will be returning it :("
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:42473e1d34bbf683f228c3f1a54b1b2f]] This is insane to me but these inserts actually broke my foot. I have a stress fracture in my heel after the hard plastic edge of the insert separated from the foam.  I was actually striking my heel on this hard plastic every time I walked.  It started to hurt and I didn't know why.  Then I started limping.  The next day I could hardly walk.  After a couple days of pain and swelling and not getting better, I went to a doctor and had X-rays.  He confirmed I had fracture and now I'm stuck in this enormous, uncomfortable, and super heavy boot for 6 weeks minimum!  I was in disbelief until I took the insert out and saw what happened.  I would not leave a 1 star review unless it was extreme.  I'd say a product that is so cheaply made that it pulls apart after only a couple months of wear to expose hard, sharp plastic under foot constitutes extreme.  Save your foot and DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,DOES NOT6 FIT S3!!! destriction says it will but its to small ...... like way way way never working to small
1.0,Too short.  Most large women would not wear this
1.0,"The color is royal blue and as expected. Very thin material. Easy to put on. Does not fit how image shows and my boobs aren't even big. Yall know how ppl do those this versus what u got videos. This is one of those. Buyer beware. For $8 it was worth trying but im returning. Got it an hour ago, tried it on, my kids laughed, its going back tomorrow."
1.0,Litterally not the size that they advertise .
1.0,Too too small!
1.0,These socks are terrible.  Levi’s cut cost by using less material.  These socks are the size that boys wear
1.0,Washed these pj's only once and the color was like I washed them a 100 times.  The color black in these turned a dingy gray and the red lost all its brightness very disappointing for what I paid for these pj's. Never again will I buy a product from this company again!
1.0,I thought this was a great product initially.  The buckle broke after I used it a few times.
1.0,Worse sweats ever. For the price you pay may as well go to walmart or Ross its cheaper. 2 washings and sweats now hv sm holes and the fabric is balling up
1.0,"Very very disappointed. Ring is gorgeous in pictures, not so much the case when seen in person. Very low quality. Received an email from the company 3 times asking if I was pleased and to please not submit a poor review. I responded all 3 times and was only met with the same original email. Returning this ring. QVC has gorgeous cubic zirconia jewelry that costs a bit more but for obvious quality reasons."
1.0,The wrong size was sent which oddly has been happening more often. I didn’t love the T-shirt enough to try again.
1.0,The quality of the product seems decent. I’m disappointed as I waited over a month for these to be delivered and discovered the writing is in ( I’m guessing) Chinese and not English. Returning for refund.
1.0,This device is terrible! Nothing more than a tarp that the hair falls off!  The area that is suppose to catch the hair as it falls while cutting has no “give” and the hair falls off to the floor (instead of staying in the pseudo moat around you).  Don’t buy this one!! Look for one made of hair cutters cloth (like their capes) as it will have “give” and catch the hair like it’s supposed to.
1.0,Wasn't as expected didn't look like the picture
1.0,Malas por donde se las mire
1.0,Costume jewelry. Didn't wear but a few hour and the gold chain broke for no reason and within those few hours had already had a dirty copper stain look.
1.0,They got lost.
1.0,It fell apart after the second time I wore it
1.0,"Very pricey item for how cheap it is.  I ordered it for my sons birthday party themed Mandalorian and wanted him to dress as the Mandalorian.  This item broke the day before party, very disappointed."
1.0,This watch was delivered with a broken dial.
1.0,So Very Disppointed with the four earrings I bought<br />Animal print ones broke within 5 minutes of wearing<br />Red ones much smaller than expected<br />White ones look cheap
1.0,Can’t even wear it.
1.0,Not sure who sizes these but they have no idea what they are doing. I wear an XXL and ordered the XXL/XXXL.  WAY to small.
1.0,These came with a funky smell - couldn’t return - wrote to provider but never heard back
1.0,These were very small.
1.0,This sign was flimsy plastic. Probably my own fault for not reading more closely but I thought it was metal. It was small and extremely flimsy and cheap. Not at all worth the price.
1.0,Ran VERY small and felt cheap. The quality of this shirt was not great. It felt scratchy and fit very small.
1.0,"I was excited for the mask, but what I received wouldn't even fit a young adults face. Definitely not an adult woman."
1.0,I do not like the fact that I used it for 2 days and water leaked into it. It had condensation as well.
1.0,The fit was terrible. Too straight as if I had no hips.
1.0,Not what I was expecting. Returning!
1.0,"Complete waste of money. The “carbon fiber” doesn’t even LOOK real, not to mention the boxy top"
1.0,"I am extremely disappointed in this dress because I really wanted to love it...<br />First of all, my daughter is a TINY 18 month old, still wearing 9 month clothing, so based on other reviews I ordered 2 sizes up (18 mos) and it fit her like a shirt! Second of all, the way this dress was sewed together was done so poorly; the reindeer's lower body is all that shows throughout the dress making it look very CHEAP. Lastly, the fabric is very see through and costume like, especially for a holiday dress that you expect to be nicely made and of good quality. Definetly NOT recommended, not even for a couple of hours of wear."
1.0,The included band does not actually fit in the frame provided.  Do not purchase.
1.0,I wanted this bracelet SO BAD that when it delivered I immediately put it on. Literally 3 hours later and after washing my hands it broke! My heart shattered.
1.0,The kimono I received looks nothing like the item pictured! The quality is also not that good.
1.0,"This is not 100% organic cotton :(<br />It's 80% organic cotton,  17% polyamide, 3% elasthane"
1.0,The idea/concept is fun but the quality of the parts is lacking. I took it out of the box (disposing of the packaging) and placed it with my other buckles. Tonight I went to put it on my belt and the hinge was already broken. I rigged it fir the night but don’t believe I’ll be using it again. What a sad waste.
1.0,"Fit as expected, very cute, but had to return bc the fabric is itchy! Needs to be lined better especially in shoulder area."
1.0,"I’m a 36C and it was not a good fit. I tried multiple ways and it just didn’t work, waste of money"
1.0,Did absolutely nothing to help me.  Completely useless.
1.0,"Very cheap, thin material! Virtually see-through but decided to give them a shot anyways. After washing for the first time (before wearing) on *delicate setting* and *air drying*, I found they were unraveling in multiple spots!! Would NOT recommend!"
1.0,"The bag itself was very nice - however, it had been treated with some sort of toxic smelling chemical that smelled so terribly that I could not keep it nor the box it was shipped in, in my home.  The best way to describe the toxic smell is a combination between diesel fuel and creosote.  I tried to allow the bag to &#34;air out&#34;, but it was so bad that the smell transferred to anything that it touched.<br /><br />I was 100% disappointed in this purchase and DO NOT recommend this to anyone who cares about their health."
1.0,"This band was terrible. It was the right size, but it was difficult to adjust, and difficult to stay in position. After about a week the clasp stopped woeking alltogether.  It opened while I was wearing the watch and I almost lost it off my wrist.  Do not buy this it is cheap junk!  Oh, yeah, abd after about a week the black finish started coming off ."
1.0,"These products all from the same person, Trices, and they are all bad. Once we recieved the bracelets, some of the clocks don't work, the material is bad, and overall is a bad product. Do not buy."
1.0,The buckle lasted 13 months.  I wore it every day. The catch and release mechanism fell apart making the buckel unusable.  Why the parts fell out is not obvious.  It is not repairable.  I would not buy this brand or model again.  However would buy this type of belt from another manufacture.
1.0,"The problem is not that they are thin or expensive for being so thin and bendable; the problem is there’s no clasp to provide structure, so when the earring wants to move, and it will, the cool shape is shot."
1.0,Super short and low cut/ returned
1.0,"The dress for well, but the material is cheap and it did not last long, I pull a thread and that was the end of my dress"
1.0,poor quality and gigantic
1.0,I had to give this shirt away.  It ran very very small.
1.0,When I put my 3-pound dog in there it pulls and it doesn't feel right not comfortable at all
1.0,"Have to send back, thought they were to fit over glasses. Very nice looking."
1.0,It is super small!!! I ordered 2XL and got what looks like Small. There is no size tag so I don't know the true size but it's certainly not 2XL. I am not pleased at all!
1.0,"returned. way too small, though i ordered xl and fit in L or XL in Target clothes."
1.0,I bought this for my Medusa Halloween costume this year.  I loved the look of it in the picture and when it arrived.  Unfortunately after 30 minutes of wear the right side of the bracelet detached completely. I wish it was more sturdy.
1.0,"I may be mislead as to what ""compression"" means, and I may have completely misunderstood the size chart  and my measurements (I'm 5'6"", 140#, 38"" chest), but these are incredibly baggy. These aren't compressive in the least! I am going to try to exchange for an XS, and if those actually are compressive my rating will improve.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />I got the XS package in yesterday and... are these the same size as the S? They're still not compressive, they're still baggy!"
1.0,FLIMSY SLIDES OFF NO FIT RETURNED THEM
1.0,This bracelet is not for human children. The delivery took an extended time. Try explaining that to an 8 year old.
1.0,there are better bands that looks the same and actually fit securely. from day one this band didn't secure well to one end of my fitbit.
1.0,They keep digging up unless wind is blowing in your face. After the second time wearing them the foam fell off.
1.0,"I just washed this grey housecoat and not only did it shrink so it is now too small, it is also a wrinkled mess.  I have bought other colors from other manufacturers and had no problems.  Very disappointed in this purchase and unfortunately the return window just closed."
1.0,Didn't fit well and didn't like the lace.  Would not recommend.
1.0,"Stretchy polyester.  Fabric is only colored on one side, the inside is white. When you move your arms and the sleeves shift you can see the white.  Also when the fabric stretches, you can see the white interior bleed through.  Went straight in the trash."
1.0,It turned colors within a week waist of money
1.0,Avoid
1.0,The size is not accurate and it’s not made well at all.
1.0,Ordered my normal size and they are sooo small and tight. The size is on the bottom of the shoe so I know I have the same size but still too tight and too small. Definitely order at least a size up or more to be comfortable.
1.0,"This dress is awful and I highly recommend staying away. The material is an itchy polyester, the fit is cheap and unflattering (looks nothing like the picture) and the fabric has an overwhelming chemical smell. The seller has made returning the item extremely difficult. Overall, don't waste your time."
1.0,"It has a spot in the top that was stitched up. It looks like there was a tear in fabric and instead of not using it, they stitched it up and sold it. Poor quality!!!!!!"
1.0,Absolutely hate it!  A lot bigger than i thought it would be.  Very cheap looking!  Only gave 1 star because I had to.
1.0,😡😔
1.0,"The sleeves were huge. They were big around, I think maybe they weren't made right. They looked more like pant legs."
1.0,This band is a piece of junk. No instructions.  I found out after I wrestled with one side that the GPS antenna had to be &#34;gently&#34; pealed off the old band and placed in the new one. Had to take it off and start all over.  The band side with out the buckle doesn't fit AT ALL.  Will not go on.  Tried heating it up with hot water and still wont work.  An absolute mismatch in size. Don't waste your money on this.  Its useless.
1.0,Would not buy this
1.0,"I'm giving these bras one star because they are not the correct size at all.  I am a solid 38C and therefor ordered the large size.  I washed them thoroughly and then tried them on and found that 2 of the 6 bras fit ok, tight but more of a firm support sport's bra, and the other 4 are way too tight and hurt me.  Because I've washed them I am not going to try to return (on principle).  I am ordering the next size up in hopes that they fit better and are more comfortable.  I can say, they are well made, I like the stretchy, comfy fabric and the colors are fun.  I am crossing my fingers that the XL fits better."
1.0,The shirt was too small and wreaked of smoke.
1.0,Got for my work keys... fell apart within hours
1.0,Just Alful!  Cheap material and sized all wrong!  Bought the 2x size in men’s to fit my son who’s chest is a 32 & is tall & thin..and it still was small!  Wasted money on! I can’t return either because it was garbage day when it came so I threw out all the packaging!! Uggggg!!!
1.0,Not worth a dime of your money . this was a waste never again.
1.0,Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and when she opened it for the first time the hinge broke. I understand it’s priced quite cheap but I was hoping it would last at least a few weeks.
1.0,Does not fit too may cards...
1.0,Says adult but I'm 5'2 and not even close
1.0,"After waiting 6 weeks to get the shirt, it doesn't fit as expected. Went to return it and my return had to be approved??? Then they want me to pay to ship it back to China?<br />Are you kidding me???<br />This is why we all need to buy US products!!!<br />NOT HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,"Received a different size, got large, ordered Medium, despite that they look great. they feel good."
1.0,"These ""balloon"" out from the waistband.<br />Nice cleaning rags"
1.0,Quality of fabric was not good. It fell apart after one wash.
1.0,It did not look like the picture at all. it didn’t have the crystals in the middle it was just purple .
1.0,"The charm with the arms up in the air are not secure. It has only been worn approx 3 times and one of the arms is wobbly, likely due to poor construction. Too bad otherwise the charms are very pretty. Disappointing."
1.0,"Runs small and you get what you pay for. Wherever the fabric stretches, example, the front knot, it will look grayish instead of black. Very cheap look and feel. As reference, I wear size 6 pants and this medium was tiny. No room for the rear or hips. Definitely not for curvy people."
1.0,3 of us tried to set the digital time and date and after watching several YouTube videos I decided to send it back and go analog.
1.0,"The glasses looked exactly as desired, but the frames were flimsy and generally of poor quality.  More important, the correction that was ordered was not delivered and the glasses were returned for a refund."
1.0,"I was very sad when I saw this purse, sure it was the right size and style but it was brown with maybe a very small tinge of purple. Will be trying again with gray. Fingers crossed."
1.0,This was bad .. I received my bracelet and it was broken.. very upset.
1.0,Ordered a large but this was much more a small. Very dissatisfied
1.0,I purchased this along with the umidigi watch and didn't realize that the watch was teal. So the rose gold wristband didn't look good with it at all.
1.0,I followed the size chart but yet the size was too small.<br />I now own a dress I cannot wear.
1.0,Had them for a month and they already broke!
1.0,Very small masonic symbol
1.0,Too small for my 6 year old face... I purchased another design and it fit perfectly but this particular design was made to fit a baby baby...very disappointed
1.0,See thru. White lining. Learn to make workout pants without white lineing!
1.0,"I don't like that a cartoon of the hocus pocus Sanderson Sisters is also printed on the shirt. Halloweentown and Hocus Pocus are two completely different movies so I don't get why you would put them on the shirt together. Although it is pictured on the item, its so small I didn't even realize when I ordered it."
1.0,It's very see through...a waste of money
1.0,I got several sizes up and they are still to small. Total waste of money!
1.0,"This is not what you get, it is a thick material that a sun dress shouldn’t be made of it is shorter than what you see I am average height and a medium build this dress stopped at my ankles it is kinda cute on but it is not the dress in the picture."
1.0,"This product runs so small. I ordered a large. My usual size in skirts is a medium but I had an event and would have preferred the skirt larger rather than smaller. I couldn’t wear it. It is so tiny! I am 5’6”, 140 lbs, and a size 4 for reference. It’s cute though. I wish it worked out.<br /><br />I hope my description was of use to you!<br /><br />—Follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram for more amazing Amazon finds!—"
1.0,I received the item damaged and would like a replacement.
1.0,I had 3 of my friends try this on and at was way way way to short on all of us. You literally can’t walk not even talking about bending down. If you want your a** all out in public than you’ll enjoy this
1.0,Turned black the first time I used them
1.0,"Shirt much smaller than expected, and I carefully ordered according to the size chart."
1.0,"The material is a gross, thin, shiny, weird material. It looks cheap. I’m returning it."
1.0,"Very cheap &  I only received 2 pairs, not 3 as described.  There’s something off about the way they magnify, I can’t stand wearing them for more than a minute or two.  I found a much nicer and more efficient reading glasses at T.J. Maxx, three pairs for $9.99"
1.0,Turned black in less than one week. Did not wear well at all. Threw them in the trash.
1.0,"Heavy polyester material,not for summer no shape, legs uneven. I hate it. Going to send it back."
1.0,This does not look like picture. Too Soft and not even leather material...returning
1.0,"Meh. Fabric is too thick, which means the threading on the pockets comes out. I have a different Carole Hochman robe that isn’t as thick so I like it better. The fit is good."
1.0,"This dress is tissue-paper-thin.  I’m only keeping it because I need it for a costume, but this is not appropriate for clothing."
1.0,"This hat is heavy. I mean really, really heavy. First the hat was not knit like a traditional hat with a smaller crown that slowly gets larger. Instead it is knit as a tube that is then sewn closed at the top. Bunching up the extra fabric at the top create a top heavy, dense hat that stands upright like a cone. The pom-pom, while beautiful is also very heavy – there is a solid mass in the middle with the fur covering it. The pom-pom is removable but the hat would still be top heavy and stiff."
1.0,Loser fit
1.0,"Although this looks like a large pendant, it is tiny. The stone and setting are fine for a teen, but I would not recommend it to someone who wants a larger piece. Truly a disappointment."
1.0,These aren’t big enough to fit around my keloid and they keep falling off.
1.0,I ordered 2 pairs of earrings and only received one. AND they aren't the correct product.
1.0,Looks ok but it runs quite large. Pic looked like it was somewhat fitted....not mine.
1.0,"Description indicates cotton, but it is polyester / spandex . Medium size is more like large."
1.0,I bought a 3x expecting them to be slightly roomy for nice sweats or something underneath. My hips and butt are too big for 2x but 3x is usually slightly big. These are the size of a womens medium. I gave them to my girlfriend who is a medium and they fit perfect. So disappointed.
1.0,"I got the black pair, which are a little different. the had extra ornamental embroidery an dangling straps, not really expected, but not that bad either. Initial impression was fair value and a comfortable fit. However, after wearing maybe 4 times, while squatting down to work on something,  the material ripped wide open up the middle of the thigh. It's bout a 5 inch rip. From top of the side leg pocket to the hip pocket. Unacceptable and potentially VERY emberrassing. Going to try to return."
1.0,Comfortable. Your normal size + 1.5 or 2 is the right telic woman sandle size
1.0,"I really wanted to like these pants but the fabric made them feel cheap and almost like leggings vs dress pants.  They were too small, although the length was long enough.  They hugged every inch of my body in the wrong place.  I had more rolls and bulges than ever before.  To note, I am a fairly thin person.  So in other words, they were not flattering at all.  They were so tight in the thigh all the way to the calf and then flared out.  I would not recommend."
1.0,"it was a lot oversized and to short ,did not look like picture."
1.0,"I was really excited for this shoe heater! Upon arrival I immediately unboxed it and put a pair of shoes on it. I let it go for 5 minutes and checked the progress, the shoes had no heat going to them, but I did notice that part of the cable closest to the unit was pretty hot. So I checked the reviews and saw that one has already caught fire. I feel that the reason to purchase a boot warmer is to allow it to dry your shoes, however I am worried it will only catch fire. This was even with a minimal weight shoe with good ventilation. So I could imagine my case would have been worse with heavy boots (which I could imagine is why the average buyer would want this) but due to it's faulty nature I do not trust this warmer. Buyer beware unfortunately."
1.0,"Fake leather, it’s not a durable material, broken in a month."
1.0,Cute coat until you open it up and it has a giant brown stain on the inside.
1.0,Didn’t receive the colors shown so beware. Too much of a hassle to send back. They are cool but I ended up with blue and no dark brown ones. They are variety sizes. Overall not happy.
1.0,"Sheer, low quality masks. Edges are white, not purple as shown in the product photo. Purchased for the color but they are scratchy and not comfortable. Will keep in the car as backup if I forget a good mask."
1.0,"I’ll start with the positives…<br /><br />The dusty rose is a pretty color.<br />It seems to be well made.<br /><br />Now for the not so positive…<br /><br />This is a whole lotta dress. Like I felt like I was wearing an antebellum dress minus the hoop. It is just sooo much fabric. I just got kind of lost in all the fabric.<br /><br />I couldn’t even zip it all the way because of how tight the waistband is.<br /><br />There are some weird, almost cardboard like pads in the breast pads.<br /><br />I hate leaving a negative review. I ordered it in spite of no reviews.<br /><br />I’m so sorry, but it is a hard “absolutely not” for me.<br /><br />I’ll edit this review after I see how customer service turns out."
1.0,The CDC as I understand had issues of approvals from certain public stores of this mask had to return it
1.0,"The Texas is backward and to have it replaced I have to go out of my way to ship it, after waiting for it go get here... not worth it"
1.0,Way too small does not fit a size 13 foot
1.0,This was poorly made stuck my cards and Licenses in the wallet and they all got stuck by glue inside
1.0,"I ordered this in Dec and yet to receive, so I can only rate on that fact. Looks super cute so we’ll see whenever it arrives."
1.0,"These are the worst pair of leggings i've ever bought. One pair starting pilling after wearing them for no longer than an hour. They both came with a horrible strong odor that i thought would go away after washing, but still persist even after three washes. It's disgusting and gives me a horrible headache and makes me nauseous. I wish i never would have spent my money on this. Next time i'm just going to go to Ross or Marshalls and get a couple pairs of leggings for a few dollars each because this is radiculous. Don't buy these leggings."
1.0,"This dress was a crepe material and did not stretch at all. I even sized up and it did not fit. Additionally, the buttons were barely sewn on and two of them fell off in a matter of minutes."
1.0,"This was SOOOOOO Small that it didn't even fit my phone!! LOL&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;What the heck do you use this for if it won't fit even a phone?? Anyway, probably my fault because I didn't read the dimensions, so learn from my mistake and get something else. This bag was worthless."
1.0,"FYI IF YOU ORDER THE MIDNIGHT GREEN, you WILL NOT get green of any shade, they are BLUE. I got my first order which was wrong, got a replacement which was also WRONG. Now I have the inconvenience of returning 2 packages."
1.0,The case was cracked and the watch won’t charge
1.0,The buckel does not work not a good product
1.0,No snap buttons on rim!
1.0,Ordered Large according to size chart.  Too small- went back...
1.0,"Sent it back. The online photograph looks beautiful, but up close the print looks like a cheap photo on cloth- like a marketing banner. I think it’s called dye sublimation printing. For the price it is a greatly inferior product and not at all something I could give as an intended gift."
1.0,"This coat is so unbelievably small its ridiculous.  More like a Small than an XL.  Your sizing is way off.  If you buy this, better get at least 3 sizes bigger than you wear.  What a shame, I wanted this."
1.0,I bought the jeans as a gift for my son. He has only wore them twice and the teeth on the zipper started falling off. I came here to find out about a replacement and I'm 6 days past the return option.
1.0,"Crap! Doesn't support at all...if you're wearing it just for looks...sure. I bought a medium, wear a 34D...and it's not tight at all...as I said before NO support...it barely stays under my boobs."
1.0,"Terrible, looks like something out of a bubblegum machine."
1.0,Very low quality. Oversized head with short chin strap so it warps when worn. At $60 it should have survived more than 10 minutes. Whoever paints the helmet doesn’t know about staying in the lines. It was packaged without any support so when it was received it was folded in half inside of a small tiny box. After 10 minutes it tore at the chin strap due to thin material. It’s definitely a product I want my money back for
1.0,"It's definitely too small. I ordered a few sizes up for my 5 year old. I ordered a size 8. But this is more of a crop top shirt. Definitely not what I had in mind for my small child to wear. Fabric isn't great either. I should've have known that I'd get a cheap shirt for a cheap price. But this isn't even wearable. I'm not sure what to do with it, besides tossing it in the trash."
1.0,"There isn't any elastic, belt loops or suspenders with this, so the only way to hold the pants up is to safety pin them to your shirt."
1.0,"The masks themselves were ok, but my masks came 2 weeks past the latest day they we’re supposedly going to come. Way past Halloween so there was no point in having them. So disappointed :("
1.0,Very poor quality plan to return it.
1.0,RUNS EXTREMELY SMALL
1.0,"I would give it a zero if I could! These were child tights, they wouldn’t go above my knees!"
1.0,This high low effect was very unflattering
1.0,This top was not flattering on me at all. I have a large (but not too large) chest. This pulled across the chest in a very unflattering way. It fit everywhere else so a larger size would fit the chest but be way too big in the waist and stomach.  The fabric is not pleasant. It reminds me of some bridesmaid dresses I’ve worn in the past. The color was pretty and the high neck would be good for the office with a jacket.
1.0,"I just am not happy with this product (housecoat) as in my view it was poorly made & so not as described by the seller.  Returns are a hassle here, and so sadly for me I am just out the money I spent here, but a lesson I did learn the hard way, but still a lesson learned is a good thing. Enough said."
1.0,Absolute trash! The colors are completely wrong. The Black Watch Tartan doesn't have purple. It is to small to fit around my head so I gave to my kids. It is so thick that they had to take it off because they were suffocating.  On the plus side it it very soft and made an acceptable substitute for tollitte paper.
1.0,I ordered size 12-24 months and received 2T-4T ...<br />Disappointing...
1.0,"I believe this is a knock off design of a dress seen on lulus.  I purchased it here as it was cheaper and it's obvious once you receive it why. Another girl purchased the correct dress and it was a much better quality. What you can't see in the picture there is a very large elastic band that is right under the chest and it looks very awkward and not at all flattering.  Also as mentioned by others, the lease is completely see-through and there's nothing underneath it. The skirt seems cheap and flimsy as well. I did send it back and was refunded my money properly however if you are looking at a similar dress do not buy it here."
1.0,"Bought size M for a 7yo. She is skinny for her age and the costume is still at least two sizes too small. The gloves are ridiculously small sized. Yet the “boots” are too bigs.<br />For $50, not worthy. Returned."
1.0,Not practical.  Hard to pack
1.0,It’s doesn’t fit as well as I had expected and it’s definitely not as full as it is in the picture. The detailing is off from the picture as well.
1.0,huge and horrid
1.0,this belly ring broke so easily! i bought it twice because of how cute it is however it absolutely sucks! The dangly part is hanging on by a hook instead of a closed circle like it should be! should a rip of!!!!!
1.0,Don’t look like the pic
1.0,They would not assemble correctly
1.0,Shorts are beyond see threw. Super uncomfortable. Not worth it.
1.0,What this photo shows online and what I just received in the mail are two completely different things. I cannot and will not give this to my daughter. It is NOTHING like the picture advertising it online and quite frankly looks like Star Trek. This is very disappointing and I plan to return this item. Misleading advertising.
1.0,This ring is not worth your time or money.  I'm so disappointed with this ring.  It is not a smooth silver.  It is all pounded and quite ugly.  The name is barely readable. A waste of money.  Seller not willing to work with my unhappiness.
1.0,Ears fell off as soon as i opened it. At least the stress ball itself is tough
1.0,I bought this for my teenager. The images look small online. However when it arrived it had demons on it.  I returns the top and shorts!
1.0,These socks are horrible. They have no sock shape. More like a tube of stretchy material. The print is awful and doesn't look even close to the picture.
1.0,"The inner triangular edges are not at all polished and feel very rough, in addition to being dull  in appearance.  Style is nice, and I like the adjustable clasp, but the chain feels like it could easily break."
1.0,I asked if it was breathable and told by two customers that it was.  It feels suffocating.  In fairness all masks do.
1.0,the material was not what i expect or liked
1.0,The pants arrived with a hole torn in the seam. Of course i didnt realize until i threw away the lackage and wore them and someone else had to point it out.
1.0,The sizing for this item was not even close!
1.0,Not a size medium....I wear a size 4-6.....this dress did not fit like a medium...more like x-small.
1.0,Ripped off again by customer support<br />Even if it's only 10 bucks. I'll remember this as tracking #$....<br />KOH1038606049<br />KOH1038605900<br />KOH1038605662<br />KOH10E8605317<br />ARE ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD.<br />RETURN CONFIRMATION MEANS NOTHING
1.0,Not waterproof at all
1.0,"Love the design, the mustard color floral design but the dress is way too small."
1.0,"Save you $. This simply does not work. Followed the directions and tried several times. I think that many of the other, “verified purchasers” are $ome how connected to the seller. Do not buy."
1.0,They are all crushed and bent … distorted! I  purchased several different colored of hats and all have been unusable! Unbelievable.
1.0,"This shirt looks like a plastic tarp.  I think it'd burst into flames if someone dropped a match on it.  On the other hand, you don't have to a raincoat over it if you get caught in a thunderstorm!"
1.0,Worked great while it lasted but it broke in a month and a half. Can't wait for my daughter to get into regular kids glasses without the need for these straps.
1.0,Does not hang way it does on the model at all….material is strange and the shoulders like pull so feels off and tight. Returning!!!
1.0,Very disappointed with these.  Look like demin but they're FELT!  Returned.
1.0,This Cable knit was not with the order.
1.0,These are for kids NOT ADULTS
1.0,Stone was cracked
1.0,Cheap t shirt type material
1.0,It was poorly made.
1.0,Ring was found under a 40lb box of cat litter wrapped in a small bag. Why on earth wasn't it in at least a box if being shipped with multiple items? But mainly the ring is not as well crafted as the ad picture shows. I am disappointed with the quality of the stone pieces. They look as if they have been glued on instead of set in.
1.0,"I should have known better. It seemed like a great buy, but last week this watch started losing time and now the watch is dead. This is completely unacceptable and, of course, it's too late to return it now. DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH! YOU'RE JUST THROWING YOUR MONEY AWAY!"
1.0,Item arrived with snags/pilling in the fabric.
1.0,It was tiny.  The quality was ruff and it was paper thin
1.0,don't like how it fits
1.0,"Trash watch. Comically cheap and low quality. Seller won't allow returns to Kohl's either, you must mail it back to get a refund. Don't waste your time with this trash."
1.0,"Not lighting up , and flower broken"
1.0,"They will send you two sets of three mask, one all black and one set all grey. Total scam ripe off."
1.0,The ring doesn't look like the one in the picture. it feels like the rings you get for 50 cents out of the bubble gum machine things. Feels like plastic. Two thumbs down 👎👎
1.0,"I don't like to give negative reviews or be mean to anyone (KODORIA). But the idea of reviews is to leave you opinions, so you might help others to decide about purchasing a product. With that being stated here goes.... BUYERS BEWARE understand these wings are made of "" Cheese Cloth "". So if you are not into arts and crafts. They are not sturdy. To much play to them and will be "" floppy"" looking on your Harry Potter flying keys. If this is what your intentions are, then yes buy them. I will need to use a little glue, to manipulate the wings. I should of payed attention to description. That's on me. I think I was distracted with the description comment about buy for yourself and female friends. Like other reviewers, lots of the wings were bent when they arrived. Probably during shipping, KODORIA to warehouse, warehouse to warehouse, then to customer. KODORIA might want to invest in some better packaging materials to avoid delivering damaged product to customers. Their wings were in a plastic bag, just a plastic bag. Maybe between a folded piece of thin cardboard (like a birthday card) , and then inside of an envelope with bubbled lining would work. So over all if printed wing design on cheese cloth with a possibility of 15 or so wings out of 50 being bent up for $ 9.00 is good enough for your needs then buy them....I will make what I got work because I know how!"
1.0,"Wish I read reviews… second time wearing.. bones poking out...i returned just before window to return cause i was keeping for certain outfit.. Got a replacement, again kept it for special outfit...AGAIN same issue, side bone poked out undercthe arm, and underwire""u"" wire moves out of place and stick out, by this time its pass the return time.. Only got 2 wear from bra DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
1.0,My kid was so excited to get these and allmost immediately the little grip dots on the bottom started falling off. So now are they not safe to wear because of the potential to slip but there are little black rubber discs all over my house. Very unhappy with this purchase.
1.0,Made very small<br />Hoping to return
1.0,"Bought this for my wife as part of a birthday gift.  Although the description says the strap is from 28""-38"", it is way to big for my wife's 28"" waiste.  I will be returning this item."
1.0,This product was a major disappointment. The fabric quality was horrific. I would put it as discount halloween costume level. I would not recommend. Also the item was drop shipped from china and took many many weeks to arrive. They are also shorter than would be ideal.
1.0,"The material is cheap and not at all like a faux suede, the shape of the legging is also very odd, the calf and thigh areas were normal, with a bizarrely large crotch and stomach area. I am currently trying to get a refund for this product, I started the return process and the package was returned by mail, hopefully I get my money back...."
1.0,It was easy to click io watch.. but then it never comes out. I accidentally attached wrongly.  But now I have to just wear what it is..
1.0,A big rip off and hard to get my money back
1.0,"This item was a gift for my daughter’s 3rd birthday.  It was on her wish list so we know what we were getting in the mail.  She loves the slippers immensely upon opening her gift.<br /><br />It’s very fluffy, cute, and the bottom of the slippers has a nice rubber material that you can use for outdoor.  However, the thread came loose within an hour of her wearing the slippers indoor. The foam and thin fabric materials is separated on the inside of the slippers. Her toe is sticking out and it looks like it would be hard to mend with basic sewing skills.<br /><br />I want to contact the seller, but I can’t seem to find the seller’s contact information anywhere.<br /><br />I will be returning these slippers, no doubt and won’t be buying from this brand in the future."
1.0,It is not similar to the picture!
1.0,"The description says the charm opens, but it is VERY hard to open, and the charm fell off when I tried to open it."
1.0,This is practically a shirt. Could never wear as a dress. And the material is extremely cheap and see-through. DO NOT BUY
1.0,Verry small i dnt like it
1.0,Way too small and no stretch. Unless you cut it and make it fit you'll be wasting your money
1.0,I ordered xlarge and it was still to small so I gave it to my wife I’m very disappointed
1.0,"Bought the solid color after buying and loving the striped version here. The solid is not the same material as the striped. The striped is extremely flattering, comfortable, and is polyester/spandex and dressy enough for work. The solid colors are cotton, very casual, like a T-shirt. Not business appropriate.<br />5 star for striped dress, 1 star for solid.<br />For both striped and solid dress, size up one size."
1.0,I'm sorry I couldn't rate it any lower.  It sounds like a cult.<br />All they want is money.  The material is just cheap plastic.  I'm filing a complaint with Amazon.  All they are doing is asking for money.
1.0,"What a huge disappointment. I ordered this suit in XXXL and XXXXL. I tried the XXXL on first, and was surprised when I tried on the XXXXL next and it was actually much smaller and less supportive than the smaller size. After examining the two suits, I quickly realized that this was because they were actually two completely different styles. The smaller-sized suit had boning on the sides in addition to the underwire that really added support - the larger size had no boning, was stitched completely differently, and the colors were very off and did not match each other amongst the two suits. Also, the smaller-sized suit came with a HOLE in the side. Really bummed and will return."
1.0,Eh. It was broken when it came so I give it 0 stars. Its cute though... And after spending 15 minutes with pliers and putting it together I am happy with it.
1.0,"I wore these once and it looks like I’ve wore them for weeks. I have a pair of the ‘best boot socks’ and they fit well everywhere, but these are super loose around the foot, tight on ankle, and light/breathable on the calf (not comfortable like the best socks). They also look like I’ve stretched them out; they don’t go back to normal after wear and they are so loose that’s it’s uncomfortable.<br />I should’ve stuck to the ‘best dang socks’ or ‘perfect fit’, but these were so pretty."
1.0,Material and buttons were cheap.
1.0,"Extremely unhappy with this suit it is not the same suit that is viewed in the picture, completely different style all together."
1.0,"UPDATED REVIEW: September 9, 2018. Rubber ear pieces come off. The adhesive used to hold the rubber sleeves on the temple bars fails. When taking the glasses off one day the rubber sleeve stayed behind on the ear. In light of the nose piece issue (see prior reviews), these aren't so easily lost, but their isn't a glue that will bond them back in place.<br /><br />The best part is the company does not want to hear about it. There is no contact information on their warranty card nor the internet. Their website is conveniently under construction??? Amazon doesn't want them. Fortunately my Credit Card company is wanting to assist me in rectifying this horrible product purchase.<br /><br />Don't be an IdIoT FoOl like me!!! Do Not Buy These. I relied on the information put out by the company and a few reviews. I hope my experience helps people understand that these Cheap Sunglasses ($20) are just that &#34;CHEAP&#34;; that should have been a red flag to me.<br /><br />I purchased three pair...2 down 1 to go. At this rate its about 1 pair lasts 2 months.<br /><br />OH you might also find this entertaining: the Warranty card explicitly says their frames are not unbreakable.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW: June 17, 2018. Nose pieces fall off and if you don't realize it and ultimately lose the rubber nose piece....All you have is parts. The glasses are unusable. This happened to me and I am staring at the most expensive glasses I have ever purchased if they will only last a couple months. I made the mistake of buying two more pair like an Idiot......I have nothing but REMORSE for buying these.<br />STAY AWAY and KEEP LOOKING! I wouldn't give a pair of these glasses to my worst enemy. Maybe Bolle' is still the answer.<br /><br />Excellent sunglasses. Was a lifelong customer of another high-end sunglass company ($85+)  but their prices kept going up and up and the designs and quality wasn't...Literally stumbled across these and never looked back, except to immediately order 2 more pair.<br />The lenses are Revo (not much better). The frames are said to be unbreakable...The hinges look like they just might be pretty sturdy; not your standard screwed or pressed in hinge leaves, these appear to be more durable. The fit seems fine. They come with a cleaning cloth and sak in addition to a nicely styled harder molded case. Included is also an eyeglass leash. It was my opinion that these were a very good pair of glasses and value-wise would compare them to glasses at least 3x the price."
1.0,Very cheaply made....the strap already broke on one shoe after one wear.
1.0,Not real.
1.0,Pants were okay. Top small. Returned for poor fit.
1.0,"For the price of this hat I definitely expected more. The quality is dollar store quality, very cheap thin material. I am strongly considering returning it."
1.0,"I loved this sweater upon arrival, the fit was perfect and I loved the material, however after 2 wears I noticed a huge hole in the shoulder near the neckline. VERY disappointed, I'm hoping they can make this right as my return window expired yesterday."
1.0,"This scarf is so cheap, rough and not made well. Might be alright it was selling for $3.00. Over priced."
1.0,"Pretty earrings, but obviously not “solid Stainless Steel” as listed.  I’ve been wearing the earring on the left; the other has been in the package until just now.  Stainless Steel doesn’t tarnish, and if it were solid Stainless Steel, there would be no “finish” to wear off.  False claims make buyers unhappy."
1.0,"I ordered a set of these pajamas in a panda print that's no longer included on this listing, a size up from her usual based on the reviews that they run small and they're great. I decided to buy her a second set so ordered the unicorn moon instead. My toddler is a skinny little thing, 2T-3T for length though everything over 24 months is super baggy. It's so hard to find anything that fits when they're 75th+ percentile height and under 20th percentile weight! I ordered these in unicorn moon 3T and they're so tight/narrow fitting they're unwearable even on my tall skinny kid, but long enough the legs and sleeves cover her hands and feet. They also had a noticeable weird chemical smell I thought would wash out but instead it got much stronger after washing. The print is cute, fabric is soft, but fit is garbage and who knows what that smell is it doesn't smell safe. I was so hopeful they'd be the same quality as the first set but this is junk. Returning."
1.0,Seller would not accept return. Look elsewhere.
1.0,"Product stopped working and that was that. Wouldn’t turn on and now now return, perfect!"
1.0,Item was entirely too small & falsely advertised. Please for the love of God Don't buy these shorts. They suck
1.0,"When my shoes came they came at two different remotes two different sets of chords and two different shoe horns neither remote worked even with new batteries and one shoe quit working the day after I got it, will not even charge I'm pretty bummed"
1.0,the cup size is really small for a large bust . If you get a 4x it will not fit someone who wears a size 44ddd
1.0,"These did not fit well, and the fabric was so-so.  I was able to return two, but the seller will not respond to me when I requested a return for the third pair.  (FYI, I purchased in two separate orders.) It looks like Goodwill will be getting them. I never had this problem in the many years I have been with Amazon."
1.0,This is awful. Don’t waste your money. I should have sent it back the day it arrived
1.0,Product didn’t not fit like a LARGE..more like an XS. I was very sad because I needed this dress for my bachelorette.
1.0,Not really doing anything just holds my hair back
1.0,"This was a real disappointment. The material is a really cheap one-sided synthetic felt. Sloppy, scratchy, unfinished seams inside and cheap plastic buttons. I never wore it after trying it on and donated it immediately. It just looked too low-rent."
1.0,"One of the decorative accents is missing already after minimal use. I ordered the one with leather decoration, I hope it's better"
1.0,"This boots are good only if you work where there is NO WATER at all, it clearly says that they are not waterproof and now I and you know that they ARE NOT WATER RESISTANT eather, the only reason why I bought it is because some clown post a picture where he has this boots submerged in water and he said that those boots were fine and not getting his feet wet... I made a bad choice buying this boots and I learned the lesson."
1.0,Chemical Smell. Runs small. I wear a Large in most pants...I couldn't even get these past my knees.
1.0,It's small and very thin quality!<br />Totally a waste of money!
1.0,Will not stay together. Junk.
1.0,Product was to small even though I ordered a x-large
1.0,"I ordered a 4xl because i normally wear a 3xl but wanted them to be loose.. the 4xl fits like a 1xl, i won’t be buying another pair and honestly you shouldn’t either."
1.0,Horrible. Bought it for my friends birthday and sadly I had to return it. The clasp and the chain were broken and the pendent itself was very flimsy and wouldnt close fully. Sorry but would not recommend.
1.0,I know the #1 problem with the stick-ons are that they aren't sticky enough.  So I appreciate trying to get it sticky enough.  But I feel like I'm in a suction cup and am seriously concerned it might tear skin (it didn't).
1.0,Not as advertised. I purchased these because I sit at a computer all day long and there was no protection whatsoever for the blue light. One of my friends has a different pair and you can actually see the difference on the computer when you put her glasses on these are just pieces of glass. No protection.
1.0,piece of crap. Don't buy. Has not compression at all! It's just a &#34;lycra&#34; glove.
1.0,The red one is not a sweater at all. It’s a very thin cotton and could pass as a short robe more than a shirt. Not flattering. I returned it.
1.0,To big s
1.0,"This base is way too light to hold a 9 ft half umbrella. It is made of a plastic resin and as soon as I put the umbrella in the stand it started to tip over. The shaft isn't long enough to balance it properly. Perhaps it will work with a much shorter umbrella. However, I also found that the shaft did not sit tightly in the base, making the umbrella wiggle. I tightened it but it came loose again. I have had to throw it out."
1.0,Size running small.
1.0,The item received does NOT look like photo. Its very tiny.There is no green stone. Clasp is flimsy and there is no pandora packaging.
1.0,It was supposed to be white it is not white it is a off-white could not wear it need to return it
1.0,Not the quality that was expected
1.0,These are way too big in size and the lens' are HUGE!  These are cheap and crappy sunglasses and I'm glad I only paid $4.00 for them!  Hideous!!!!!
1.0,The product fit perfectly but again not for talk women. My ass crack was showing when i triednit on. I cant go to work like that
1.0,"Maybe this is good for a religious covering, but to protect you from germs? Not going to work!! It is so lightweight and thin it won’t keep anything out. The fabric is a very loose mesh and you can completely see through it. I have some other light weight masks, but this goes to a whole other (unsafe) level. Definitely returning!"
1.0,"Top fit perfect, however the bottom has a weird shape to it."
1.0,Ridiculously small
1.0,"Is ugly, and does not go to shoulders looks like a mrs, clause costume"
1.0,The arms are not comfy or like the picture shows mine where pink and purple
1.0,Not navy blue at all. Much lighter color.
1.0,Tarnished to ugly dull color after first wearing.
1.0,Ripped at the waist seam upon opening. Quality is lacking and dress does not look like image.
1.0,Not even close to the look or feel that is advertised… total waste of money!
1.0,WAY larger than expected and awful color and quality. I tossed them in the trash after waiting almost a month for them
1.0,Half of them didn't work
1.0,"Batman logo is cheap plastic does not look good in person, the fit of the cap is tall (the top part of the hat sits very high.)"
1.0,"I have bought this bra for my wife and all it does is hurt her, the seams are scratchy and feel like they are going to bust open even though is the right size, the back is very unsupportive and the material is so low quality that have rubbed her raw. I will invest a little more money and buy a better quality one."
1.0,"Very disappointed. I bought this for my dad, with his input. It was too large and the closure did not work at all."
1.0,I upsized just to make sure I had extra room but If you have any kind of chest I would not order this. It fit like a medium... and I ordered an xl just to be safe..
1.0,CHEAP!! Spend a couple extra dollars and buy a real watch. This piece of crap probably costs a quarter to make.
1.0,This product looks absolutely awful in person. Cheap material and looks nothing like the picture at all. Do not buy!!!
1.0,Fell apart during first use
1.0,"Era para regalar a mi esposa y no especificaba el tamaño y resultó como para un bebe de tan pequeña,deberían ser más específicos me siento estafado."
1.0,not worth the money cheap
1.0,"Sizing is small. Short length in the front. Maroon/Red color is actually a white/red heathered. Material is not Like a knit sweater, more of a mesh material. Not impressed."
1.0,Very cheaply made. Such a shame bcuz they are very pretty. The post was so thick (see comparison pic #2) I couldn't get it into my ears. The back clips don't click onto post. They just flop about. Not sure how one would secure them. Came with 2 plastic pieces but they don't fit on anything! Very flimsy. I returned.
1.0,Do not buy this...the writing on it is so small and faded that you have to hold it under a light to read it and even then it's still hard to see it!
1.0,Lens coat peeled within 60 days. Don’t waste your precious money.
1.0,Turned out to be unusable junk. Don't buy and look elsewhere.
1.0,"After just my second use, the 2 bumpers/plastic pads on the backside of the large suitcase broke off exposing 2 sharp screws.  I tried to get replacement pads or a new suitcase from the manufacturer, Coolife. To their benefit, they responded quickly to my messages, at first offering me $50 and then $80 for my trouble.  However, that did not take care of my problem, a suitcase that cannot be used because of the danger of 2 screws protruding from the backside.  Coolife then referred me to Amazon who would only refund me $119 instead of the full cost of $149.  Amazon said the 1 year warranty had expired, but this is just the 2nd time I used the suitcase; this is not an item that is used frequently."
1.0,Poor fabric. Can are through material when on.
1.0,Alien patch coming off/falling off before i have even been able to wash it!
1.0,"The length is suppose to be 22"" but is less than 21""  plus you can not return the product. If you buy go to the next larger size"
1.0,Worst boots ever . Boots broke after 3 weeks use.
1.0,"Very cute top. Unfortunately, it will stretch out significantly after a few washes. (I would suggest sizing down because of that) The real problem is the black top bleeds black dye on EVERYTHING. Your skin and anything light colored you wear it with. After taking several steps to correct this issue myself (i like the top and prefer not to return things or create waste) like soaking, washing and heat setting, the top still bleeds black dye. I reached out to the seller for either a refund for a defective product or a replacement of another color and I have heard nothing. I have purchased 5 of these tops from this seller and am super bummed they can't take a moment to respond."
1.0,"It fit for the most part, but was right around the top a little and you can tell the bottom is cheaply made. Ya get what you pay for 😅 I guess. The bottom ripped from the top after just a few hours of wearing it."
1.0,"Headband missing, stain on the onsie, the tutu waist band is twisted and then sewed together.<br />Very poor quality<br />😠"
1.0,"My order came ripped at the seam so it was a complete waste of money... it looked good on, definitely if you have a little tummy, but the fabric was thin. The garment felt cheap and poorly constructed"
1.0,This way way off size wise . It would fit a child .
1.0,It doesnt work. Does absolutley nothing. I wouldnt even give it one star
1.0,"My husband bought a keychain (model Bear 3D keychain) in July 2019, on Amazon and after three months in use, this item is completely destroyed. <br />The gold color looks like 2 years under use and bear profile dismounted suddenly, in a way that surprised me. "
1.0,"DO NOT OPEN INDOORS! Green and white fur will cover your house.<br />A 3 year old must have made this.<br />Where to start?... for $100, expected something usable. You're better off going to a dollar tree and making your own.<br /> The gloves must be from a deformed hand. Pinky finger is off to the side, thumb is pointing back at you, long fingers with short, fat palm.<br />The foot covers might fit and infant or dog.<br />The hat is about the same size as the foot covers, might put an elastic band on it and put it on my dog.<br />The jacket... good luck getting your head through the hole without cutting or ripping the fabric.<br />The pants are not terrible but short.<br />The mask is the absolute worst part. It's a round rubber disc sewn into a wad of green ""fur"" with eyes and eyebrows glued on, and horrific attempted paint job. Honestly a dollar store sells better quality masks.<br />Overall, absolute disappointment and waste of money. Would not recommend.<br />Picture is of my $25 grinch mask compared to whatever came with the complete costume"
1.0,I ordered the small and it fit perfect the first time I wore it. I watched it once and I meticulous about getting clothes out of the dryer because I hate wrinkles more than anybody. Not only did it shrink but the wrinkles won’t come out and I’m not paying to get this T-shirt dry cleaned. I just feel silly for ordering two extra now that I know how poorly the product is made.
1.0,"Pretty necklace but the quality is very poor. I was so excited to get it in the mail because it is a great design. However, the necklace broke within the first couple of hours wearing it (the chain broke) and it is not able to be fixed. Do not buy!"
1.0,"I purchased this bag in October. The compartments on the bag are wonderful and help to keep organized. But the quality is terrible as is customer service. My bag began falling apart about 4-5 weeks ago on the bottom. Life got in the way. Finally called today and got told, ""if it was that important you should have called sooner. You've kept it since October."" I asked what they do, if anything about the poor quality, and was told to basically, ""deal with it."" Well, thanks for nothing. Buyer beware."
1.0,cheap is cheap i guess
1.0,There was no stretch to them.
1.0,"The necklace's overall base is awful. Not only is the ""moldivite"" fake, but the strings on the necklace easily broke. Even the smaller prices for decoration."
1.0,"I bought these for my nieces to have matching dresses at my wedding. They were so thin and see through that you could see every bump and wrinkle. Even putting a white slip underneath was too visible. You could literally see their belly buttons. If anything, this would be good lingerie."
1.0,Back pulls bottom up into a wedgie. Suit turns yellow in chlorinated pool.
1.0,"I bought these because I just wanted some cheap readers for occasions when I'm in the sun.  I ordered gray lenses, they are purple.  I ordered a 2.5 I think.  I have a very hard time focusing with these.  I thought maybe they needed to have less  curve around my face, that maybe that was messing up the focus through the bifocal lense, but it didn't help to bend them flatter.  They drive me crazy trying to focus through them.  I've bought better glasses at the Dollar store."
1.0,The XS is very loose
1.0,Do NOT buy! The photos in the ad are misleading and the hoodie is essentially just a Walmart quality hoodie that someone then ironed on a horrible pixelated image on. I've ironed images on shirts before as a kid and this is exactly the same quality... But even worse because the person making these used a horribly pixelated image. You can see the pixels from very far away and the ironed on image is very shiny. Not professionally done at all. Plus the item is shipped from China so when I went to mail it back the shipping cost would have been over $40 just to get the $30 back that the item cost. So now I'm stuck with an ugly hoodie i won't wear and down $30. Stay Away!!!
1.0,"Had this watch band less than a month, and it is turning colors. The band designs are “flaking off” along the edges. Would NOT recommend!!"
1.0,"If this were a more expensive item, I'd send it back.  The headband is white, not silver tone as described."
1.0,"These slippers are not good at all. The top is fluffy, but the bottom is so thin. The size 7/8 is closer to a size 7, maybe 7.5. No way an 8 could fit this size.<br /><br />My main issue is that the top is not even connected to the bottom on a part of one slipper. Photo attached. Keep in mind this was the condition on day 1 of use."
1.0,"We bought this for my 88-year-old mother in law. She wears it around her neck. From day one it was difficult to set the correct time. After a week of wearing it the time went off. I again put it near a window and it reset itself. Three days later the time again went off. Since mom is blind she didn’t know if it was 3 o’clock in the morning or 3 o’clock in the afternoon! I again reset it Putting it near a window for the 3 AM sinking is annoying. Now it is stuck on the Pacific Time zone. We live in Florida.  This is a nice concept, however I would pass on this item. It’s too late now to return it."
1.0,Zipper was broke when it arrived and it looks and feels cheap
1.0,"Very restrictive material, not ideal for sleeping and the top is a wrinkled mess. Who has time to iron their pajamas each night?  Pant legs are a bit short"
1.0,Within two weeks the zipper strip started detaching from the shorts. Also the stitches in the crotch appear to be coming undone. See pictures. I've got other shorts that are 10 years old that don't have problems nearly as bad as this. I would not buy again.
1.0,This runs small and has no stretch in the fabric - did not work for me.
1.0,I received mine today i put them on they are my size but the bk heel is way loose i cannot wear these they look horrible and made very cheap looking DO NOT BUY!
1.0,As soon as I pulled it out of the box it fell apart. This is the worst purchase I've ever made. This company should not be allowed to sell anywhere.
1.0,"I received the earrings and the packaging stated &#34;Made in China, lead free&#34;. There's not a chance I'm going to allow these in my 6 year old's ears."
1.0,"Paled in comparison to pair by Rock Bros. If size matters, don't waste your time here."
1.0,"As cheap as they come.  Don't bother.  The carbon footprint for this is too big, and not worth the price."
1.0,"this coat was ordered as a 2X, and was easily a small. The zipper was horrible, and so was the material. the product that was advertised looks nothing like what I received. Very Disappointed."
1.0,I hate the design of this band. It is very difficult to tighten or even put on because the strap slides under and not over to snap.
1.0,Fits really weird.
1.0,"Weird size. Def short and wide. Seems like a weird men's shirt. Not a girl shirt at all. Had to return it. No way it would fit. I'm 5'2 about 160 and it was way to wide and barely covered me, hit the top of my pants. Cute print tho."
1.0,"i bought these is black 12/1/2015 and was happy until yesterday I noticed the top of both lenses, the tint is fading and obstructing my view. I looked and noticed they are made in China so I'm guessing they are a &#34;knock off&#34;. Very disappointing.... Will not buy again."
1.0,Ordered size 2x and I couldn't even pull them up. I thought they were tagged wrong but it said 2x. Very disappointed. Bought 4 pairs of them.
1.0,I received the watch without a band as a gift. I needed a band so I got this one. I was very happy with the band itself. But the clasp was garbage fell apart three times... final was when I was having s conversation with my big boss.. how embarrassing that was and I threw it away just as fast as it fell off my wrist...
1.0,This jacket shed all day - i literally kept my lint roller in my handbag because everywhere i walker and sat I left black fuzz.
1.0,"Awful. Cheap, diesnt close...I am sending it back"
1.0,Too small. Children size
1.0,Cheeeeaaaapppppp Material.  It is so cheap and full of static cling! Just looks like wearing shiny paper. Could be very cute if quality material was used. I would say it fit okay but I couldn't tell. It stuck to my belly thighs and butt in the mist unflattering way. Looked like plastic wrap and I was the food. No.
1.0,Nice looking but material is paper thin and can be easily ripped.
1.0,"The stones is much darker (dark red) and cloudier than the picture. Somewhat disappointed. In the picture here, it looks a bit clear and translucent."
1.0,This item looks and fits nothing like the images shown.  The sleeves only reach just above my elbows and the length barely covers my butt. I will be returning this item.
1.0,"Ordered Kayla, got Kylie......I guess my niece will have to change her name. Quality is OK, but it's worthless if they don't get the name right."
1.0,It’s cute. But you can’t see the eyes. It was pretty flat when it shipped. Pretty disappointed with the product.
1.0,I ordered a size Large and did not fit to my daughter. It is like a size Small. I'm not happy.
1.0,"For starters I didn't receive correct color that I ordered. They are cheaply made. Within the 1st wear the seems have holes in them. They are very see through. And not squat proof. They are very comfortable, I just wished they were better made. Will not make another purchase here."
1.0,I don’t usually leave reviews but this was very cheaply made and it had a funny smell. I will be returning.
1.0,the glasses have a logo printed on them
1.0,Horrible BROKE in 2.2 seconds
1.0,Was a Christmas gift.firts use 1/24 inside liner tore .trying to figure out how to return
1.0,So disappointed with the quality.
1.0,to small order xl and they look like med
1.0,Will not stay attached to glasses.
1.0,"Do not order from this company. First time i ordered from this company,  I ordered gray and I received black. This time I ordered size 33 and I received 34. Don't know if they are incompetent or just don't care. Oh and the product is just ok. You get what you pay for."
1.0,"Update of 6/13/19: Only after 2-3 uses, the goggles eye piece fell off on its own after the goggles were left in the pool (water) for close to an hour. See the second pic. What else can go wrong? My kid is still using them after replacing the nose piece which broke earlier and now putting the other piece back on. Hope for no leaks with continuous use.<br /><br /> I liked that the goggles came in with a bag. Also the back of the straps have ""bumps"" so the straps would keep in place. Love the split straps. Great ideas!!!<br />But.... Only after one try to check how it fits, the nose peace broke in half. What!?!<br />P.S. the instructions say that these goggles are only for swimming, not diving."
1.0,I really dislike this product I put it on my Apple Watch and it didn’t even get tight at all the worst product I have ever bought in my life
1.0,They suck for welding
1.0,The heels on these boots caved in after three wears on a 14 year old girls weighing 120 pounds.  Were intended as horse riding boots but heels failed immediately.  Poor product.  Do NOT purchase
1.0,"Save your money, this product is so cheap and thin. It's not neoprene all over and makes the belt very flimsy."
1.0,Not Leather. Cheap. Not worth money at all.
1.0,This is REAL FUR. Google how they get rabbit fur off bunnies.  Listen to their screams...it is one thing to kill an animal for survival.  It is another for a keychain.  I got one as a gift because I love rabbits and did not know it was real fur.  Its cheaper for them to actually use real fur than to produce it.  Please educate yourselves before buying something silly that an animal was tormented to produce.
1.0,"I absolutely love this nightshirt!  Just the right weight , softness, and comfort.  Runs a little small, so go up a size."
1.0,If you are a D cup or larger don’t buy these unless you enjoy having your boob flop out as you go about your day
1.0,Vino sola una y eran 2 la Rosada y la Blanca y solo me vino la Rosada!!
1.0,"Somewhat disappointed with the size of these, much less body to them than I would have thought necessary for long term durability.<br />Make them more substantial and I’d be happier."
1.0,There cheapy crappy glasses my son was really disappointed your rather off buying rawlings or oakleys you can see the paint chipping and how pourly they are made terrible sunglasses will make sure people are aware of this scam
1.0,This is made out of such a thin flexible material you can barely tell what it is when you look at it
1.0,"this was too small, had an awkward fit. wasn't ass sticky as expected"
1.0,"Unfortunately this product can’t stand up to pressure from wrist-bending and normal activity of a 4 year old.  It broke on day one, right off her wrist!  - It’s just not sturdy enough for an active child.  What a horrible disappointment for my granddaughter as she was so excited to get it as a gift - only to have it break apart while wearing it two hours later.<br />If your child is less active or wears delicate jewelry, it might work for you.  I would say my purchase might be a defective model, but the case does seem weak. I won’t be trying this again, and will instead buy a metal case watch.  Cheaply made.  Buyer beware."
1.0,Very poor quality and so wrinkled that it would never be wearable.
1.0,Fell apart at the seams after about 3 weeks. Not a quality product. Especially the velcro pocket.
1.0,My son had this watch a week before the pin popped out on the band and was irreparable. He was sitting in class and turned his wrist and it broke. Wish I had gone with another watch.
1.0,Cheaply made. I bent one just trying to get it in my ear. Regret this order.
1.0,Cheap.  Broke in 2 days. Almost lost watch when the seam up by the clasp opened up.<br />Don't waste your $$$.
1.0,Strap stuck straight out away from neck?
1.0,"Faded within a week, and now after 3 weeks later they are peeling off!"
1.0,Threading is bad it comes apart after just one use
1.0,"I have never written a review of a product on Amazon, but I thought this purchase was worthy of a review. Horrible product!  The picture advertised does not match at all the reality of the look of this shirt. The colors are vibrant, but the pattern and the inclusion of a lot of blue, light blue, and white does not match the orange-y, summery look that is advertised. The sleeves also have no buttons. The fabric just ends abruptly at the wrists. When you roll the sleeves up, the pattern is not there on the underneath of the fabric; it's just white. There are no tags whatsoever. The back is longer than the front, and although it was advertised to be that way, it just doesn't look good.<br />We can't return the blouse because we are in Honduras and shipping is too expensive. I hope this review helps someone to avoid making the same mistake I did."
1.0,Can't seem to work with it.
1.0,Mask designs were cute. Not comfortable to wear for long periods of time (while at work) due to no nose wire.
1.0,Very soft and inviting. Until you wash it. Washed it with a few other items and everything is covered in fuzz. Even wearing it it is pilling and fuzz is all over everything.  I’m not sure if I can return it as I washed it. Will probably end up in the donation bin.  Terrible quality.
1.0,"Be cautious of great reviews,  they try to have you remove bad reviews for monetary compensation. I guess if you want a tights material for under clothing in winter these are the way to go. They are an odd material, not shiny or soft. And they don't fit properly. The crotch is sooooo large and droopy I can only compare it to how nylons fit. I had them pulled up to the bottom of my bra and still they fit weird."
1.0,"Description says, ""One size fits most."" Really?? In what magical realm can these socks possibly fit ""most"" women??<br /><br />My wife has recently needed to start wearing compression stockings. As we live in the cold north, I thought these might be a good match. I mean, it does say fits most people, right? Like most every other sock out there? HA! Only if you have pencil legs! I was surprised to hear my wife say she couldn't get them over her calf. So I pick up the other sock and stretched it a bit at the top edge. I was shocked to see the maximum amount of stretch these things have. Heck, the only way ""One size fits most"" could apply is if these were being sold as arm coverings! Don't believe me? Take a look at the photos.<br /><br />I measured the top of a sock as it lay - 3 inches (7.62cm). Then I hunted to find something that would just barely fit inside without risk of tearing the fabric. Ah, found a partial roll of clear tape. You can see what the tape measures across (top view), and the amount of stretch the sock has while around the tape. I will admit, there could probably be just a few more layers of tape on the roll and still fit inside the sock, but NOT MANY layers! That sock is nearly at its limit. No pic, but the circumference of the tape roll is 12 3/16 inches (30.92cm). Are these 'socks' meant for kids?<br /><br />Another thing - in the reviews, there are two women who both say they are 5' 11"". One says the socks come over her knee and the other says they come up just to the knee cap. Now notice in the photos in the ad -- look in the last photo, showing 7 socks rolled up (those look like individual socks to me; not rolled as a pair). Now look at the socks on some legs, and notice how high they go...and not even stretched, either. This HAS to either be a young girl or a very small Oriental woman. There's no way that is anywhere near a normal, full-grown adult woman!<br /><br />Also in the Description (same line as ""One size fits most"") it states, ""Fit for size 36-40 feet."" What measurement is that? I have to guess it's metric, so let's assume cm. That equates to about 10 1/4"" to 15 3/4"". Now, what is it that's being measured? Certainly isn't the length of foot. I have to guess circumference? Hmm....that roll of tape measured 30.92cm. Yes, I suppose that is talking about circumference. So again I have to ask, in what magical realm is that a ""one size fits most"" size? If the feet can be a maximum of 40cm circumference, then these socks certainly are NOT meant for anyone whose calves measure a larger circumference! Maybe we got a defective pair, as there is NO WAY these socks will stretch to the minimum 36cm measurement! I struggled as it was to get the sock top around that roll of tape, and as mentioned, my wife could not get the sock over her calf.<br /><br />All that aside, the socks seem well made. It states 80% wool, which is very nice. BUT....it can't keep you warm if it won't fit. Wife commented that she liked the feel of them.....while covering her ankles!"
1.0,"This literally broke immediately. I am a smaller person so its not like it was too tight, but still the clasp broke. Its a cute anklet but worth 0 stars since it can't last a day."
1.0,If a larger size. They’re extremely see through and limited stretch.
1.0,Very poor quality sweatshirt and the graphic is fuzzy.
1.0,These things looked like crap when I put them on so I returned them. The fit was HUGE and the stretchy part didn't look good at all.
1.0,These are products made in China.. the material is so cheap you can see right through it don't waste your time in buying this piece of crap!
1.0,I did not like the fact that it's too heavy & looks ridiculous on my ears .planning to return the earrings.
1.0,"The band and cover are very cute! The band is amazing but the screen cover isn’t fully functional. It creates a spot on the screen that looks “wet” and that spot doesn’t work. Cleaned, dried, and reapplied. Still the same."
1.0,This item runs EXTREMELY small!!
1.0,I didn't get all of the charms. I didn't get the black and gold charms.
1.0,This is the 2nd wrong T-Shirt.  Ordered Colonel Reb T Shirt and received Party in the Grove twice.  I give up trying to get it!
1.0,I didn’t like this item at all. It’s very cheap looking and made. It’s a big waste of your money.
1.0,"I usually wear a medium or large, I ordered large size and this is extremely small. Even the straps are too short."
1.0,Provides so little warmth they are pointless
1.0,Large fitting in the booty
1.0,It’s alreay looking like old strap after first day of the use...<br />Straps are very rigid to put under each cross stays
1.0,"Just skip it.  It is not worth it since they make you pay for the return and the fit of the shirt is super wonky.  The arm holes are super big and the entire shirt is just a mess. Which, would be fine - if they would take it back properly, but they make you pay for it.  So uncool and very frustrating.  BUYER BEWARE."
1.0,Way too small. More of a child's size
1.0,Came 3 months late and just was horrible quality
1.0,"Top was poorly constructed,<br />Arm holes were oddly very tiny.  Returned this item."
1.0,"I ordered the white/orange tye dye because they appeared mostly orange in the photo. They are not mostly orange. They are mostly white with orange splotches and it's a dirty white too. I wanted an orange pair and thought these were really cute so I paid what I considered more for them compared to other Amazon leggings. While I understand the concept of ""tye dye"", these are really quite far off in color from the photo shown. I will keep them but am not very happy with them. I expect to get something at least similar to the color in the photo even if it is tye dye."
1.0,These are advertised as Winter Insulated but are no thicker than non-insulated gloves I have bought in retail store
1.0,was not like description- not oversized and not 100% cotton either - very clingy
1.0,I was so excited when I saw these earrings.  Opened the box and one broke off the ring for the teardrop right away. :(
1.0,This skirt looks nothing like the picture. This skirt came pleated and was not nearly floor length. The white version is actually ivory in color and was not at all what I anticipated when ordering.
1.0,"I thought since these were US Polo that they’d be decent quality... NOPE! I literally wore them once. The fabric felt cheap, then one of the eyelets for the waistband string fell off, the stuff inside then began to come out of that hole. The string ends are that cheap plastic and was already starting to get soft and appear to be breaking. And the lo and behold, there was already a hole on the pant leg seam. I sent back for a refund because I didn’t trust that getting a replacement would be beneficial given the poor quality of these joggers. I am beyond disappointed, especially since they’re not technically “cheap” in cost: save your money and find another jogger instead."
1.0,"Comfortable but very bulk. The gloss is not consistent, and they don't look very good. Good value, if you like them."
1.0,"While they are adorable, within the first week of school the layers fell apart! I'm very upset that I wasted money on them."
1.0,They fall off even if you put the end of your shirt back through the clip.
1.0,It was a ok product wasn’t what I expected but it’ll work for the time being
1.0,"Received promptly, broke 2nd day. We just keep super glue around to adhere leather to the metal. Seems to have been adhered with glue gun in the past."
1.0,Just used in the shower. Request a replacement.
1.0,Estoy muy descontenta los devolví porque no me gustaron y tengo más de 18 días esperando mi devolución y ahora no tengo ni mi dinero ni los lentes! Que les parece? Nunca me había pasado esto con Amazon! Increible
1.0,"After a 12 hour shift, these socks will leave an imprint on your legs. Definitely do not recommend these."
1.0,The product looked great but. In my pocket for less then a week and it's broke. Do not buy if your going to actually going to use it.
1.0,This hoodie was big and thin. It looked nothing like the picture. I will never purchase this again! If you like to waste your money then purchase this item.
1.0,"The Material is awful, and the fit is atrocious! Worst purchase I have ever made; it looks nothing like the picture."
1.0,I got an xtra small for my son for Christmas but they gave xlarge I call and told them about they send a new one out but it came out to be Clarke again. I just gave up. There xsmall is an xlarge.
1.0,"Very light , cut it with a nippers to check. Piece of plastic."
1.0,Terrible quality. These get runs and rips so easily.  The “lining” on the bottom does nothing but show over shoes.  Will not be buying again.
1.0,Just awful
1.0,This product was not at all worth it. Don't waste your money.  The customer service was also awful.
1.0,The clasp for the strap broke immediately just trying to put it on.  Such poor quality.
1.0,It sucks. Fraud
1.0,returned.  cheaply made
1.0,The photo really does not allow you to see what the item really is like in person.  I probably would not order from this brand again.  Was my 1st appointing Amazon experience.
1.0,why oh why didn't I read the reviews!! Bad decision!  Waste of money!!
1.0,Terrible quality. It looks like it came out of a quarter gumball machine.
1.0,"Absolutely the worst fabric ever. I bought the black with white stripes. Outside seems ok, but the inside is SOOOO ITCHY.  I CANT STAND IT ON MY SKIN!"
1.0,I ordered these expecting 288 pair- I received 44!!
1.0,The material It’s too thin and it made me itchy.
1.0,The back of the earrings arrived bent.
1.0,The aqua stone is not as brilliant as advertised and the ascent stones were dull. I returned my necklace because of these imperfections and also due to the aqua stone being set crookedly.
1.0,"This is my second one and the first was fine.  However, this one doesn't close which means it's useless.<br /><br />This is a cheapie item and I don't expect high quality, but I do expect it to close."
1.0,"Too big compared to the ordered size. Not What I expected, total waste of money. Not recommended"
1.0,Broke almost immediately after he started to use it.  Garbage product.
1.0,I was not happy with this bracelet. Looks like it was used. Was tarnished and scratched. Took it to a local jewelry and they told me that this bracelet was already worn. I bought it as a gift and I can not give it as a gift bc of the condition it was delivered to me.
1.0,"I ordered LEGGINGS and got jeans. The pictures of the product show no zipper or buttons, and a stretchy waist band. What I received was the opposite. They were too small for me and about 10 inches too long as well, very uncomfortable. So completely unusable. Disappointing."
1.0,Sleeves were 3/4 instead of full length. Very disappointed. Returning.
1.0,"Its very small , not what I thought it would be.  Its made very poorly.  I would not it again."
1.0,"I purchased this dress a few years back and loved it. The fit was perfect, the fabric was of good quality, and it was flattering on me. This dress was complete opposite. The same sized dress was extremely too big, the fabric was cheap and flimsy, and it was constructed very poorly. It was not a flattering fit. Far cry from my first purchase. This dress was probably an attempt at emulating the original dress."
1.0,Cute purse but very cheap material.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,Low quality fabric. Not comfortable
1.0,"The sunglasses seem ok, but i hate to see this happen. The only reviewer with more than 1 review written stated that the sunglasses were sent to them.  Buyer beware."
1.0,The lines on the shirt make it so that it looks like you are wearing it crooked. Bought it just for 4th of July but I can’t even wear it. Nice material but the lines make it unwearable. Waste of money
1.0,I’m gutted.  I loved this bracelet and it broke after a two months….. I have the plastic one as well and it’s starting to stretch out and I’m scared it’s gonna break too.
1.0,"These are nothing like pictured. The fabric is disgusting, it feels so cheap and gross and the photo makes them look like a gauzy olive green and these are a cheap polyester in a robins egg blue color. Their advertising is SO deceptive. Then they want to charge me to return their terrible product. What a joke. Do NOT buy these."
1.0,XL does not fit 38 D chest.
1.0,"I ordered the xlg I’m the black dress with white collar. It is literally like a small/medium. Very misrepresented otherwise it’s cute, but thin material. The entire dress fits into a sandwich size ziplock"
1.0,"its cheep, looks cheep, feels cheep"
1.0,"My original purchase was great-a tight top band, but easy to pop the stitches of the embroidered logo. Second set: thinner material, tighter band. Very disappointing. Third set was horrendous!!! Soooo sad because I have huge legs, hard to fit, and I really liked the first set."
1.0,Permanently twisted.
1.0,Very cheap and smelled horrible
1.0,Y’all. This is CHEAP material. Super thin and you can see right through it.
1.0,This thing was meant for a child or very small faced person.  I'm not a big man. But this thing is too small and to rigid. Covers your nose & upper lip or mouth & chin
1.0,This wasn't silky or stretchy like a slip should be.  This material catches and causes weird wrinkles on whatever you wear over it.
1.0,they shrink way too fast when you wash them other wise alright but not for me
1.0,I couldn’t wear this nose ring. It was missing a stone and didn’t lay flat on my nose.
1.0,"I am between a L and XL, because I like my clothes to be a little big. I bought these in XL. The items I received weren't even big enough to fit my youngest child. These are asian sizes, so they prob don't make my size. And it costs more than what the price is because of shipping, and it costs even more to send it back. I gave away to goodwill for dress up clothes for a toddler."
1.0,Fit was okay but brand-new unraveling
1.0,I have written several reviews all negative so lets see if this gets some attention.  In the past I have enjoyed Hanes.  The fabric is horrible now. I wear a size 7 125 pounds.  I have given the briefs to goodwill. It sad to see Hanes go down like this.  I first ordered the wrong size.  I didn't see the word Plus.  Now that was my fault.  Even ordering the wrong item I got regular size 7 in multi colors.  This purchase was a comedy of errors. On my side and senders.  How well
1.0,"The idea is good. But with these, if you put the part that sticks out on the outside it’s really obvious but if you put that part on the inside it digs into your skin. Bruised the heck out of my hip bone. Like I said, the idea is good they just need to make it less large."
1.0,Constant tangling
1.0,I would not buy this dress I bought it for my daughter it looks like a potato sack in a hideous green it’s awful<br />Return ....
1.0,I tried to reorder and was not able to get te larger size.
1.0,"Really bad customer service, I had to pay for the return fee. Nice Reebok"
1.0,"Though a watch is supposed to be Swiss Made, it has not tag that assure that,<br />I am not returning because I have no reason as described , but am not happy with it.<br />The description did not mention where it was manufactured ,and we did not find any clue  of the place it was made."
1.0,don't hold long
1.0,the quality is bad
1.0,I was shipped the wrong size and since I have a large chest it did not fit at all. I ordered the one size fits all after reading many many reviews and I knew the small would not fit but that is the size I got instead. It’s cute but I gave one star for obvious reasons.
1.0,The flower on the one shoulder fell off first day granddaughter wore it!!
1.0,Did not fit correctly and went by size chart. Probably because it was made in China...FJB!
1.0,Cheaply made no  bright light  asit claims very disappointed
1.0,Got it for someone as a gift they loved it !!
1.0,Beautiful bracelet but its broke. Was broke as soon as I opened the package. Took a long time from ordering  to receiving. Very disappointed. Having a hard time trying to get it replaced or money back.
1.0,No support what so ever!
1.0,The first day I wore it then metal rings starting falling off...so now the belt is starting to tear up more
1.0,"When I took them out of the package, I tried to clean them and they fell apart in my hand!!! Absolutely a total price of garbage!!!"
1.0,I can only attest to the mask with the snotty nose. The mask is very large as well as the graphic. The graphic is so big that you can't even see the entire thing. This might work for someone with a giant head and face. Like Shrek... it might look okay on him. Returning.
1.0,Too small ok for kids Beverly thin and stamped with made in china
1.0,stinky leather.
1.0,Way too small! I thought I was shopping on prime not wish.. 2x fits like a mens medium. Couldn't even put it on. Very dissatisfied..
1.0,"No coverage. I felt like the girls were going to just fall out and may I just say I’m an A cup; that should not happen. I got a small which fit but the way it’s made is to have little coverage. Do not buy, you will just be sending it back and wasting your time getting excited about it."
1.0,The lights stopped working properly only after a week or so.
1.0,"The springs within the Handle are so weak, that the Handle keeps falling off, and does not hold into the Locking-Latching  holes when the handle is pulled up for dragging the spinner....The warranty! Another story: you have to pack and pay for the shipment, and Samsonite needs all kinds of details that the users like us are hard pressed to locate the information; the warranty details are printed in small print, so seniors will not be able to read it....The entire system is diced against anyone asking for any warranty work! They ( The Samsonite)  do not want users to avail the Warranty Repairs!"
1.0,"These socks do not stay in place. After the 1st wear, they got so loose. It keeps slipping down my Adidas Stan Smith. It is very annoying. I wonder if people are paid to write the reviews."
1.0,"The bag is listed as:  ""Size -- 7.9inch*3.1inch*6.3inch.<br />In reality the bag is larger:  7.9i"" x 7"" x 6.3""<br />Also, the fake leather is super thin and will not last (flimsy)!"
1.0,Can't rate this  product because the belt was impossible to open so we are returning.  Also the fabric is very heavy and didn't feel good in the hand.
1.0,Ordered XXL
1.0,Too small both top and bottom.  Also pocket on shorts was not sewn shut
1.0,Product runs extremely small!
1.0,Cheaply made and not worth the money
1.0,"Update, 2021-04-04.  Had it for only 2 weeks and the movement has stopped running.<br />It is at full charge, and will not wind any tighter.  So the one I got, the movement is junk.<br /><br />Perhaps, if you are a watchmaker, or can clean & repair watches, this might be a nice watch, but at this point, either there is junk inside the case like hair or dust, the movement is garbage, or I got a defective one.<br />I'll try contacting the seller next, but this is probably a junk movement.<br /><br />It is still beautiful, but if it won't run at all, that's a 0 rating.<br /><br />Original review:<br />So, I was very skeptical of buying this watch. For all the features @ $300 US, it seemed a bit much.<br /><br />The problem was, the damn thing is SO GORGEOUS.<br />I HAD to buy it.<br /><br />TL;DR, if you LIKE it, BUY IT.<br /><br />Now, I'm going to write a pretty darn good review.<br />A LONG review.<br /><br />The crystal *IS* Sapphire, according to a professional testing device a friendly jeweler owns.  It is not as cold to the lip-touch as other sapphire crystals I own, but it passes the expensive tool test.<br /><br />If I remember, I'll post a review a year or a month from now about the durability of the crystal.<br />I am wearing this gorgeous thing every day now, for at least a month, just to test the crystal, & accuracy.<br /><br />Presentation: God Damn Perfect.  When this watch arrived, I thought it was a heavy tool that I purchased for another project.  The box felt like tit weighed 5 pounds.  Well, maybe not THAT much, but it sure as heck was WAY TOO HEAVY to be a watch!<br /><br />Opened it up, saw it was a watch, and figured they must have weighted the box with steel or something!!<br /><br />Opened the , very nice BTW, watch box, took out the watch, and WOW.<br />When they say Tungsten Steel case and band, I believe them.<br />(No, I have not performed a density test.  It IS HEAVY.)<br /><br />The second hand movement really IS sweep. not a click, click, click once per second.<br />The second hand really does move smooth, 5 clicks per second.<br />VERY NICE looking!!!!!!<br />( I am VERY happy about this, compared to other watches I have bought.  Can you tell?  )<br />The second hand sweep is really very nice.<br /><br />I haven't scratched any part of it yet, and I am not a gentle/small person.<br /><br />It comes with a cleaning cloth.<br /><br />Mine came with some weird alternate watch band, I think?  No idea what it actually is.<br /><br />Came with a band segment removal tool.<br />You need to be fairly good with small hand tools and metal watch bands in order to remove segments.<br />The directions are actually pretty good, if you actually READ them.<br />(Unlike me.... )  READ THE DAMN MANUAL, or RTFM as I learned it.<br /><br />OK, enough gushing, on to the bad.<br /><br />The clasp release tabs are very cool, but they are VERY sharp.  I had to file down the edge facing my wrist.<br />This is a problem.  If you can't fix this yourself, you will need to bring to a jeweler to fix.<br />It actually hurt so much for the first day, I filed the edges myself, badly, so it felt better.<br />To be honest, I liked this watch so much, it was not an issue.<br /><br />Just saying, the inside clasp edges are unpleasantly sharp.<br /><br />OUPINKE, you need to fix this.  It was VERY annoying.<br /><br />Now that I filed it away, unprofessionally, spent maybe 5 minutes with a fine file, it hasn't bothered me all day.<br />9 am through 3 am the next day at this point.<br />So, VERY easy to remediate.<br />Still, this sharp edge should be (ad)dressed at the factory.<br /><br />The crystal:  I Don't Like It.  It registers as Sapphire, but it fails the lip test.  ( Put the crystal on your lip.  It should be cold to the touch.  ALL my other genuine Sapphire crystals are damn COLD to the touch, even if held to my lip for 20 seconds.  This sucker is warm ALL THE TIME, when I'm wearing it.  )<br />Also, the crystal stays filthy.  It comes with a cleaning cloth.<br />You will need the cleaning cloth.  All the time.<br />Your shirt sleeve will NOT clean the crystal.  Well, maybe YOUR shirt will clean the crystal, but my shirt is hit-or-miss.<br /><br />The manual leaves a lot to be desired.  You'll figure it out, if you are smart enough to buy this watch.<br /><br />The crown is difficult to manually wind.  I plan on replacing the crown ASAP, if the watch runs down too often.<br />(They recommend winding to full once a week?  If I remember correctly?  Crown is too slippery. This is not a big deal.  Crown should be EASILY replaceable.  I'll amend this review if I replace it.<br />And to the manufacturer, folks, this nice of a watch SHOULD have a bigger crown, to make it look more manly! )<br /><br />Waterproofness.  They rate it at 50 M, but specifically state on the page to NOT wear it underwater.<br />I would go with their assessment.<br />I'll change this opinion after I take it apart and look at the seals.<br /><br />Lastly, I AM a watch enthusiast.<br />I have built 4 watches from a whole movement and all other parts individually, so I don't know too much yet.<br /><br />I have NOT yet taken this watch apart and looked at the insides.<br /><br />NO I AM NOT paid for this review!!!!!!!<br />I just loved the features and look SO MUCH, I had to buy it.<br /><br />So far, for $300.00 US, I am pretty happy.<br />you know, for 3 days of wear.<br /><br />MORE info.<br />The clear back is supposed to also be ""sapphire"", but a standard High Quality Nicholson micro file was able to EASILY scratch the back crystal.<br />I don't really get from the listing if the back is SUPPOSED to be Sapphire.<br />The back DID measure as Sapphire on the professional tester, but I do not think it is.<br />The crystal just gets too dirty, too quick.<br /><br />I think the crystals may simply be Sapphire coated, or some-such other thing.<br /><br />Either way, treat the face crystal carefully, and you should be ok.<br />I am NOT going to try scratching the face of mine, sorry folks!<br /><br />So, final thoughts?<br />This seems to be a pretty damn good watch for the price.  $US 300 as of 3/15/2021<br />If you like the way it looks, BUY IT.<br />Just treat it carefully, and realize waterproofness is probably exaggerated, and the crown is a bit slippery.<br />Most likely, for a few hundred $US, you could have these 3 flaws remediated by any competent watchmaker.<br /><br />YMMV."
1.0,Stretched out. Slides right off my nose.
1.0,"Cheap, broke within 2 minutes wearing"
1.0,I have a small head and these were to tight.  I gave to my granddaughter.
1.0,Armband did not fit . One was like 1” and the side was short as well. Very defective. Cost too much to send back so I gave it away.
1.0,"First off, it wreaks of spray paint!! It's a rubber mask that doesn't hold it's shape.  DO NOT BUY! POOR QUALITY!!"
1.0,This shirt was not even close to true to size. It was EXTREMELY wide and on top of that the material was thin and see through.
1.0,So cheaply made don't waste your money!
1.0,UPDATED REVIEW:  Unfortunately I had to change my rating to 1 star because I washed the shirt in cold water and the wine color bled all into the white so this shirt will be going back.  I am very disappointed and will now have to see if all of the Jack Smith shirts I purchased will do the same thing when washed.<br /><br />I really like the style of this shirt but the material is tightly woven and not very stretchy.  The fit is a little snug in the upper arms so I'm glad I purchased the large instead of the medium.  I haven't washed it yet so I'm worried about the color bleeding issues others have mentioned.
1.0,"Bought this for school dress up day so it’s ok if it only survives one day of being worn, but the quality is very poor. It’s not even sewn on the back, just folded and pressed.<br />Not worth the money."
1.0,It was not worth the money<br />Very cheap looking
1.0,"This item is an analog wristwatch with a factory-installed battery that is to be activated by swinging the watch in a back and forth horizontal arc for about 30 seconds.  Upon receiving the item on September 22, 2010 I tried to activate the battery according to the directions provided in the small manual.  I tried this at least 5 times, even swinging for a full minute on one attempt.  This watch will not run.  I have initiated the return process through the seller (the Store Closet).  I should have read the seller's return policy before even purchasing the item.  The seller has a policy of fully refunding only UNOPENED items, charging a 25% fee for returning opened items.  They sent me a defective product and they won't refund me in full?  That is a rip-off, my friends.  Regarding the Store Closet, you be the judge.  Worthy of note, too, is that the product review states nothing about how this watch is to be activated.  Is it any wonder why?<br />Addendum (Oct. 1, 2010)  It turns out that the Store Closet purchased the item from another vendor.  The vendor has given authorization to Amazon to refund my money in full.  I have been notified by Amazon of the full refund.  As of this writing, I can only wait to see if there is an adjustment on my credit card.  However, receipt of a defective wristwatch is inexcusable and my rating remains at one star, though not even one star is deserved."
1.0,100% polyester guys. The description reads mostly cotton!
1.0,The strapped ripped on the 2nd use
1.0,Front fell off the first week
1.0,Horrible no guage
1.0,No dice la descripción que se estira
1.0,"Not touch screen compatible, really disappointing considering I needed these gloves to brace the Michigan winter as well, now I'm left on hold."
1.0,I like the top but the pant portion in the white color is too thin (won’t be wearing them) and would not order any other items from this brand
1.0,Color comes off
1.0,"These noses came in a vacuum seal bag, which would be fine except that they never puffed back up into a circular shape- even after being taken out of the bag, sitting out for a while, and even rolled<br />Around in my hand. Very disappointed :("
1.0,Plastic trash bag is much sturdier than these cheap quality pants. The ones advertised in the photo is not the same ones that was sold to me. I threw them in the trash. What a waste of money.
1.0,Uncomfy fit with poor sole!
1.0,"The material of these pants is soft and breathable,  but it is very thin and clingy and seems to highlight any less than perfect curves in an unflattering way. I AM 5'4"" and usually wear around a size 16 and these pants looked horrible on me. They were also very long on my legs. I couldn't keep them due to the terrible fit."
1.0,Too small and didn't like the fit or the print.
1.0,The Ortho arch support was in the wrong place on the shoe. No heel cup. Material is below par.
1.0,"I’m 5 1 135/145 give or take depending on the days. I got a medium. It’s HUGE IM SWIMMING in the jacket. The material is nice, the color is everything I expected it to be. Just size down if you buy."
1.0,This was the worse product that I have ever received from Amazon.
1.0,Unhappy 😔
1.0,Way too small; size is completely wrong
1.0,The fit was way off from a previous purchase of the same item in store. The return is a hassle so I’m taking a hit and keeping an item I can’t use. Don’t buy clothes online
1.0,"Update:  I have had this watch for a few months now, and I am leaving this as a one star item.  Ever few weeks I have to update the time because it will be between five and fifteen minutes behind.  This does not seem to be a gradual thing, it is just all of a sudden behind.  I would recommend you spend a little more money and choose something of better quality, at least if you plan on using it to tell time.<br /><br />This watch looks nice.  It is pretty large and comes with a tool to resize it.  I have been trying to make it a little smaller, but I have not been able to get the pins out with the tool provided, so I have been wearing it in the size received.  It is very large on me.  I thought since it came with a tool it would be easy to resize, which it has not been.  This is why I am giving it three stars."
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture.very disappointed
1.0,Made for a small busted woman.
1.0,"Can't tell you about the product,  received something else....waste of tine and money."
1.0,"At first i loved it, but then the drawstring part broke.. I was sad cause i honestly thought it was perfect."
1.0,The band was torn and dirty<br />Was very disappointed
1.0,It was horrible it said daddy's little girl ishing instead of daddy's little girl fishing and I can't even afford to return it so I'm stuck with it giving it to my dad that way
1.0,Too tight for the sizing quoted
1.0,"I buy things on amazon literally daily, I have never hated anything more. It looks nothing like this picture. Do not waste your $$!!!<br />Also, I would give it a 1/4 of a star if possible."
1.0,These are “pop beads” but many of the beads were too hard to connect to each other and on many of them the smaller connecty piece just broke off .... and no ‘connecty’ is not a word.
1.0,They don't look anything like the picture. I immediately returned them.
1.0,I ORDREED THE DRESS FOR CABO AND IT WAS NOT THE SAME COLOR MORE OF AN ORANGE RED
1.0,"Way too small, could NOT wear!"
1.0,The best this about this purchase was the ease of the return. Item was way too small. I ordered an XL. This is either a jr/child’s shirt or someone doesn’t understand sizes. Extremely disappointed as I was excited to get this shirt for a weekend sorority event.<br /> Returned!
1.0,"so cheap. definitely what youd expect for the price. fell apart instantly, and very stiff material."
1.0,Too elastic. Unsecure latch.<br />The strap is way too elastic enabling the saxophone to sag too low when not holding<br />The latch/hook has a large opening and therefore it is not secure
1.0,Does not fit to size.
1.0,"Fit is extremely small. I ordered an XL (if I can find shirts in Tall, I order a large, xl is to accomodate for longer arms) and it is so tight and so small, almost like it was sewn backward, the back is too lose, the front cowl should be drapey and it's tight (I don't have big boobs either), the sleeves are extremely short... more like 3/4 sleeves, and the overall fit is awkward and unattractive. Also, the fabric almost feels like burlap. Very rough and very thin. This is an awful shirt. The picture must be of the sweater on a short 5 year old."
1.0,Runs very large. The medium is more like an XL.  But super cute.
1.0,It was way to small. I ended up returning it
1.0,"Chain looked terrible when arrived,  sent back immediately.  Quality not good for the money."
1.0,"While they are very pretty, the clasp on one of the earrings broke within a couple of hours. SO bummed!"
1.0,Ok first I want to say ...I loved them wen I got them... but  my grandson only put them on  occasional only when he comes to visit me maybe once a week And then suddenly  they were all ripped from the front how did that happen I don’t know I haven’t had them  that long ...that was the only problem
1.0,Stitches pulling apart during first wear. Very disappointed in the quality of threads used to sew this.
1.0,Dress was too big and colour didn't look like what we saw on line. Wanted to send  it back but I was told to pay for shipping returns. So I had to give the dress to my friends daughter.
1.0,Too small and poor quality.  The applicator fell apart on the first use.
1.0,Ordered in the beginning of September...still not here yet. Seller does not respond to emails.
1.0,"The dress was expected to be free flowing knee length but it was not when arrived it was straight,Body fit and hung past foot to ground... 😔"
1.0,"Well, I have my doubts that these are 14k, as my ears became irritated right away. Also, the screw backings are so small , they are hard to put on. Taking them off is nearly impossible! My husband had to use needle nose pliers to get them off!  In the process, we lost one backing and I threw away the other. So much for being able to send them back."
1.0,But color fades when washed
1.0,"This is not a “knee-length women’s robe.”  I am less than 5’ tall, and I wear a small in everything I buy.  I couldn’t even get both arms into it. And it didn’t cover my butt. This was seriously child-sized."
1.0,This watch band was so poorly constructed. I waisted my money. It fell apart the first week I was wearing it.
1.0,"They're not the shinny blue that's in the picture. I'm honestly upset because I wanted shinny blue, not a dull grey. Not to mention these plugs are really heavy to the point they'll stretch your ears to a bigger size. Be careful wearing these"
1.0,Within a day of putting this dress on the elastic on the dress started unraveling. The dress was poorly made.
1.0,Absolutely terrible. Horrible quality
1.0,"Horrible. Cheaply made. Size for kid not adult, if I had used this purse it would most likely fall apart before making it to my car! 😬🙃😢😣 I was so excited from reading the other reviews, though nope this purse sucks! It's cute for a photo shoot where you have nothing in it and even then it would break. Stitching is all lose and not uniform. Horrible ! Don't waste your time!"
1.0,2 of the 5 rings broke that night.
1.0,Horrible quality. So thin it’s basically transparent. Nothing at all what I expected. Do not order. They didn’t even send me the right color I ordered. Avoid.
1.0,To short. I had to return the item.
1.0,Not what I expected. I ordered the dark blue one and it is not sweatshirt material ..the picture fooled me.. it’s more of a bathing suit material.  I’m bummed was really excited for this but I’m thinking I may need to send it back. Not worth the price.
1.0,I bought these in April and the strap broke off yesterday-very disappointed in this for the price I paid. Can I get them exchanged?
1.0,Muy bonitos pero las tallas muy pequeñas
1.0,This product sucks
1.0,the dress is to long and looks like you should be going to church in it
1.0,Shirt was TOO SMALL and I even ordered a size bigger. The print is blurry and looks poorly done like almost airsprayed on. Shipping took FOREVER. ALL AROUND BAD PURCHASE I SUGGEST LOOKING ELSEWHERE.
1.0,I strongly dislike these earrings. They are cheaply made. They come out easily. They are starting to turn copper.
1.0,"I bought one for myself and my mother in law , we both had the same conclusion…<br />This does not fit nicely and the lace shows through<br />t-shirts<br />They do not provide a good return policy"
1.0,It was very big..
1.0,Broke before I ever got to wear them!
1.0,I did not like the material or fit. Color was too bright as well.
1.0,The product itself is fine.  This came to me in two different deliveries and was late on top of that.
1.0,Horrible quality
1.0,"I really wanted to like this bag, but the long strap broke the very first time I used it! :("
1.0,Cheap. Thin. Odd cut. Slippery shiny material on sleeves.
1.0,Fits loose in frame falls out very easily
1.0,Used this on my sterling jewelry and actually made my lightly tarnished pieces worse! I’ve used many jewelry cleaners and have never used a product like this that worsened the jewelry’s condition.
1.0,"I ordered 3 pairs of these last week in XXL. I tried them on after they arrived and they were way too big. I returned those 3 pairs and immediately placed an order for 3 pairs in XL. Those arrived today. After unwrapping them I noticed that the black pair were way out of proportion to the other 2 pairs, yet all 3 pairs are labeled XL. I decided to keep the 2 pairs that fit and return the one that is too large. Sometimes I get worried that Amazon will think I return stuff too often but if it doesn't fit properly I have to return it."
1.0,"Description says 50/50 cotton/polyester but tag says 90% cotton, 10% polyester. Did not come with any tags on it, which makes me suspicious of authenticity, or if it was previously returned. Neck was a little out of shape. Material rather thin, but some may prefer that. Size Small was very small, even by Junior standards. Returning."
1.0,"This is nothing like the picture. For starters it isn’t what most people would consider a “sweatshirt”, it isn’t even sweatshirt material. It’s super thin and runs incredibly small. Save your money and the time it will take you to return it. It’s a piece of crap."
1.0,"Was gonna use it for a party, the v neck was way to low and did not feel comfortable with it on,"
1.0,The keeper loop on the tie came ripped in half.
1.0,The swimsuit looks as pictured but it is incredibly short. I already have a short torso so I expected it would fit...but it doesn't. Not even a little bit...not even at all. unfortunately I went out of town after I decided to return this and missed the return window...so now I'm stuck with it and will never wear it..Guess it will get donated.
1.0,The crotch is longer than the rest of the pant and just looks wrong
1.0,Very small I thought it would be larger.
1.0,"I was so excited to wear this dress to a wedding, until it arrived. The print looked completely different than what the model was wearing. It had these weird, blob flowers that were blown out and not shown in any of the listing photos. It made me hate the dress. The fit was also terrible, it was HUGE on me! I am 5'2, 110 lbs, a 34C and I ordered a Small. I adjusted the straps as tight as they would go and the chest area still had giant gaps on both sides. There's no way I could move without being exposed. I had to return it and am very disappointed."
1.0,They were absolutely horrible they fogged up before I even got up the mountain I would not recommend them to anybody and I already bought a new pair
1.0,I ordered twice in blue color both time it came defective. I will not recommend it to buy because they are selling used one
1.0,Extremely cheap fabric. Not worth the money or the hassle of trying to return it and then only offer to receive half your money back. Just spend the couple extra bucks and get a nicer brand!! I wish I never bought these.
1.0,"Wore the gloves once, worked great. Put away for season, went to use this year, batteries will not hold a charge. Waste of money!!"
1.0,Looks like a nice case but there is such a strong odor coming from it that I won't use it
1.0,"This is terrible quality.  Hole in fabric, way too big, open seams.  Do not purchase from this company."
1.0,"Incredibly thin material, surprised that didn't show up in the reviews. Had hoped it was work appropriate , realize upon receiving that would need to be layered."
1.0,The gold color faded fast and have already lost two of the Zarconian.
1.0,This product is a piece of garbage I would never purchase again
1.0,The chain was really cheap<br />Not a good product.<br />Would be bettter if the chain was better. Until then I rate poorly.
1.0,"This apron had holes in it !  Very poor quality, not as described"
1.0,Zipper broke after only a couple of months.
1.0,"I give 1 star simply because the ring itself looked nice and sturdy. ITS NOT THE RIGHT DATE! BTS debuted 2013-6-13, they don't show the full ring in the picture because they put the 12th not 13th. Its wrong."
1.0,They were only 6 inches  too long 50 inches long wow.  No way not going to waste time to get a belt 6 inches too small
1.0,This is made for really small people.... Their L and XL sizing is nowhere near normal L and XL measurements :/ I have a 36 bust and even the 3XL would be too small... VERY disappointing! :(
1.0,"Very poor quality for its price, faded thin, & loose will not recommend buying this product to anyone"
1.0,These are fake do not buy. These do not have glass lenses.
1.0,This is the ugliest thing I have ever put on. Please do not buy! The material is like plastic (why do people use this type of material to make clothing?!)<br />and it looks way different in real life. Knock off version of a famous brand. Don't buy!
1.0,"It was made of an awful scratchy material, would never be comfortable wearing that for any amount of time"
1.0,"I ordered the brown gloves with 100% cashmere lining (as the pictures clearly show) from Warmen Gloves and received a pair with a 70/30 wool/nylon blend. The gloves feel nice, but their marketing is definitely misleading. Using my phone with the gloves was very difficult as well.<br /><br />Warmen Gloves was quick to respond to questions, but repeatedly dodged my inquiry on whether or not the &quot;cashmere&quot; lining is actually just a wool blend.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I threw away the packaging before looking at the tag, so it seems I'm stuck with them."
1.0,Bottoms fit great. The top was made for a ten year old. Had to return.
1.0,The fabric is cheap they length was not as expected
1.0,I washed this bandana and all the color washed out<br />Now its faded tan with some blotchy color
1.0,I just recieved my purse and iam very disappointed when i opened it up inisde I found a used pen and some cold medicine pills like someone had been using it and the whole inside was torn out it....someone must of returned it and the buyer didnt even to bother to look at it and just send it to someone else I just couldnt believe itmmm
1.0,didnt last a month
1.0,They look very cheap in person and it took a week to receive item which isn’t returnable. Very small earrings.
1.0,"I got my cap today and the first thing i noticed as soon as the wrapping came off was that the R is peeling off, the Beretta logo seems to be slanted to the the left, the words beretta are unevenly spaced out. And the print......just looks cheap. Definitely not worth $21.50"
1.0,Way smaller than expected order 2 sizes up
1.0,They were broken upon arrival
1.0,"Tried for 15 minutes, in half a dozen well lit locations.. Would always bounce back and forth between ""Move into frame"" and ""match the outline"". I'm 6'4"", so maybe it has an issue with extreme ends of the measurements?? Either way, if it can't complete the algorithm, or you don't want to/can't use the imaging feature, there should be a way to enter in your measurements manually."
1.0,Both straps broke after one day.  Tried to tighten with the &#34;wire&#34; straps (plastic)...they broke. And they don't do returns. Looks like I'll make a pretty necklace. Shame.
1.0,"The silkscreening was horrible - it looks like they ran out of ink - you can't even read the word ""Woodstock"""
1.0,Watch broke as soon as I took it off the cardboard.  Very disappointing
1.0,Looks good but the first time I took it off the strands started to come undone. Sorry
1.0,"In the world of cheap imported junk , this is even cheaper and junkier."
1.0,The smell is awful… even after several washes.. it’s like a deep heavy smokers home smell… even putting  perfume on when it’s on doesn’t help…
1.0,"Overall a nice lightweight watch.  The digital numbers are missing some light sections within numerals when lit.  Adjusting the band is pretty simple, the pins connecting band sections only go in one way.  Youtube has plenty of videos showing how to do it, 5 minutes tops.  At bobo bird site these sell for $100+ so obviously I got a return/blem for $30.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/19/2019 - Seller offered a new watch to replace defective one - new one works fine - all numbers look great.  Great customer service!!!<br /><br />Update: POS - Doesn't work well, no instructions, threw it away."
1.0,Shoes are way too small. The 9 that I ordered fits exactly like an 8. Debating on requesting a return.
1.0,These are junk and huge. I want my money back.
1.0,junk too small bought 2 sizes bigger than my size 5 foot so I might wear sock. could not ge table foot in slipper.<br />disaster..
1.0,Within a few days this just broke right off my sons wrist. I couldn’t get a replacement because one of the pieces that broke off was lost on the ground so we couldn’t return it. Waste of my money sadly
1.0,I accidently reviewed the wrong item. DO NO POST THIS REVIEW!!!
1.0,The chain is so cheap that half of them broken while putting keys on them for the first time. Buyer beware.
1.0,I purchased these shoes for my two year old daughter on June 14th 2020 and they are already broken after 5 weeks later.  The quality sucks. I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,they fit fine but the holes are not open so i can’t button them anywhere. the buckles are not on the straps. kind of ridiculous.
1.0,Size runs way small
1.0,The wrist band feels and looks great. But the color is fading and it’s been less then a week that I’ve worn it. Already looks ugly. I Got the color black.
1.0,purchased the necklace and when i got it it had a price tag for $10 less than i paid. gave it to my ex because they're both trash
1.0,Where’s the back pocket? Men don’t buy or design pants without a back pocket. Just sayin’
1.0,Order a size to big they run small
1.0,"Tiene poca calidad , la tela no tiene que ver con la foto"
1.0,"I ordered the PVC coating more than the latex , instead I got I got a latex flimsy mask. Do not order either one cost more than the other and you end up with the same flimsy latex"
1.0,"The dress material is like cheap Halloween costume material, and it was very see through. Also, I ordered and XL (I'm usually L/XL), but it was way too small, seemed more like a medium."
1.0,"Bought this for a particular event, but never got to wear it as the zipper completely fell of the first time I tried to zip it up.  Too late to return it, now it's just junk sitting in the corner of my closet."
1.0,material very thin already had a small hole in crotch after only a few weeks. would not recommend or purchase again.
1.0,It looks like dirty cloth
1.0,Finally wear it for the first time and there's already a hole in the back. Very disappointed knowing that I love the material and everything else.
1.0,Dress does not look or fit as pictured on the website.  A potato sack would fit better.  Turned it into a house dress - not suitable for outside at all.
1.0,"They’re great, fit my head well (which is a normal to large woman head), however two were damaged on arrival. All had fingerprints, and required cleaning, which was odd. My clear pair and grey/purple pair have defects or spots to the coating and/or slight scratching. Returning and will rate again when I receive a good batch."
1.0,Horrible. The coils I received are nowhere near as big or thick as the ones in all of the pictures. They're tiny and even after stretching them out they're still smaller than the metal ring itself which makes them pretty much useless. DO NOT BUY THESE.
1.0,This item does not work
1.0,"Too small, looks and feels cheap and scratchy!"
1.0,These gloves don’t warm my hands very much unless it is only slightly cold outside (around 60 F) which at that point defeats the purpose of these gloves as I got them for when it gets much colder than this. I do not recommend them not in the slightest. As well as them being a bit uncomfortable to wear as they seem to be too big for my hands despite this size normally being just fine.
1.0,"It had a nice look, but urn was too tiny to put ashes in."
1.0,"Not very functional for holding cards.<br />It is too short to easily place a bank card or standard ID card in.<br />It might be okay for a single key .<br />If really stretch it, you can wedge a card in sideways. Then extracting the card is some major work"
1.0,awkward fit.  poor quality
1.0,Order 4x larger. Disappointment
1.0,These pretty much SUCK - you cannot adjust them without taking them off and on to get it the right length - need to be able to pull it tight while around the suitcase and you can't - you have to take it off and readjust over and over. Used them because it is too late- will throw them in the trash when I return because they are GARBAGE.
1.0,I don't know why these don't fit.  The exact same size as all the others I own. So disappointed. Also took way too long to receive. Very disappointed.
1.0,No jewel was sitting correctly in the ring.
1.0,"Dislike, not at all what I ordered. Too short on my 2 year to wear, not a dress at all. Maybe a short shirt without sleeves. Now I have to order another costume & hope it gets here before Halloween."
1.0,These do not work with glasses. The metal band at the top is too short and allows air to escape out of the top which easily fogs up glasses. Im sure they are fine if you dont mind your breath blowing in your eyes and dont wear glasses
1.0,"I have a 31 inch waist and it was too big on the tightest closure. It’s too stretchy, doesn’t flatten stomach or support back/posture, not worth the money. Returning and buying a different brand with more boning."
1.0,"Not like in the picture, I kept them because I did not want to go through the hassle of sending them back. They do not have the red stripe on the side and that is what I liked most about them."
1.0,I’m not happy with this purchase at all. It was supposed to have inside zippers and didn’t or I would have never purchased it:( the inside is poorly made also.
1.0,"The description says it comes with Two shirts and a tie, but this is definitely only one. Thought I found a deal..."
1.0,The &#34;pearl&#34; looks like half a sphere. Like one was cut down the middle. It looks and feels fake and cheap.<br />Mine also had a scratch which must have happened when the loose earrings rubbed against each other in the ziplock it came in.<br />The best looking part is the cloth bag it comes with.<br />Site crashed every time I tried to upload a pic of it.
1.0,Product cheaply made!
1.0,"Pretty dress, but the sizing is WAY off! The 2x was more like a medium. Also the white dress, is actually ivory, not white. Extremely disappointed as I needed this dress for this Sunday and now I have to find something else to wear. I will be returning it ASAP!"
1.0,Bad quality..smell yuck
1.0,Returned it sizes are not right
1.0,I’m not sure what was up with this but I couldn’t fit my head into the shirt. Definitely sending it back.
1.0,"Purchased two pairs of these and both have had blown seams within two uses. Very comfy just not durable. Got a replacement pair for the first pair but won’t bother getting another. Cheap product that doesn’t last, unfortunately."
1.0,Did not fit my foot well and had to return them.
1.0,my watch keeps great time and looks fantastic but despite me wearing it even at night it will stop keeping time eventually.  if I manually wind it it works fine but unfortunately it's advertised as an automatic and it's not working as it should as such this clearly falls in to the poor product realm.
1.0,Shrank after washing...so disappointed.  Hung to dry ...so disappointed.
1.0,stones missing
1.0,Doesn't look anything like the picture. Very lightly colored. Hard to see even what it is.
1.0,there was a hole in the crutch
1.0,Was expecting a pack of three but only received one. Definitely not worth the money. The mask itself also strongly smells like plastic due to the packaging. Not something you want your kid breathing in.
1.0,Will take a month and a half to arrive.  Ridiculous.
1.0,Would have been lovely if the mirrored rounds in the center didn't have glue residue on them.
1.0,I don’t know what material this is but it  does not respond well to my iron and I can’t seem to get all of the wrinkles out. Update: took it to the cleaners and they couldn’t get the wrinkle out either.
1.0,It costs a lot. I bought it for the “shock” to wake me up in the early hours for work but the shock was mediocre. I ended up sending it back.
1.0,I ordered this dress in olive size xs. I was very disappointed when it came. It doesn't look olive green at all. Looks more like a charcoal gray. It is also too big. I am 5'2 and 100 lbs and the xs small is too big
1.0,"Beautifully earrings, on one side... the back is a flat plate so when I put them on the back plate was visible. Too bad :("
1.0,Cute watch but super cheap! Came with broken stem not worth trouble to send back:(
1.0,"This sweater was really disappointing. If you compare the first and second photo shown on models, you can tell they look very different. The main photo of this sweater is way higher quality and longer. The actual sweater is relatively soft and thick material, but it’s not the quality shown and is way shorter. It’s short enough that even in high waisted pants, you will be showing stomach (I’m 5’6” for reference). I am not a crop top person, so this is an absolute no go for me. The name of the item calls it “scuba”, but that is also not true, it’s just regular old cotton."
1.0,The black in the writing came out within a week of wearing it
1.0,The pants ripped from crotch to waist the first time I used them
1.0,"It stunk up my house for days and even if I was willing to wait months for it to stop stinking, it just didn't look like the images. It looked like a 4yr old painted it."
1.0,This bracelet was cute in theory but in reality it's not comfortable to wear because of the way you have to attach it. It's pain.
1.0,HUGE. not good quality either. returned
1.0,"The tube is only 1/2 inch long, allowing the pin to slide around and flip. The dimensions listed are for the package, not the pin itself. I though I was buying a longer tube for a large pin."
1.0,I wanted for a 6 years old girl and this is for a three 👎🏻
1.0,My kid likes these BUT....Took forever to get these and I do not expect them to last a week at the pool. Not for active young feet
1.0,Definitely not real leather. The one I received didn't even have the genuine leather stamp on it. It seems they gave up on the sham. The sides and seams are clearly heat sealed and the plastic shows in several parts. Very cheap looking and the material is so stiff that it you can barely put the band through the loops on the other side. It is falling apart after a day of wear and I anticipate needing a new one within a month.
1.0,Wanted to like this shoe as it was water proof but my kids are complaining of heaviness and pain I feet post use. Looking forward something new now
1.0,"They fell apart at the soles ,, less than 30 days old"
1.0,"have bought a lot of piecing jewelry off amazon, would buy again except from here. jewels were out of settings, they are to small to try to replace. some didn't even have the top screw on jewel part and they were not in the sack. Very, very, disappointed."
1.0,Very big than it just snapped and heads went everywhere. Crap
1.0,It’s suoer long. I️ do t like it at all and would like to return it
1.0,I purchased this item in a 3x after reading about it. Not ture tp size. The dress made me look like i was 6 months pregnant and it was like i had to sleeves to cover my breast. Now if i worked that kind of life style it would have been perfect. But i dont want any and everyone seeing my goodies. Including my cookie and toot. The skirt underneath was so short it didn't cover up only the chiffon.
1.0,Well after a week or two of wearing the jewelry the stone in the middle fell out of every one.
1.0,Very cheaply madr
1.0,"They do not look as good as their photos. Cheap, very small, way overpriced."
1.0,"Cheap quality. I bought this for a Medusa halloween costume. After 10 minutes of wearing it, the screw holding it together fell out, and the necklace was in two pieces and irreparable. I managed to use a safety pin to hold it together long enough for some photos, but it didn't look great."
1.0,Two-week shipping and it is complete garbage. Seems like a crappy dollar store find. I did put in batteries only to have blue smoke come from it as soon as I turned it on. Pure trash.
1.0,I gave a star because I can't posted this review without 1 star. I returned it.
1.0,"With very light use, these sandals fell apart in about 2 months. Basically only worn on weekends and once a week for sprinkler time at daycare. Do not recommend."
1.0,This &#34;bra&#34; is ridiculously tiny. It looks like it's made for a five year old. Going back ASAP!!
1.0,The shape of this thing is just nuts. The arm holes go way down to mid abdomen and the sleeves are very short even for me and I’m 5’2”! The neck just doesn’t sit right either. Very uncomfortable to wear and doesn’t look good either.
1.0,The shirt as smaller than expected. Son was only really able to wear it once
1.0,"Way too small, gave them to the Thrift store"
1.0,"La camisa no es como la de la fotografía, no tiene la bolsa y tampoco trae el logo de Mercedes cero recomendada"
1.0,Just doesn't fit right
1.0,It looks different than the photo. It is much smaller and feather was detached when it arrived. I am returning this.
1.0,Don't buy this material is really poor
1.0,Fabric looks like a black plastic garbage bag - these photos are not accurate. I have reached out to the seller Top 10 Sports and they are &#34;reviewing&#34; my refund request. I will keep you posted on what happens.
1.0,"Seems that the quality on the stitching is not good.<br />I purchased a size larger than normal and they fit, bit after 3 or 4 warings the seems were coming apart on the inside.<br />Great colors, but you need to be able to wear them twice a month or more without them falling apart."
1.0,"Runs huge, and is not a rayon or cotton blend as the description states.  It is a shiny bathing suit type material.  Flowers are not embroidered, they are printed.  Returning."
1.0,Mine look absolutely nothing like the picture. Very disappointed.
1.0,"European panties, Way too small. Top is nice but I have to return the whole outfit as the bottom doesn't fit properly.Bummer!"
1.0,"This must be made for a very petite person. I'm 5'9"" (normal length torso) and the waist hit under my bust, at the widest part of my ribcage. It looked ridiculous on me. Returning."
1.0,"Purse fell apart within the first hour I carried it. First chain broke then when I buttoned it, the fabric ripped. Terrible!"
1.0,"I’m so pissed off, I have 2 other pairs of these I bought last year, they were great, so I order another pair, and they changed the material! It’s cheap and thin. So disappointing"
1.0,its looking good on the model but in real it was too huge on me...maybe two size smaller then what you wear. Texture wise its stretchable and good material...
1.0,"After washing it for the first time following the directions in the tag, the t-shirts SHRUNK to at least one size."
1.0,"Huge bummer as this broke immediately upon taking it out of the package.  Maybe I got a bad one or maybe they're all like that, but I'm not going to buy another to find out."
1.0,"My wife got me this for Christmas.  She bought it and a month from purchase, I was excited to use it.  The screen and interface is simple and you get the hang of the rotation of the wrist quickly.  However, when I went to use it on a cloudy day, I couldn't ready the screen.  Cupping my hands around it, I was just able to make out that it was on, but not well enough to see what screen it was on, let alone get it to start recording.  I did a swim with it and afterwards noticed it did record some data.  However, it was so difficult to use in an outdoor situation that I wanted to return it as I swim outdoors.  If it doesn't work on a cloudy January day, it won't work in the summer etc.<br /><br />The support department refused to take it back as they only have a 14 day return policy.  I advise steer very clear of this product and company!!  They do not support their product or customers!"
1.0,Stopped working after 3 days
1.0,"Worst purchase ever. Like a box, itchy and very unflattering. Ugh!!"
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:fa3bbcff2a71c2ee32678a692599a1bf]] They advertise the NH35A but you get the Miyota movement that does not hack, only 21 jewels,  winds in one direction, and has a second-hand that stutters ( slows and speeds up) as it counts the minute. The Miyota movement is an outdated piece of junk. You can see the second-hand stutter in the video between 20-25 second mark.<br />The sad thing is that they advertise the Seiko NH35A but you will never get it.<br />The NH35A hacks, winds in both directions, 24 jewels, DOES NOT stutter, smooth 6 beats per second second-hand movement."
1.0,Not impressed. Very cheap and not worth the money.
1.0,The size was not comparable to other clothing items of the same size. It ran VERY small.
1.0,I’m so sad that this shirt did not look at all like I expected. The tank was much shorter than the one pictured and the sleeve area was cut so wide and awkwardly that I just could not wear it. It fit somewhat small despite going by the measurements in the pictures. Definitely not a good buy and that makes me so sad.
1.0,"The inner lining has frayed, interfering with the withdrawal of the I.D., Embarrassing when in public."
1.0,Theses were very cheap quality.  The frames were very flimsy.  Z
1.0,First day my youngest wore hers a button fell off. Then my oldest got hers a few days later and one of the straps that hold the button already broke also first day. I do not recommend these boots. Yes price is right but as the saying goes by cheap receive cheap. Will have to order new boots for both girls again!! 😒
1.0,Would give 0 stars if I could. XXL is a 32 waist? HAH. Okay. Vanity sizing much? Remind me never ever to buy from this brand.
1.0,its for kids
1.0,Washed one time on delicate cycle with my other compression shirts and the threading came unraveled. Very poor quality.
1.0,"It's not good quality. Very thin material. It was not made in the US, contrary to what the ad says. Overpriced , made with cheap material<br />Also the ad said 100% cotton, but it's not. Very cheap quality"
1.0,Ordered as a bridesmaid dress. The dress I received didn't match the other dresses. Completely different material. The sizing is WAY off. Not sure if alterations would help. Wanted to send back but I refuse to pay double what I paid for dress. Its awful. I highly doubt I can sell on a different site.
1.0,It’s such a cute romper! But it’s just too small. Thought it would work since I got the largest size (which is bigger than my “usual” size). Still didn’t fit :(
1.0,Not a good fabric very thin
1.0,Not anything like picture
1.0,"Terrible! Finally got a chance to wear this. The necklace and bracelet kept falling off because of the clamp. If I could,  I would return it. But it's too late."
1.0,"Do not look anything like photo, crap quality"
1.0,"Was excited to find wooden sunglasses that looked good quality, were under $20 and had some color to them. The glasses I received seemed promising at first - they came in a good, protective box and had a carrying pouch/cleaning cloth - but were really poor quality all around on closer inspection. The decorative metal pieces were glued on crooked and appeared to have been applied prior to painting. Same goes for the hinges, which were both very stiff from having green paint get all up in the working mechanisms. One hinge was so stiff I actually broke part of the hinge off trying to close the sunglasses to package up for return.....And last, the lenses looked cheap and dirty.<br /><br />TL;DR - save your time/money and put it toward a different pair of glasses."
1.0,"After only two months, it’s already broken, and no way to contact seller. Fabric also got dingy very quickly."
1.0,Fit was horrible. The dress is NOT made for bigger breasted women. One star.
1.0,This material is too thin and there is no way that it will fit anyone who is not thin.  It is so poorly designed that it cuts me across the stomach.  It is a total waste of my money.  It's going into the donation pile because it's not worth the gas to return it.
1.0,Very cheap quality they came to me broken
1.0,Watch itself worked well but had to hit the light up in order to see time. Good saving batteries but somewhat inconvenient. Band broke in first few days of using it.
1.0,"I decided to write review about New York Patek Philippe office but (could you believe?), in whole Internet I didn’t fine place where I can do it. Patek Philippe doesn’t need any comments about quality of its watches. The only place for review is this museum. I understand I don’t achieve any effect but I hope I’ll feel better after this review.<br />So, I have Patek Philippe watch already 15 years and every couple years I visit New York Patek Philippe office to change battery. A few days ago I did it again and an officer surprisingly offered me some service for $600. Before this visit the watch worked magnificently, I didn’t have any problem and I refused this service. When I left office the watch worked but next day it stopped.<br />What you think, is this coincidence? Eternal Patek Philippe watch ceased to work right after offer of expensive but unnecessary service. For me it looks like robbery."
1.0,I purchased and paid for a NEW item and was sent used shirt. The tag inside was ripped and sewed back on for re-sale. Soon as I opened the bag it smells of sweat and the neckline has make up stains. Returning immediately.
1.0,"I bought this and the cheap buckle broke within 10 days of receiving. The tiny pins that hold the buckle simply broke with very little use.<br />Although the seller was very good in replacing it quickly, the 2nd belt broke in the same way in less than 6 days. You get what you pay for."
1.0,None of these went past my knuckles and I wear a 5.5 ring on ring finger. They were useless
1.0,Weird fit.  It was baggie and bunchy in some places too tight in others
1.0,[[VIDEOID:b43b3045449bef3697864330f820316]] Definitely is not a dress  The neck is cut to small to drape. And for large busted women it doesn't hang well.
1.0,not the same pants as shown in the picture.
1.0,"so gorgeous, but not enough material to cover my boobs at all!"
1.0,36”was more skin to a 32 - not even close
1.0,Disappointed look cheap in person. Poorly made
1.0,This thing is so gawdy.  It's a lot bigger than expected.
1.0,Will not accept a standard chain or cord - hole is waaaaay too small.
1.0,"We bought this set because we travel often.  We used the smaller pieces several times over the past few months without issue.  However, the first time we used the largest piece the handle broke and a wheel broke as well.  I have never been more disappointed in a piece of luggage in my life.  For what we paid it should have lasted more than a one time use."
1.0,"I own a toy store and around Halloween 2008 we had almost everyone who bought the wig come back and try to return them, we do not order the wigs anymore, and we found better ones from a cheaper company that we can sell for cheaper, I actually sell them in baskets filled with other Hannah Montana stuff, so you don't know right away that the wig is not official, but I put notes outside that say to avoid the offical one, since it does not work well enough"
1.0,"I bought this set for my best friend's birthday - she wears one, I wear the other.  Mine broke in half just this morning.  Can't sent the set back bc friend lives clear across the state, so I am left with my broken ring. :("
1.0,This is really awful and not what I expected from its description and pictures.  Its like a cheap horrible little kids piece of clothing.  It won't keep anyone warm and it  looks so awful on... do not waste your money!
1.0,"Bracelet wasn't the style I picked out.  The turquoise was not infused with copper, or at least you cannot see it..  It is a single complete stone(not like the picture) .<br />  I gave as a meaningful gift. So I cannot send a refund.."
1.0,Usually these come w a metal piece sewed to the end for easy set up. This didnt have that and the fabric was so thick on one side I had to cut it a bit so it would fit into the watch. The ones w metal on the ends were the same price as this one so next time I'm just getting those and not this.. it took 30 mins and I had my husband hold it while I use a spoon to help me push the pin in .  Pain in the a**!
1.0,"bought it to wear a nice gold cross I got from Italy and the third time I wore it, it broke and I couldn't send it back because the warranty which I guess was 1 month, but it had run out..Not happy about this but I continue  to order from you."
1.0,Cheap. I wore it once snd when I was taking it off it broke in half. It’s made of the cheapest metal... I don’t even know what it is.
1.0,Apron had a large rip across the front. My son was so excited to get an apron for Christmas he didn't care about the 2 inch rip and wanted to wear it right away so I couldn't exchange it. Would have been a fantastic apron otherwise.
1.0,Purchase the real Crocs. These are a vey cheap and uncomfortable shoe. Don't waste your money on these.
1.0,The photo and the necklace photo I received are two doffenet things.  The detail on the one that was delivered was not good.  Cannot tell it is a mermaid.
1.0,Looked nice but there was a hole in the shoulder. You get what you pay for.
1.0,"Horrible, best part was the color"
1.0,Beautiful plugs but the flare is too big for my ears and yes I ordered the correct size.. 00g
1.0,Eso no funciona. No pierda su tiempo
1.0,This sweatshirt look like they literally ironed on the letters. It is so cheesy looking I embarrassed to wear it. I thought it was a legit college sweatshirt. But it’s a home made iron on product. There’s no way I’m wearing this out. I’m just going to have to lounge around in it at home. I will have to go to the actual  university website next time to order a college.
1.0,"The gloves I received are literally entirely different than those pictured. They are paper thin, so much so you can see right through them. They have holes in them. They have ridiculously long fingers, like over an inch past the end of mine, and the palm part is way to small. There are no embroidered lines down the back of them like the picture shows.<br />Wish I could give 0 stars."
1.0,The title is misleading the leather is obviously synthetic. Aside from that the stitching is scratchy and the buckle pin feels flimsy and it feels like foam mixed with plastic.
1.0,Not sterling silver .925 as stated .. it turned my finger green within 2 hours of wearing
1.0,"I have had this ring since Sunday. I have worn it more often than not. But not to bathe or sleep. Today, Thursday, it has tarnished and turned my finger green. Didn't even survive 5 days.<br />Do not recommend.<br />DO NOT BUY!<br />And they deleted my review once already!"
1.0,There awful don't buy very uncomfortable and rub the skin off your feet
1.0,I wear it to school
1.0,I discovered small cracks in the band which is unfortunate because it is a nice looking with comfortable fit.
1.0,The sandals fit toe to heel perfect. The width is off because the strap is way too loose. They were sliding all around my foot when I tried to walk.<br />I am returning them.
1.0,These are not good: expensive and the Pom poms are glued on (what-the-heck) after the second wash they came off. I do not recommend 👎🏻
1.0,"Nice pcs, the string is not my style, will pass it on as a gift."
1.0,Df
1.0,"Beautiful dress, fabric had not stretch but even that would not have helped. Definitely size up! The white looks more like an yellowed pink color. Length of dress was very good though."
1.0,Don't bother.  Ugly.
1.0,The bottom was huge for me and the top was just too small (I am 32DD) for me on the top. The material is very thin and cheap looking!
1.0,It's not true to size. I wear a medium & this medium was much too tight.
1.0,Neck line is a terrible fit
1.0,"My 4 yr old liked the watch , but it did not keep accurate time."
1.0,"Came apart after one week, don't recommend, so cheap not worth returning"
1.0,I ordered a 3XL and it was actually more like a womens medium.  Too bad it's a cute shirt.
1.0,Not like typical magnetic bands. I can’t keep this one in place or on my wrist. Waste of money.
1.0,Words are printed wrong. Should say “I’m so cute even the grinch wants to steal me” instead it says “I’m so cute Ivcn the grinch wnnts to steal me”.
1.0,"The reviews were mixed, but I ordered these earrings anyway. Exactly what I wanted. The first earring fell apart when I removed it from the package. I have returned them."
1.0,If your buying it because it looks big dont get it its supper small
1.0,Product description says it is a woman’s size medium.  This is not an adult size.  It fit my child who takes a youth medium!
1.0,"Only gave it 1 star because I had to. I don't know what this is but it's no beanie. It's got holes on both sides, really more like a very tight scarf. Not at all what I thought I was ordering."
1.0,"There is a really bad reflection on the inside of the lens. I can see a clear mirror of my face and eyes, it’s super distracting and really gets in the way of my vision. Also, these are for smaller faces.<br /><br />Not only is the inside reflection bad, check out the picture.  This was during a Zoom meeting, one of my co-workers took a picture to make fun of me.  The combined reflection of the glasses and my head is similar to staring at the sun."
1.0,Broke in a day
1.0,"This is not at all as expected. It's itchy, it's thin and just don't bother with it. I had hope because of the price but that right there should've been my first red flag."
1.0,I thought that the material was more cotton and the color was more mustard. It actually is a banana yellow and it's spandex like. A waist of money if you ask me.
1.0,Did not look as good in reality. Cheap. Color off
1.0,desapointed shirt runs way to small had to return and there were no more !!!!!<br />the shirt quality was very nice and looked good. what a shame!!!!
1.0,Huelgan a húmeda
1.0,Very disappointed! I know the case was cheap but is weak cover when it said that is a shock absorber.  Not recommended!
1.0,This product is already peeling and I have had it a week.  Not worth the money
1.0,"I am furious that I can not return the two of the four (1 is another color)I bought by mistake.  It's fine if they mail them to me, but I can't return them?  How does that work??? That is so wrong!  Oh, I see now the very fine print that they are not returnable, because they are flammable, but who would think to scrutinize the ad  with such an innocuous item.  Clothes catch fire easily, paper products too,  but they don't have absurd restrictions."
1.0,These are poorly made.  The edges were jagged and had bubbled surface of one of the sets. Extremely disappointed.
1.0,Comes in small
1.0,"Don't buy this sweat shirt.  First of all,  I normally wear a size large and after careful notation of all the other reviews I got a size 2x large bc I need it for work.  I wanted something loose fitting.  Still 2x large is too small; however,  the sleeves are extra long.  I'm 5ft 9 in and I still can't wear it.  The normally do not have any problems buying clothes straight off the hanger but the cut is just not comfortable.  The material seem ok, the pocket is so shallow you can forget about putting anything in there bc it will might fall out."
1.0,clutch broke as soon as i took it out of the bag :(
1.0,They broke the arm hinge came unglued from the frame within 2 months
1.0,"Got this for my sister in law for Christmas and she loved it. However, within 2 months of her using it, the leggings ripped horribly in the washing machine!!! There is no reason leggings should be this damaged after only a few washes."
1.0,Do not purchase the dress I received was not the same as the one pictured. I received a shapeless black dress with drawstring sides and terrible material
1.0,i ordered 2 one came in broken :(
1.0,Material is the cheapest ever. The feel puts the fabric is like plastic.
1.0,"When I received these broken in the mail, I figured these things can happen and since I really liked these earrings I'll return them and get the same pair. This pic is of the replacement set I received. They were broke too. Now I have to find time to return these both . I dont have a work schedule that allows much time during the days to get  things done. I stil pm havent received any communication from the seller about either pair. Not happy"
1.0,Poor construction and horrible fit. Size representation is off. I needed to order a size 3 times as large as what I normally wear. Don't waste your money!
1.0,The product was broken when I received it.
1.0,Didn’t last long with the cheap backs
1.0,The buttons will not stay closed on this! Can't wear this without exposing myself every few minutes.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:6f93f1f5269d131f18072ac1abeea08f]] Eweeeee is all<br />I have to say, this is not cute. Nothing like photos."
1.0,"fits in the body, but way too tight around the hips and I don't have hips.  I think it should fit longer, it's also very thin."
1.0,So small you need a magnifying glass. Poor presentation and praying for the fact they were giving 3 or 4 dollars to help get water to countries that would need it. no facts just a bunch of BS to sell a product that went right through your ear it's so small. Stay away for this gift and gifts from this company.
1.0,"I was very excited to pre-order this book. Sadly, I am greatly disappointed with it. It seems that the latest book from Princess Sultana series has been used to spread political views. There were not many stories concerning the royal family. Overall, I regret purchasing this book. I wish I could get my money back."
1.0,I am very disappointed in this product I asked a question on if they were true to the size before I purchase them and I was told they were I wear a size 8 ring so I bought a size 8 they don't even go over my knuckle sending them back
1.0,"It’s september and I bout the belt in the middle of April. Made of cheap pot metal and the clasp broke. It’s not a full leather belt either, it’s leather wrapped. Get what ya pay for I guess."
1.0,i ordered this awhile back and it was way to small:( ordered a 2x and it fit like a large i was really disappointed because i really liked it
1.0,Nada cuality. Did not work
1.0,Dress is really long.
1.0,"This is nothing like the picture,  it is a Halloween costume with foam padding all over the ruffles.  Totally disappointed."
1.0,Too small not true to size.
1.0,This product looks very different in picture than the real ..the price so expensive comparing by material
1.0,Missing the string to tye up the eye holes in front of dress
1.0,I didn't like this at all. It can small and the fabric was very stiff and I comfortable. I returned it.
1.0,"Love what the bracket looked like! Was so excited to get to wear it for Xmas eve for the first time. I knew I was going to throw my hair up later that night. ... within the first hour i found the binder wasnt staying on the braclet so I had to push it up my arm to get it &#34;tighter&#34;.<br />I'm so sad, I got home later that evening and realized it was gone! It fell off! I was devastated. I have not been able to locate it. :-) I was interested in buying 2 more for by bff's but I don't want it to happen to them. Not sure I'll buy again."
1.0,Smells very bad.  Strong odor.  It’s unfortunate because it is very cute.
1.0,"I am returning this as the quality of the fabric is poor. It is very shiny and looks cheap...almost like cheap swimsuit fabric. Pattern is as pictured, but the cheap fabric ruins the dress."
1.0,Couldn’t even get these past my hips due to the literally 3 inch zipper?? Size fits small once you wiggle your way into them. I bought both 10 ( my size) and 12 one size up. Returned both.
1.0,A star broke off from this earring during the first wearing. Cheaply made not worth the money.
1.0,Fell apart within 2 months.
1.0,It has a hole on the pant.
1.0,Turned my finger green not even 30 minutes after wearing it.
1.0,Would never order again.
1.0,I ordered several apirs of lounge pants due to losing 40 pounds! This is a KNOCK OFF Company! While 1 pair fit perfect... the 2nd pair was 2 sizes too SMALL?????  GGRRRRRRR. NOT HAPPY!  Will NOT order from this company again ever!
1.0,"These things smell absolutely horrible. No idea what kind of chemicals these things are treated with, but they smell absolutely wretched…like a combination of fertilizer and sweaty gym socks."
1.0,-It came with scratches on both lenses.<br />-The frame is cheaply made with bad materials when comparing to similar item sell by others vendors.
1.0,Sized extremely small and tee is very thin and made of inferior material.
1.0,"The soles on my old boots had worn through, and since I walk a couple miles each day to get to and from work I needed a new pair right away. I figured that since I had more pressing expenses at the moment I could pick these up on the cheap, and they'd tide me over for three months, by which time my other matters would have been settled and I'd have saved up enough to buy a quality pair of leather boots that would last much longer.<br /><br />Well, after one week and perhaps 10-15 miles of wear, the soles have begun separating from both boots. These things won't last me a month, let alone three. If you just need some stylish, thick-soled slippers to cover your feet while sitting on your rear, these are probably fine. If you need something that will actually carry you reliably and comfortably to where you need to go, don't bother with them. These things are barely fit to be called &#34;boots.&#34;"
1.0,Second time my son wore it to school the elastic broke and he had to wear mask from school that was very loose. Very poor quality
1.0,The stripe part is much longer than the picture shows. Came down to almost my belly button and the dress stopped 8 inches shy of the floor. It was almost a 50/50 ratio stripe/black skirt.
1.0,Quality is not good and arrived wet????
1.0,I received the watch winder 3 days ago and today one of the watch holders broke off....needless to say I will not be purchasing this winder again and thankfully I am still within my return timeframe.
1.0,No manda el product comprado
1.0,"The word momma is so small you have to zoom the camera to see it. Had I known that I would have not purchased this ring. It's very small. Does not look like the picture the seller provides at all. The gems are tiny. I opted for the sterling silver, and it was a waste of money. I'd give zero stars if possible. Contacting Amazon to return."
1.0,This jacket is not real leather! Rip off and the part where it’s suppose to be shearling on the collar looks like old carpet! Don’t waste your money. I ordered a 3X to make sure I could wear my oversized sweaters with this jacket. Of course it’s too small! Why because it’s from another country where the US sizes don’t match theres! It took foreve to get here.
1.0,Thin and flimsy.  Horrible quality
1.0,"Not only very small size, there are too many small buttons down the center. So disappointing...would have been great for my forthcoming cruise.<br />Will have to return it.."
1.0,"This purse has zippered areas, so everything can have a place, without adding bulk or weight. Unfortunately, when I put it to use, the top main zipper gave up and I had to revise my initial rating."
1.0,"Assuming price is low because of quality, tarnished, lost one of them first day would not stay on ear.  While I can appreciate free items, they also very thin quality, received two hearts, not sure what they are for."
1.0,I was surprised at the poor quality of this item. I just returned it.
1.0,The sleeves were too long and didn't like the material. Thought it would be thicker.
1.0,"Ordered a dress, I received a pair of poke-a-dot pants no quality control at all!!"
1.0,Kinda pissed me off to see all the beautiful Black Lives Matter and African American representation then to have the blue lives matter to mess it all up smh I’ll be getting a refund.
1.0,HORRIBLY MADE! Took the wings out and the feathers were coming off. It looked SO cheap. The wings at Party City were priced cheaper than these and way better quality. Super disappointing!!!
1.0,Both earrings arrived completely broken. I’m going to try and glue them before I send them back.
1.0,Pins are garbage. Band does not stay attached at all and I'm not willing to lose my device because of a trash product. I HATE wating my money.
1.0,The worst don't buy if you are a bit plus sized.
1.0,I will be returning it. Part of it is tarnished and doesn't appear to be sterling.
1.0,Very dissatisfied and disappointed. It broke while trying to put it on for the first time. Would not advise buying.
1.0,Very flimsy they do look nice but you get what you pay for
1.0,"I ordered this shirt in another color a size up and I was swimming in it. So I ordered my actual size and when this arrived it looked kind of funny. The hem was so crooked, and it was somehow boxy. It was tight and hung funny. The color is nice, but that’s about it."
1.0,"This design is ok, but the fabric is so thin and cheap...like a  Halloween costume.  I missed the return window but I would never wear this dress"
1.0,Tried to adjust it and it came apart and I cannot get back together.  Very sad.  I was happy for about 30 minutes.
1.0,"thought the charm and the idea was cute, but it has already turned a brass color."
1.0,This was the most uncomfortable neck rest I went to Spain my neck hurt so bad I had to get it off my neck do not waste your money does not fit over your head either DONOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
1.0,"After wearing one of these for 2 hours it broke in half. I'm a little disappointed in the quality, but you do get what you pay for on Amazon. I would not suggest buying of needing these long than one night."
1.0,Size not even close if you need a large you better order a 2x
1.0,I was so excited for these…but they are already turning green and I haven’t even taken them out of the package
1.0,"Didnt come as expected. There are no flaps to cover child's ear, also the angle in which the velcro straps go around the back of child's head are odd shaped and oddly positioned.. if your looking for this for your child, please keep looking"
1.0,Awful quality. Broke within 2 hours
1.0,"Cheap cheap cheap!!! Within two weeks if wearing this ring, a stone fell out. It was past my eligible date for returning so now I am stuck with it. So disappointing."
1.0,"Poorly made, very flimsy and the material is light and doesn't hold its shape... Wouldnt recommend."
1.0,These slip pants appear to have been sewn by failures in a sewing class. The fabric is like the hard satin bridesmaid dresses were made from back in the late 60's/ early 70's! I've washed them in fabric softener twice. I won't be wearing them; I wouldn't even make doll clothes from them. Disappointed.
1.0,Terrible - each one ripped up the side as I inserted the earring posts.
1.0,"The flower beads tarnished after 1 week, left tarnish stains on my ear, and irritated my very sensitive ears."
1.0,"Not very happy with product , looks very cheap"
1.0,"This is fine as a toy, or for small noses. But not comfortable, and wouldn't buy again."
1.0,Would be a great bikini however you can see the circle padding on the top and looks so awkward 😒 if you order I would recommend getting a dark color since I ordered the brown/mustard one.
1.0,"The padding in the chest area was the thickest I’ve ever dealt with, the problem is the thickness was all over and wasn’t formed to be complimentary for anybody…."
1.0,"I ordered 5 UV protection shirts because I want to protect my skin from the Florida sun.  Well, I tried on a green one and it was impossible to put it on, but I did.  If I was 10 years old, it may fit, but I am a senior citizen, with good muscle group.  I know I ordered large, but given my dismay the 5 shirts, I want a refund of my expenditure, or all new shirts of the same colors and in size XXLarge.  I hope the vendor can do the right thing, as either new XXL shirts or, best, just refund my payment and I will ship the shirts to the vendor if they give me the proper address, etc.  Robert Simpson"
1.0,The material is a bit still and itchy. I was really hoping it would be comfortable. It also bunches up in the back.
1.0,Too small. See through.
1.0,I was excited about the price of these scarves and to get to wear them but sadly I have never received these scarves and I ordered them over a month ago! Very disappointed!
1.0,These are awful quality. The heart wasn't even punched though all the way. They are also very small for my fingers and I don't have large fingers.
1.0,Bought a xxl and it may be a kids size large .. super tiny and I who normally wear a large cannot wear this because it is way too small. Buyer beware
1.0,"Not what I expected and definitely not worth $15.45.<br />The charms are small compared to similar styles, I'm lucky the person I bought it for has a very small wrist or they would look tiny. The length of the bracelet is fine, it just the size of the charms themselves. The clasps do not close well so I have to replace them or the bracelet will probably fall off. I personally have (and have seen) similar style bracelets of much better quality for half the price."
1.0,"Not well made, ring clasp broke upon first wear"
1.0,I only keep these b/c they do the job....each slipper came w/what looks like a huge cigar hole in each side buy its not that noticeable<br /> I do not recommend
1.0,This item is child sized. They never mention this is not for a full sized adult. I'll try to sell this and another to someone in my apartment complex for a dollar to recoup a miniscule part of my investment. Do not buy from this company unless you are bringing your child up as gothic.
1.0,"Very wide but the large isn't tall enough . They are nice for the price  ,but expected them to fit over my glasses which they did not.😖"
1.0,"This is not a steel boned corset. It's pretty, but poor quality all the way around. The zipper sticks, the plastic boning is very flimsy, and the faux leather is very thin."
1.0,I got a black pair of pants but it was completely different than the pictures. The inner material is black and is much thinner than what is shown.
1.0,"I opened the package, and when I did...there were strings hanging off the purse.  The stitching was coming off.  Sent it right bac."
1.0,"It is a pretty band and easy to install on watch.  I put it on and could not get the clasp to open.  Thankfully, it was loose enough I could detach it from the watch face to get it off."
1.0,"We needed a simple, white shoe for a wedding. Red bottoms won’t work ( nor is it not like pictured) when she will be pulled in a wagon with the bottoms of her feet front and center."
1.0,1st off it clearly says its WHITE its definately NOT white it was BLACK!  Was a gift and so i gave it in the wrong color and it sheds everywhere!  Not terry typeand its messy.  Vert not happy.  Wont buy again!
1.0,"this is a very heavy cotton material, youth shirt. if you are looking for a juniors (teen) sized shirt, no. the picture and description are deceptive. i could have bought a 5 pack fruit of the loom boys shirts for like $8. thats what they send you and terrible customer service from Bob Joe trying to get what i ordered."
1.0,Use this for the gym but find it is rather thin
1.0,"I got this maybe a month ago. At first it was ok, but then the backing of the metal compartment turned green and was leaving marks on my wrist. I also developed open sores on my wrist where the metal was in contact with my wrist. Very unhappy. Will be returning."
1.0,"The watch itself is OK. The leather band is thicker than I like, but you can change the band. The rest of the watch feels solid other than the crown... The graphics are find..BEWARE THAT THERE IS A $40 RETURN FEE (THEY CLAIM IS THE SHIPPING FEE) ON TOP OF WHAT IT WILL COST YOU TO SHIP THE ITEM BACK TO HONG KONG. Given that its a $200+ item, you are basically out $80 or more. There are better watches and better options out there....wont buy Spinnaker again...."
1.0,No son tallas reales. Es más corta de lo que la foto indica y las mangas no son nada anchas. Yo devolveré la mía. No es lo que esperaba ni vale el precio. La tela si es suave

1.0,One of the shows didn’t work! Save your money!
1.0,It’s not flattering on a bigger person. The lines highlight all the wrong places.
1.0,"I purchased this umbrella last summer (August 11, 2013) for $129, and we used it well into October and absolutely loved it.  The lights worked great and it offered a lot of shade.  We stored it in our garage all winter so it was out of the elements.<br />We brought it out the first weekend in June and put it in the same table, and used the same stand as we had last year.  We put the umbrella up, tested the lights and everything looked good and we were excited to be able to eat outside again.  While I was cleaning the table off to use, the umbrella was caught by the light wind we were having (maybe 5-7mph winds) and snapped the pole in half.  I would have thought that patio umbrellas are engineered to withstand a slight breeze, and am very disapointed that an umbrella of this quality/value failed under such common conditions.<br />I notified the seller immediately, and have had nothing but runaround from them.  I would NOT purchase anything from this seller and caution anyone who purchases this poorly-made umbrella."
1.0,The magnet isnt strong enough to reach through the skin on the nose. Low key annoyed about it
1.0,Lasted only two weeks then wouldn't work. The second hand couldn't wind it. Very cheap quality.
1.0,"4 stars for the looks. But the quality is terrible. Within 2 days, the stiching on both heals completely ripped. Entirely ruined after2 days."

1.0,"Measurements: 5'3&#34;, Chest: 36&#34;, Waist 29&#34;, Hips 36.6&#34;.  I got the large and it fit ok (it was baggy in the upper back/shoulder area).  The style is cute, but the fabric is very cheap (it was Halloween costume-like). Also, the zipper was really cheap and stuck out at the butt area.  I really wanted to like it, but it's going back."
1.0,"It’s more like a 4.99 hat, very cheaply made"
1.0,It was packaged as as if someone else had already worn it and threw it in the bag I'm very disappointed
1.0,Beard sheds fast. Orange chunks of fake beard ended up on everything. Was hoping to get three uses out of this but might not even get that.
1.0,Although the dress is nice itself.  I didn't like the length nor how the dress draped on my body. It flared out a little too much for me.  I already have wide hips and fit like a moo moo on me. Returned it.
1.0,Earring holes were to large for my ears.
1.0,This was an acu E-5 tank not<br />Ocp. Completely missed it guys.
1.0,"No es lo que esperaba, la caida del sueter no queda como la fotografía, es un poco estrecho en la cintura. La talla está bien,  pero en general no está bien construido. No compraré más esta marca"
1.0,They broke before 3 months. You cannot repair them.
1.0,these were not true to size. at least 2 sizes too small. poorly made. cheap material.
1.0,This is more like a disposable kitchen apron. Not useful for hairstylists. Not what is pictured this is a mat disposal apron. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,I got a medium size B and they ran like an A size. Super not happy about it. Really wanted to like these too
1.0,Not waterproof only lasted three weeks before the sole came unglued

1.0,[[VIDEOID:ffdfda6373758de2ee5130ebd1dd8927]] Dress was too small and oddly shaped. I tried to return and was not successful. DO NOT BUY!
1.0,"This wig looked nice for the first five minutes of having it. Then it immediately frizzed and knotted up to the point that my hairbrush got stuck in it! Plus, the small ribbons holding the wig together ripped the second time i wore it. Not to mention the fact that there was barely any hair on it. Also, there was a huge portion of hair that was melted and i had to clip it off. In general, not a good wig at all."
1.0,"The quality wasn’t as good as it looks online, very cheap quality, sent it back."
1.0,The description said these pants are lightweight but they were quite heavy. The legs were baggy and the inseam hung down. I normally buy a large but got the medium because the description said to size down. I ordered the Medium and they fit more like an XL. I returned the pants.

1.0,All pieces were not attached.  Wouldn't stay.  Worse purchase ever
1.0,It scratched to easy to soon :(  I bought it to use it on my pregnancy but the blue color doesn’t last..
1.0,Couldn't get them on my foot.
1.0,"Normally I wear M or size 6. When I open up, I know it's too small, they are made in China. It's not a flexible dress. So u might really think 2 size up if u wanna look like the style. Not going to waste time doing. It's very thin the material too. Not worth it. Didn't bother to try on either"
1.0,I followed the instructions for measuring correctly and still the bra was not only too big that made me look like I had giant nipples. Then they charge you to return it.
1.0,I no it’s not real silver but now it’s black!!!
1.0,These are way too big for my son and almost too big for my face 😭
1.0,It fell apart right out of the bag.... and the thick gold necklace was too small to fit around anyone’s neck it was the size of a bracelet
1.0,Returned because it was too small
1.0,"It’s shiny. I mean, not cottony at all. Very slippery polyester. I wanted it as a beach coverup but it would be too hot even though it is thin and sort of see-thru. And it’s definitely not flattering on me! I won’t be wearing it anywhere else. I will be returning this."
1.0,Tops too small.  Bottoms too big.  Inweable for size worn by both adults.  Very disappointing.
1.0,Doesn't match description for size at all. S was more like an XXS. Not happy at all.
1.0,Back seam was poorly sewn and ripped out the first time I wore them.
1.0,"I wish I received the product that the other reviewers are talking about. If I had no arms this might work, but as it is the sleeves only make it halfway down my forearm."
1.0,Too large. Small feels like large (I am US size 4)
1.0,Far too snug and poorly fitting.
1.0,"note that i did NOT get this on Amazon, but purchased a new one of these from another seller, an authorized dealer.<br /><br />the seconds hand wouldn't hit the markers on the mark (yes i have other Japanese quartz, solar and battery, that do hit the markers right on...one is a $50 quartz that has a marlin logo). And the diver bezel was misaligned to it too was not stopping right at the 12 marker.<br /><br />for a watch listing over $500 this is fully unacceptable, no matter what it's discounted to. had i purchased on Amazon and needed to return it i'm sure things would have gone smoother, but as was i needed to return it at my expense to an overseas dealer. additionally, i've had another citizen quartz solar diver that was a bit better, but still couldn't seem to consistently have the secs hand hit the markers."
1.0,Painted on colors over the stones. Dark yellow and black not like advertised.
1.0,"This ring arrived damaged.<br /><br />For starters, one of the tanzanite stones on the border was MUCH darker than the others. It clearly doesn't match the rest, and stands out like a sore thumb. Some of the black spinel stones on the sides of the ring look more like chipped pieces of gemstone rather than uniform, round stones. Most upsetting is the pear shaped amethyst. There is a giant scratch on the bottom of the amethyst stone that is visible through the top of the ring.<br /><br />Lastly, ring came in only a tiny plastic bag. I did not receive the blue velvet bag shown in the pictures.<br /><br />Overall, I was very disappointed in this item. The quality was terrible. I had a few other items from Orchid Jewelry saved in my cart, but I will not be buying them now."
1.0,"I would not order again. It has a very bad chemical odor. It was pretty, but the smell is horrible!"
1.0,"Complete scam. They say its a decent quality saber. Its trash, can get a better sturdy one form the dollar store. No sounds no nothing. Avoid buying form then"
1.0,"This is junk, metal came tarnished while still in the package and the clasps would not open due to the tarnished material."
1.0,These panties ARE NOT LARGE  they are are medium or small  the fit is way too small
1.0,"#1: Returning this watch because the “Emblem” in the weight that winds the watch, is peeling off. I’ve only had this watch 2 days.<br />#2: Watch has no luminous at all.<br />#3: The year is not fully visible. “202”<br />Very cheap. If you want a watch for glam go for it but if you want a naive tine piece that will appreciate over time or for craftsmanship then you can find cheaper watches that won’t fall apart and will probably look better depending on what your looking for."
1.0,This is not water-proof. Just came back from ski-trip and these got completely soaked. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Se rompió sin usarlo, material demasiado fragil."
1.0,these are not very good for your ears. they fall out of mine all the time
1.0,"The quality is really bad and my yin yang charm fell right off. The plastic wires connected with a metal plate came right out, I had it out of the bag for about 3 minutes before this happened. But it was cheap so I'm not that worried about it."
1.0,Material is WaY to thin to wear white
1.0,"I was to receive a necklace and instead got a bracelet. After looking at the fine print, I seen that is what they were selling. The picture is very deceiving."

1.0,cheaply made  Ripped on 1st time wearing
1.0,It wasnt cut right and the material was a cheap
1.0,"I'm a size 20 and ordered a 3X .... It didn't even get past my thighs. Super cute, but just runs to small."
1.0,They are fine but only five came in the package when six were listed on the product. Unacceptable.
1.0,Came apart quickly.
1.0,This looks pretty online but ugly when received. The item was delivered fast but the product was cheap and poorly made
1.0,I searched Amazon for Dress Shoe Inserts - this was the #1 item and has high reviews.<br /><br />After cutting the 1 size fits all sole; i realized these are designed for tennis shoes.  The width around the ball of your foot will not accommodate narrow dress shoes.  I now have a pair of inserts that won't fit my dress shoes and one of them has been sized so I am not unable to return them:(.
1.0,"Side cut outs are huge , shows much more of sports bra than what picture does, so now it’s just a sleep shirt."
1.0,"The fabric is terrible, thick synthetic. Not summery at all"
1.0,"Amazon has continually been a pleasant buying experience for me and my family, but certain people selling on Amazon use the format to sell you a grossly inferior product. I have bought these Stingers for every woman in my family after testing the product myself. James Keating designed an efficient, durable and comfortable tool for personal protection.<br />When you need it the most is not when you want too find out it is actually a Chinese knock off.<br />Make sure you are getting the real Combat Technologies product, by having it shipped to yourself first for inspection.<br />My Daughter was not going to tell what she actually received, so I'm glad I asked.<br />I promptly replaced it with a new one from Amazon, and returned the cheap plastic replica to it's seller (on my dime!)"
1.0,The soles on these are HARD and not comfortable.  I do NOT recommend these...save your money.
1.0,Way too small and cheap material. Even for the price
1.0,It's almost 3 full sizes smaller than listed.
1.0,"The masks literally feel like a loose leaf paper! So thin! Nothing compared to other masks. The design is poorly made, did ya'll not have enough ink or something? I will not be buying again."
1.0,"The sizing on this item is way off.  I ordered from the size chart and read the reviews regarding the fit too.  Don't buy this dress unless you have a very small upper body and large lower body.  It would be perfect for you if this fits your needs.  Unfortunately, it's going back.  The top is way too small.  The skirt is generous and a little too long in comparison to the top.  Don't bother."
1.0,Creases easily then gets caught on clothing
1.0,"My son received this for his 7th birthday. He was very excited! However, after charging once it went dead and even when plugging in the recharger for many hours, it remains black. He is so disappointed. I wish we could get a refund. He literally had this watch for a few hours."
1.0,the dress was torn from the front when I opened it
1.0,Jacket was made large. Said U.S. small but more like a U.S. large. Good quality jacket but didn't suit me
1.0,"Very loose and thin. Ended up returning. Its cheap but i mean you can definitely make it at home with 2 pieces of fabric, needle, and thread."
1.0,The color was not right and the design was no where near how the picture looked 👎👎
1.0,Not at all what it looks like. Cheap looking and does not have any pink in it
1.0,Ordered the lighter color came to me orange and very large for XS not what I was expecting
1.0,I gave this watch to my sister-in-law because it was too small for me.  I thought the strap would be longer since it was a unisex watch.  It would probably be too small for man's wrist.
1.0,Doesnt stay on foot
1.0,"Poor quality, very thin, extra stitching makes the fingers look weird"
1.0,It broke as soon as I put it on...don't waste your money.
1.0,Terrible thin fabric and when you fold it up it completely covers the emblem...
1.0,They run so small. I am 40DD and i order them 42DDD and they dint fit! Totaly regret this purchase
1.0,Doesn’t glow in the dark as advertised
1.0,Not compatible with Fossil 5th gen watch even though it says they are in the description on the listing
1.0,The dress shrunk into a t-shirt size and cannot be worn at all. I washed in on Cole water and hung dry it. Very disappointed.
1.0,Could not find where to choose size. Size small showed up and had to return
1.0,"My advice, don’t try it. I got 2 literally the worst purchase I made an amazon. I am  speechless. I got my refund"
1.0,"After less than 3 months of wear, the layers of leather 'laminate' separated where the buckle is attached to the belt"
1.0,"I look like a nurse wearing this. Not what I expected. Nothing particularly wrong with the shirt, however."
1.0,Works like a charm while it lasted. Put on watch around first of the year and April 11 it is tearing apart.
1.0,Did not fit!
1.0,"No matter how you loosen them or tighten them, they are still going to be painful."
1.0,There cute but it's not waterproof at all I wore these boots on a rainy day an let me tell you both my foot was severely sooked an wet yes they do keep your feet warm but water proof no. Not worth $29
1.0,I ordered a XL and it looks like a small. The product reviews were False. I am extremely displeased with this product.
1.0,"Pics include: Inside of bra, front of bra.... and then I put a brush on the inside to show how every little bump shows through. Combine with the funky seam lines and sizing that runs small, it's unflattering to say the least."
1.0,The gold plating wore off in less than 3 months of use.
1.0,Didn’t work for my toddlers.  They refused to wear it.  Returned it.
1.0,Ser through & hand washed it & it fell apart
1.0,Received this dress and it does not look like the picture. The material is very stiff and I washed it to see if that would help and it did not. With that being said it makes you look very round in it. Not at all flattering.
1.0,"Save your time and energy. Do not buy this. Like everyone else said, the arms are completely wrong. I ordered my typical size, was smaller than standard, but OK. I NEVER, have problems with arm sleeves being too small. I can even size down and my arms still fit, and I buy from a lot of online sources, and a lot of amazon. The measurements are completely off. Fabric may or may not soften with washing, was very scratchy."
1.0,"This beanie is a Christmas gift for my 8yr daughter, HUGE fan of funneh & the krew . The beanie is terribly small, very disappointing. The iron on sticker won’t last long. Cheap representation of our beloved youtubers. My Small 8yr has a very Small head. So hopefully that helps anyone purchasing in the future... Which I suggest if it’s for a baby, it should fit. Beanie is WAY to small!!! Total bummer"
1.0,The size was off by alot. I ordered size 9.5 US which was for some reason equivalent to 43 (which is not what is written in size chart. I received the shoes which totally not 9.5 at all..it's was 43 ..huge.
1.0,writing was too small to even read
1.0,"As other reviewers have said, these are very tiny; however, I would have been fine with them anyway if they hadn't been completely tarnished.  The ones I received don't look silver at all but instead look like they have a cheap exterior that has worn down to a look of tarnished faux yellow gold...except I haven't ever worn them because they looked that way when they arrived.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"Me qedo bien d la cintura para arriba.<br />De lo largo no me qedo a esa altura q se ve en la fotografía<br />Es demasiado largo.<br />No soy tan bajita, estatura regular."
1.0,"I purchased this and it broke shortly after. They gave me a replacement, (great customer service). The new one just broke."
1.0,I got a small and it’s huge! It looks like a large on me
1.0,"Good for cleaning your windshield, that’s about it."
1.0,The sweater was the wrong color and it just looked cheap and wrinkled when I removed the airtight packaging on from the item.
1.0,"I originally bought these to go with a navy blue and gold salwar kameez to wear to an Indian wedding reception. When the earrings arrived, they were true to the picture. The stones were deep blue. However, they were very heavy. Also, the wires in the back (to go into your earlobe hole) were very thick. I couldn't even put the earrings on because the wires were too big in diameter to fit my earlobe hole! I had to return them because I couldn't wear them."
1.0,When I got this I was very excited but unfortunately it did not fit nor was it the same shirt I had even purchased. There was no dip in the front just straight across couldn’t even tie a bow because the fabric was too short. Very disappointing
1.0,Very disappointed with these boots. My husband only wore them twice on two date nights. The 2nd date night we played mini golf and he felt something strange. When we got home the whole heel had come unglued up to where your arch would be. Very very mad because we really liked this style of boot.
1.0,It was a scam
1.0,I would have been comfortable with a XL instead. The large hugs my body too much and there's not much stretch.
1.0,TRASH!!!!! An imitation to the real thing! This was basically a colorful plastic bag! In the trash it went!!!
1.0,Sure wear it. You can be just like Dimitrios Pagourtzis.
1.0,"This shawl is not warm, not plush, and not comforting. It's made of some slick almost ""slimy"" feeling synthetic material that feels icy to the touch when the room you are in is cold. There's nothing warm, plush, or cashmere feeling about it. They did get the Maxwell tartan correct, but that's the only even vaguely good thing about it. Do *not* recommend!"
1.0,Cheap clothing. Zero quality
1.0,They broke taking them off the first day. The arm snapped and I looked like a doofus when it happened.
1.0,I use the frame number on my son's old frame as the lens were new. The frame didn't fit at all :(
1.0,Do not order this case. Not only terrible quality but also an unbearable oddor. Go to a dollar store and get something better.
1.0,Demasiado pequeña
1.0,Very small for a 4 to 6 size...quality very very poor
1.0,I purchased these super cheap and only got to wear them once because they turned orange and the chain broke. You get what you paid for....
1.0,You only get 1 bunny. I’d give 0 stars of possible.
1.0,It's not that hard to measure and get sizes right. The chart is not accurate and for workout clothes fitting is important. Do better.
1.0,Its a gift so have not used or received had to reorder
1.0,"It fits good as far as the cut and length i'm 5'9 160 lbs... it's pretty short...but functional so long as i don't drop something but... thats about it. Every other aspect of the dress was so disappointing. The fabric is much cheaper looking than the picture and the colors are off!! And its SO thin!!! At first I thought they messed up and sent me a cheap scarf. I'm either returning it or using it for exactly that, a scarf"
1.0,This was twice the size of the size just below it....
1.0,Love the idea but this one is not well made. The connection part broke the first time my kids wore it.
1.0,"Material states cotton spandex label on dress states 100%polyester material is clingy, cheep and see thru.Adorable dress nice fit Material awful why cant you make dress with a nicer quality fabric?Sorry to return ."
1.0,Hurt my hand
1.0,Returned<br />Smelled like plastic.
1.0,item is not as described  no neck strap  no filter pocket
1.0,Narrow waist and very long
1.0,"Cheesy fabric, not at all what's shown in image.  They are using someone else's product photos<br />and attempting to counterfeit them.  Poor, poor quality."
1.0,Nice shirt but small and loose
1.0,This shirt was significantly misrepresented inn size.  It is way too small.
1.0,Super small very thin socks. Buy another brand this socks aren’t good
1.0,Piece of stone missing
1.0,"Like it says, within an hour, the back strap snapped off. My daughter was just leisurely walking around target and pop!"
1.0,One tile is cracked and several have white gouges. I also ordered a color one and that one is perfect.
1.0,"This is a flimsy thin ""costume"" - just imagine when you pull out a polyester costume from a plastic bag at a costume store.  That's what it is!  It even says it's from a COSTUME STORE IN CHINA!!!!  Do NOT buy!!!"
1.0,It’s probably a great one for someone who looks like a Vs model
1.0,Not sweatshirt material.  See through as well.
1.0,"Way, way too small!  I'm usually the last person to say this:  I think American sizing has become too generous over the last 5 years....but I say pass, unless you are a TINY woman or very slender teenager, AND don't mind ordering an XXL.  What a shame.  Beautiful colors!"
1.0,damaged
1.0,I let my friend use it in pretty small surf. He said it came apart once but was able to reattach it. Then he ended up losing the string and hat entirely while paddling in. Wouldn’t recommend at all
1.0,Do not care for them they won’t stay in plsce
1.0,Not real C&C... returned
1.0,"I've worn these shoes about 90% of the time for the last 5 years. I've LOVED them until this pair. The left one is fine but the right one, the top straps are all stretched out and the shoe is extremely loose.  Great shoes normally but quality control on this pair was really bad."
1.0,The coat way way too small and looked nothing like the picture.
1.0,"The description said 8""x8"" but falls short. its more like 6.5""x6.5"". I am returning this because I can not use."
1.0,This item came with a hole in it along the arm seam.
1.0,"This product broke before I could even use it once. I put it over my head and then went to take it off to turn it around because I had put it on with the mask upside down and lifting it over my head it just broke. The beads went everywhere. I wasn't even having it hold the weight of my hair, literally just lifting it over my head. And it was with a surgical mask, not a cloth or N95 one. So this product can not hold any weight or movement."
1.0,"Bought this case at the end of August and its broken already, will not close and stay closed. Guess the spring or whatever is broken. Use it every day, but still not really abused just opened and closed carefully. Wouldn't buy again. My last one was good for a year, different brand and I don't remember where I got it. Lucky I had a spare I forgot about in a drawer."
1.0,"I like these leggings, they fit well and are comfortable. Unfortunately I only received one pair when I purchased the pack of two."
1.0,"I purchased a pair in May of 2018, and seemed like a great deal. Within a few months, the supposed Extremely Light & Unbreakable frame snapped right behind the lens when putting them on. The company sent me a replacement, and fast forward to this week and the replacement pair snapped in the same place. So in a little over a year, these unbreakable frames snapped twice in the same place.  I am not rough on my sunglasses, I only wear them when driving, and to break like that is inexcusable. I think you better change your description as its falsely advertises the quality of these sunglasses."
1.0,was too big and wasn't the color I ordered
1.0,"Very poor design. Nothing like the photos. The dress is too short, but was too big everywhere else."
1.0,"BUYER BEWARE! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! This is a fake hoodie! First, the material is made out of polyester, nylon or acrylic, it is not cotton. I am extremely disappointed and outraged! Second, the fake hoodie is too small. Third, the picture on Amazon website does not come close to the fake item I received. Next, in the description, the seller fails to describe the type of material the fake hoodies is made of. This is a classic case of “bait and switch”. The material is extremely flimsy and very very thin. Most (ordinary) hoodies are made of thick cotton material, not this piece of crap! If I could give the seller zero stars I would have done so. I am returning this crappy material immediately! BUYER BEWARE! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! FELLOW CUSTOMER’S, YOU’VE BEEN WARNED!"
1.0,When I received the shirt it was completely covered in soap. Have no idea what happened but when I took it out of the little package the whole shirt had big sloppy wet marks on it when I ran it under water it was soap. I am not happy and if this stains I will be returning it. I've never had dissatisfaction with this company I bought many items but I have no idea why there would be soap all over this item.
1.0,It did not work. I returned it.
1.0,1.  BAD: Pattern design only on one side and both sides show when wearing. Looks wrong.<br />2.  BAD: Belt rings do not lay flat while wearing.  Looks funny.
1.0,Can't hold on to dishes!
1.0,Thread started coming out of the bathing suit as soon as put it on and the top started coming apart.
1.0,I had hoped they would be clear for viewing pictures.  The card holder pockets were very skimpy.  I will not be using them as I had hoped and will give them away to children to play with.
1.0,it broke as soon as I put it on. cheap quality
1.0,Very pretty but fell apart first time I wore them
1.0,"Wanted to love this sweater. I knew not to expect too much considering the price. Within 2 weeks, the snap pulled off the material. Sent it back and got a new one. The new one had no elastic in the bottom and fit like a tunic. Not sure this company is monitoring their product for quality. Would not recommend."
1.0,"Very thin leather and poor stitching, I wore a few times and it started to rip at the seams ..."
1.0,The outfit was not like the picture I was very disappointed
1.0,The material of this T.shirt is a really bad quality. Fabric is rough. I do not recommend this product.
1.0,"Huge!!! I knew it was going to be large, but it is the biggest watch I think I have ever seen. Made my husbands wrist look like a little kid trying on his Dad's watch. Kept time for about 2 days. After that he was constantly setting it even though he was in the sunlight roughly 8 hrs a day. I knew it was cheap, but figured he could use it as a back up while he got his other watch fixed. Bad idea, save your money not worth it."
1.0,Looking to return.
1.0,picture is not the same glasses i received
1.0,I ordered 2 size 2-4s for my twin toddlers and two different sizes came. There was a size 2-3 and a 3-4. These should be listed as different size options. And if I'm ordering two of the same product they should be the same size...
1.0,Other reviews were right...the short keeps rolling up...very uncomfortable.
1.0,"At first I loved these and got a log of compliments, but then the mirror finish started to rub off very quickly."
1.0,An ear fell off the first time my daughter wore them. Poor quality.
1.0,I ordered a size 8 for my 7 year old daughter. This is closer to a 4T
1.0,"Cute pattern, but runs VERY SMALL!  Like the fabric though."
1.0,Cheap material and runs small. Does not keep you warm. Overpriced and poorly made. I don’t recommend spending your money on this. Found 10x better quality hoodies at a fraction of what they charge. Nothing like description. Very disappointed. This is the first bad review I leave on Amazon after thousands of purchases!!!!
1.0,Buyer beware
1.0,The clock is nice but the battery ran out a week after I arrived :(<br /><br />el reloj es bonito pero se le acabo la batería una semana después de haberme llegado :(
1.0,"Ordered white, received black.  I bought these for Halloween to go with a German beer garden girl costume. Ordered white receive black didn't notice until Halloween. They also run really small"
1.0,Cheap fabric material and they give only two buttons on chest so it won’t cover it all and everything is popping
1.0,Strap broke after 1 month of minimal use.
1.0,I didn't like the fuzzy fabric. The buttons are not cute and it made me feel older.  Based on the pictures I thought it looked nice but when it finally came in I realized it's just not my style.
1.0,"I really hated these. They were supposed to be red and they were a very ugly dusty pink, not even a pretty pink. very disappointed."
1.0,The fabric is that weird stretchy....swimming suit like material..... I was expecting more cotton tshirt like.... not the case. It fit fine.... the seams stuck out a bit and I just couldn't get past the material.... in the winter it clings like crazy!
1.0,"This key chain is made of metal and seems sturdy enough, but the paint is cheap!  It arrived with a scratch on it and now the paint is beginning to flake off.  I just got it today and am very disappointed.  And to make matters worse, the company selling it made a signature a requirement with FedEx, upon delivery!  I would not recommend this product to anyone!"
1.0,Vary hard on ears. Had to discard.
1.0,I ordered a Large but it looked more like a small. The material feels and it looks very cheap.
1.0,Not good. The cotton sucks and its prone to rinkling and shrinking.
1.0,"I ordered the black long sleeve dress with the eyes and lips on it. I’m 5’9 145lb. I’m usually a medium in every thing. So I ordered a medium and the dress was too large. l probably need an extra small from what it looks like. Plus I didn’t like it the material, it  was more spandex then a tee shirt dress which is what I envisioned but I guess that was my mistake. Sent it back."
1.0,Awful.  Not the sweater that is advertised at all!!!  Needed this for the Holidays!  You can’t trust the clothing!!!
1.0,The size says XL and fits like a medium the 2x did like a medium as well
1.0,I finally got it yesterday but the zipper pull tab was broken<br />I will have to return it
1.0,"So we ordered 2 sets of these as a gift as we needed them in different sizes. On both orders we only received the orange shirt and not the white one that says ""I Yam"" super disappointing as they are not really so great unless they are together. Amazon was great in helping us reach a resolution but it is still disappointing only getting half of a Set of something. It's like order 2 pairs of shoes on only getting the left one from each order..."
1.0,The fit on this is very odd. Too tight in some areas and way to big in others. Going back.
1.0,Terrible. These barely have any elastic in the waist and fall down constantly. I think I'm going to throw these in the garbage!
1.0,The watch was not put together. Do not know what to do now. Do I go to as Jewerly store to have it put together?
1.0,"I am not happy with this purchase but feel as if I’m stuck with it. I received it and threw in the wash by itself. I washed in cold water and hung to dry, and unfortunately the red in the shirt ran and now my white and red shirt is pink and red. Not happy"
1.0,The charm was smaller than I expected and the loop on it was too small to fit on a normal size chain. The loop broke when I tried to put it on the chain. Now I’m trying to find a larger loop.
1.0,I searched for weeks looking for a burgundy soft warm cardigan to wear with my leggings and was ecstatic to find this one. However the buyer includes didn't show that it raises in the back and that there are string frays everywhere! This cardigan is no where near what I expected and am greatly disappointed.
1.0,I just received the shoes today I have blue and a pink. The pink one works for a little bit and it stop working. My kids love it till the other one stop working.
1.0,"These were never worn outside.  ALWAYS in the house on carpet or tile.  Both soles split after 6 months of VERY light usage.  Now looking, they're no longer ""available from Amazon"".  Of course they're not.  I need to return something and I can't.  UGH."
1.0,This item is very cheap. I dropped it once and it broke
1.0,"Sooooo cute, but I could barely breathe in it! Runs VERY small. Order 2 sizes up!"
1.0,Washed these when they came in as I do all clothing. They fit my daughter tighter than a pair of underwear. She can't even get them up over her legs anymore. All going in the trash
1.0,Cheap crap made in China
1.0,"Ordered a small and they were way too big. Scrunched at the knee and loose in the waist. For reference, I'm 5ft and 108lbs."
1.0,way too big and weird
1.0,I AM EXTRA SMALL AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE HOW MISFIT THESE WERE.
1.0,Tiny not the size listed can't read inscription item is so small.
1.0,The color was nothing like the picture. I received a lime green shirt
1.0,"I hoped my ear was different and that my experience would be better, but this item doesn't fit my ear. It was really cheap so im not overly upset, Overall it looks poor quality and doesn't fit. i would not recommend."
1.0,"Quede sumamente decepcionada , nada que ver con la imagen que te muestran, em material de malísima calidad, muy mal hecho se nota que lo hicieron en 5 minutos, es mi dinero peor invertido en mucho tiempo, janas lo volvería a comprar"
1.0,Bro this is Satanism
1.0,Very poor quality the material was cheap and thin. They fell apart after I washed them twice
1.0,Color is nothing like picture. More<br />Yellow and brown than camo
1.0,Very cheap looking fit terribly very disappointing
1.0,I love how it is made with satin on the inside but the sequin were falling off everywhere!  It was like glitter.  Wear to a pajama party or something then throw it out!
1.0,It's a lot more plushie than expected and it fit small. I feel very round in it.
1.0,Large at the bottom and no zips.
1.0,Don't like the way it feels or size is not true fit
1.0,Worst watch ever. Band literally broke by itself after 5 days. Would never recommend or buy again. Honestly a refund would be in order
1.0,Ring stone falling sideways...metal left inside..clasps in earrings hard to open and close. :(
1.0,Really feels cheap.  I have a large head and the frames are slightly large for me.  Vision through the lens is  weird.<br />Wouldn't buy again or recommend
1.0,"Fits great everywhere except for the bust, which is why I always size up. Disappointing because I really liked this blouse"
1.0,"I followed the instructions. I looked at the videos. I called Amazon. The watch would not set itself.<br /><br />I went to a different manufacturer and bought a similar watch, but not solar powered like this one. The new watch set itself just fine."
1.0,Not what i thought i was ordering
1.0,The almost-sheer fabric on the sleeves ripped the first time I wore it.
1.0,A los tres días se dañó
1.0,Broke within one day and I bought it for $2.79. Now that the price is 7.99 I really don't think it's worth it. Also the ring for ur toe is very very uncomfortable no matter how many times u adjust it.
1.0,There is no tag indicating materials and size of the sweater. I’m not sure how best to care for or wash it. The sweater is too small for medium. It does not fit the way previous sweaters I’ve bought from sellers of the same style sweater. The seam where the arm meets the shoulder sticks out as if it was sewn wrong.
1.0,I’m not sure these are leather. The back of the earrings are plain white and do not match the color on the front. I returned them.
1.0,"short sleeves and too short of legs, while having an extra wide body.  ODD"
1.0,"Update: About a week after I submitted my original review, the heat stopped working on the dryer. So it is running the fan function only.  So shoes are no longer drying.<br /><br />Original review: This shoe dryer works quickly.  It has a high heat, low heat, and fan only setting.  You can run it on the timer up to 99 minutes.  The “stock” setting is 20 minutes.  And with high heat and 20 minutes it will dry out a damp set of chucks.  When they were soaked and covered in mud I needed to bump it up to about an hour.  It also has an ozone feature.  I could smell the ozone, so I know it actually worked.  You can run the ozone without any other options running if you choose.  The legs pop up and then the tips will extend and bend to get into relatively deep boots and extra curved shoes.  I have not needed to run it more than a 90 minute cycle on anything at this point.  So as of now, it has dried every pair of shoes/boots I have wanted without having to max it out and restart it.  I have been using it 2-3 times a week."
1.0,"The package arrived in a timely manner, no issues there.  This shirt is not for me, seemed to run large, so fit was too loose and not flattering."
1.0,"Cute style and cut, but the first time I wore them they tore at the toe. I wear a 7.5 shoe. These should have fit fine, and I hardly walked at all today."
1.0,"Looked awful. I am 5'10&#34;, 38DD, 175 pounds. Absolutely terrible unfortunately. No support for my breasts, did not even want to tie around my neck. Definitely not for tall girls."
1.0,I did not like the look or fit
1.0,Don't waste your money. Too small. Too short. Low quality.
1.0,Incredibly ugly and not what is pictured. Sizing chart doesn't match up.
1.0,very small in 2-3 sizes to small. last time I take what is written
1.0,Muy mala calidad!! No es lo que se muestra en línea!!😡
1.0,I ordered  extra large and it is tiny tiny tiny!
1.0,Color is more of an orange..it's small. And fabric is rough. I hate it.
1.0,"I ordered this in April. When it arrived, a part of it had already somehow broken off in the mail, although the packaging appeared unharmed. Today, on May 31st another piece snapped off. Upon closer inspection, most of the pieces appear ready to fall off at any moment. However, there's always a few that slip past quality control, maybe i just got one of those!"
1.0,I placed a lot of orders with Netaya during their recent sale.  After not receiving any notification that my items had shipped I called them up to find out why.  Netaya decided to cancel my orders because they had second thoughts about their sale.  And they charged my card!  Now I have to wait and see if they will give me my money back.  What reputable company behaves in this manner?
1.0,"Not what I expected, legging to small."
1.0,Purchased a 9W. The box and tag says 9W but the inside of the shoe says 10W. Needless to say these are way too big.  My toe barely makes it to the toe box. 9W may be to big even.
1.0,small and short on my 5'2 195 lbs
1.0,Glasses cute but broken when received. Had to send back. Also were A bit big and sliding off my face.
1.0,Disliked. I sent it back. To big for a small
1.0,It’s short but baggy weird fit and the material is cheap
1.0,The vendor sent out an unfinished blouse. No hem around the bottom and sleeves. The embroidery was nice but the material wasn't very good.
1.0,I bought a size 8 but it’s more like a size four am not even sure I can exchange because of the size discrepancy
1.0,Item was received damaged.... poor quality. Should not be allowed to be sold on Amazon.
1.0,Did not fit like a true medium. Use caution when ordering
1.0,"This is not as advertised, what was sent looks like a ring that’s been used for 6 years..... I don’t know how they could send this to me!"
1.0,I bought this item specifically because the picture shows it has elbow length sleeves.  It does not – the sleeves are short.  The picture also shows crop length pants but the pants are regular slack length.  Additionally the description says the jumpsuit is high-waisted – it isn’t.
1.0,Flimsy and huge. The Dollar Tree has higher quality glasses than these. Sent them back.
1.0,"At 5/14/2018, I am asked by this seller, to offer a review. Perhaps they will have regrets.<br /><br />I ordered one set of these on 12/5/2017, received them 12/7/2017, and promptly installed them on my work shoes of the moment. I sent this message via Amazon, on 12/12/2017: &#34;I lost a lace-ends cap on my first day of walking with these laces. I had coped with absence of any directions and did OK, but something is not error-proof here. I wish to receive another cap.&#34; There was no reply. Absent the cap, the lace ends have released twice from the exposed adjuster; that luckily still captured by a lace end.<br /><br />There is a lot of competition in this needed alternative to ordinary shoe laces. Some, perhaps most, work. So, don't go here.<br /><br />I have a dying pair of shoes bought at Columbia Sportswear, sold with the elastic laces I like best. I can't find them among the many Amazon offerings. I will disclose their better design via Amazon, to this seller if wanted. Surely some good little factory, still wanting to sell these, probably in China, needs discovery."
1.0,but too heavy to wear
1.0,"The sizing is wrong. I bought x-large, they are supposed to fit 10-12; wrong! I'm a12.  No bigger than a 10 could wear these. The slipper at the heel is not very high so they slip right off as soon as I step."
1.0,Does not look anything like the picture. This product sucks
1.0,RETURNED IT. DESIGN SUCKS AND TOO TIGHT
1.0,This is gross in color. It is goldfish tan. Can’t return because I have to pay to ship it to China and it’s more than the dress. Gave to a shelter
1.0,"I ordered a medium after reading the reviews. But I am returning them due to the fact that it says to dry clean only! What?? My PJ's?? Um no Thank You! I hand washed and air dried mine, but still the fabric sticks together on the outside. Also mind you these are polyester, so you will sweat in them at night or get tangled up in your sheets!! Due to the fabric I believe. The pants are very long so you would have to hem them, I'm 5'2 & 115 so they still were a little roomy. But long. The colors are pretty, but over all I'm returning them due to the fabric issue. Sorry it's a fail👎"
1.0,Alot of the beads had fell off as if someone had worn it
1.0,This dress is very thin. Paper thin. Going to return soon as possible.
1.0,One nose piece is broken off and the other is loose. Can't wear them😩
1.0,I ordered this ring for a temporary replacement of my wedding band while it was in the &#34;shop&#34;. I was very disappointed from it because the hearts were complete squished and didnt look like hearts anymore. i will not be buying another.
1.0,It was cute and the fit was just as I had expected base on measurements.<br />The shirt had a distinct smell with stains all over them. I bought it for a trip and couldn't even wear it nor did I have the time to return it.<br />It's been sitting on my dresser and I'm hoping the stain removers will remove it.<br />Just make sure you double check your shirts when you receive them.
1.0,TOO SMALL. CHEAP looking sending back
1.0,Broke after wearing only a couple times.  Would not recommend.
1.0,Wallet too small to insert bills... not as advertised.
1.0,Not enough material to cover by chest area and any under bra with it showed. Had to use fashion tape which left areas of fabric that were extra and sticking out
1.0,The necklace is black now totally tarnished very upsetting
1.0,Horrible. The material is super cheap and thin. It runs 2 sizes small. Save your money and buy something else.
1.0,Too small for medium size..
1.0,I should have taken a picture with this on.  It is the most hideous fabric like shiny velour plastic. It’s so terrible my husband thought I had on silk pajamas. SAVE YOUR COIN you will look a mess
1.0,These are not true to size or true to the sizing guide posted. They’re at least two sizes too big. The material is very cheap and see through.
1.0,I am returning it
1.0,I have several items from Zanzea in the size xl that are loose and flow and I love them but not this dress. If it fit like I anticipated it would have been great.it was a boat neck and not off the shoulder and tight in the stomach area. Unfortunately my husband washed it and the tags disintegrated and I can't return it. I am thinking of getting it altered into a skirt so I didn't waste money completely.
1.0,Zipper broke on first use
1.0,"Bought from seller Jenviit. Received a 10 pack, not a pack of 50 as advertised."
1.0,I always wear men medium. Bib part comes to neck. Legs very long and loose.
1.0,The quality of the print is terrible and it was off to the side of the shirt.
1.0,"The material was put on this inside out - the black/negative side is on the outside, and the houndstooth side is on the inside. I've tried to turn it around, but it just goes back to the black/darker side.<br /><br />Also the clasp for the material is cheap and sharp (it has little claw teeth on it, and it wasn't closed all the way).<br /><br />Finally. the hook for badges is a cheap metal hook."
1.0,"The first time I put this ring on, it snagged my clothes and scratched my fingers. It wasn’t smooth at all and I threw it away. Not happy with my purchase at all."
1.0,Shirt was short in length & was tight. Not as shown on model. Size up!
1.0,Large is like a big parachute. Cute but humongous. Buy size down. I didn't receive my refund. they take my item though
1.0,The fabric was soft on the outside but scratchy on the inside. The cuffs were stiff. The stitching was poorly done. The fuzz came off really easily. The first shipment I received was missing the shorts.
1.0,It has no band to hold your breast.  Bottom is wide open.
1.0,"This product was a complete waste, when I received it the buttons were all hanging off. When I tried it on they all snapped off without applying any pressure at all."
1.0,I returned it<br />It was too big and I really didn't like it
1.0,"This kepi is utterly inauthentic.  The vinyl brim is too large and chinstrap look cheesy.  The crossed rifles insignia was introduced in 1874 and was never used in the Civil War.  Wearing the kepi marks the owner as a farb . If they are above the age of 15, they will be seen as a legitimate target for ridicule by anyone with any knowledge of the headgear of Civil War soldiers."
1.0,"Did not lift as described, instead just covered and sagged."
1.0,"I’m used to buying Asian made stuff and dealing with the sizing, often times poor stitching, but these were ridiculous. I would venture to say the image they show is not what was sent. The band in the back was lopsided and not even wearable. It’s tough because you want to get a pair of joggers for a decent price, but it looks like this is one item that you’re stuck paying 60 bucks for a decent pair."
1.0,Horrible. I’m very  disappointed
1.0,Seems cheaply made and small.
1.0,It was described as a necklace and was a bracelet. Maybe a necklace for a doll...
1.0,I used this purse twice and the metal strap broke on second use. Do not waste your money.
1.0,Quit working after two months.
1.0,Poor quality. You can see a blue haze when looking from the side view of the sunglasses.
1.0,Do not waste your money if you have larger breasts. Does not fit DD at all!
1.0,I am so disappointed not only with my purchase but with Amazon these were not even big enough for a freaking toddler toddler a six-year-old they did not even fit the 6 year olds wrist they were ugly and Trust You me don't let them pick it out for you because it's horrible then they are so generic and their responses when you want to return the item you have to pay for it it's not what it says it is at all I am highly Disturbed disgusted and dismayed at how I have been treated over this purchase it's not a very expensive purchase but I've had more assistance with other purchases this is just absolutely ridiculous
1.0,"First of all these are not Jessie Kidden pants.  I have a pair purchased just a year ago that plainly states in label Jessie Kidden. The label says 'Outdoor Sport&#34; on this pair.  The fabric is different, the belt is different, and the cut is different.  The zippered area is too long for shorts and too short  for capris.  Not sure what you would call them.  Also one of the labels is cut out so I am not sure what is being hidden from consumer."
1.0,Looks nice on picture but really cheap looking in person. I will gift to a child to play dress up in. Do not order!
1.0,Ordered this item 2x now and both times it broke!
1.0,it didn't click on the watch. cheap material. don't waste your money.
1.0,"Tried very hard to adjust the hat with the tie, but it wouldn’t fit my head. It kept falling off. The hat too large for my head!"
1.0,For one the foot is too short in the picture it is long flase advertising!!!! I was looking forward to this item it's nothing like the picture sad to say I would not recommend any one to buy this product....
1.0,"As a person who owns the collectors set and is buying this for someone else, this is not the ring that comes with the UC3 collectors edition, as advertised, instead it is a cheap knockoff with a cheap necklace. The pictures they used as product descriptions isn't even what you receive. Not only is the font and size of the letters off, but there are slight misspellings (surely to avoid any trouble with Sony or Naughty Dog) Sig instead of Sic and the 32 on the inside of the ring looks more like a 12. The band is also thinner than the legitimate one and lighter in color."
1.0,"This is not an anti fog solution for glasses and masks.  And the little flap is nothing but annoying.  It's a mask, but it isn't what it's advertised to be."
1.0,I was disappointed that the fluffy ball keep coming off so easily and it is annoying.
1.0,I purchased this slim wallet in May of this year and just three months later the inside lining has already ripped.  I was initially very happy with my purchase but see now the stitch quality is no good
1.0,"Misrepresentation this is a nose ring it’s advertised as a belly ring and then when delivered the packaging clearly states nose ring, it is TINY. Very unhappy"
1.0,Can’t even give a star.  Terrible quality... guess you get what you pay for.  I literally threw it away.
1.0,I'll probably never wear this dress - maybe as a bathing suit cover up. It's COMPLETELY see through.
1.0,sags under armpit
1.0,Not even close to being the right size
1.0,Have this is not what I expected the quality was very thin the poor material I'm sending it back was not happy with this dress at all it looked very cheap
1.0,This dress is so short. If you are over 5’ 5” it’s not going to cover you up. The dress itself is long enough but the liner underneath doesn’t even cover my whole behind.
1.0,You can’t even see the mouth it just looks like an orange and brown swirl mask.
1.0,"I have always ordered 42/44 mm and in other brands this is the size I wear......got this product that is clearly stated as 42/44 and its to small for my wrist by a considerable amount, for the price I paid i chalked it up as whatever<br /><br />but you need to know that it did not fit compared to other brands based on the 42/44 mm"
1.0,"False Advertising:  This vest label is in Chinese.  I took it to my neighbor to interpet it for me.  This is what the label actually indicates: Outside material polyester, inside lining mater is nylon, inside filling is polyester.  This does not have Down Feather filling.  Will be returning all 5 vests  that I ordered."
1.0,The sleeves are awkwardly long and the neck line is way too wide.
1.0,"I ordered 2 pairs in large. The black ones are tiny & don’t stretch, my mom is a medium & they didn’t fit. The red ones are fine, stretchy like most pants. I give one star because it won’t let me return the black ones & I literally have no use for them."
1.0,I really wanted this dress to fit but it was unflattering. The sleeves and chest area definitely run small. Material has no stretch
1.0,Horrible design. The front feels too short. Not flattering in any way.
1.0,Brought this suit to my granddaughter's swim lesson so she had to wear it and I can't return it.  The fit is terrible. It is  very wide and the straps have no real stretch so they just fall down off the shoulders.  While the body of the suit is wide the legs are cut way up in the back and the material is very narrow at the top in the front.  No child is built like this and also it is very thin and see thru.
1.0,The stones in reality don't look anything like the planets in the online picture(s). Very disappointed!!  Was going to purchase more bracelets for Christmas presents but definitely won't now.
1.0,"The bag looks as in the image. However, its very cheap quality. The item arrived in torn condition and since I was out of town I crossed the return time limit of 30 days I've to keep the torn purse"
1.0,Felt like curious George.
1.0,It is way too long to be a necklace and it doesn't wrap around enough times to be considered a choker. Would give this 0 stars if I could.
1.0,"They don’t look anything like the photo. It’s just a cheap chain and like 8 little pearls, not a pearl bracelet."
1.0,Was more like a shirt
1.0,They run way to small and are super cheap and thin. I actually just donated them. Would not recommend
1.0,Completely different color. Item misrepresented. Returning.
1.0,not a good fit.
1.0,Way too baggy
1.0,Impossible to wear. Gave it to my niece
1.0,I received the dress and it was so short you would mistake it for a shirt. I returned it.
1.0,I was not impressed with the quality. The shirt ran small. The product smelled from being stored too long in hot plastic.
1.0,I ordered the gold shoes and received white ones.
1.0,"This product was made to the lowest of quality standards, not at all sewn like in the photos. It looks like a square simple cheap sweater. The quality would be much better from somewhere like Target and for probably less money. Size was fine."
1.0,trash
1.0,"Returned the day after it was received, Stones were cloudy and two of them were loose in the setting. I guess you shouldn't expect much for 8 bucks."
1.0,Cheap cheap shoes tore up from day 1. Do not buy
1.0,"Will be returning. I ordered the 2-4T hat hoping it would fit my 3 year old who is very small for his age, to my surprise it doesnt even fit my 6 month old. Little to No stretch either. Cant even get it on my 6 month olds head. Very disappointed"
1.0,"I order the orange, and what I received is red."
1.0,I opened the package and found a bug on the inside of the plastic. Disgusting.  I’m scared to even open it.
1.0,The bands were too small. Wrong size with no option to return. unsatisfied because I can't wear them and need to order different ones
1.0,This little sweater looks so cute in the picture.  It looks like a sweater.  The one I received is thin and more like red with white in it.  It doesn't hang as shown.  It is a tighter fit with a much longer tail. It is still cute...just not what I thought I would be receiving.  I won't wear it.
1.0,Save your money and buy something else.
1.0,Daughter likes them way to small
1.0,Cheap and plastic look.  Big disappointment.
1.0,"These socks are supposed to be women's, but they are HUGE, and clearly look like men's socks. They are otherwise nice socks, but I gave them to my husband!"
1.0,Very cheap necklace.
1.0,The clasp broke after 2 weeks of wear.
1.0,Update: changed from 3 stars to 1 star because I've had the ring for less than 2 weeks and the CZ stones are already falling out.<br /><br />The ring is absolutely gorgeous but I ordered a size 7 and they sent me a size 5.
1.0,the worse purse.
1.0,"Already distingegrating after 2 wears.  We will go back to the whale one that we had last year, after this."
1.0,"Only one of the stones were going looked somewhat authentic, and they were very very small. Not true to the size displayed."
1.0,Even though I ordered 2 sizes over my size it was way too small<br />Amazon needs to drop this Company
1.0,"Was extremely disappointed with my purchase! These are NOT bootcut, they are skinny jeans! The material is extremely thin and flimsy that I highly doubt will survive one run through my washer without being torn to shreds. The button is just a snap on and is about to fall off, the waist is NOT low rise, it goes above my belly button and still has the crotch hanging 3 inches lower than it should! I cannot get these things sent back fast enough! Is there even an option to give negative stars?? Dont waste your time and money, you couldn't pay me to keep these!"
1.0,Way too small for any adult head. I made everyone try it on in my house and it wasn’t even close to fitting
1.0,The dress was a nice fit. The neck line rested a bit to high for my comfort though. And the color wasn't as I hoped. I thought it could pass off for a silver color for the holiday season because it's light gray but no. I ended up returning the dress. I wish I would have purchased this dress when it was available in my size in red. That would have been perfect.
1.0,"The fabric is like a curtain it’s so thick, not for me."
1.0,These are a fraction of the size pictured and described. They are so tiny and crappy and hold nothing.  Do not buy!
1.0,"Very disappointed. Apparently, to this manufacturer a size 14 is extra- large. PJs made way too small."
1.0,Product came in a small package all wrinkled Do not buy unless you have time to wash and iron
1.0,Faded easily but I mean for the price that’s expected I guess
1.0,don't like it at all not good material is very cheap please refund me my money please
1.0,"This suit is horribly made. Fits terriblly awkward. I'm normally a small, but ordered medium and still fit like crap."
1.0,Terrible quality. This should be an embarrassment to even offer.
1.0,Stupid small... definitely not XL
1.0,Teensy weensy.  Not even closely the size as depicted. The design is beautiful as long as you have a magnifying glass to see it. I'm a retired geologist and I know that garnets aren't rare and a necklace with larger stones isn't that hard to present.
1.0,I bought a XL the shirt that came felt like a medium so I paid for a return and got a refund. I bought a XXL and the shirt that came was the exact same size the shirt said XXL but was a medium. So either these are knock of shirts or the shirt was a mistake print. I ended up buying another XXL off an eBay store and they got it right.<br /><br />Really disappointed..
1.0,"Delivered quicksilver shorts with O'Neil tags..really? Like I wouldn't notice? Hope it was just oversight, going to return and give chance to make things right."
1.0,This skirt is way too small.  The size is correct but it fits like it’s a child’s size.
1.0,The frames are GREAT I'm sure the lenses are as well but the ones received are bright green and not the brown I ordered.
1.0,They don't stay on.
1.0,Will mot keep your hands warm if riding atv. Can’t put these on if your hands are sweaty.
1.0,"This dress came with an overpowering body odor smell so strong that I wondered if washing would even remove it. Obviously someone... someone stinky... has worn this dress. Also, although other customers warned that the fabric is swimsuit material... I expected it to be the soft, thin swimsuit material. This material is thicker and stiffer. It is a complete shame because I love the pattern and fit of this dress. I am returning it."
1.0,"This is not a &#34;sweater&#34; dress more a t-shirt dress, material thin. I did not even recognize the dress when I opened the package I had to check my history to see if I had even ordered it. Colour is accurate. Similar style to picture but still picture doesn't accurately represent style/shape of actual dress.  If you're looking for more of a t-shirt type material then this would be fine for that style.  It's is NOT sweater material."
1.0,Did not come with swim cap.
1.0,There is no size.  What size is it?
1.0,Shirt wAs too small
1.0,"Amazon did a great job shipping and delivering the cap on time.  The one star is for quality.  The material is not the best, the hat was too small and the logo was ironed on.  For this price I was expecting an embroidered logo and something that fits.  I do not recommend this product."
1.0,Light. Flimsy. Sent back.
1.0,The product was an inch less in the inseam then presented on site.
1.0,I did not receive this color.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!!!!! I am a medium but I ordered a large for preference, and it was so small I couldn't get it up my legs or over my arms!!!! The tag even says large, but if this is a large then I would hate to see a small. very disappointed"
1.0,I bought these and they looked like they were already used. Some of them turned colors.
1.0,"My son loves dinosaurs and this was the perfect birthday present, until it broke the first time he wore it."
1.0,The l/XL size was way too small for a Man.  Could not get them on.
1.0,"This piece absolutely amazing looking But the very first I decided to use it the back part clip breaks ,I was so disappointed now I'm looking for a clip to reassemble that clip Not a happy camper"
1.0,They looked and felt cheaper. I didn't like them and sent them back.
1.0,"I've been a fursona designer for years now and I was looking for more fabric and saw this, thing.<br />Kids if you are just now getting into the community, just wait till you are about 18-20 years old you you boby has the best chance to grow fully and you can think about who you are, who you character is, and if you even what to commit to something like this."
1.0,for me this was an epic fail
1.0,The first time I put them they fell apart. Literally I pulled the right one on and leather came off in my hand.
1.0,I disliked the fact that the first time I went to snap on the eye shield a snap came off.
1.0,"First they looked very cheap, but was like whatever, but then the plastic frame started leaving black marks on my face<br />You’re better off with glasses from the dollar store"
1.0,"These are not the best leggings I have bought, but with that they are super thin and not what you think they will be"
1.0,"This item has been previously opened.  The ""the try me button doesnt work.""  Had this put away until my son's birthday.  When I went to wrap it, saw the condition it was in.  Not happy!"
1.0,Very cheap looking. Not worth the packaging and postage.
1.0,"It’s made of mesh. Of course you can easily breath as if you’re not wearing a mask. It’s full of holes. Defeats the purpose, really. Might as well not wear one. This new money grab is funny."
1.0,Don't keep my glasses from fogging up.
1.0,There was nothing in the wash other than t-shirts and delicates so there's no excuse here. $25 for a set of pajamas that ripped almost immediately. Super thin fabric. Don't waste your money!
1.0,The size that is discribed is not accurate they Run really small
1.0,"Way larger than expected, material was flimsy as well. I am 5'1 and 110lbs.<br />Navy blue color was true color though."
1.0,this clip broke on my second use .
1.0,The locket does not remain closed. I don't think they're natural stones look more like glass. I don't recommend buying.
1.0,My son ordered 2 they broke within the first week. Small band holding together is not very strong.
1.0,Súper fea no la recomiendo se ve demasiado barata para el precio que manejan
1.0,item was returned a long time ago
1.0,"So I bought this hat with the scarf and they fit fine but why oh why do they stink? I mean like a moldy and unclean rusty smell, it’s like someone wet it and put it in the plastic immediately after and sent it out"
1.0,The quality is very cheap. The top of the boot looks like it was cut with a razor blade and wasn’t finished before it was shipped. My daughter tried to put them on the day we received them and one of the handles immediately broke off. I will definitely be returning and not purchasing from this company again. This is not the quality I was expecting from a company rated 4.5 stars.
1.0,"I received these earrings and they are stuck together. When I tried to get them apart, the rhinestone strip started to peel off as if it was glued on poorly. Will be returning."
1.0,Fabric is transparent.
1.0,This shirt is VERY short and MUCH smaller than the said size
1.0,This product came defective. One of the seams was not finished and when I tried to put it on it ripped all the way down the arm sleeve even though I only gingerly lifted the sweater.
1.0,The stitching busted loose within the first two hours of wearing them.
1.0,"Horrible, uncomfortable material. Felt like it would have been itchy to keep on longer than a few seconds. The shape is very unflattering. I got a large and it was so small that I struggled to take it off. The design is nowhere near as elegant or pretty and the picture makes it seem. Lastly, it was shorter than I expected. I like longer shirts because I don't want to worry about what's sticking out when I lift my arms.<br />Returning!!!"
1.0,"Holes near the edge of the sole (where the fabric meets in the front toe portion) appeared after one wear. The shoe is lightweight and easy to put on, but quality is not good."
1.0,I returned these leggings due to the quality I took one out of the bag and it had a hole in the leg.  Didn’t bother taking the others out. Also the sizing was so off I am athletic  built weighing about 175 and these were huge!
1.0,"Looks beautiful, but broke on the third used!"
1.0,I'm waiting for this.
1.0,No me sirvió
1.0,Fell apart after 2 months of daily use
1.0,Majority of the eyeballs fell off the headband before it arrived.
1.0,Image on shirt was discolored and not symmetrically placed on shirt.
1.0,Fit me weird
1.0,Low quality for the price
1.0,If you dont have a short torso would work well. The clasp/buttons do not clip snug so it un buttons on any move. Also does not accent the body as shown. Its straight don doesnt show curves at all.
1.0,One wear and the bottoms are completely peeling!
1.0,"After reading some reviews stating that they run small, I ordered a 3X (I usually wear XL) and it was still way too small.  The 3X looks like it would fit someone who would wear a size 8.  Very dissatisfied."
1.0,Es incómodo no good
1.0,The skirt is an A-Line and not figure flattering. I wanted a longer length because I am tall but this skirt is too long. I will be returning it.
1.0,broke in 2 sec
1.0,The screen print is sticky and has creases I'm going to be surprised if it holds up to washing
1.0,You get what you pay for!!!!!!  So CHEAP looking and manufactured.  Took FOREVER to arrive.  Luckily it was inexpensive .....would cost to much to send it back.  Into the garbage for this one.  Also won't be using this dealer again!
1.0,Cheap  But for price & Halloween its ok
1.0,much smaller than described. ordered a XXl for me and it was more like a small. ordered a 8 for my daughter and it was more like a 5.
1.0,For 6 year old girls.
1.0,"The snowman, tree, etc is so small you need a magnifying glass to see it. I am very disappointed and will be returning it."
1.0,"Very dissatisfied went to pull crown out to adjust and it feel off, I've had 5 dollar watches that were better made who do I contact for a refund, don't waste your money on this"
1.0,I did not receive the size I ordered and the one I received are to large​
1.0,skirt looks cheap
1.0,It's not good as what we can see in picture
1.0,is is small and cheap i will not buy from you again
1.0,"All of these cheap watches have pretty much the same internals, and this is no exception. I tend to replace them when the band breaks, which in this case figures to be about a week. The band is tiny, barely fits around my wrist and so thin and flimsy, it stands little chance of surviving for any length of time. Package arrived in an envelope with the box and plastic stand the watch ships on both smashed. I buy cheap plastic watches because my arm gets banged around a lot. Never got one this flimsy, though. Obviously intended for a 4 year old to play with for a couple of days before he loses it. Bave owned a lot of Casio watches over the years, but never got one this unlikely to survive. Don't buy this product. Decided to buy a different watch from a different seller via prime. Should be here in a couple of days. Need a watch so, I'll hold on to this until the one I ordered today arrives and return this one if it's not too complicated from out here in the boondocks which it frequently is."
1.0,"Do not Purchase!  Waist of money!  I received the product 01/31/11 started using it, liked it.  On 02/22/11 the clasp is already broken it will not close, and is worthless.  I have a rubber band wrapped around it!!!!!"
1.0,"it was way too small for an x lg, the dress had a s on the tag that tells me its an small."
1.0,"When I received these there was a very obvious blue dot on the left shoe. Fortunately, I didn't pay much for them so I didn't bother returning product."
1.0,"Bought for my husband who had a surgery and needed compression on his chest. This is a big joke. Material is so lax and stretchy it doesn’t compress a thing! Basically I should have just put a t shirt on him, would have had the same effect. Not a good product, should not be called compression shirts."
1.0,This hat is ridiculously huge more like a Woman's bonnet or somethings.  Gave it to my wife looking else where for a boonie hat
1.0,These may work for some young girl going to prom....not for women....As soon as you begin to perspire they begin to slide off in every direction.
1.0,"I ordered a two row earnings and received a single row! I was ripped off unable to return it, because the postage from out of country takes 4 to six weeks! So disappointed!"
1.0,Poor quality. Ripped at first use!
1.0,No lo compren es pésima calidad a la primera puesta hay que votarlo no sirve
1.0,"Very gaudy and cheap looking ,got as a gift but was embarrassed to give it.."
1.0,Product turned my wrist green. It didn't help my arthritis.
1.0,"This thing is awful,  fits like a deflated balloon doesn't hold any kind of shape and it's made out of some kind of lycra like material .<br />Save your money,  you'll be disappoint<br />PS: workmanship is poor at best"
1.0,"Bought this item from a different seller, broke in less than a month."
1.0,Do Not purchase. I took it out of the package (an envelope) and the stone came off!!
1.0,To hard to press to display clock.
1.0,Turns neck blue after a few days
1.0,Very cheap made....it is just a piece of paper or plastic with the image put behind a piece of glass. Looks like it should be a trinket out of a gumball machine
1.0,"Itchy and very small for a Men’s size, female sizes, itches poor quality fabric!"
1.0,Arrived dinghy and dirty
1.0,These socks are woven too tightly and don't fit right.
1.0,These are not sized correctly.  I usually fit a 37 Euro/6.5 American.  These say 38 on the bottom and are so floppy.  I nearly tripped in them.  Will save them for guests with larger feet.
1.0,Unflattering and shapeless. I ended up returning it.
1.0,looks NOTHING LIKE PICTURE!
1.0,Unfortunately these are very poor quality.  The fabric reminds me of cheap bead sheets. The stitching doesn’t look like it will hold up. I actually bought a size larger than usual and the pants still ran very small.
1.0,"Great masks, but falsely advertised. They show a picture of three masks, but you only receive one. Buyer be ware!"
1.0,I am 5’6” and this dress hits mid shin on me.  I am larger busted and the gathered part is right under my boobs.  Looks completely ridiculous and color looks closer to black then the blue I ordered.  Will be returning.
1.0,Just opened the package and my surprise was that the glasses have scratches
1.0,The metal pieces at the ends came off the first time I wore it
1.0,The material was thin almost lycra style.
1.0,"I had this for just a couple of months, didn't even use it all the time (have 3 other bands for this watch) it broke while I was sitting at my desk, luckily it was there and not while riding my motorcycle. If it had broken then I'd have lost this $450+ watch. DO NOT BUY YHIS PILE OF CRAP!"
1.0,"Ordered a size 2 for someone who wears a 1, so that they would have some room to grow.  The 2 is about a size too small.  If you order, order at least 2 sizes up."
1.0,very flimsy & broke easily
1.0,Fell apart immediately out of the bag. If I had enough pieces I would’ve sent it back.
1.0,Way way way tooooo small!
1.0,"These slippers now belong to Good Will, after being in my house for a short while.  Why?... because they are at least a size larger than will work for me... and they are called &#34;size 12 or 13&#34;.  I wear a shoe size 13M, and I fall out of these slippers without trying!  Not worth the expense to return or anything else, so they have been discarded, as I mentioned."
1.0,Pins fall of easy
1.0,"Horrible chemical smell. There is no tag to list what it is made of, but it is not mostly cotton as described. Feels like a bathing suit material. Yuck."
1.0,"Awful cheap fabric very scratchy, unflattering shirt cut"
1.0,"Not big enough for a women,  definitely more for a child"
1.0,Awful. Already returned.
1.0,"I have a fairly large head, but this was HUGE. It was hard to even see what it said on it when I wore it (the one time I wore it). I didn't keep it and wouldn't buy again."
1.0,"When I received this product, I thought it would look just like the picture, but it didn't which made me very unsatisfied with my product."
1.0,The seams running along the legs (back and front) is prints out and shows through your clothing. Not recommended to be worn under close fitting garments.
1.0,Not true to size! These are so tiny. They hide in your nose or pinch because they're too tight and sit so high on your septum that it doesn't look cute. I have a 16 gauge septum ring from a professional piercer/tattoo shop and these don't even come close. I'm so disappointed! They are so incredibly cheap and feel like plastic. It's been in my nose for 10 minutes and it's burning. Buyers beware!
1.0,"I ordered a small but what I received was definitely not a small. This was huge! It is definitely not a small, even though the tag said it was. It was more like an extra large. It went past my knees and was extremely baggy.  Returned item."
1.0,"Only heated the front of the foot, heat not working , barely reached warm on high setting after 1 hour!"
1.0,These earrings are very flimsy and do not stay closed. Easily bent because of how thin they are. I returned them.
1.0,Both of the hummingbirds are facing the same direction. The picture of them online are facing opposite direction. I am very disappointed because they don't look right facing the same direction. If I can get a another earring facing the opposite direction I will change my review.
1.0,Broke in less than 5 min very cheaply made do not buy
1.0,Not only did this come with a stain on the side but it doesn’t shape anything and you can see where the pads are. Worst thing I’ve ever spent my money on. Waste of time.
1.0,nice shirt  way too small
1.0,This is my second replacement I ask for it states 36 pieces I only receive 9 pieces
1.0,I bought this for my husband for Father’s Day and it started to rip after only 2 uses:(
1.0,"At first this bag was great.  It's big enough to hold a lot of stuff while still looking nice and professional.<br />I used it daily for less than a month when it suddenly broke.  The stitching that holds the cross body strap came apart...leaving my bag to fall and empty onto the floor.  Boooooo.<br />While i did use the bag daily, i didn't abuse it and throw it around.  It was gently used, so i was very disappointed that it broke.<br />Poor quality i guess."
1.0,"The initial greeting ""TO MY DAUGHTER"" is off centered..."
1.0,i spent the last of my money on these and they turned my fingers green and even when i put nail polish on them they turned completely brown and ugly. :(
1.0,I really liked the jacket at first but I ordered my size which is Large but it was way too small. So I ordered the XL but it was way too big. So I tried washing but it doesn't shrink. The fit for the jacket isn't good. Very cheap material for the price. The stitching inside ripped and one of the pockets after 1 day. I would not recommend buying this. Rather pay more and get a better brand with good material.
1.0,No me agradó que una pieza llegó quebrada
1.0,The suction almost sucks my children’s eye balls out of their head. Terrible design
1.0,"I can not believe they thought shipping like this was a good idea. Talk about sad. The second I snap these back into place they are going to break, I have tried this before and I know they either will break immediately or soon thereafter.<br />Update: tested, item is NOT STERLING SILVER"
1.0,Cute. But it broke after my second use.. and i literally went no where with it.
1.0,I just unwrapped this tee-shirt and it has glue or something like glue right in front about a foot long. This was going to be a Bday present. Now I have to go out and buy something else. I missed the return date.
1.0,"Very pretty ring, BUT it lost the silver color real quick and stained my finger. it also caused an irritation on my finger. not a good ring"
1.0,"The product fit, but after just one wear the gold sparkles come off and you're left with large patches of just yellow. Definitely not worth the price."
1.0,Uhm where’s the slip? It’s a bathing suit coverup at best. You get what you pay for
1.0,There way longer than expected the skulls dobt look right thinner than expected lol i can see thw outline of my lips. Ummm overall. Boo waste of 17$ but the shipping was fast for nothing lol
1.0,Broke in 2 days
1.0,Just made everything yellow. Didn’t notice any benefits.
1.0,I didn’t like these at all! They’re not made of a weird fabric & they were way too big! They wouldn’t fit my adult size head! I’ve never purchased a headband that fell off my head.
1.0,They don’t fit Victoria’s Secret bras
1.0,Bought it for birthday gift for granddad who is crazy about tigers.  Too large for her to wear & I think it’s even too large for an adult to wear.
1.0,"Way too small for a teenage boy even. Great product, just no breathing room. Feels like a corset"
1.0,Not a high impact bra at all. Uniboob with no separation. Like what I wore when I wore two bras to run.
1.0,I ware baseball caps every day and these fit poorly to say the least.<br />They are inexpensive but virtually un wearable.
1.0,The dress looked like the picture but had some sort of animal hair all over it.
1.0,"Too tiny. XL didn't fit. I'm 5'4, and it didn't even cover my behind. Color is pretty. Should be sold as shrunken shirt. Plus, it's not prewashed, so, it will shrink more, I assume. Returning"
1.0,"Very upset! The Picture had black buttons, this shirt has white buttons!"
1.0,If you think you take a large get close or xxl size is very off
1.0,Ordered a 5X and it fit my friend who is size 1X. Not American sizing!
1.0,Its too small for my 3 years old baby i bought larger size than my baby's size but still small
1.0,Washed once then they became the quality of pj bottoms. Would NOT recommend
1.0,"""Rollin' with ti"" is what it says... Spelling error. Sending back. Do not order."
1.0,"These are nice folks but there really is no effective return policy from the US. They make good products (I've purchased twice from them before) but you better get your size right the first time. I tried USPS, UPS and DHL and the cost of returning the item was far greater than what I paid for it. They refuted this in my emails to them (they were polite) but I have no reason to make this up - I would have loved to send it back and gotten the correct size. It is notable that the sizes are not consistent across all of their products. So, now I am stuck with items that do not fit.<br /><br />Nice people, good products, BUT cost prohibitive returns from the US (get your size right the first time!)"
1.0,The coloring of the bottom lost all of its color in a week.
1.0,Don't waste your money with this foolishness.
1.0,This is HORRIBLE it looks like a trash bag! Cheap material.
1.0,Beautiful but it arrived broken in several places.
1.0,My head is average. These are too tight across my face and the adjustable arms aren’t long enough to reach my ears. These are for children or tiny adults.
1.0,REVISED REVIEW. I really liked them in Jan and Feb but now (May) they're falling apart. I did not wash them and I am the only once who touches them. The lining is separating from the mask. Now it bothers my eyes and nose so bad I'll either have to cut out the lining or throw them away.<br />Blocks ALL light better than any I've tried before.
1.0,"Beautiful material, but too thin for this dress.  The stitching was not up to standards.  Definite Knock off.  Returned"
1.0,Threading on the top of the slipper came apart by the second day. I sit with my legs crossed while watching TV in the evening. Just the bottom of one slipper rubbing against the other wears through the fabric in just a few swipes.
1.0,Item was a gift for my sister and it was ripped when she received it.
1.0,only had for a few days and it broke apart.
1.0,Was happy with it ; then the right glove  after wearing it for a few days got teared appart for no reasons ..;(
1.0,I would give 0 stars if i could<br />Its not oversized and it was uneven on the face<br />Save your money but something better<br />Dont waste $10 on this<br />Cheap plastic
1.0,"I got less pieces than promised, also the pieces I got weren't even the pieces shown in the picture! I am very dissatisfied with this product!"
1.0,"Gets tangled too easily due to cheaply made design. Took forever to ship, so long I'd actually forgotten I'd ordered it!"
1.0,Poor quality and runs very small
1.0,I wanted reading glasses that was strong and would last a very long time.  Not these the lens fell out of the frame the very next day.
1.0,"Fits way different than other Zohara tights - could barely get them on & they ripped to shreds before I could even really wear them. These are for smaller bodies than the 120 denir zohara tights and I will not be ordering sheer ones from this company again. The opaque ones fit great, though, so it was an honest mistake."
1.0,The material was very very thin and the quality of the material was terrible.
1.0,"Love the jumpsuit, but zipper broke after my son wore 3 times. Money down the drain"
1.0,"I received this band today. Was packaged in a ziplock sandwich bag, and the clasp that locks it in the watch was broken so won’t lock. Didn’t know I was getting a used broken product. Not worth the time to send back since it was not expensive so went in the trash."
1.0,"I'm 5'4 and this dress does not come to my calfs, a maxi should reach thr floor. Just horrible."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:ce29933897ef57df8b8a28b6e79ab4a4]] Just opened this gift for my grandson. It looks like some rubbed red paint down the front of the shirt.<br /><br />Very disappointed.
1.0,color is wayyyyy off and material looks different in person than pictured.
1.0,I’m very disappointed. The necklace turned black.
1.0,The glue came off when I got it.. 😔
1.0,"This is very cute for a costume. However, the package said large and the actual jacket size is small. I needed it for Halloween, so I ordered early. Now I'm scrambling to find something else for my costume."
1.0,"Shown as a size 40, but was not, there was no indication of a size differentiation of whether these were US or Asian sizes, so far I've been really disappointed by my clothing purchases on Amazon...shirts have been fine, underwear and socks fine...but pants have been a 50/50 thing and shorts have been a total miss...I don't understand why If I order a size 40 I am not getting a size 40 and I'm ordering through Prime...it's almost insulting.<br />I understand expanding into different markets, but it should not be at the expense of the existing markets...not happy."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:d0b729e3acb4ccd5feba092d98a25e50]] They are very expensive googles and the quality is the worst, I have several brands and they are not worth it for the high price you pay."
1.0,"These are see-through! I am a size 4 dress and bought an extra small. They fit tight but not too tight. Unfortunately you can see my underwear through them. With their return policy, I have to pay four dollars in shipping. Will try to resell them instead. Total waste of money."
1.0,Such a good looking watch. husband just started wearing it a few weeks ago and it is already ripping
1.0,"Sizing wrong. This is not a belt for a 40&#34; waist as tsated, it's a 40&#34; long belt"
1.0,These shrink after you wash them.  Only got to wear them once before they were too short in the legs.
1.0,Not at all what I expected. The lenses were hard to change. Just didn't like it.
1.0,returned it. lasted perhaps 30 minutes on the bike then was already showing wear.  no thank you.
1.0,I returned this dress. The material felt cheap and shiny. The underside of the dress was very itchy and uncomfortable.
1.0,Broke 2 weeks after purchasing.
1.0,Way too big more like a us 4x not a 14/16 as the description says
1.0,"This was broken when I received it, and I had waited a while to receive it."
1.0,"Shorts arrived today. They are nice looking and seem to be reasonably made for the price. The problem is they were not made to fit a live human being. Forget the inseam: there is no crotch in these shorts. When I tried them on I found there is no way NOT to expose the top 4 inches of my boxer briefs. So these at intentionally made as ‘plumbers pants’. Also, the front ‘pockets’ are ridiculous. I wear a large size glove. My hands haven’t been small enough to fit into those pockets since I was 10 years old. Not sure if I’ll take the time to return them, but I can never wear them. DO NOT RECOMMEND"
1.0,This is not the same print as advertised nor are the flowers the same color. This is a look a like. I will be returning this blouse
1.0,Shirt came delivered with a huge grease stain on the front. Took 1 and a half weeks to receive. Disappointing as this is the product I really wanted.
1.0,"I've seen these types of cooling scarves before and thought it would be similar, but all this is is a cheaply made cloth scarf with a tiny bit of gel, and I dont even think the gel is cooling gel because it remained at room tempature even while inside the house at 73°.<br /><br />  I kayak a lot, and have used several ways to cool myself. I thought this would be a smaller version of what I've been using. (Those larger cooling towel things.) So I was excited to try it.<br /><br /> First thing I noticed was a lack of the gel crystals, but decided to wet it down with cold tap water and try it anyhows.  sitting at my desk in an air conditioned house its only cooling relief came from the cloth being wet. Once that became body temperature the cooling wore off. I would say maybe 10-15 minutes.  I felt for those few gel crystals and they were even room temp, not cool at all. How do they expect you to cool off if the gel crystals aren't even cool?<br /><br />  If you need something to keep you cool on hot days, look else where.<br /><br />If you want a cheaply made scarf to wear around your neck, this is the item for you.<br /><br />Honest Review by someone who did NOT receive any discount on this item."
1.0,"Did not care for the dress it was more like I long tee shirt. Neck was tight and again like a tee shirt.<br />I kept it to sleep in, but it's even uncomfortable for that."
1.0,"It made my old reliable dark-brown leather Sperry boat shoes look dull and washed-out;  it turned them into an ugly  streaky light-tanish color.  Over the years I've used different liquid silicones on these shoes and on many other leathers;  and, I've never had anything but positive results.  This product seemed to bleach-out the rich look my shoes always previously had."
1.0,"Not at all like the elegant picture. Cheap looking, One of the rubber cushions on the clip backing was missing. Gaudy junk.Returned."
1.0,The first time I wore the white pair the seam along the waist began to unravel and it won’t stop unraveling. Otherwise they are great in terms of fit and comfort. But I don’t want underwear that falls apart the first time I wear it
1.0,These headbands are not described correctly- you can a better quality headband at the dollar tree.<br />Broke within minutes of putting it on<br />Save your money!
1.0,Sizing wrong! About 4 sizes to small. Gave them to my daughter
1.0,Cheap and glue all over. I returned for a refund.
1.0,"if i could give no stars, i would. i ordered the clear rings for my job and these are so not a 16 gauge. they’re so tiny i can’t even get them into my nose. they’re thin as paper and break with the slightest touch! this is ridiculous. i need clear nose rings for my job that i start monday and now i have to go spend more money to get some that are the right size! i also didn’t get 20 in the mail, i got like 10. so that was not cool either. wouldn’t recommend to ANYONE! buy from a diffrent company. D bella is no good. i’m so upset."
1.0,Don't waste your money or time .  The bracelet is junk. It's so fake.  Poor quality clasp is too wide. Color is off. Fake fake fake
1.0,Aún no he recibido el artículo...
1.0,I wish I didn't waste my money
1.0,This skirt does not have pockets.  I returned it immediately.
1.0,"These leggings were weird purplish color rather than the blue I expected, the fabric was extremely cheap and after wearing them once for a few hours I noticed lots of little snag runs all over them. I'm pretty sure that once they get washed they will be going straight in the trash afterwards because they'll be ruined. Save your money, buy something else."
1.0,The dress did not fit well at all. Way too short and did not lay right across the chest.
1.0,"Cute earrings, and they come in an adorable box.  I bought these as a birthday gift for my daughter who loves elephants, and they really are cute -- she would love them.  However, the company sent me 2 &#34;right&#34; earrings (instead of a right and a left, as pictured).  It's like being sent 2 &#34;right&#34; shoes!  It just doesn't look right to have the elephants both facing in the same direction... Earrings should create a symmetrical look.  So I sent these back (thank you, Amazon Prime!) and will try ordering them again...Fingers crossed for the 2nd attempt!"
1.0,I ordered my size based on their size chart. It was way too small. I mean not just like a little bit. It had to be mis-marked based on pictures I've seen posted of other women who purchased this dress and are the same size as I am. Returned.
1.0,Ordered a xl. It runs small.
1.0,"These seem to be quality goggles, only problem is blurry vision under water. Fine above, clear as can be but go under and blurry vision."
1.0,"Their XL says 36"" hips. That's usually a medium. That's Marilyn Monroe, and nobody would call her an extra-large."
1.0,"School has been in for less than a month and the entire set is falling apart. The keychain didn’t last through the first day of school. The lunch bag Velcro stitching is coming apart. The backpack water bottle holder does not hold water bottles. We have already lost 2, including the one that came with the set. We are looking for a new set."
1.0,Incredibly cheap and stitched horribly
1.0,It was to small for my daughter
1.0,"Too small. Breast sag. Cheap quality. Uncomfortable. The only thing I liked about it was the zero hassle return. As for my ladies, they did not approve."
1.0,Didn't like it wasn't what I expected.
1.0,DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD ON MONEY ON THIS CHEAP SH*T.WILL NO CLAMP AND STAY ON CORRECTLY. FOUGHT IT FOR 15 MINUTES TRYING BOTH SIDES BOTH STRAPS.👎
1.0,"The print is huge and makes the shirt look just absolutely dumb. HUGE waste of money. Looks like a BRO shirt. Ya know, like someone who doesn't know who the misfits are but wants a skull tee. Literally can't wear it. I have it to my kid for a nightgown."
1.0,The pads for the breast are weird. They are perfect circles plus they’re not attached on the inside of the top; they move around. So imagine this perfect little small circle of pad is moving around as try to adjust your top.
1.0,Horrible dress bad quality
1.0,"It funnels monies from tired apolitical old white men and subservient wives to the self-profitting mode fake newsmaker. It easily satisfies the owner's desperation for some leader regardless of chaos sowed. This cap embodies rural America's last stand and easily identifies those who'll lose their medical care, rendering their seeing Jesus that much sooner. The cap protects the owner from rain but not the impending diplomatic doom which will spawn trade wars which will make [foreign nation] great again. Use this cap to salute the finale of America as other greater nations are made yet greater."
1.0,Screen doesn't lay flat against phone screen
1.0,Took 3 weeks to get here and is very cheaply made. Iris fell out when I opened it
1.0,"I wore this only once when the chain simply snapped in half. I was hoping for much better quality... It's a pretty necklace, but needs to be more durable."
1.0,My daughter has had this chain for 9 months and it just broke. She doesn’t wear it to bed nor does she wear it when she showers. She took very good care of it but it still broke. Waste of money.
1.0,"Big, clunky piece of poor craftsmanship! Do not order this! When I sent it back as an Amazon Prime return I was refunded only $20 of the $49.99 purchase."
1.0,They come really small.
1.0,They were like waders on my kids legs...
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!!!! I bought this and when I got it I was so exited to wear it. After the first day of wearing I’m bruised up and down both forearms (I wore it on both hands that day). So I did some research how tigers eye could cause this, and come to find out some Tigers Eye is dangerous to wear because it has ASBESTOS in it! Now I just have to eat the cost because this item cannot be returned! I have never been so unsatisfied."
1.0,The glasses do not block blue light. They are mislabeled.
1.0,ORDER THREE SIZES ALL WERE TOO SMALL
1.0,"Despite the mixed reviews, I decided to try these because I have a backless dress. I ordered a DD and it was, maybe, big enough for a C cup. That unfortunate thing was, if it was big enough, it probably would've worked. Lining up the holes for the nipples, did not allow enough of the bra to fit around the sides. Highly disappointed because I am running out of time to find a bra to wear with my backless dress."
1.0,Much shorter then it looks in the picture and the red color isn't as deep
1.0,These would be great if they were not held together with glue. Each color that was ordered came a part in the same place on the temple. I really like the design however the product is poorly structured. The reason there are so many pairs is because I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt. I have tried reaching out but it seems to be a slow process.
1.0,Broke after two uses. And the point was too dull to pass through fabric
1.0,It was fitted not loose fitting
1.0,Way too small. 3xl fits like a large would fit! Big men don't waste your money!
1.0,Very thin fabric pills quickly I won’t buy them again
1.0,I went by the size chart on this should be put out there for little children nowhere near the size it said with it would be
1.0,"I ordered an 18mm, but received a 22 mm that is way to big for my fit bit.  Too much of a hassle to return."
1.0,these companies are crap product never as described!!
1.0,"Purchased last minute....literally arrived the day before, for Christmas photos, wanted the matching headband. If its not included it should not be shown or stated so you clearly know it"
1.0,This dress was too big when it came in and when I try it out it was a see-through like you could see through it to your underwears and your bras so with that I dislike it
1.0,My screen protector was missing from the package. Band wasn't as described
1.0,It got a rip in the sleeve after not even a month.
1.0,After wearing it for a few weeks the pentagram fell out.
1.0,Picture wasn’t that great.
1.0,You all need to be more accurate with your sizes. Fits too small
1.0,Not good quality broke in 2 days
1.0,I dislike this dress very much. It looks very pretty in the picture provided by the seller but when I receive it quality is not good and it's big. It said it recommended to one size down and I did but still too big to me. I am not happy at all.
1.0,Numbers were incorrect on board and we received two of the same running back stickers and were missing a whole sheet of running backs. Also missing cam newton on quarterback labels. Not worth the money
1.0,Didn’t like them at all. The handles were on the opposite sides. Waste of money
1.0,This shirt was not what I was expecting...very limp material. I actually returned this shirt
1.0,"This item is NOT in stock here or anywhere. The HD359 is much wider and not attractive on a narrow face with short hair. The manufacturer (Viva) quoted my optician mid to late July for delivery, if they don't discontinue the model as some have been known to do. Shame on them and Amazon for misleading customers!"
1.0,"They are not soft at all. I thought they would be more flexible in order to get the mask elastic through but they are closer to a plastic instead of a flexible silicon.<br />When your threading elastic through you need flexibility of the holes in order to pull the elastic thru, I tried needle nose tweezers and other fine tipped tools but could not get the elastic thru the smaller hole.<br />In the picture I am applying pressure to show the hardness. I<br />Not a fan."
1.0,I bought these dresses before in a longer version and love them. But this one the whole elastic part came out and now the dress is worthless. Wore 1 time. Smh. Bad quality.
1.0,"We've had this crown for a few months now, and almost all of the jewels have fallen out of it. Very disappointed."
1.0,This product is a scam. It was not nude. How difficult is it to sell a nude stocking? I mean Isnt this why it was invented?
1.0,"Gloves are very cute, I love the style.  The gloves are not red, they were maroon."
1.0,"Appears to be very small, not even close to size 10-12"
1.0,After wearing for a couple of days my ear had an allergic reaction thats not common I don't know  but it doesn't seem to be fully stainless steel
1.0,"This was very disappointing. Where to begin... It is cream and black, not white and black. The material is thin and feels like the lining of a cheap jacket (slippery but somehow rough). It is utterly transparent on the cream areas. It is a shapeless tube with not enough stretch to be form fitting in any size."
1.0,The radar doesn't work. I'm so disappointed on it.
1.0,"It should have sa, kid's shirt. Quality of the picture on the shirt is awful"
1.0,This looked like it should be part of a monk halloween costume. Not to wear as a cross every day
1.0,I have other styles in this brand and this one is like toddlers underwear.. I have a 34w so bought the XL and they are cut way too narrow in the leg openings no room in the crotch.. I like the meshy material and that’s it.
1.0,Trying very hard to return this. Purchase for my wife as a birthday present. Open and find out that it’s for a baby doll or a young adult.  Description should be naughty nighttime attire.
1.0,One of them ripped the first 10 min.:(
1.0,The top is size 6 and the bottom size 14
1.0,I loved them when i first got them. But then i took a nap an 2 hours later my fingers were green where the rings were at. 😡😔 Horrible sorry.
1.0,"I gave it a 1 star, I liked it but the earrings came broken and I bought it for a gift,"
1.0,I have very small hands and these wouldn’t even go on my hands. It says they are Womens size but they are more like Childrens size. Do not recommend
1.0,Poor product. They don’t clasp in place. Threw them out. Not worth 5 bucks.
1.0,Dress was way too big on me. But it alsondidn’t look like the photo. The gold sequence layer was much longer than the inner lining. It also smells like chemicals.
1.0,Too small. It doesn’t fit right and the material is so cheap
1.0,"Not a great product. Looks cheap, falling apart almost immediately & they’re unfinished basically. I don’t recommend this. My wife was not happy."
1.0,Dress is shorter in the front and longer in the back. That is not how this dress is described or the way it looks in the picture.
1.0,There is no glittery buckle. The bottoms wore off within an hour of walking.
1.0,"My son has been wearing stride rite shoes since he was born. This is the first pair that have caused blisters on the back of his feet. Also, the overall quality seems poor. They don't hold up and look old after one month of normal wear."
1.0,"Horrible quality and slightly small (ankle). The socks look terrible after first wash. I attached a picture, the socks on top is a different brand after multiple washes. The lower pic is this socks, completely twisted, almost unusable."
1.0,"I see little to no effect, pun intended.<br />Waste of money."
1.0,It does not indicate that there is only one bracelet and not a pair.  I certainly would not have ordered 1 hand!
1.0,The design on the front was not as advertised in the picture. And the material was a cheap feeling disappointing thin material.
1.0,"Stiff leather, large zipper make the bag look like like a knock off. Very disappointed for the price."
1.0,Clasp does not stay closed if you grab by the handle.
1.0,gift for my daughter. haven't seen her wear it yet
1.0,Zero stars. Unfortunately that's not an option
1.0,Really cheap material. I bought a large and it mine as well have been an XS.<br />Not for curvy women or women with a booty or boobs! This would definitely fit if you're a size 2 with A-B cup and very small booty. The material was not very stretchy so It was hard to get it on too.
1.0,Poor Material... Fit was odd
1.0,did not work i wore themin 100 degree full sun lense did not darken
1.0,I expected these to be cheap but not defective. Plating chipping on some. There are deformities that look like tiny round burn spots.
1.0,This ring is not rose gold. It’s silver-toned and oddly shaped. Not very comfortable on the hand.
1.0,Unfortunately these gloves are worthless for cold weather. I live in Chicago and tried the gloves the day after receiving them. Within several minutes my finger tips were very COLD!!!. I will attempt to return these worthless gloves.
1.0,cheap material. Fake pull string. My 3 year old won't wear them at all
1.0,"Sorry but the side pockets sag out, it gives a strange look."
1.0,"2nd pair in 2 months - SAME ISSUE, coating flakes off almost instantly.<br /><br />I had these new lenses for 2 weeks and the iridescent coating started wearing off!  Totally wrecked.  May be has something to do with wearing them on the sea?  Also, I had another pair, the wizard ones, super cool looking and comfortable and they did the same thing after 3 months.  I thought it was a fluke so I bought these.  Unbelievable!?!  To the manufacturers, please fix this issue.  I love the glasses and had to rub all the coating off to use them.  Now I'm not sure if they're still 100% UV rated."
1.0,Poor sizing. I got a 3x (I wear an xl) and it was still too tight. I had to give it to my 11 year old granddaughter to play house in!!
1.0,"These were too tight in the lower legs. And the material is NOT 100% cotton. It was a cotton/poly blend, which for me is not an option. I hate polyester! Gross. What a waste to make things with crappy material. How much are they really saving like that? I LOVED the polka dots & what looked like a super cool design. But this was only terribly disappointing. I immediately contacted the seller to return them. Their customer service was impeccable. I wish their pants were too."
1.0,The material and the size
1.0,The don’t lay flush. I basically purchased a bad set of nose rings.
1.0,These face masks are supposed to be for kids they are extremely big. I'm an adult.
1.0,"I’ve since learned that there are toxic elements in this even though it was advertised as non-toxic. I had a skin reaction after wearing these, and had to wash them 8x to get the chemical smell out."
1.0,The dress is very cheaply made! The style and concept is cute but horrible quality!!! The button holes are way too large for the buttons and there were threads hanging from the dress everywhere.<br />It is also very thin material so you can see right through it.  Very disappointed because the style and print is so cute!!
1.0,Buckle broke the first time I put them on. Decided to upgrade to sidis!
1.0,I was thoroughly upset with the quality of this product when I received it in the mail stones were missing and it was bent. I will never buy from kiss Pat again.
1.0,Unbelievably small!!! Way too short and way to small; looks like it would fit a 10 year old boy instead of a small adult male! Need to order 2 sizes larger than normal and I was ordering these for my skinny teenager; I would hate to see even a small adult male think he could fit into these!!!
1.0,"Material is rough, it hurts, size XXL doesn't fit my legs. I am a 10 size but it is ridiculously made for some stick or something like that."
1.0,This is crap do not buy turned my finger green
1.0,The jacket came in so small I couldn’t get it on!
1.0,Is a garbage
1.0,"This was supposed to be one size fits all. When I received it and tried it on, it would more have suited a child, rather than an adult. Had to return."
1.0,I bought these for my granddaughter for Xmas & she only wore them a couple of months & one boot ripped in ithe back.
1.0,"Zipper was too small. If you are busty, this is not the dress for you.  Love the design though!"
1.0,I ordered a size up and it was still way too small! Fabric was not as expected either. Very sheer and felt very poor quality.
1.0,After one wear necklace turned black. Horrible! Not only that I went to sleep with it and woke up with a horrible rash from the neckalace! Very dissappinted since seller stated item is gold plated! Do not buy!!
1.0,The dress would have been really cute... Had the pockets been sewn in the same place on the sides of the dress! One pocket was sewn so low it was only a couple of inches from the bottom hem! I am so mad because I needed it for a Sunday brunch tomorrow!
1.0,The pockets in them give the illusion that my hips are huge!
1.0,It dnt fit
1.0,Didn’t run true to size
1.0,"Everything in here falls apart QUICK. The only thing worthwhile is the shoe polish, expect everything else to wear out or break after a vigorous polish or two. If you can even mange that with tools so tiny. I actually still have the 'big' brush, it's pretty stiff, so I use it to scrape debris off my work shoes before polishing them with some much better tools."
1.0,Looks very cheap..29$ was too much..just my opinion though
1.0,Sadly my brother was unable to wear these as they came horribly smashed. They are very flat.
1.0,"I ordered an infant size 4, which was what was photographed and described.  I did a double take because as soon as I hit the order button, a totally different sandal showed in the photograph, but when I re-read the description, it said it was sending me exactly what I had originally thought I was ordering.  When I got it, NOPE! They sent me a pair of sandals large enough for a middle-schooler."
1.0,Not at all what I was expecting. The pads moves around and the straps does not stay in place.
1.0,Cheap material… don’t buy !
1.0,"Really liked it at first, but after wearing it 3 (THREE) times, part of the fabric completely lost its color. Bought it in May 2018 and by end of August 2018 it is no longer wearable."
1.0,"Too small, came apart when I tried to expand the ring. Couldn't fit even my little finger"
1.0,Breaks very easily.
1.0,"The size was too big for me but in addition, the materials used was of very LOW QUALITY. I promptly returned the same day."
1.0,Runs small. Bought two of them and they both fit different.
1.0,"I regularly wear a size 44W-32L and stand at 6'2 foot. Not only was the pants to long, it fit loosely around my beer belly. I did not want to give it three stars because it was likely my fault for choosing the wrong pants size.<br /><br />UPDATE: What the hell. So I made plans to wear the pants tomorrow despite it being to big for me and struggled greatly to snap the stupid thing together when trying them on. After wrestling with the pants to do that, the snapper came off when I sat down. HOW!!!! The pants are to big on me for such a thing to happen. It's so dumb. So yes, do not buy those pants."
1.0,I have small hands (size 5 ring) and the medium was too tight. That is ridiculous. Nice looking gloves and see like pretty good quality but the sizing needs to be better. In no world should a medium be tight.
1.0,They fit fine but there's a hole in the pocket and in the seem of the leg I guess I'm going to have to get a needle and thread and fix it myself bc there so cheaply made thanks for the waste of time and money
1.0,Did not look anything like the picture.  Size runs small
1.0,[[VIDEOID:b41c826f2fbe0749ececf80dc949999b]] Pretty but not real silver. Very disappointed
1.0,"Nice quality fabric on hoodie, but bad quality control on silkscreening…lopsided and diagonal.  My wife actually started laughing when I put it on “You can’t wear that!”  Really bummed because I was excited for Boca hoodie.  I debated an exchange, but afraid they screened x100 like this in a row on the machine?!?"
1.0,Its fake and too small want a refund
1.0,Goggles looked perfect and had a comfortable cushion eye sockets. I also loved the clip on/off button for the goggles instead of pulling them over your head. The real unfortunate side is that both pair of goggles were clear outside the water but once you went in the water then everything was blurry. No leaking and did not touch the lenses. We ensured the plastic coating was taken off as well. With all of the other attributes these would have been the perfect pair but unfortunately the blurry vision made them unusable.
1.0,Se rompio en menos de 2 meses. Solo duro mitad de un invierno.
1.0,It was way too small for my eight year old
1.0,The item was poor quality the feathers were cheap 1 layer n not worth the price. The feathers were sewn on terribly and threading was coming a loose. Satin was but wasn't exact replica of picture. I GOT A CHEAPER VERSION
1.0,It was not as pictured on line.  Very disappointed  cheap looking material.
1.0,Shirt was small for the size. The material was cheep and didn't hold shape. The necklace is made from plastic and the finish was scratched and chipped.
1.0,Missing buttons and coming apart at the seams. Not worth the buy for such a crappy quality product. How dare a company send this to a customer!
1.0,Material is way too thin....
1.0,Sweater arrived with spots & fraying<br />Returning
1.0,It came missing a few rhinestones
1.0,They broke before I even got to use them once. Piece of junk.
1.0,Ordered a Medium. I wear a 4 and medium was 4/6. The bottoms were WAAAY to tiny and the top was huge. Maybe if I had DDs it might have fit. Didn’t even fit in the band though....
1.0,Bottoms way too small and top poor quality. Very cheap looking.
1.0,"The garter belt was extremely small, I couldn’t get it to fit at all. Only for really tiny people. I usually wear a size large for undergarments and leggings and this did not fit at all."
1.0,False advertising this is not a licensed product it is a cheap knock off from China! Very disappointed
1.0,"The fit on the sweater was okay, but it is being returned because the color is WAY off.  I bought this sweater based on the picture as it shows a deep and dark emerald green which is what I was looking for to match a pair of shoes.  I received the sweater and it is a bright turquoise!  Super disappointed in the color difference."
1.0,It's all RIBS under the shoe insert for your foot to sit on. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.  Must be made in China. More JUNK
1.0,This delivered broken.  Cheap ..
1.0,"UPDATE: Just received a second pair with the same issue. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY<br /><br />I’m not one for reviews, but these shorts are actually really good quality! I can’t even fit my leg In them though. I ordered an XL and they sent me a Medium and in XL labeled bag. Was super excited to get these, hope I get the right size."
1.0,No stretch at all. Terrible.
1.0,Did not fit. Small for the size.
1.0,Soft and cute but I don’t know what the people are on saying this keeps them “warm”. I’m in southern CA and it’s 62 degrees out tonight in December. This jacket ain’t keeping me any bit warm.
1.0,"This pendant was the biggest waste of money, it is cheaply made & looks it. I will never buy from this company again. Very disappointed in this piece of jlry & if I had the time I would send back but Christmas is almost here & can't."
1.0,To cheap.
1.0,I can’t even give this product 1 star but to leave a review I have to. Nothing like the picture at all. This cover up is suppose to be long and elegant. What I got was a boxy looking fabric. I am 5’10 and it goes right below my knees. I weigh 130 and I am willing to bet three of me could fit width wise. What I am reviewing is the lace cardigan cover up.
1.0,Material was completely different than advertised
1.0,"I agree with other reviewer that this thing even at it's loosest was too tight on my bicep. And Im pretty skinny. Also I hate these types of straps, such a pain in the ass to adjust anyway."
1.0,Very disappointed with this. Bought for my husband and it fell apart the same day he wore it.
1.0,It broke 3 days after I had it. Ah well. My loss.
1.0,I could not even get my toes to the end of these shoes.  Very narrow.  Would not recommend these shoes at all!
1.0,Paint chipped after daughter wore it once on her bracelet. Like the entire front edge was gray with few blue specks
1.0,"I ordered size 10. The stickers said size 10, but when you look at the bottom of the slippers they say 11. They feel like cardboard and have no comfort or support."
1.0,"The product showed up in on time. Well<br />Package and looks even better in person! I love them!<br /><br />Update on 9/19/17: after waking them for less then a month these earring turned my EARS GREEN! I have never had gauges do that before!!!! I am so disappointed, I loved these when they came in!!!"
1.0,"The lens width is stated to be 60 millimeters.  This is incorrect.  I believe the seller meant to write that the length is 60 millimeters, as the width is 37mm.  Still though, the length is 58mm.  I purchased the clip ons on that basis as my prescription lens length is 62mm.  False advertising!!!"
1.0,Cheaply made. Garbage. It says painted but It looks like rhinestones in the picture. Definitely not rhinestone.
1.0,The shirt fits me but it's so incredibly short that there is no way to wear it. Waste of money
1.0,"Writing this review will most likely accomplish nothing, as all the fake reviews have pushed this product above the four star mark. Wonder how much money they shelled out for all those reviews.<br /><br />Either way, these are terrible socks. At roughly $4 bucks a pair, you would be better off picking up a nice pair from a department store. The socks came frayed and with holes in them. Holes!<br /><br />Combiner that with a cheap feel and a less than 50% wool by weight and you get a cheap, overpriced, defective 5 pack of socks."
1.0,Right shoe had very uncomfortable lump under the ball of right foot. Package was shipped in original box wrapped in a plastic shipping envelope. Original box was damaged. Just was a poor experience overall. Returned these and bought Skechers locally 30% cheaper and way more comfortable.
1.0,Not happy at all I have a wedding coming up and the purple suspenders don't even match the bow tie very upset!
1.0,feel apart immediately
1.0,The top was too small and the pants were so long they would fit a teenager. Someone new on the assembly  line. Shiny material. CHINA
1.0,"Very disappointed in the quality of this synthetic material. Hangs like a big sack, regret I ordered it."
1.0,"I typically wear an XXL or 1x and well endowed. I have a partial corset (chest is not covered, so you need an undertop) and love it.<br />I was excited to get this but no doing. I ordered a 4x, thinking I could cinch it up. It would not touch to zip up!<br />Check out those size charts and order big. You can always tighten it up."
1.0,I wish I never brought this . It’s not easy to put or take off . Just bulky . Don’t get this . You can have mine is so .
1.0,A child hat not for an adult even a large size!!
1.0,Cheap material. Ran small
1.0,"beautiful print, horrible fit. Would recommend purchasing multiple sizes and returning the ones that don't work out for you."
1.0,Very bad quality...damage after one week of usage
1.0,"The bracelet looks like the picture. However, after wearing it for 3 days the leather is starting to peel and come apart.  While the price was right - I was hoping for better quality."
1.0,Returned it because the cut was really weird!  The Mickey front went way to high.  Looked really lame!
1.0,"The skirt part is sewn on to low. It wants to fit very low on your belly , making you appear like you have it under your belly, not attractive at all"
1.0,"The size are Not accurate, reordered 3 times.<br />Customer service is a hot mess!"
1.0,Waited over a month to receive this item (I am a prime member) when it finally arrived it was a pair of panties!!!!! Not at all even close to similar!
1.0,"Did not like it... had to return it, the dress practically was see-through. I do not recommend it."
1.0,"Don't buy this! Not cute like the picture. It's tiny, for the size M it was more like an XS. It's so thin the white material is see through even before getting wet. Horrible product."
1.0,Super mad. They broke after one hour.
1.0,Very stiff and cheaply made.
1.0,This dress is more of a stiff fabric it isn't the satin fabric like it says so it makes the top poke out on the sides and it feels really uncomfortable to wear I wouldn't recommend
1.0,"Me gustan los pantalones cortos con cintura alta, y en la foto se ve alta pero no lo son, siento que perdí mi dinero con este artículo..... Quiero mi dinero."
1.0,Broke after a few days.
1.0,I was really excited for this. Seam ripped open after only 2 days. It is tight like other reviews mention and I have a tiny wrist. Really disappointed I only got 2 days wear out of it.
1.0,There’s a horsetail seam on the back if this sweater that looks so cheap. Sent it back immediately.
1.0,The bracelet broke after 2 weeks
1.0,This was a lesson in product quality. It arrived broken with the start/stop button not working. Useless.
1.0,They were humongous
1.0,After 2 months of wearing them. Rust is starting so come out in the back side where my skin touches the metal clips on my calves. Kind of annoying.
1.0,"So If u like extremely tiny pj’s in itchy weird orange fabric u can see thru,AND cheaply made, these are your jams...  look no further!  If your not a huge person but u want to know what it would feel like to gain 6 sizes suddenly, u really have to try these!  IfMy size 2 granddaughter couldn’t fit in them never mind my size 6-8 rear!  Very cheap fabric snd not the color pictured but a very orange color.  I own an exotic cattery so I know what this print SHOULD really be looking like!"
1.0,I rate it as ok but would not purchase again.
1.0,"Worked for about 4 months, sent email to seller but no answer."
1.0,"Shrunk at least 3 sizes after washing it.  Don't waste your time with this inferior product.  It's also very poor quality; thin material.  I rarely leave poor reviews, but save yourself the hassle."
1.0,The quality of the material was cheap
1.0,I returned this item. I did not receive a angora wool blend as advertised. Even though I paid for the $27 set.  The blend was cotton polyester and spandex.
1.0,I liked nothing
1.0,"Me siento engañado, en el anuncio dice que son impermeables y la verdad es que se mojan por dentro ademas no me sirve para andar en la lluvia que es para lo que las necesito."
1.0,"J..U...N..K<br />What can I say.  Don't buy these.... plain and simple. J,,U,,N,,K."
1.0,"Very very cheap material. Average length, despite other reviews saying they were perfect for tall girls. Save your $$"
1.0,Button on top of hat fell off....For as expensive as this hat is...it should last an eternity.....Not Happy
1.0,"Bought 2 bracelets from different vendors, one was solid as a rock and this one......As soon as you adjust it, it bends like a cheap bracelet from an arcade place, and has discoloration at the bend. I just got it not 10 minutes ago and I’ll be returning it immediately."
1.0,"Well, I have to give it 1 star because they put the seam on the outside of the watch. I have two other bands like this and the seam is on the inside. Anyone who has an Apple Watch knows that you can only put the band one way or it slides off the magnetic catch. Well, this band was backwards so the seam shows when wearing."
1.0,My Fitbit band arrived in “worn condition”. It was dirty and the clasp is awful. I don’t even trust wearing it for fear that it will fall off!! I was going to return it but it showed that I would only $2.88 back! Very unhappy with this purchase
1.0,It doesn’t fit.
1.0,Feel off all the time and feel apart
1.0,Don’t even open so I can’t even charge my phone I’m afraid to break the bracelet so I just put it in the drawer I bought it for nothing it’s not worth it this bracelet it’s hard to open it don’t even get no stars
1.0,Very bad quality. Started falling apart right away. Do not recommend
1.0,Junk. Made in China. These try to advertise these as nice shades but they are junk. kameleonz=walmart glasses
1.0,Came broken and knotted.  Took over 3 weeks to get here.
1.0,Size chart is inaccurate. These are exact number you order.material is ok for polyester.
1.0,"These are way too tight trying to pull it over your foot and a couple of the pairs the heel dosent even come up to the heel! Also these are very thin. I had bought some of these in a different color and I love them so much I wanted to get more, the other ones hold their shape after washing and are much thicker. I would send them back but I already wore a pair."
1.0,"for the price, I expected a dress that could be worn when going out. This is more like a cover-up that could be worn around the house or at the pool. Sending it back."
1.0,"Fabric was thin and the garment was not cut straight on the grain so it didn't hang well. Trim started to fray after just a few washings. After just a couple months, it went straight into the bin."
1.0,I used this product for my triple cartilage piercing and could never get the ends to clip together because the holes were to small. Don’t get these.
1.0,"This was a terrible bag from the beginning, the leather in the chain was broken and then the metal around the chain and bag broke off!!! This is a terrible product that I ended up returning!"
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:c518e7335362851384aac924cfd5ac5b]] poor quality, they are packed in unsuitable material, and the bag was open."
1.0,"The dress would have been cute, but the issue is the ruffles in the front are not centered.  They are slightly off and it’s absolutely annoying.  I already washed it so I’m not returning, but be wary of this issue if you purchase."
1.0,"Had to try them so spent the money; bought 2 pairs, one for my one for my wife; We both wore these glasses in<br />traffic while driving; came to same conclusion they really don't work well so they now are sitting in the glove box."
1.0,The band did not come with pins. The pin went missing that is the reason to buy a new one.
1.0,"Package arrived ripped open and Left ear loop was broken, NOT IMPRESSED"
1.0,Returned item it was too small and not the same as the photo
1.0,Material is like wearing potato chips
1.0,Looks nice but really cheaply made. Will fall apart easily
1.0,"I read multiple reviews regarding sizing so I will save you the trouble, don’t buy this shirt. It’s crop top length and tight clingy material. I returned the same day I got it"
1.0,Way too small. Sizing isn't true. The color isn't the same as in the picture. It is impossible to get on without ripping it. Its made so poorly and very cheap for the price. Total waste of money!
1.0,"This was a horrible experience!  It was an urgent gift for my cousin and everything went wrong.  I received the package and it was missing the Cummerbund, and the bow tie was 2.5 inches too small.  Horrible experience, really.  I made a clown of myself with my family.  I don't recommend this seller at all!"
1.0,no tiene ni nombre ni número pésima descripción para lo que se recibe
1.0,"I was buying this dress to do a reverse tie dye because the description says it's 100% cotton, but it's not a natural fiber. It's very shiny fabric and stretchy. Doesn't match the picture either"
1.0,Loved the look of the boot however as soon as I took them out of the box to try them on the Velcro covering on the zipper tore off and the zipper was broke.  Sent them back the same day.
1.0,The scarf is pretty but not made very well.  The stitching at seam very poor.
1.0,Pajamas were VERY small and NOT flame resistant.... HORRIBLE!!
1.0,Doesn't work on Samsung phones!!!!
1.0,"Sides unravel, belt metal constantly comes off. Just really poor quality."
1.0,When I first got these I was a fan. They are light and breathable. But then I actually started using them. They are not stitched together but instead glued together and started coming a part after just a few wears. Will definitely never buy them again.
1.0,Another give away. Purchase a XL it's look like a XS.
1.0,A hole in one of the shirts appeared after I washed them the first time. So you can see the quality is bad.
1.0,"Cheap material, shapeless. Disappointing."
1.0,Waistband seams are coming undone after a closer look very poorly sewed
1.0,Not as it appears - cheap look
1.0,"Pretty sure this isn't even the same jacket. I got the xxl and it fit fine, but doesn't look like the picture. I was hoping for a more form fitting jacket even the shoulders in the pic have a cute little flair and the one I received does not. It's nice because it's not super thick and is a nice fall jacket. Just wish it looked like the one in the photo, so I am sending it back."
1.0,Strategy material and super small
1.0,"I liked the design of the pants online, but when they came, the design was different, with added zippers and different types of pockets, as well as a different fit."
1.0,I returned it. Grabs/tears bills when closing.
1.0,Extremely uncomfortable. Blisters all over my heels. Bought these for my trip to Europe the day before so it's too late to return. Have worn them a lot and still not broken in and give blister. Won't recommend.
1.0,I received a cruddy tiny sweater that is not the same as pictured. It would only fit a small child. Like a skinny 4 year old. Absolute waste of money.
1.0,The product arrived  month late after it was cancelled. The masks were opened a already used. The product is also not described correctly. There is no butterfly that you can see. The print is so light you don't know what it is. And opened. no sanitary at all. I would stay clear of this seller. Items are not make or from the USA at all. Beware .
1.0,The boxes were completely damage
1.0,glove ripped like after a month of wearing them.<br />To soft for riding a motorcycle.
1.0,"I'm sure it was a knock-off, the item was tight around my wrist and barely was made with enough material.  I was replacing an original band and felt far less durable and was too small (very very difficult to attach watch face to.)  The original was easy to attach, this was made with too little material, just like a cheap knock off from Taiwan."
1.0,The picture they have gives the impression that it has crystals or some sort of clear jewel on it.<br />It is made of nothing but the silver material and looks poorly made its not at all what I thought I was ordering and I am EXTREMELY disappointed!
1.0,Not quality product. I returned it
1.0,"This review is not about the quality of the product as it is well made.  However, the color of the product is nothing even close to this photo.  Not even in the same color range.  This product is bright seafoam, bordering on the teal-turquoise tones.  Terribly misleading photo which clearly displays a deep Army green.."
1.0,Was not neoprene. Sent me a medium instead of small. Sucks. Do not buy.
1.0,Thin and poorly made. 10/10 don’t recommend
1.0,I was very much disappointed. The quality is awful. The picture suggest many dices in fact there are only two. The print is very poor quality too. I found some in my local store for $4.99 they are way better than this. Please save yourself some time and money.
1.0,I do not leave good reviews on a marketplace that employs slave labor.
1.0,"This sweatshirt is very small. I normally wear a size Medium, bought a large just to be roomy, I don’t think an XLarge would fit."
1.0,It's too short to be a dress. Very disappointed.
1.0,This was a horrible piece. Did not get my refund either. It is so thin you can see through it. The sleeves are different lengths. And my husband couldn't even get it over his head.
1.0,"I got one of each, they look horrible. Very pleated and pixelated prints. Not worth the cost of shipping"
1.0,The quality was cheap and plastic like
1.0,Do not buy these.  The boxes are mislabeled.  These are actually the twisted style.  I exchanged mine and the second pair was the same issue.  Wrong glasses in the box.
1.0,"Garbage. Way too thin, way too tight."
1.0,Doesn't feel like cotton: rough and scratchy.  I bought the same thing about a year earlier and they were much more comfortable. Something changed.  I won't buy Hanes again.
1.0,Hanes products have been made cheaper and cheaper over the years  Absolutely no elastic in the legs - just sags<br />I've spent about $100 looking for their good old fashion underwear they used to make.  This isn't it!!!  Hanes used to be known for excellent under garments................sadly not any more.  Time to find something new
1.0,I wish I could give negative stars. This thing is such a piece of @#$$. It came with nothing put together and they straps would not stay on. One trip for our son not even packed full and it ripped.  Worst purchase I could make.
1.0,"I wish it could fit me better ,its way tooo big"
1.0,The real thing does not look anything like the picture.  Mine is YELLOW and very stiff.
1.0,"Itchy fabric. I don't know what the hell this is made of, but it was too tight and was really tough. Yuck."
1.0,Too too big and swallowed me up
1.0,Shoes are very hard with very little flexibility.
1.0,They were not good quality and fit small
1.0,Cheap material returned right away.
1.0,I should have read other reviews before purchasing.<br />The charm was tarnished despite being in 2 plastic bags and Little Jewlery box. I could not get charm to shine despite using polishing cloth.  Do not order this item. I will never order anything made by DALARAN again.
1.0,"These may be ok for other chores, but not what I hoped. The hands were large & floppy but was tight on the arm. They do not have a cotton lining, so using hot water for dishes made my hands sweat so bad inside, there was more water on the inside than out! This made the gloves very difficult to use & maneuver.  I had to use a dish rag along with them also anyway. I will stick with the name brand regular 'dish washing' gloves & a trusty dish rag. I paid more for these knowing you get what you pay for... but- no. Maybe they'll work great to bathe the dog..."
1.0,Very short. Fits tight. Normally wear a large ordered XL and it still fits snug
1.0,"HORRIBLE material, nothing like the description of what is advertised."
1.0,Don't waste your money.  These are junk junk junk.  Take forever to get here and can't get any customer service.  Unless these are for a one time use for a costume or something move on there are much better items.
1.0,"Dress runs really small, I ordered two sizes larger just in case it fit snug; even that size was too tight!"
1.0,Would never buy! There super cheap
1.0,TERRIBLE!!!! This would fit a child!!! I am a size 4 and got a large because I felt like it would run small but this is ridiculous!!!  Waste of money!!!!
1.0,The battery only last two months. Not a good buy for the money.  I would not recommend it .
1.0,Product is lovely but small - couldn't button up at all!  I was very sad. I liked the coat but returning it. 😞
1.0,"This product is absolutely crap. I didn’t even wear it for 12 hours and the coating/ paint started flaking, causing my nose to become infected. Don’t waste your money.."
1.0,Quality was crap. Don’t buy this item
1.0,"What is going on with these PJs. I got a beautiful blue pair for Xmas because I have a nerve condition and the Cotton Modal is the only fabric in PJs that keeps my skin from burning. My daughter bought these for me for Christmas and I loved them so much I ordered a second pair for myself. However the pair I ordered in “Blush” or “Pink”were not CottonModal as described. The size of L was huge and not soft because it is 72% Polyester and 28% Rayon,not Cotton Modal as advertised.. I cannot send back because I washed them when received. I have a condition that causes my skin to burn if I don’t wear Cotton Modal. I feel the INK+Ivy makes a great PJ but the description was grossly described wrong. Now I am stuck with what I was these items I PJs I cannot wear because of the wrong fabric. Very disappointing to have this happen to me and others. I think the mfg. should be held responsible for the different labels that make a very significant difference in the feel and wear. Very Disappointed!<br />Kmorris1.krm1973@gmail.com"
1.0,Made of thin fabric. The apron itself was very small. It won't work for an adult.
1.0,"i am SOO UPSET with this purchase. first of all, i have no idea why they would use white pads for a black shirt. second, the material is so thin and completely see through. the pads are sewn in, and are so uneven. it also has absolutely no stretch and runs small. i bought two of these because i have seen so many good reviews but it is the worst top i own now. DONT BUY<br /><br />just tried on the white one hoping it would be better and it’s worse lol so see through. worst tanks ever."
1.0,Terrible quality.  Would not buy again
1.0,"Item was child sized.  It is listed as a tall but the waist barely came below the bust and it did not clear my knee (5'8&#34;).  Ordered the XL (wear a 12) the arms, bust, and shoulders were skin tight.  Unwearable."
1.0,"I bought one to test it out. I loved it. It came with 1. adhesive behind the glass 2. another adhesive to stick on the pendant 3. the information to resize it.<br /><br />This set of three I just received DID NOT come with 1, 2 or 3. ANDDDDD look at the height of the glass in the Photo. Its a huge difference and DOES NOT LOOK good.  I actually have 5 more coming to me (total 9 ordered) returning ALL if it comes to me like this again.<br /><br />SO SO Disappointed as I needed these by tomorrow for a wake/funeral gift."
1.0,I bought these for my son... he has worn them for about a month and the velcro closure is already no longer staying closed and is coming apart.
1.0,This luggage has a terrible odor. We had to move it outside because it smelled so bad. The smell is a cross between plastic and mothballs. We are trying to air it out and we wiped it down with Lysol.  We've tried baking soda and vinegar. I would not recommend getting this luggage.
1.0,Is not even what is on the picture! Looks like a Pajamas. Very horrible blouse... I spent my money on that!!!!
1.0,Received broken.... one of the blue balls was missing entirely
1.0,Worst POS. This does more damage than good. Cheap cheap cheap.
1.0,"I am a fan of canvas bags, but this bag had so many problems. The side strap connectors both broke, so I ended up using carabiners to reattach, just to get some use out of it. The zipper is not attached to the full length of the bag, which allows for gaps. This also means that it takes two hands to zip and the pulling causes the material to detach. The bag as a whole sits funny on your body for a hobo style crossbows, but workable."
1.0,I wore this (1) time washed it wore it underwire broke in half on one side.
1.0,Ball sack too small
1.0,"Very misshaped, doesn't fit at all like the pictures show. I'd return the dress if I'd even get my money but I wouldn't. It's gone in the trash."
1.0,Horrible. These legitimately broke in half my first wear.
1.0,Broken and loose stone.
1.0,This product is chinsey and even if it hadn’t been broken I don’t understand how the necklace wouldn’t fall off since it won’t class together at all.
1.0,"The length of the skirt doesn't change with the size of the skirt. I'm 5&#34;7' and would have to wear 2&#34; high heals, at least, for it to work. Supper bummed because the color was beautiful. Wouldn't recommend this."
1.0,inaccurate description. i received four when i had purchased five. package came open and damaged. very disappointed.
1.0,Everything about the top was horrible. Do not buy.
1.0,"I was afraid of it, but they all shrink to fit my little girl after washing.  they are now located at goodwill.  a bit of a waste."
1.0,Not the size I ordered
1.0,Is not accurate.<br />the eye patch comes out sometimes
1.0,"The slippers are two completely different color shades. Other than that, my daughter loves them."
1.0,"Not good quality product. As soon as my kid wore his shoes, the label started to fade. I had to write my son's name again and again with a sharpie"
1.0,Do not waste your money. I'm 5'9 148 lbs.. The XXL is tight on me. Fits funny. Horrible customer service.
1.0,It is not that I did  like . They were way to long for my short arms. Can't rate them because I did not wear them.
1.0,Unless you want to spend an hour vacuuming do not purchase. Poorly made. Feathers everywhere! Buy beads instead.
1.0,The belt ran small and was cheap looking.  Not made of good quality material.  The seller was nice to give me a refund and didn't have to return the belt.
1.0,"This is a completely different dress!!!!<br />You messed up!<br />I’m so upset, I needed the other one for a garden party on Tuesday! I can not wear this one"
1.0,Mine came broken!
1.0,"Poor quality bag which ripped in multiple places after a few weeks of use. The front of the bag, the inside pouch, the zipper, and the side of the bag all ripped, one by one, over a few weeks. We threw the bag away and replaced it. The smaller lunch bag is still in service."
1.0,It broke right away while installing it. I haven't even worn it.
1.0,Ripped instantly
1.0,loved the colors just so small I wear a medium first ordered a medium  could not even pull it up. Then I ordered a large<br />not much better. I just gave up. Always  a guessing game when you order clothing on Amazon.
1.0,"Buyer beware, you get what you pay for.  The listing states that the material is polyester, but it should state that it feels like plastic.  It does not have any stretch to it, and it is actually a very loud material.  Sent back right away and requested full refund."
1.0,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY! So this shirt was supposed to be a 3 XL this shirt might fit a 3-5 year old depending on their size. This was one of two I ordered. There is a true misrepresentation of the size, either they pulled the wrong sizes twice or they are asian sizes, or misrepresentation regarding sizes. Yet I can't return it despite their error or issues, not mine.  I would have kept this product if it were not the size of my head, and instead the size I ordered. Remember not once but TWICE the WRONG SIZE!"
1.0,"Purchased red , not liked . Fabric super thin ! Returning"
1.0,Glad it was only $22 cause it's cheap the band doesn't fit in the center right and the rest of the ring bends easily
1.0,Broke rite away
1.0,Bought this for my daughter. Very cheaply made. Not meant for slim wrists as falls off.
1.0,"I guess I wasn’t paying attention when I ordered this.  When I took it out of the packaging, I noticed the pockets with the ties and gathering so I checked on Amazon to see they had sent me the right thing.  Yep.  Then, I noticed the bit of gathering at the neck, which is a feature I actively hate.  At that point I had decided to return it, but glutton for punishment that I am, I continued to inspect this thing.  The black fabric is very similar to some winter-weight tights (stockings, not leggings) that I have, but with a bit less stretch.  This was quite possibly one of the worst items I’ve ever purchased.  Really.  Returned."
1.0,I received the wrong Tunic Dress 🤔
1.0,Broken after 3 days
1.0,The robe I received is NOT 95% cotton as advertised.  It is 95% rayon.  Big difference. I will be returning. I was specifically looking for cotton and don’t like the hassle of having to return due to inaccurate description.
1.0,This was way too short for me. I wear  36DD bra so maybe that's why.
1.0,Disappointed!  Very thin band and words are tiny.  Would not reorder
1.0,"These were terrible!! They came without the backings on the earrings. I couldn’t get the backings on, they didn’t fit. Waste of money!"
1.0,I thought these were velvet. I returned then because they were not velvet at all.
1.0,"I am right on the edge of misses/plus sizes.  I can wear everything from a large to a 1x depending on the cut of the shirt.  I ordered the 5xl and it is just too small.  I skip this if you ever wear anything bigger than a large.  Also, the &#34;ruby&#34; color is rust."
1.0,Garbage don’t buy. They are just cut pieces of cloth. The gaiters I have for myself are of much better quality.<br />Spend you money elsewhere
1.0,I don't even know why this is being sold here. Low quality and deceptive picture.
1.0,Size runs small and material is too thin
1.0,Pretty but useless... doesn't close properly and is tiny.  Impossible to get on.
1.0,"Cute and comfortable, sized up due to reviews. Really weird , this centers the girls right in the middle of your chest."
1.0,"Cheap, small fit, not a good jacket"
1.0,Not fitting quite as picture and I ordered up to wear baggy
1.0,"Like I mentioned in the headline, I ordered XL and they shrunk down to a smallish Medium after only one wash"
1.0,This actually fits toddlers not the age range if they say they do. Don’t waste your money. It is just a waste of money.
1.0,"Really ?? I order XXL because be sure to do not be small, I am L size but  come so small and short looks like Small size but have XXL on . So confuse so sad an mad. Most off stuff are so bad and pore quality I give up ."
1.0,Two small for me
1.0,"Mine lasted 6 weeks, and then my fitbit started falling off my wrist numerous times on a daily basis. The issue is with the strap connection to the body of the unit."
1.0,"These are garbage.  I should have known the I tried to buy cheaper shades that you get what you pay for.  I wore them less than 10 times and BOTH lenses have popped out (no idea where they are now).  So if you want a pair of brand new looking frames with no lenses in them sitting on your counter for a fe months before you finally toss them in the garbage... by all means, BUY THESE!"
1.0,"Very large neckline but small waist.  I normally wear a medium, ordered the large.  Returning"
1.0,"Size says large/extra large but the top, if you could even fit into it, would fit like a small. Shoulds are much too narrow to be large for an American. Costume is very satiny and looks cheap. Not worth the money especially if you're busty."
1.0,The plastic was so thin that it had tears in it when I got it
1.0,I like the glove so far for comfort and warmth but I am using them for work and they tour on the fingers in Palm within 30 days I ordered a new pair hoping that it was a defect in the glove
1.0,I received my earrings today and they are completely tarnished with no pink whatsoever on them. They look like old costume jewelry. I will be returning. Im very sad because the reviews I read were wonderful and I was excited to get mine. Mine look like old worn pennies.
1.0,"It was a nice hat, just too small."
1.0,The craftmanship is very poor. The pearl doesnt have the lustre expected from a pearl.
1.0,Only inflates itself. Hose fills with air but not into the tire. Worthless Garbage now
1.0,"The product is listed as a push pin citation bar. Even has a picture of the back of a push pin citation bar. When ordered it came in as a screw post and when the seller was contacted about this mistake, told me that it was advertised correctly and refused help resolve the issue besides just refunding me the cost minus the shipping for their mistake."
1.0,"Poor fit, the dress was entirely too thin, have to return it :("
1.0,The women's large was more like a child's large. It was laughable and sad because I had bought them for my granddaughter and me.  I'm a size 10 so ordered a large to include possible shrinkage when washing.  Opened the packages - found the child's size 8 barely okay for my granddaughter who wears a 7. The women's large clearly marked on the package was barely large enough for my other granddaughter who wears a women's size 00. Oh well :( at least they were cheap.
1.0,Zipper broke in less than a month
1.0,Dress is completely see through and cheaply made. Arm holes are too small too. Will not wear this dress.
1.0,Sizing is not normal US sizing. My son needed 2 sizes up in this shoe.
1.0,"When I took them out of the package and slid my hands in them like I usually when purchasing pantyhose and they seemed to be and fit perfectly.<br />Then I put them on and they fit great .<br />Then I pulled them up to assure the crouch came all the way up to my woman part like I usually do with my other sheer pantyhose and they are a lot thinner material and I still have them , but I wanted to try something new .<br />So anyway.. they suck and as a customer I was not satisfied with my product because they ripped and I wasent even able to wear them once and I planned to for a very special event and wasent able and my night wasent right ! Thanks"
1.0,"The picture made item look large but when I received it very very very small. Something for a charm bracelet, I wanted it to be able to wear around my daughter neck😠 was very very disappointed."
1.0,This is not a original Pandora charm! Didn't come with a Pandora box! The details and the color are not the same as picture. I am not happy!
1.0,This collar clip bar fell apart the first time I used it. It wasn't expensive so I guess I got what I paid for. I'm still in the market for a good clip bar but don't know where to purchase one. Bummer.
1.0,I have a tall 5.5 year old and ordered the size 4-6 and it's WAY too big. Now it's too late to order anything else for her Halloween costume. So frustrating.
1.0,The floral pattern definitely didn't look as pictured. Quickly returned.
1.0,Fits my 2 year old after one wash. Should have just thrown my money in the trash. Same outcome.
1.0,It came apart never even wore it
1.0,Crappy material. Very disappointed in the quality of this dress. Opened package and immediately put it back and ordered my return! Do not purchase
1.0,You could never wear this sweater as a dress. It is way too short and you can see right through it.
1.0,I dont like it so loose
1.0,Got xl but arm opening is the size of a small
1.0,"Pros:<br />-<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Fabric is cheap acrylic<br />- Loose pilly yarn<br />- Cardigan is too large<br />- Tank top is the same size on the front and back (not sure who it would fit)<br /><br />Overall, very unflattering and cheap-looking.<br /><br />Would NOT recommend."
1.0,Ridiculously small.  I am a petite lady and I could not get it on.  I would not even fit my 9 year old daughter.  I ordered a size L.
1.0,"I wore this dress once. During the evening both straps broke, and I got a hole where the bodice meets the skirt from sitting. Very poorly sewn dress."
1.0,Strange fit.  Fabric is beautiful but the back is very low cut and felt like a maternity dress.
1.0,Dont like it
1.0,The finish on the sunglasses started coming off few days after receiving them.
1.0,No  me gusta
1.0,Muy mala calidad se le sale rltapin del filtro
1.0,Horrible fit 3 sizes too small
1.0,Very disappointed. Over priced for the quality. Already fraying at the top of the toes
1.0,I had to return te Gloves since they weren’t the Green Arrow Gloves like the image shows. The ones I got were standard leather gloves. Very disappointed.
1.0,Way too huge for my ankle.... want my money back. No one has that round of an ankle
1.0,Fell apart easily! Cheap material
1.0,I thought they were cute but the post fell off after 2 weeks
1.0,The backs slide off to easy
1.0,Not durable for the price paid not the best thing it broke the elastic is cheap not happy
1.0,Take a look at the photo after a month of wear it looks terrible. I have ordered these type of bands from other companies with much better results. Buyer Beware of what you think is a nice color 'cause it won't last.
1.0,"DO NOT PURCHASE THESE.<br />You will not be happy as they WILL both break very quickly and before that, they will bind-up and cause you to be very unhappy while trying to do even a simple stretch.<br />Just pay extra to have a quality product because these are ABSOLUTE TRASH."
1.0,Very disappointed in it.<br />Can hardly make out figure - very small and not well festured
1.0,Was very interested in this product and really liked it until I was disappointed when the coin itself not the chain broke within 2 days.
1.0,"Do not buy these. After one wash, they were falling apart at the seams."
1.0,The quality is not an issue but this belt does not resize properly also this belt cannot be resized if you lose weight. Belt manufacturers need to know that one size does not fit all.
1.0,I have lots of costume and high quality jewelery. This is really flimsy. It's like 99 cent jewelery from the beauty supply store.<br /><br />I think there are several other options to choose from on Amazon that would be better unless all you have to spend is 10$.
1.0,Quality is cheap.<br />Loses color with every wash.<br />Hand wash separately or it will damage other  garments.<br />Front zip.No buttons.
1.0,I got these scratched and broken.
1.0,Micro freakin-scopic
1.0,So small can't even read the text
1.0,I can’t wear these because they are heavy enough they fall right off.  Very unhappy with them.
1.0,Cheaply made. Doesn't match picture. Looks like a circus clown tent. Colors are far brighter than picture. Buttons align crooked.
1.0,I bought this late summer thinking that it was fixed. I read the reviews so I picked up a pair. A week in a half ago the buckle jst popped of my waist. So if you want fix your belt keep looking dont buy this plastic replacement.
1.0,Don’t buy if you want cotton
1.0,"Fair quality material, but thin - I don't see how anyone could wear this as a dress.  I considered all reviews and photos carefully, and I ordered a large, since I am size medium and wanted a loose fit under a semi-translucent dress.  The slip was skin-tight from top to bottom.  I will either return if possible, or toss it.  It's unwearable."
1.0,The is no support no show liner very poorly made see blue all over boot
1.0,"I have purchased and worn several other brands of small, rimless, convenience-sized, flexible reading glasses, and none of the others were as tight and uncomfortable as these. Along with being an uncomfortably tight fit, the nose rest areas of these have very sharp serrated edges that are so abrasive that the skin on my nose bled the first time I wore them. I was out of town and had to make due with the painful glasses, so I had to file the serrated edges down, which resulted in one of the 3 pairs breaking. If I hadn’t had to file them down because they were all I had with me, I would have returned them and demanded a refund when I got back home. Do not buy."
1.0,Junkie
1.0,"Cheaply made. The absolute cheapest. Where is quality control<br />At?<br />The button was sewn in to an odd place on the romper and the eyelet that should have been in place to secure the romper back, with the button  was missing.<br />Sadly I threw the romper on and left for work, realized it was open in the back and I realized all of the quality mistakes once I reached the office.<br />Update I got an email from the manufacturer that said thank you for your feedback. Your input helps us with quality. Lol what a joke."
1.0,"Ordered 2, one for me and one for my best friend. Mine was put together wrong and they both broke the first day we wore them. 😑 save your money"
1.0,"The orange hat came with a almost matching red-ish orange band and star, so it is b early visible- lame! And the star is really really off center! Not worth $20!!!!"
1.0,"The product says that it has a padded shin for skiing and snowboarding but changing the design color in the shin area doesn't make it a pad. In fact it seems that the sock might actually be thinner in shin area. I can't say how well they works as socks because I haven't worn them yet. With no shin padding at all, they are all but useless to me."
1.0,"In retrospect, I don't know what I was thinking is all I can say for myself :(  Good luck getting this thing in whatever your belly peircing might be like.  Mine is VERY deep which means, I need a bigger size than the norm (usually 1/2&#34; or better) and its simply not as easy to find nice rings in this size.  I figured this one had plenty of extra room even if I had to reshape it a little.  But in the end, I couldn't get the ring in at all, couldn't get it all the way thru my piercing hole.  I even unlooped it so it wasn't curving back on itself so it was one sorta-straight/long piece from top to bottom but still there were too many twists & turns in the metal to get it thru.  I tried countless times to get this thing in but ultimately, no joy.  Eventually, it just became too painful to keep trying."
1.0,Bought for my 5 year old granddaughters glasses.  They broke in less than 2 weeks.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Finish full of big bubbles. Neither necklace will open and shut. I was going to give one to my daughter. Disappointed .
1.0,"Last July's purchase was okay quality.  I ordered another one as a gift, but the quality took a NOSEDIVE.  I compared the details of both purses side by side:  they are now CRAP.  I'm ashamed to give this as a gift.  The photo in the ad and the price are still the same though.  These folks have no morals."
1.0,Product was much smaller than I need! I had a heck of a time just getting them on my foot! Not happy with this product😳
1.0,Turned inside out the first time I used it
1.0,The size runs on the small size.
1.0,already splitting at the seam only a month after purchase.
1.0,El vestido llego roto.
1.0,The beads where pretty but the bracelets itself smelled so weird and broke easily.
1.0,"Bought a size M for my 9 yo. Belt is so small it can’t even be buckled. And he is not chubby/overweight, wears a 10-12 for reference"
1.0,"The product looks good, but the problem is that it runs wayyyyy too small! Btw, I'm a pretty petite SoCal girl and wear a 32B. And if I think it's too small -- believe me, it's not your typical American bra sizes. I think it runs by chinese sizes which tend to be really small, but I've bought from different brands on here (e.g. Aivtalk or FallSweet) and the sizes they use fit me similarly with Victoria Secret sizes if that makes sense. If I had to buy from here I'd probably get a 34-36C? Because even the cup size was small too (and I'm flat)! But anyways, I'm really not too sure how that would fit if I were to buy from here again, which I'm not! I suggest you to buy similar styles, but from a different brand. Trust me on this!"
1.0,"Tiny pin inside the mechanism falls out easily, rendering the belt useless.  Avoid."
1.0,Too small!! Not happy!
1.0,This is NOT the dress I got - bait and switch!  I got the short sleeve version of this dress and loved it. Ordered the sleeveless version and got a ridiculous looking imposter version.
1.0,The product is not pictured well. It looks as if there is a wide band for comfort at the top.  There is NOT . it is faux and part of the print.  They also look like a comfortable lounge pant that is cotton .. these are thin thin polyester or rayon crappy material and made for some one 5'10or taller.<br />What a waste
1.0,"I wish I had ordered a larger size,it fit snug,just had to lose a few pounds,so ladies,try to order a size larger because to me the sizes run small"
1.0,"If this is an earring, I must have big ears.  Couldn't get them on so I gave them to a friend whose daughter has a pierced nose."
1.0,"The compartments for the credit cards, etc. are exactly the size of maybe two cards. This makes getting the cards in and out difficult, particularly if you put more than two cards in. Additionally, the area for money is also very small and the bills are difficult to put in and remove. All in all, I hate it and will probably throw it away since I did not save the box."
1.0,"Slippers tore really easily.  The first time my daughter grabbed them, the fabric split.  And it took over a month for these to be delivered."
1.0,loved except for the fact that the suit came with strange white cups in the bathing suit that cannot be taken out!
1.0,This item had a distorted fit. It had to be returned
1.0,"Broke in 1day, heart fell off metal ring. Was a gift. Dissatisfied"
1.0,Wrong band
1.0,"Cheap made...looks cheap on.<br />Bought for my teenage boy for a quick suit for a dance. By the end of the night, seams were coming apart. Was never able to get the wrinkles out of it...steamed and ironed."
1.0,"thought pajama s quite nice UNTIL FIRST WASH.<br />What a mess,  lined dried as directed and results AWFUL"
1.0,This is not like the picture at all. It's a screen printed image on a moisture wicking fabric. Not worth your money or time.
1.0,Un engañado total de eso
1.0,For short/petite women
1.0,"Fits great, but I feel like it came used! 1) the tag was missing. 2) there were hairs all over it! GROSS!! 3) it had a perfumy smell to it. Not sure if I'll get a replacement in time. So strange! At least it was cheap (as far as evening dresses go)."
1.0,I only gave it one star because it arrived on time. I ordered the 3xl thinking it would be a little loose as it is supposed to be loose(relaxed) fitting. It is SOOOOO small I could barely get it on  and the length only came down to my belly button. It looks like a shirt for a ten year old.Just wanted to give everyone a heads up  and remember BUYER BEWARE!
1.0,Order 2 sizes bigger than you think
1.0,"I ordered a pack of 4 tanks. I like them but...the first time I wore one of them the right strap came  off of the front of the tank, totally unhooked, threads just came undone. I thought that was maybe just a flaw with the one tank but I was wrong. After a few washes and wears the other 3 are falling apart too. I even order my tanks one size large so it's not an issue of being too tight and stress the threads, it's sewn poorly. I won't ever order this brand again."
1.0,I sent this back. It was extremely long and not quite the material I expected. The front is pretty casual and the back goes very low. I'm 5'4 and would have had to get quite a bit taken off of the length to wear.
1.0,I usually wear a medium to large bottoms. Waist-30 hips-40. Ordered the large and it was way to tight in my waist.
1.0,"Poor material choice, not sure if it was a mix up but, it has more spandex than cotton as description stated. I am very disappointed with this product. The fit is also to short. I am 6.1 and ordered the large, its a bit big fitted to the top."
1.0,Latch is to weak. Lost 2 of them on the first day.
1.0,"I got this for a party that was pajama themed, horrible decision. It took longer than expected to get here, and when it did it was horrible quality and totally off in regards to size. I am typically a size small, which is what I ordered. It was so big that I could stick my entire body in one leg hole and it would still just fall off. My friend wanted to try it on and she is typically a L or XL, and it was too big on her... The quality was also super cheap and plasticy feeling. Would not recommend."
1.0,Used it lads than a month and it’s falling apart already. Don’t buy it .
1.0,Scratchy fabric that looks like it has angora in it. If you're like me and seek out viscose and cotton scarves that are soft and gentle on your skin then stay away from this one. This is most certainly not 100% viscose. The plaid pattern is cute but the fabric is gross.
1.0,"This was a bizarre material and doesn't come with a belt. I'm a few pounds extra and this was shapeless. I can only see this looking good on tall, skinny women."
1.0,I wouldn't purchase this product since it's easy to see it's fake with the wrong amount of stars. Bad copy.
1.0,Product listed as to be 7.79 inches in length. I measured my twisted before ordering and I am a little under 7 1/4 inches.  Received the bracelet and it did not fit with all pieces attached.  I am returning
1.0,"Got an XS for my 13 yr old daughter. We were both very surprised when it came in. It was HUGE. Too big for her, too big for me, and even too big for her grandmother. Sizing is waaaaaaaay off."
1.0,the dress material is cheap. not flattering on the body. returned.
1.0,It’s a very pretty bracelet but it took like a month to arrive and on its arrival date it said running late and I didn’t get it for another week after that.
1.0,Returned. Poor quality.
1.0,Material is very thin for brand name
1.0,Returned. Stone was popped out on delivery. Much smaller in size than expected. Cheap coloration to the gold tint.
1.0,"Not enough prime letters I cant spell out my moms name cuz she has 3 A's and i only got 2 i also got 9 V's WHY who need that many the other plen8 of is B,W,P,and D but give me 1 X 2 L and 2 Z I guess I shouldn't complain since I did manage to get 1 of each alphabet so not worth it"
1.0,"Could not look through them for more than a minute before developed a headache.  I have worn other multifocal glasses before with success, but these were only viewable through a very small target in the center of the lens, everything else was blurry."
1.0,Nothing like what's in the picture. The color is also greyish blue....kind of faded looking.
1.0,I wore it once and it broke! The clasp fell off! Very cheaply made!
1.0,"This is a great lululemon dupe, however the cord on the zipper fell off as soon as it went in the washer.  Very disappointed in the price for the zipper cord to already be broken.  Would NOT recommend."
1.0,Took forever to receive in the mail and when i got them the quality was poor.
1.0,Put the jacket on and I immediately heard a rip so I pulled it off.  The entire inside had come undone. Get an extra size for what you normally wear
1.0,Would not buy again. Very cheap and thin material.  Fit like female leggings
1.0,"Ordered this dress for a wedding. The night before (tonight) as I'm steaming the dress, I notice the fabric is not dyed correctly and it has lighter and darker stripes located horizontally across  the dress. So now I have to go shopping tomorrow for a new dress, the day of the wedding. Absolutely livid right now."
1.0,"I ordered this bag to cut down how much I was carrying. It definitely did that. The most irritating thing is the clasps that hold the shoulder strap come unhooked for virtually no reason. I got out of the car one day to find one clasp undone. As I picked it up by the unhooked strap, the other end came loose! This has happened repeatedly. In addition, it cannot hold much at all or the snap will not close properly. The bag doesn’t have “give” to it so you can’t put anything that is not slim. Only one compartment has a zipper so when the snap doesn’t hold, what is in the unzippered portion falls out. I have tried to like this bag for several weeks but I simply do not. I will not be using it."
1.0,"No, it's too big for my face.  Can I return this?<br />Thank you"
1.0,Poor quality very flimsy and thin
1.0,cheap materia
1.0,Not as described. Will be returning.
1.0,Buttons on bottom keep breaking. Can’t fix them either. Fraying at some of the seams. Poor quality .
1.0,The dress came inside out without an English label. No cleaning directions. The dress has breast liner/padding sewing in the dress which has no function or need based on the design.  The lace is a separate piece that must be worn over the top and will easily catch.  It was shipped in a basic plastic bag. Shipping time was extremely slow for Amazon and in no way was it worth paying $20.00 for.  Avoid completely.
1.0,"If you have a very small face (in all dimensions) and didn't particularly want a nose wire, these masks are probably okay.  If you wanted a nose wire because--glasses--and/or you have an average sized face, then look elsewhere.  I edited this after my spouse tried wearing one for a day.  It didn't even work for her."
1.0,ripped after one day
1.0,No one can wear this !! It’s a rug
1.0,"This bracelet had a design flaw.  The tiny hearts slip through the hole.  I tried to use pliers to make it smaller, but it snapped and broke."
1.0,Bad quality I was expecting a more better quality
1.0,The colors are different from what you get. It's more a copycat version of Erikas originals but the material is very thin and cheap. At $10 it would be OK but at $30 it's not worth it. Also comes with no pins which is ridiculous. Straps always come with new pins. One reason I got this was because the pins on my old strap were bent and I threw them out.
1.0,The material was really cheap and the ends of the dress I received were frayed. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1.0,Not cotton as described and very very thin
1.0,Very disappointed. The item I received was nothing like the picture but rather a replacement in the same color but different style.<br />I returned it immediately and will not order from this company again.
1.0,Will be returning dress. Way to small! I ordered the size I usually wear. I’ve actually lost weight recently and it was still way to small.☹️ Will never buy clothes that are made in China again.
1.0,Pretty disappointed in the sizing. I ordered a 2xl and they run extremely small.
1.0,Turned in to Amazon at UPS without a problem.
1.0,Hat didn't fit my husband runs really small! Will not order anymore!
1.0,"The sizing inconsistencies in these shirts is beyond frustrating!! I bought a medium in the dark green color and it was ridiculously large on me. I’m 5’0 and 135 lbs, a little chunky in the waist after having my second child, and the medium was still huge on me. And it was not cute in an oversized kinda way like a lot of shirts are now. It just looked bad. So, I ordered the small. Uh, can you say skin tight! Literally the Small was skin tight on me. I feel like I must have tried on an XXL first and then a small or XS. The sizing inconsistencies are ridiculous and I will not be purchasing any more of these. It’s like playing the lottery with what you will get."
1.0,Metallic rubbed off after one wear.
1.0,"This blouse looks nothing like the photo on Amazon's website.  The fabric is clingy and does not flare out like the photo.  Plus, you have to pay for shipping and also shipping back.  Waste of money!"
1.0,This is the worst shirt ever. It is so thin it's just about to rip. I tried to cancel but I was told it was too late.......it was 2 days after I put the order in. Definitely not worth 2 cents
1.0,"My son wanted these so badly so I got them for him for Christmas. When they arrived I was surprised at how cheap they felt. And In fact parts of the shoe seemed to be made of exactly that; felt! Places that should have been leather or at least pleather, it was simple cheap fabric. No wonder he popped a toe through and seams are ripping after just a few weeks!!! These don’t appear to be authentic. Save your money and shop at Nike!"
1.0,"logo is off center,<br />Only one side of the strap on back of cap,  could be adjusted, the other one is super loose had too sew it down :(<br />center of cap is way too tall"
1.0,I am getting headaches if i wear these glasses. Did not working for me.
1.0,nunca me llegaron
1.0,Junk jewelry.  First of all it comes Directly from China. Second when you open up the envelope it looks like something you would get out of a gumball machine. I realize it’s not expensive however I did not expect garbage for my money.
1.0,Horrible fit and quality!  I am returning this one.
1.0,"Returned, not my favorite. It’s not soft."
1.0,After a week my finger turned out green. Cheap but is not worthy
1.0,"My daughter  put them on walked from her bedroom to the bathroom, and the strap broke immediately.. Very disappointed on the quality of product . Had them on less than a minute.."
1.0,I’m disgusted. This is clearly a used shirt. It came with obvious “pilling” and many strands of long blonde hair. It’s going straight in the garbage. I expect a full refund.
1.0,Nunca llego no reclame ya q no me encontraba en USA
1.0,"So I guess I should have trusted other folks' reviews of this item, since it appears from more than one seller; this seller just had better reviews than the other. But all the remarks were true: the lights don't work, the way you take the necklace on and off is with a cable screw and cable wire that is almost impossible to grip and turn because rubber tubing has been glued to one side (so you have to rotate the whole necklace to turn it), and the thing must weigh five pounds. No way I could wear this for more than half an hour tops. There is hot glue gun glue showing out at least four or five of the eyeholes, and it arrived with one of the lights and a huge wad of glue already popped out of one of the skull sockets. Super disappointed, trying to decide if it is worth just taking it apart to make my own necklace that is a tolerable weight, or sending it back and having nothing for my event."
1.0,I was so looking forward to these T-shirts I bought three of them. They all fit me differently but this purple one fit me like an extra large and stead of a 3X is very difficult to get on and snug snug tight. It’s definitely not a 3X I want I bought a 3X so it would be nice and loose are usually wear a 2X
1.0,The necklace unfortunately arrived broken. I put it back together and it broke again. It’s a very fragile cheap metal and there are noticeable glue around the eye. Would’ve given it a higher rating (i wasn’t expecting quality because it’s literally $2) but gotta give an automatic 1 star for it being broken
1.0,"The size is not true, if you wear a large go up 2 maybe 3 sizes!!"
1.0,Super thin material and see through. Also had a weird smell to them when they arrived
1.0,Harry Potter Wears Glasses But Not A Hat
1.0,NOT FOR A PLUS SIZE WOMEN
1.0,Not at all what I expected. Already gave away
1.0,"No he recibido el producto, aunque aparece como entregado"
1.0,No the real thing. Material is obviously different from factory material that it advertises to be. It works and looks the part though. Another way you can tell it is not as advertised is it develops a smell from sweat. Silicon does not do that.
1.0,i love the ring and the look but one of the stones broke a couple days after having it
1.0,I ordered it as a gift for my daughter. She wore it for only 2 hours and she showed me her skin was turning blue like the stones.  I can’t return it because it was a gift
1.0,It’s uneven and very tight around your neck.
1.0,"I thought this was a solid material and not a mesh, well it turns out it is almost a mesh material with holes throughout the fabric. This should have been clear in the description. It is light weight and thin. Also the fit is really strange and kind of baggy. Not what I expected."
1.0,"I was really looking forward to getting this and SO hoping it would be everything I thought it would be. Boy, was I wrong. Hate is a strong word (one star reviews), but this was really a gross piece of clothing and awful quality/workmanship. I don't really know where to begin describing what was so wrong about it...<br /><br />The material was an awful, slippery polyester/spandex (I'll give it that the material wasn't thin...pretty nice weight, actually) type of material...sort of what running shorts are made from. It appeared to be already pilled...previously worn? Just the material rubbing against itself? Tons and tons of white, red, gold pieces of tiny material ALL over the thing! Inside and out. And if you can get past *that*, the workmanship/quality was horrible. The thumb hole stitching was either coming undone, or fraying. The fit was very odd. I know this is supposed to be loose fitting, but it's very odd, boxy style around the chest/armpit area. The sleeves were super long as well.<br /><br />This is too bad; I really wanted to like it. Back it went."
1.0,Junk!!! One ring broke first day wearing!!
1.0,"These were not a good fit, they hade sports bra look weird through clothes.. Sent then back"
1.0,Just plain awful!
1.0,All they did was sew a tube. No ear loops as advertised and they didnt even hem the top or bottom which were cut ragged. Suspect other reviews are paid.
1.0,Super thin and extremely big. This would fit a teenager
1.0,Goofy.
1.0,Gave me used gloves during a pandemic
1.0,This item is only 8 oz not 32 oz.  Can buy the 32 oz for less money at any online tack shop. Very deceptive advertising.
1.0,I was really excited about these bottoms but the material was very cheap and it bleeds purple and will dye your skin. Shame because the advertised picture makes them look super cute.
1.0,"Wanted to love it, slim design, but constantly fall off"
1.0,"After arriving 5 days late, the dress sent was nothing like the picture and cheaply made, maybe it was the wrong item, either way it was sent back."
1.0,This was a piece of crap
1.0,"I am very disappointed with the dresses ,their not apair to what I am seeing the picture ,I have bought a lot off them ,the color an the size. I need a refund of something I am stock  the rest  dresses"
1.0,Not true to size at all runs very small
1.0,wrong size.. buy no 6 I received 2t
1.0,Yellow tint glasses: Failed polarization test with card provided. Tried with another card and it failed. Purchased dark glasses and they passed polarization test. Disappointed.
1.0,Does not fit at all. Waste of money. I have a big of a big chest but this dress wouldn't even go past my shoulders!! Don't do it to yourself!!
1.0,Cheaply made. One of the jewels had fallen off before I even got the product.
1.0,Product was made flimsy needs tk be thicker when i pulled it open to size to my finger it broke when bending it tight to my finger... very dissatisfied with this product and mad i wasted my money.
1.0,"This was actually very pretty, however washed 1st time and all the fringes came out. Unfortunately this is what weighs it down and without the fringes it takes away from it."
1.0,I ordered this in the bright pink as shown on the model but it’s not a pretty pink that’s on the model but rather a dull pale blush colored shirt….nothing like in the picture.
1.0,Horrible size chart disapointed it was ripped
1.0,It’s cute for wearing every once in a while but not everyday wear. I’ve had it on for 2 days and my finger is already green. None of my other 925 rings turn my finger green but this one does fast.
1.0,Product made in China.<br /><br />The web belt material appears to be of good quality but the buckle looks like cheap knock of quality manufacturing and paint.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product.
1.0,Absolutely way to big for a child or adults face. I have no idea what size face they measured to make these.
1.0,The paint chipped right off in my mouth and then all them started to chip and the ball started to strip on 2 of them.
1.0,"I purchased these for our trip to Disneyland to wear on the water rides to keep from getting soaked. Somewhat disappointed. They are extremely thin. I had to throw away the first one after taking it out of the package it ripped before I could even put it on. After putting it on, it ripped when I sat down. It tore up the  side so I had to hold it together until the ride was over.  I managed to stay mostly dry, but it was a lot of work with these cheaply made poncho's."
1.0,Went to go try it on and the clasp instantly broke before I could even finish putting it on. The fabric is cheap and thin.
1.0,"The dress looked NOTHING like the picture. It was not off the shoulder, and there was an extra sewing of the fabric on the right side that made no sense."
1.0,It made my neck break out and I have scarring
1.0,Make sure to size DOWN!!! I ordered a medium and this is either marked wrong or runs large. The size I received was closer to an xlarge. I’m unable to wear it as it falls off me. I’m 5’4” and 145lbs. Requested a return two weeks ago but it still has not been approved. When trying to file a claim the order number is “invalid”. Basically I’m out the money which is a shame since I love the print and was going to order a smaller size.
1.0,They didn’t look like the picture. Not what I was looking for. Need to send back!
1.0,I received a completely different dress. It doesn't look like the dress that's advertised at all. I am so disappointed. It's definitely going back.
1.0,The top to this set sucked. I could not even put it on my body ... it wouldn't expand at all to be put over my head. Don't buy it.
1.0,"Made in China says it all about these gloves.  Not sure where these got all the positive ratings because there's NO WAY these gloves are good to -30F.  +15F with liner gloves inside and my hands were frozen in 10 minutes.  JUNK, Buyer beware!"
1.0,"Runs small I wear a size 14 the bust was too tight , My bust size is 42D . No to small"
1.0,Was not happy with color said free return but does not give you proper label to return. When tried to return cost was $40 almost as much as dress .
1.0,Too short! Too wide! Hideous! I hate writing bad reviews but this was terrible. Returned it.
1.0,"I ordered an extra large, I receive something that doesn’t even fit my petite wife. The size is about eight sizes too small."
1.0,This will good for skinny face...<br /><br />Which means No good for round face....<br />or big face...<br /><br />It just don't fit right
1.0,Too small. Half the size as advertised.
1.0,It was so thin and see thru I had to return it👎🏽
1.0,Clearly plastic beads. Not stone not even close. Weighs next to nothing compared to my real stone one. This is junk unless you just want a fashion peice.
1.0,"I gave this a few tries because I wanted so much to love these but, sadly for a larger breasted women these offer absolutely no workout support. They’re extremely tight underneath my breasts which makes wearing these very uncomfortable. So I will be returning these"
1.0,Terrible!  These pieces of garbage broke the first time I used them and I lost my watch!  Don't waste your money!
1.0,"Single sided, heavy."
1.0,Very small with little crouch area. Material was not stretchy nor did the button area stretch
1.0,Way too small. I am sure the sizes posted are for models or the sizes are asian.
1.0,It keeps coming lose and falls off of my wrist.
1.0,It didn't fit well. I looked frumpy!
1.0,This is hardly genuine leather. Poor quality and a poor fit. At best this is worthy of a Halloween costume.
1.0,I didn’t like it . I returned it right away
1.0,Do not stay on the ears
1.0,So disappointed again! Will give it to my small niece. Loved that shirt but too small.
1.0,"to small for me, so have to return and but cute"
1.0,The chain fell off the cuff immediately after i put it on.  Cheaply made and not well put together.  Not impressed.
1.0,"I got this according to size chart, too small"
1.0,The product I received was a cheap imitation of the product in the photo. Returned
1.0,This rins over 2 sizes too small after cold water wash and cool dry. Barely reaches to the waist.
1.0,"MUch too large and company never even replied to my request for an exchange.  Poorly made, looks and feels like a ripoff."
1.0,"these are not worth the money. first of all, they stick out WAY outside of your ear, so unless you're a back sleeper, sleeping is going to be uncomfortable. second, these work no better than a cheap $2 pair of earplugs that i bought to go shooting. third, why are there 3 cone-shaped plugs at the end? this seems excessive and just contributes to the large size. i did a bit of research and couldn't find an advantage for this. finally... i don't understand the product pictures. they show someone sleeping, studying, doing construction work - but not a single person is actually wearing the earplugs in the pictures.<br /><br />i'm keeping them because they do work... but they are not better than cheap foam earplugs. don't waste your money here."
1.0,"Was so excited when i got these socks as hate my ankles covered in shoes! The fit and shape looked great to begin with. After wearing, am now so upset with this purchase. The quality is really really bad! Have worn 2 pairs since i got this package and both pairs ripped on first wear strangling my toes! I would blame my toe nails but why blame them when they have never ripped any other socks!  Gave a couple of pairs to a friend who also complained they ripped on first wear! Now I have to get those two worn toe stranglers and my two worn pairs and wash them and send them back to get my refund.  What a waste of time!"
1.0,"Doesn’t look like the dress in the picture. I know sometimes the lace can be different, but i expected the lace to cover the same areas as in the picture. The top is weirdly placed and the lace at the bottom doesn’t go up to the belt which is needed to get the right look. I’m sad. I was so excited for this dress."
1.0,"Do not be fooled,  this is NOT glittery. There are no sequins, rhinestones etc on this mask. It is just fabric. I would NOT have bought it  had I known!"
1.0,I order a large thinking this was gonna be an a line dress and it wasn’t the line was just under my boobs and the pockets were at my waist and it was too tight on the shoulders. It hit 3 inches above my knees. I’m only 5’6” and my bra size is a B... so I don’t understand why this didn’t fix. Even did the measurements for this dress.
1.0,Necklace came broken
1.0,This shirt is not off the shoulder whatsoever. Yes it it a nice shirt but not what the picture shows or what I was expected.
1.0,This item sucks.it won't stay on my ear
1.0,I order this before a large and had to send back . It was like a small.. so they sad order 2x  Will be equivalent to a US large but still on the snugh side.. I take a medium to a large but suggest if some take a large get a 3 x and will be equivalent to a large or a medium.. would send back but need it for a trip this Saturday will have be carful not eat to much .. lol like the quality and fabric but not size chart .. very disappointed !!
1.0,"Very disappointed , seems are coming apart and I missed the return window. Complete waste of money."
1.0,YIKES!!! WAY  WAY too small!
1.0,Ordered gray pink and cones in apricot. Color on model is gray but they are not sending gray. Very disappointed
1.0,The product is not true to photo.  The items are lighter than it appears in photos.
1.0,received broken. Only had one arm. Also does not look or feel like real silver. Looks cheap and junky.
1.0,"I didn’t even get them on my watch face because they are extremely difficult to slide on, I have a series 5 by the way. After multiple attempts with 2 different bands I tried a 3 that did slide on like they are supposed to, I noticed it was different though where it slides on as far as there being 1 magnetic piece on the ones that didn’t work and 3 on the ones that did. I paid for a variety not one or two that work.  I’ll definitely make note of the company/brand name so I don’t make the same mistake twice as I like a big variety so I buy and have a lot"
1.0,"Very itchy product, poorly made in China. Not representative of the quality expected on the picture. Gave me a huge rash after putting it on for 2 minutes. Not worth your time. I don't see how this product could get any better than one star."
1.0,Daughter went to put the hat on and fell apart
1.0,"I did not even had a chance to use this product because it broke after trying to open 4 times. A total waist of money and time!,,"
1.0,Don't waste your money on these I was sent 4 pairs of the same teal ones 2 pairs of whites and the yellow ones didn't even come with the head band. I expected 10 pairs of different colors.
1.0,These will not stay on your ear. They fall down.
1.0,Super cheap looking.
1.0,"This product is the worst quality clothing item I've ever purchased on Amazon. I didn't even try it on, it's so cheap looking. I returned it."
1.0,I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CHEAP STUFF
1.0,Pants fit very high on the waist unlike picture. Length is too short unlike picture. Material is very thick with no stretch so very uncomfortable. Bought size up to ensure bagginess but still too tight.
1.0,"a month and a half with them and I had to sand the 4 hooks that hold the shoelace because they were quite sharp and completely torn them apart. also after a week began to break the seam that borders the shoe. (Maybe to buy them and use them once a year disguising themselves as military at carnival or Halloween, it's fine) ... definitely not recommended for daily use. Nor did the choice of size go well."
1.0,"The price lured me in, and I got what I paid for. It's as stiff as a board, and difficult to use. Unfortunately the slots for credit cards and business cards are too tight to use. I'm really disappointed in this product."
1.0,"didn't look like the picture all too much. was a little disappointed but it was a gift and she seemed to like it, she uses it every day"
1.0,This dress does NOT run true to size.  Absolutely love the dress but it runs REALLY small
1.0,Not at all how it appears online.  The goddess image is MUCH smaller than advertised; the leather not as advertised -- a much lighter hue & not very flexible. Nearly impossible to attach clasp.  I've bought better items from the dollar store!  I don't recommend this item.
1.0,"Blouse is NOT like pictured at all. The bottom hem goes straight across, not &#34;wavy&#34; like it looks in the pic.<br />I ordered a 2x, thought it'd be huge an loose for beach wear,  it's not. It's heavy and runs SMALL"
1.0,It was tiny not wat I thot it wud be. Your photo showed it being bigger.
1.0,Was eagerly waiting for this product only to get disappointment after receiving it due to its color. The picture displayed a bright kurta which was one of the reasons I was lured in buying it but the actual color is a darker than what was displayed. Total disappointment.
1.0,Stitching is not the same
1.0,"Just received these, order was for 50, received 10. These are suppose to be individually wrapped, they are in one package. Missing 40 pieces is ridiculous! The tag inside the package even shows 10! As for the thickness, I knew what I was buying and they are 3 ply."
1.0,"Loved this purse when I first got it but 2 months later, one of the straps started to come undone and fray.  Cheaply made.  Had to long to send back."
1.0,"Fabric felt cheap, looked cheap."
1.0,Wore it one time when I came home the turtleneck was detaching from the sweater
1.0,Incredibly small more like a change purse
1.0,Sticker did not work. Cheap.
1.0,"I want to like this sweatshirt as a huge Star Wars fan.  But the product itself seems cheaply made.  The image is blurry.  there is no stretch to the fabric, and the fabric doesn't breathe well like other sweatshirts.  I ordered a 2xl (I am 6'2"" and weight 305lbs).  Other 2xl products fit me fine."
1.0,My wife like It but it broke. It just fell off
1.0,Junk..returning..
1.0,"It said extra large, the sleeves were really long, but the torso fit like a small."
1.0,It boke as soon as I put it on.
1.0,Cheaply made and broke after wearing it for one day.
1.0,I wear a size 40 belt that leaves plenty of overlap when belted.<br />They state trim to fit and size as 40-42. Nope!<br />Very disappointed!
1.0,This product sizes are wrong 14-16 looks like it’s for a 10 year old.
1.0,"Material and stitching are decent,<br />Material is not hoodie type, more like sublimated base material,<br />which makes sense, since art is sublimated.<br />Artwork is terrible, see pics. art is blurry, washed out, and very pixelated.<br /><br />Seller requires you to return item to China, so cost of return is more than cost to buy and ship.<br />Stay away!"
1.0,It’s pretty but it broke after one use .the pearl fell off one of the ends.
1.0,Poor quality I don't know what's it 's made of but it's junk as far as I'm concerned. This hat is ugly and does not fit right. Would not recommend.
1.0,"The material is very cheap and thin. It shows EVERYTHING!! Dimples, cellulite, etc. Not bad for a party with low lights. But wasn't good for my intention."
1.0,"This dress is sooo hot and waaay too long. I bought it for the summer but it drapes on the floor and it makes me sweat. I might try to fix it up with my sewing machine, but if I’d known about these issues before buying, I wouldn’t have gotten it in the first place."
1.0,I wish I could give this item 0 stars it was horrible..looked like a cheap dollar store item I just returned it for a full refund.
1.0,"Well, you get what you pay for I guess. They arrived timely and packaged well. But after 4 uses (mind you, no sweat, water or any kind of liquid touched these) it started turning my fingers green. Ew. Don't risk the buy. Save up and buy a ring of quality. Best of luck! '"
1.0,I loved this when I first got it but within two days the clasp broke and I lost both the medallion and the necklace.  Bummer!
1.0,Love the idea of the shoe but they are very cheaply made you can’t adjust the straps and the “Diamonds” are peel and stick which aren’t sticking very good in hot weather! I ordered a whole size bigger and they are still too small so if you wanna give them a try I suggest order 1.5-2 sizes bigger.
1.0,"I ordered this shirt in a large. When it came in, it looked like a child size shirt. I contacted the seller and they sent me an XL, and it still wasn't a good size for me, but I kept it anyway. They run very small. Choose at least 2 sizes up from your size."
1.0,Arrived so incredibly tangled/knotted up. Attempted to untangle for at least 2 hours. Gave up. Returning.
1.0,"This shirt was a complete disappointment. Ordered two sizes larger than what I typically wear, and was unable to wear it as it was too small. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Although this looked cute online, material is too silky...thought it would be more like cotton.  Thought it would be loose and flowy.....but is made way too narrow.  Wanted it to be looser/more material/cooler/flowy so as to be able to belt it if I wanted.  Don't want to be bothered with sending it back.  Unfortunately, I also ordered a palm print in the same size, but won't get that until August!.....didn't realize these came from China....probably would not have ordered these.  Need return labels so I can return to AMAZON."
1.0,These rings were made of very light metal or plastic. Good for children!
1.0,"the black is more like a dark grey, and the proportions are different than in the picture. the &#34;black&#34; stone in the middle is small and the surrounding silver is more pronounced which wouldn't b such a big deal if it looked like silver. the quality is just horrible. i'm very disppointed"
1.0,As you can see in the picture the pink lining over the foot area leaks some kind of oil of some sort I tried wiping and washing it but it didn't do any good.  Sorry for the review on the shoes I wasn't satisfied especially price wise.
1.0,"Okay, where do I start. These were absolute garbage. They stretch way too much and the string is so thin that once u move it it snaps. I have beads all over my house because more than half of them snapped."
1.0,"This jacket is cheap cheap cheap!  The first time I went to wear it the zipper ripped right off the jacket.  Luckily I was able to return it, but I chose not to replace it.  Even though it was very inexpensive it was not even worth the small amount I paid.  Save yourself the hassle, and do not purchase this jacket."
1.0,"Ordered a adult LG and got a kids sm/med.. The material was very ""cheap""... Seller was no help in terms of correcting the issue, I ended up giving it away."
1.0,"""Genuine PU leather"" is what the tag inside says. PU is polyurethane, so these are pleather, not sure how they can justify calling it genuine leather or lambskin when it's plastic. Also, that is NOT cashmere lining, very rough wool or polyester is my guess. I guess it's my bad for thinking I could get a good pair of leather gloves for under $50."
1.0,Looks super cheap as if out of a quarter machine!
1.0,Nice shoes. Poorly made. Torn within 2 months.
1.0,You got to be skinny to wear this I brought an xlarge it's looks nothing like the girl in picture I use it for a night grown
1.0,Very see through.. don’t think I’ll be able to wear it
1.0,"I know it’s not the most expensive necklace of this type, but come on - basic quality control should never allows this to be shipped. There is about an inch of untwisted material near the clasp."
1.0,"Not sized as stated on the chart. I would not recommend these to a friend. And they've said they refunded my money, but never have!"
1.0,Broke within a few months
1.0,This item BREAKS EASILY! The ball bearings that hold the two pieces together are extremely fragile and will pop out after only a few uses. I've bought this twice and both have broken in exactly the same way.
1.0,Very small. I bought a large and I usually wear a large. my boobs looking way to big in this and the wrap around isn't big enough. very disappointed.
1.0,Robby’s used to make a great thumb sock product that strapped around your wrist with a nice smooth seam.<br />This ‘condom’ sucks!
1.0,I had high expectations for this item but im very disappointed. It runs super small!!
1.0,The ruffle  tore away from the shirt the first time I wore it. Not quality fabric or workmanship.
1.0,Body suit was ordered XS. Fits for a size Medium. Belt came with excess glue & in really bad shape. Jewels were ripped off and loose in package. Never had ordered a cosplay so poorly made. 0/10 recommended.
1.0,within 1 week the shoe ripped at the lace area... and i m sure tat its not bcos of over usage....
1.0,My 1st disappointment...this belt fell apart...I was only able to wear it twice...
1.0,Beware of sizing
1.0,"I got about 100 tiny charms, 2-3 pairs, all VERY POOR QUALITY.  Mainly elephants, cats, horses, insects, cattle, Easter bunnies.  I waited too long to look at these so I can't return them, but there is nothing I can imagine doing with them other than sneaking them into the pocket of some unaware child.  Really, a total waste of money.  So disappointing."
1.0,Garbage glasses look nothing like the picture...the clip on lenses are weak and move around and there is a Vuarnet emblem on the clear lense which is not coming off...rediculous and costume quality !!!
1.0,It’s a beautiful ring and it’s so comfortable wearing BUT it’s made out cheap! Mine was broken in less than a month
1.0,"So sad. THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL bag, but it broke the second time I used it.<br />I would’ve understood if I was carrying heavy items, however, I had hand sanitizer from target, and my keys. Didn’t even have my wallet or phone.<br />Very disappointed."
1.0,The dress looked horrible and easy took big.  The quality is cheap and the color is not quite the same.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"The chains don't hang evenly and they were glued (?) on in a crooked manner. Not worth the effort to return them, and wouldn't be caught dead giving it as a gift. You get what you pay for..."
1.0,Would be cool if they just sent a replacement and didn't make my elderly father drive two towns over to the UPS store in the secluded mountains where he lives.
1.0,Too small .. you need to order 3 size larger
1.0,The box and stuff is cute but honestly I thought it would be a lot bigger it looks nothing like the picture the box I received is so tiny and the necklace is tiny too I wanted to give this to him for his birthday tomorrow but it’s more like a bracelet than a necklace I wish I knew it was this small I would have bought him something else
1.0,I ordered two sizes up still to small
1.0,The dress I received looks NOTHING like the picture. The one I received has very short sleeves. It is much shorter in the front. The color is wrong and there are NO pockets.
1.0,"This  shirt came and it did not even fit, false advertisement, it did not even fit my skinny teenage daughter"
1.0,They are snug for the size I ordered and the one color I really liked the zipper won’t stay up so it is a waste of money
1.0,All i did was open them to put them on (not bending them back at all by the way) and the arm on one side snapped off.
1.0,"It is not as good as they claim in the product description, not durable at all, it developed holes on the first try I wouldn't waist many on product like that, and I believe that you get what you pay for."
1.0,"Just opened the package. I was pretty excited, but.... Glue on the lens. Unable to get it off. Lens have small scratches. The arms are not sturdy. You get what you paid for. Too bad, this deserves 1 star. Disappointed."
1.0,The band did not clip on correctly
1.0,I thought this was a sports bra. A sports bra that does not offer any support is no bueno.
1.0,Broke at the eyeglass hinge after 3 months. No good
1.0,"I ordered a size up, because the recommendation says it may be small so order a size up if you like it looser. Still way too tight- the buttons are an inch away from touching. Very disappointed"
1.0,It's very big.  One size fit none.
1.0,"I agree that it is not as pictured - I looks like an oversized long underwear top, not to mention the blush is more baby pink - putrid and cheap. Don't buy."
1.0,This Product Is Extremely To Small You Need To Be An Extra Small To Wear The Extra Large
1.0,"It is not just small, it is tiny. I usually purchase S size or even XS, but this item I never managed to fit. I didn't even tried to be honest. Awful product."
1.0,This shirt was labeled XL.  I could not even get it on.  My father-in-law wears a small or medium and it fits him well.  The color is not very nice and the animal on it is huge and ugly.  Not impressed.
1.0,"No not at all my style....too too bigggg,fabric is also not gud"
1.0,The length of the dress was to short and it fit tight in the chest area.
1.0,These are not 35 below socks. They don’t even have the label on them. They are not warm just plain socks.
1.0,"If they made small clothes for small giants, this would be the place to go. This ""small"" was more like a ""medium"""
1.0,"I read the previous reviews and order a size bigger, and it still too small :/ it sucks because its so nice"
1.0,Totally see through. Returning it ASAP.
1.0,"Really disappointed, I have bought these repeatedly and every time they seem like the quality goes down...They don't even last a days time. Since I have such an estranged relationship with this brand I am very careful to place them within my face when I go outside or to the pool. Within hours of receiving the item and using them they will break, making me consider that the plastic they are using is very cheap and is very easily broken by little or no pressure. I would consider finding a better brand that doesn't break as easily as these do...even an egg is not as brittle as these sunglasses. If I could I would give them negative stars >:("
1.0,"nothing like what it looks like in the picture, matierial is itchy and not comfortable"
1.0,Was way shorter then the picture showed. I am 5/'4 and a size small. But way too​ small.
1.0,This product is not very durable I gave it to my sister in July as a gift it is now 1 October and it is missing at least seven of the crystals.
1.0,Returned not an actual plus size
1.0,"Besides being a very cheap looking and feeling hat, it didn't fit my head. My head is average for an Anglo American, but after adjusting it as far as I could it still didn't fit."
1.0,I wouldn’t know if this item was worth the buy. We got the wrong dress. It wasn’t even similar. Very disappointed. We needed it for an event so it was too late to exchange it.
1.0,Not what I thought it was nor fit well
1.0,"Very disappointed!!<br />My size is 2X, this dress fit like a 4X. I wouldn't recommend this dress at all. The sizing is all wrong."
1.0,Tiny and arrived broken
1.0,I only Use one I do not like it
1.0,Material To shiny and oversized
1.0,The description says delicate.... Theseare huge heavy and look incredibly cheap..<br />Return but needed return approval and seller requires a printed label making for a tedious return.. Cant just drop off and use scan code. These earrings are the size of a small soup bowl in length to give you an idea... Bummer
1.0,"These glasses were advertised as Polarized, however, they were not.  They even came with a card to check them, but the glasses didn't work.  I did try my polarized sunglasses with the card and my polarized sunglasses worked.  You would think they would try them with the card before sending them out.  Very disappointed!!!!"
1.0,The blouse was not as pretty in person as in the photo. The material looked cheap and it didn't fit Weill over my chest.
1.0,Misrepresented! Jumpsuit is SILK!! See through!!!
1.0,"The material is made from a costume. It’s paper thin, does not look anything like the picture. While  going back and look at the picture after I receive the item, I see the female is photoshopped. 😡😡."
1.0,Sizing is wrong.  Way to small for the measurements it says it will fit
1.0,Looks like a sticker on the sweatshirt
1.0,So bad 😡
1.0,This was way too short in the chest....it didnt fit.  I even went a size up and it didn't look right.  It was returned!
1.0,Already faded. I thought these were real.... waste of money.
1.0,These glasses are terrible. Everything in your peripheral vision looks like a rainbow and it's very distracting while driving.
1.0,Im very disappointed. The frame broke apart in my face with just one month of use
1.0,I will never order from here again to took more to send back that the whole thing waste of money it looked horrible it just hug in me
1.0,Sized way to small and cheap fabric. Also shorter than photo. Not happy.
1.0,"The side openers don't clasp shut and had to rig it to open and close. Bought it for a 14 year old and she loves the look, but is afraid to wear it for fear it will break. Very flimsy."
1.0,Total crap!!! fell apart after 1 month
1.0,Poorly constructed.
1.0,"This is a low quality bag with some assembly required. Upon arriving, you have to assemble all of the clips, which isn’t too painful just annoying. I packed it with my powerlifting shoes and other equipment, using the backpack straps to carry it. It wasn’t that heavy, my smaller duffle had no problems with it. Less then 5 minutes, the strap snaps off and my stuff falls to the ground. This is not a study bag, especially if your stuff it full of clothes with a pair of shoes. Not good for travel either because of the same quality issue."
1.0,"I bought 2 googles for my son for swimming and I think they are nice and make the job, but after a month of using them the clasp broke in both of them, I figure the little detachable clasp will be for sale on internet but I think is way tooooo expensive paying almost 10 dollars for this little part when the new google are 12 dollars.  I will try another kind of googles I am afraid this will happens to all googles I buy with this system.  Maybe if the company has a bag with 10 clips for 10 that will work. otherwise it is a waste of money."
1.0,"the face mask was missing, I'm trying to get one spent. I don't know if they wuld."
1.0,It was way too small and the length was more like capris.
1.0,Doesnt hold you in and immediately rolls down
1.0,Chain was way too thin and dainty for a unisex chain. Returned immediately.
1.0,Made for a child...
1.0,Jacket was perfect. Nice and firm fitting. The pants were big enough for two people.  Very strange proportions. I was not happy with this purchase at all.
1.0,This dress runs small.  I generally order a XL for a loose fit but this XL fits like an Large and the top is even smaller.  The person should not be andy larger than a B cup and generally wear a size 12 for this XL. Returned it.
1.0,Very strong smell of rotten fish. Horrible.
1.0,I'm 4'11 and the material dose not even reach my bra area. And it's extremely uncomfortable.. Horrible product do not recommend it at all..
1.0,Purchased this to wear when mowing grass need something to keep from breathing the grass and dust. Received today and tried on was tight around my neck I have a rather large neck I wear a 19 inch dress shirt. It was so uncomfortable when I pulled over my nose that I won't be using these.
1.0,Do not stay on your feet!
1.0,That fake looking iron isn’t cute I thought the zipper opened on shirt because that’s how it looks on the picture
1.0,not what i was expecting
1.0,This watch worked for about 2 days.  You certainly get what you pay for...
1.0,It’s absolutely too small and the material is not the best!!! Very disappointed!!
1.0,Ugly and unflattering
1.0,No clearly identifying size tag. I purchased a size large and what I received was a very big item that did not have a size tag. I purchased same item in a different color and was very satisfied
1.0,"It's sewn with a dart that is backwards, so it looks like a side nipple. Not good!"
1.0,Bracelet doesn’t close!
1.0,The first time I received this there was something in one of the glasses that wasn't supposed to be and I only received 3 pairs.  It clearly states that it's 6 pairs. I sent them back and they sent it again.  They were fine the second time but they still only sent 3 pairs.  I would've loved them if they had actually sent what they advertised.
1.0,The buckle broke on our first trip using the straps!
1.0,Was not compatible with iwatch. Returned.
1.0,so cheap I want to return them asap!
1.0,"Opened bag, it was poorly sewn around the sleeve. It was and several holes in the sleeve. Very disappointed! So upset the item was never worn!"
1.0,Order up 3 sizes of you want it to fit loose like the picture.
1.0,"I should have known that these were not compression sleeves. The price should have been the first clue, followed by the fact that these are one size fits all. I can see these being used as &#34;sun sleeves&#34; whatever those are, but if you are looking for compression sleeves, look into another product."
1.0,"Cheap, runs very small, crappy material<br />Total disappointment"
1.0,Longer than shown in the picture.
1.0,"This didn't look like the picture.  It was flimsy, very cheap material"
1.0,"Absolutely hated it. Before I even tried it on, I was like, eww no. The fabric is gross. The color is more of an orange-y red. Not at all what I was expecting. I returned it."
1.0,This is HORRIBLE. It is too large in the chest and breasts stick out. There is literally no fabric to cover the left breast. It has fringe scrap material hanging off of the bottom which is seriously like 1.5' too long. I've seen better dresses at Walmart. I have life threatening illnesses which prevented me from immediate returm and am now told its too late to return. My only recourse is to throw it away. It is THAT CHEAP.  I have literally never seen anything so poorly constructed.  Unwearable. If I could give it negative stars I would give it a negative 10. Its that bad.
1.0,Suit was too big. Contacted seller and still waiting. At this rate the time to return will expire.
1.0,The magnetic connection  does not hold very well. Lost several of them because It just fell off in turn I lost my button/snap!
1.0,"The design is good, but the clock stopped working after few days. I packed it to ship it back."
1.0,Material doesnt breathe
1.0,"This is so, so cheaply made.  I don't even know where to start.  Don't buy it.  Not cute.  The photo of this person is not even wearing the same shirt.  This is some cheap recreation and they did a terrible job.  Sad I missed the return window, this went straight to Goodwill."
1.0,"I bought 2 pairs of them. Same size, same style, etc. just different colors. One pair fits fine the other I can’t even get my leg into. The tag shows it’s the same size as the one that fits fine."
1.0,"Too big and baggy, sent them back."
1.0,"These leggings came in and fit great, very lightweight and love it the first time I wore them. I wore them for a second time, and the seam at the crotch ripped and now their is a massive hole."
1.0,VERY TANGLED. THREW OUT.
1.0,"awful, awful fit. bottoms are way smaller then top. i thought i was shipped 2 different sizes. gave it 1 star because i HAD to."
1.0,The description says it's STERLING SILVER 925 and its not it turned my finger green
1.0,Worst shirt ever<br />Left terrible scratch marks on my arm
1.0,Picture shows hoops being included but they aren’t. I ordered two pairs for myself and my god daughter and saw no hoops check packaging and it says studs. Earrings are nice but I only wanted them for the hoops.
1.0,"The material is weird and thick and almost stiff. I got a small which is my usual size and it was huge on me. And that would be fine if it hung like some oversized tanks I have, but it sticks out really weirdly."
1.0,looked like PJ
1.0,Do not recommend. The material is not what was expected based on the pictures. Feels more like cheap activeware. The stitching around the neckline is bad. The cut and stitching around the sleeves are bad. And there are loose threads and strings all around the shirt.
1.0,I didn't receive a the necklace as pictured.  What I received hardly passed for the picture.
1.0,Very cheaply made. Some rings you could tell had uneven metal work and scratches. The rings feel terrible when they're on. Completely regret buying this
1.0,I loved this until multiple snaps broke off after one wear  as so many others stated.
1.0,"One arrived busted and I can't seem to get a response from the sender for a refund. Yeah they are inexpensive, but would have been nice to at least get to wear them once. Ordered them for vacation and now the replacement won't be here in time and still no refund or response on the broken one. But they are very pretty.<br />Update: got the refund and ordered the replacement. These are so cheaply made that the metal between the stones busted between the ring and the bracelet while I was putting it on. Garbage. There is no way to repair these. Save your money."
1.0,Cheaply made. Oh well
1.0,En un dia de usó se rompió. No lo recomiendo.
1.0,sole on shoe (right shoe only) split. very sad quality control needs fixing. sad for a disable person that can not order at this time. i like so many other americans would rather pay a little more and get a better shoe. not sure i want to do business with these folks again<br />c. kent
1.0,"very bad quality, does not correspond to the image. instead of a dress cloth, it looks like a nightgown cloth.<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071F7X4R5/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1[[ASIN:B071F7X4R5 Womens Sleeveless Tunic Swing Dress - Basic Casual loose Tank Dresses, (Red-M)]]"
1.0,Item runs extra small..
1.0,Doesn't fit Samsung 3. False advertising.
1.0,The button clasp is cheap and came apart.if you could sind a clasp to replace it the leather seemed ok.
1.0,Coming apart after only two washes.  Hope the second pair I ordered two months ago is better quality if/when it ever arrives.
1.0,I ordered this hat for my husband for a Christmas present. I liked it because it is grey & the hot wheels logo looked nice but when I received it the logo is pink & the logo is a cheap iron on. Honestly I really don't think he will wear it. I am truly disappointed.
1.0,Can't set the correct time
1.0,Super cheap material. Everything sticks to it. I even washed it all by itself with bleach and it still came out looking filthy. The fabric attracts everything and then it’s impossible to get any of the filth off.
1.0,Thickness and size is perfect but the coloring flakes off within a day of use. I was excited to have the fun colors but will have to buy something else
1.0,It’s really pretty though but it Didn’t fit right had to send back maybe order a size down
1.0,Not a wet look at all.. the fit is funny. Not legging material...more like a loose jean except at the waist.. something is wrong with this jean.
1.0,I bought this item's and is nothing like what you are watching in the picture above ....It called fashion jewellery look cheep like a child toy was very disappointed so pleased do not order this save your money
1.0,It’s too narrow at the tip. May not work for wife feet
1.0,wrong color around pink flower should be silver
1.0,"I wanted so badly to love these but it's just not going to happen.<br />These came in the cutest reusable bag. I opened it so excitedly and once I saw the product I was immediately bummed. They looked wrinkled, large and not the color that is pictured. The color is way lighter and off shaded. I have pretty fit legs but not tiny so when I put these on and they were so baggy I was a little upset. They do not fit at the top and they get baggy all the way down. They just look horrible. I figured that since they cost so little and they actually felt warm on my legs that I would toss them in a drawer in wear them in the Fall/Winter over leggins when it's cold. I wanted them to look cute but it failed horribly."
1.0,"The overall quality of this jacket is very poor.  It's not waterproof, especially the seams - you will get your shoulders, neck, arms, even your pockets completely wet. It's also not particularly warm .At least not for a winter in the Midwest."
1.0,wasn't the gauged i wanted it was to long also
1.0,This is not for children . This is for toddler/baby although its not specified anyware
1.0,Didn’t meet my expectations
1.0,"The dress is too short and tight. I bought the dress in a medium, and I am a small person, but it was like it was for my six-year-old sister. Please don't waste your time and money. I am returning the dress tomorrow."
1.0,Don’t buy this leggings they are super sheer and they ripped on me with just one use!!! Thank goodness I was at home and not at the gym! There goes my money down the toilet because I can’t ever use them again😤😤😤😤
1.0,Love the dress but it’s made for girls not women
1.0,Great idea but did not work out. The holes in my ears were too small then the backs wouldn't go on the earrings because they were too small.
1.0,It was a waste of time. Never saw a difference.
1.0,My wife does not like walking in the sand so I got her a pair for our morning walks on vacation. After 2 and 1/2 weeks they have proved just what value they have for me. I stuffed paper towels in the sand sock/shoes so you can see the results. Bad is an understatement. should not be allowed to be sold.<br />John
1.0,Not quite the material I thought
1.0,"Not good, it’s like a shirt built like a jacket, it’s way too big, it’s misleading, be honest and use pictures that display the product 😡"
1.0,likes the style and shape. really cute but....the seam runs on the outside of the arm which looks horrible.
1.0,Thought I bought a cute 4th of July outfit or my daughter. Finally received it only to see it says “Democrat” all over the top. Could have done without politics being brought into kids clothing!
1.0,Really wanted to like this dress. When I tried it on my fiancé said “matronly” the mesh floral fabric is not flattering.
1.0,Gorgeous but flimsy.
1.0,This look may work for a select few. But it looks like a potato sack on me. I seriously laughed out loud when I tried it on.
1.0,Unflattering. Boxy. More for men.
1.0,"The purse is cute but the way it was packaged was horrible.  There were no stuffing inside to help keep it's shape.  When it arrived, it was creased on the bottom, the handle tilting to one side. The shape of this bag has been compressed into creases that I can't fix or make it pop back out."
1.0,"I am an average guy with an average size head who likes to wear beanies but this sucker gives me a headache after trying to wear it for 10 minutes, way too small and the ear pieces are not aligned to fit the ears. Pass!"
1.0,bad quality i'm returning it ...
1.0,Broke in my first use
1.0,Not even close to the color in the picture. Terrible.
1.0,"These pants have several cuts in them, as documented in the photo. I noticed it when I was ironing the pants after the return date. I am disappointed with this item and the craftsmanship."
1.0,"This the second time that you made a substitution that did not work or meet my needs. If you don't have what I ordered, just say so!"
1.0,"Cheaply made, within 3 days of wearing it one of the rings broke and fell off. Don't recommend."
1.0,Even a small is too big
1.0,"They are not an inch! Way too small for an adults ear. I'd say baby, toddler and maximum age for these would be a 6 yr old and that would be pushing it...they also took forever to get here."
1.0,This is made of the shiny stretchy material that Halloween costumes are made of. Very unflattering and very clingy. I
1.0,These comments are only about the fit or sizing only. And vendor customer service . . . . . . . or lack there of.<br />I'm a 6'1&#34; 225lb man and not my best shape either. 1- These shorts are too large at the waist to use the adjustable waist strap to cinch them down without creating a huge bulk at the cinch point. 2 (& main issue)- The shorts themselves aside from the waist are so large they dance on me as if I'm a child in my fathers clothing. The shorts seemed like an Urban fit for the saggy-pants wearing group and nothing else in my opinion. You would have to be a rather large male at the rump & thigh area to fill these shorts properly. I would probably categorize these as for Big/Tall men that require more material to properly cover them.<br />I have started the return process which now comes out of my pocket at $14 in a USPS box. I got an email from this vendor and they only approved my return and did not offer to cover the return costs.  I will never again buy from Heikon or this vendor again. Poor customer service IMHO coming from someone that has worked customer service for 40+ years.<br />You live & learn everyday. Lesson learned here.
1.0,"This is a super cheap quality necklace. It almost looks like it came out of a gum ball machine. I just received it and when I opened the package, the initial went flying to the ground bc the necklace was broken. Do not recommend at all. Pay a little more and find something nice. If I could give zero stars, I would. Sorry about that. :/"
1.0,Not even close to right color
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:f2aa81f6ec05904b7eccb7c10cfdcbd4]] This is what happened when i put it through the washer with warm water and common detergent. The hoodie itself is also not of good quality either. Seller didn't reply to my messages so i can't recommend this to anyone. I don't know if this was just a bad print or not, but one wash? It was peeling off easily without any effort. 2 thumbs down"
1.0,They were not stitched right at all
1.0,"The little ball on the end of the part that actually goes in and out of the belt hole is made out of plastic and ripped off the very first time I went to the bathroom and removed this belt: I told the seller and they sent another quickly. However, the product unfortunately is just cheap and bad. It broke again, do not reccommend and will never buy another myself."
1.0,Planned on returning but missed the deadline. Wore it the first time yesterday and discovered a hole near the hem on the back. Shirt was extremely thin. Nice style but poor quality. I will pay better attention to returns in the future.
1.0,The item I received is not what's advertised.<br />So disappointed. Does not invert. This is a regular umbrella.
1.0,Item does not look like it was posted.  Very cheap material and it does not fit right.
1.0,Really disappointed.....looks much nicer in the pic....very stiff and old fashioned!
1.0,"I'm 5'10, 140 lbs.  They came up about 1.5 inches above my ankles.  I look ridiculous."
1.0,Didn’t like at all. Looked cheap and poorly made. Returned.
1.0,it worth  ten cents
1.0,"I have had this item for less than 2 months and unfortunately, it fell apart in my hand. With no option for a return at this point, I just wanted to share my experience using it. In my opinion, there are other keychains you can purchase that can hold up longer than this one has for me."
1.0,These are too small.  I don't think they'll fit any adults hands.
1.0,Not American size as advertised.
1.0,"I returned this top- concept was good, execution poor.  The material was really subpar, silky/slimy- and it was huge.  Very boxy- out of shape."
1.0,"Cute in theory but looks more like lingerie than a sun dress. And runs very big...I am usually a 10-12, ordered a large and it swallowed me."
1.0,If I could give this 0 stars I would. First off as soon as I received the package I opened it to see the glasses immediately. Turns out it's not the same glasses in the picture as ADVERTISED. What also pissed me off is that it came with a card that says &#34;sent with care&#34; ironically the lenses were absolutely dirty I that had to clean it. It is not a &#34;metal frame&#34; but rather a plastic one. The left lens feels broken and will definitely break after a couple of uses. One of the nosepads were terribly crooked and the whole product itself feels like it would break easily. I don't normally get jacked from the products I order online but this one is a first. Returning it and want a refund.
1.0,Not at all what I expected...this is like a crop top. The length in the picture is not accurate. Will keep and wear but it definitely isn't what I expected.
1.0,This was a joke right. Waste of damn money. I wasted mine already... do t waste yours.
1.0,I ordered these for my 1 year old and received a women’s size.
1.0,Horrible fabric quality! I’m just starting to pack and one of the cubes already broke.
1.0,"I returned this item, it was too big."
1.0,Poor quality material. Returned.
1.0,"Product is very thin and see through, ordered recommended size larger and the xl fits a size xs person, we're definitely not what I expected, glad I didn't pay a lot of money, but I guess you pay for what you get."
1.0,looks horrible on - I thought it would be flattering for curves but it's just the opposite!
1.0,"I ordered an asian XXL, which is uposed to be an american large. It might be a large- in childrens sizes. I am by no means overweight and I cant even zip it. Also the drawstrings are made of plastic. They were wrinkled on arrival-and will be permanently since ironing plastic wont work out well. It did come on time and the hoodie looks cool (except drawstrings), but I don't recommend buying for a grown-up. The size I ordered was the largest it comes in"
1.0,it broke the first week I had it. :(
1.0,"Literally broke the 3rd time I used the bathroom on the 1st day I wore it lol. Total trash, don't even bother."
1.0,This shield is very thick. It is NOT clear. Your vision will be very distorted. It is not fog proof. Fogged up the second I put it on. It is not comfortable to for those with glasses. I do not recommend this item.
1.0,Ran too small so I returned them but I was sad about it because the cute was super cute. Stitching & material looked good.
1.0,"They're cute, but too much cushion inside."
1.0,"Very disappointed. Cute design, but when packaged it was folded and that created a large crease that will not come out making the hat sit funny. It just doesn't look right. The straw is too floppy. Shipping it back today."
1.0,"The chest area of this dress was very tight on me, I am a 34C. While around the waist it was very loose. The material at the lower back hung away from me. The hole in the front was very low.<br /><br />I received this product for free or a discounted price in exchange for an honest unbiased review. This has not influenced my opinions on the product. I have written honestly about my feelings and experiences with the product. I have no connection with the company and I have not been compensated for this review other than the product."
1.0,Broke the same day I got them :(<br />Wish they were a strong product cause there really cute!!
1.0,"I bought this watch in February, 2014 as a gift.<br />I just heard it's broken by itself, just after few months.<br />A little part lost inside, and stop working.<br />It lets me feel very embarrassed."
1.0,Honestly the only things correct about these masks are the brand and the color. I didn't receive a box of 50 like nor were they individually wrapped like they were listed. I got a packet with 10 masks in them.
1.0,The cheapest brittle frames I have ever encountered in a so called sport sunglass product. The right temple arm broke during normal use.
1.0,Ordered a large. Pretty true to size. Have a large bust. However there is no drawstring. And the strips of see through cut off even with my lady parts in front and back. And I am 5’9 and it cuts off mid shin. I will be returning
1.0,No coincide la talla
1.0,it took forever to arrive and came with the seam broken. complete garbage.
1.0,Recibí la camisa  a tiempo pero muy arrugada parece usada hasta la etiqueta está arrugada muy desepcionado con este producto no lo recomiendo ni a la tienda ya que te envian artículos usados o devueltos por otras personas
1.0,Looked nothing like the photo. Extremely cheap in material. Sent back immediately.
1.0,Poor quality in every way!!
1.0,Was advertised to work with Juliets. does not. Was not the effort of returning.
1.0,Do not waste your money. My feet ended up cold and wet just going to the grocery store. There is no way I'm wearing these this winter.
1.0,Way way too small and I ordered XXL and usually wear medium to large
1.0,To tight on top of toes can’t wear them they are the right length.
1.0,was very light but not durable and not enough space for clothes did not think it would last for one trip so it was returned for a full refund
1.0,Turned my finger green
1.0,Thumbs down
1.0,"Size was not good - too large, need to return"
1.0,They did not work when arrived still in box...a waste of money wrote buyer no response.
1.0,Second wash and seam came apart on one side. Poor quality.
1.0,Been purchasing these for a while and they’ve just now changed their material. It’s rough and not as soft as their previous product. Disappointed.
1.0,This robe runs ridiculously small. A also think it must be from some super cheap/knock off line since the neck tag says size 14/16 (the size I wanted to order) and the arm tag says 10/12 (not what I ordered). Regardless this did not fit my 9 yr nephew in the slightest. Clearly no inspection to how these garments are made. Do not waste your money.
1.0,Lasted 3 months and broke in half. Not returnable for replacement .  Definitely not quality product.
1.0,Suuuuper cheap plastic feeling and so top heavy they don’t lay right... returned!
1.0,Only 1 masked worked
1.0,These look and feel cheap. Not even worth the price. Product is ok for a kid maybe but not a grown up.
1.0,The design on the hat looks nothing like pictured.
1.0,"I'm very disappointed in this pair. Cut larger, thin, not shape flattering and don't like this style."
1.0,Not satisfied with the quality of the dress. Cheaply sewn
1.0,Fabric is see thru
1.0,I had the necklace for less than a week and it broke was very much disappointed
1.0,"I thought it being the brand is I wouldn't have any problem. And the cost I paid for it was not cheap, however, the coloring is coming off on the top on both sides, on the bottom on both sides, and in the middle by the driver's license holder. I have only had this thing since the end of December, and now it's the end of February. This thing should last a heck of a lot longer than just a few months. I'm totally disappointed in this.<br />please tell me how I can get this replaced. it looks tacky"
1.0,"just one day bought and the shark drawing came off.<br />They are nice, but the quality is not good.<br />I do not recommend it."
1.0,2 raindrops discolored the lenses then they peeled. Great fit though.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Lousy fit and cheaply made. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"As much as I like the buttons I got, I received buttons that were not what I paid for. It be appreciated if I had recieved the cutie marks. After all that was what I paid for. If I wanted to get their faces I would've gotten their faces. I'm not exactly happy especially considering these were supposed to be a gift. Huge disappointment."
1.0,Pedí un talle L para hombre y párese P y uno P para mujer y era más chico aun… una pena
1.0,I send this item back with  the tablet  this is not what I was expecting
1.0,Too flimsy! Hate it.
1.0,Absolute garbage. Arrived with small holes in seat of pants that I didn't notice until I pulled them on (making the holes larger). Buyer beware!
1.0,Returned not happy with this item
1.0,The Necklace arrived with one of the jams off. I glued it back on and on the way to the party the chain broke and the necklace fell off. When I was putting it back in the box the bottom portion of the necklace fell off. The necklace itself is very beautiful but cheaply made. dont waste your money
1.0,"Terrible quality, the design is so sloppy, holes in the orange part. I am returning them."
1.0,I compared this to what's purchased at a military store (PX) and it's oddly shaped....not narrow enough.
1.0,This only fits a ceiling mount. It is thin plastic. and the screws were missing.
1.0,No support at all. I should’ve paid attention to the past reviews. Very disappointed.
1.0,They look very nice on the picture but they are very cheap so you can obviously tell. You get what you paid for.
1.0,Wrong size shipped and the product looks nothing like picture
1.0,"I'm a lover of all things piggy, so I was super excited to get this adorable bib for my little guy. Sadly the quality of the print is awful and looks like it had been washed a ton of times. It's faded and doesn't pop like the picture. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1.0,Doesn't fit tight
1.0,"First off, this is not a jacket. It's a very thin, almost see through, wind breaker. Horribly made in China! I'm assuming it's supposed to say &#34;SHARE YOUR HEART&#34; but it's misspelled. So it says &#34;SHARE YOU HEART&#34; instead. In the front they just cut a piece of the misspelled fabric and attached it without a care so it says &#34;SHARE YOU HEAR.&#34; Don't know why Amazon has a cheap product like this on their website. Sad too because it's a sweet looking jacket. Sent it back so my son wouldn't get made fun of at school."
1.0,Liquid is spilled all over the box. Waste of 18$
1.0,Like the message if it was printed correctly. Poorly made and printed. Terrible quality.
1.0,"Nice rhino, sadly mine arrived with both horns broken. Still I decided to keep because the price is awesome without horns."
1.0,Although we ordered the correct size they ride so low that they are uncomfortable. Plumbers may enjoy them. Would not purchase again. Possibly order 1 or 2 sizes up.
1.0,After wearing once and I mean 1 time the soul of the shoe started coming off very disappointed cutie she and fit great but had to return :(
1.0,Flimsy material and broke very soon after wearing.
1.0,I ordered an xl. Not even a size 4 could wear this and button the front.  Beware of anything coming from China. Sizes are all over the board.
1.0,"I liked the colors and styles but the Material is really poor, The material deteriorated only after wearing it once. It looks air breathable but sweats a lot. The socks in the picture are first time washed but looks like this just after one time use."
1.0,Broke while I was working
1.0,More like a long uneven cut shirt
1.0,This took forever to get and then it was missing pieces so we had to send it back
1.0,"The fabric felt like it was made from the same material as nurses’ scrubs. Frankly I would be embarrassed to wear it out in public, it looks very cheap."
1.0,"SORRY,not really leather,"
1.0,"Returned, even the smallest size was way too big, so sad."
1.0,"This isn't an 18 mm strap, although it is labeled as such. It is a 20 mm strap."
1.0,"They literally sellout within 5 minutes. I like them and would love a replacement. The backs provided start to bend the earring, so I would like a new pair and I will use a different back."
1.0,This bathing suit is very cheap material. The bra feels like it has cardboard in it and with the tight back and around the neck I found it incredible hard to put on. Would not recommend.
1.0,"Looks nothing like the picture, very loose and cheap."
1.0,Misleading in size very disappointed
1.0,Very bad product. Threw it away after first use. It was cutting my son’s foot at the achilles.
1.0,Smaller than actual size and see through
1.0,Entirely the wrong size  large fit like XS
1.0,I got it and it does not look like the picture at all. In the picture the fit is loose and looks very soft. I got mine and it looks very very cheaply made and is not a good material. It also is short and not very relaxed and movable. I am not happy at all. I'm actually probably going to give the shirt away.
1.0,Fit too small. Has a Terrible odor that won't wash out. Similar to burnt plastic.
1.0,Ordered 5.11 brand belts and got these.<br />Not happy as they are thinner and bigger buckle is cheaper.<br />We/I use these for hard use-duty and this is not acceptable.<br />Chinese crap.
1.0,"Received yesterday and was very disappointed, one of the large stones was missing. Would have been very pretty if was intact"
1.0,"I got this thinking it would be great to throw over my black dress to dress it up a bit.  It looks like the picture, so in theory I guess it does dress up my dress, but the fabric is just... uncomfortable.  It's a stiff fabric that doesn't easily drape, lending itself more to a vampire collared cape look rather than a soft wrap.  I tried adjusting it more around my neck, so it hung down in front more like a long scarf, but that just made the back stand straight up.  I tried adjusting it, moving it around... I give up.  I just can't see myself wearing this anywhere.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this item for free in exchange for posting my honest review via the Amazon Vine program."
1.0,this product arrived without batteries that cost me $40.00 dollars and still does not work.  I will not pay for a return even though they will take back.  Also the product had a big mark on the front.
1.0,Way to odd of a fit
1.0,"The fabric is very very thin. Also, the fabric piece is HUGE and not for anyone with a small or medium face. Don't recommend. -Candace"
1.0,Returned. Runs very small. Not sure if I will bother getting next size up.
1.0,Way too small. Bad purchase.
1.0,"Nice warm leggings but after not even 2 hours of wear there is multiple little holes below the waist band, they're slightly sheer so no bending over unless you wear a long top over, and the fabric is not very durable...brown pair came with a run in them like panty hose....not pleased at all. Waste of money entirely."
1.0,Really bad quality. They are all broken. It didn’t even last a Day in the linens. Don’t recommend it at all
1.0,"Any stretch you may think is there is not. They rip instantly and aren't worth the money. And they arent really made with much material so they definitely aren't ""absorbing"" headbands. I give one star for color only."
1.0,"I think seller needs to send a microscope with this item next time that sales it, it is super small..."
1.0,My son wore these for two days and the stone fell out.
1.0,El cuello parece una bandeja o blusa
1.0,Not how it looks in person compared to the picture
1.0,"The hat is shipped folded completely flat somehow and it's impossible to remove all the wrinkles and resulting strange shape of the hat. The tie is also extremely small, as if made for a child... Pretty disappointed"
1.0,Son loved it. But unfortunately the chain broke immediately
1.0,This is ridiculous. Same knock off case in an Apple box that others have left review about. Blocking the credit card charge.
1.0,The pants were too big and the top was way too small.
1.0,Kinda cheap Didn’t feel to secure like it was going to fall off
1.0,"I bought this watch for my son who is totally blind. The buttons are not easy to press. After two months, the talk button stopped working. There is a warranty, which is great but horribly inconvenient, since my son depends on wearing his watch! This talking feature is the whole purpose for wearing this watch. For that to fail is extremely disappointing."
1.0,"The overall quality is horrible. You would think that such a well known brand would be better made but after a couple of washes (gentle cycle) the threading began to unravel around the neckline. For those reading reviews, take more stock with those that have had the item long enough to have been worn and washed a few times. Will not buy again."
1.0,"Not true to size, runs very small. Clingy material. Will return it."
1.0,It has no stretch
1.0,No issue with the smell. I was under the impression from reading the caption that this was a pack of 2 refills. Not the case !  The price is WAAAAY too high for a single<br />I returned
1.0,"I bought this umbrella because of the UV protection.  Since it cost $47 I expected to receive a quality product.  However, after only 8 days of normal use two stretchers broke.  I do not recommend buying this umbrella!!"
1.0,"It said it was sterling silver ring and it was not, what now? 😕"
1.0,Size not true to America sizing.
1.0,This belt is a hunk of crap.  It broke in less than 30 days.
1.0,Too big for my wrist and I did not like the material.
1.0,Not cute at all looks like a mumu
1.0,The angels are facing backwards so no one can see them when I wear them.  Total waste.
1.0,I only received one earring
1.0,These run way small it felt and looked like 4xl. When I had it on I don't know if the fabric thin or it was so stretched on me the shirt was see thur and look very dirty due to it.
1.0,Very soft and comfortable.  Favorite gown for my little ones.
1.0,"Small fitted. Sleeves are holding on by a string, literally."
1.0,Horrible product. My son is very disappointed. This product is made out of parachute material it's not a hoodie it's not warm like it shows in the pictures.
1.0,"I purchased this item in a medium, my daughter wears a size 8 and could not fit this...It isn't worth the return and it is not useful. You live and learn."
1.0,"Great, worked out  well"
1.0,"Guess I should have read the reviews before I purchased. I ordered the pink one, which I loved the color but one side snaps on but the other side won't. I even tried switching them around and it still wouldn't work. I immediately put my original band back on and am sending it back for a refund. Don't waste your money!!"
1.0,"I like it when I got it. But I wore it, the ring holding on turn brass. And the letters came off. The black in the letters. I was sad. Because I really like it."
1.0,The item was ordered two months in advance of a wedding.  It arrived late and it is not what I expected.  It’s a little large and the seller is not easy to contact and shipping it back is difficult and expensive
1.0,Beautiful earrings! I only got to wear them once. One earrings came off the hook and was lost. So upset
1.0,"I bought this as a disposable item just so I could see how it fit and if I liked the design and width before purchasing a real necklace. I still expected it to actually look gold. It doesn't. It's almost brown. It's really dull and already starting to tarnish before I even put it on to check the fit.<br /><br />But, it served it's purpose. In the trash it goes..."
1.0,"Gave 1 star cuz it is not letting me submit my review if I don't, otherwise would have given a minus..Going back , horrible fitting, horrible quality cloth.."
1.0,I did not even give this to my granddaughter.  Cheaply made and did not have the charms that it was advertised to have.
1.0,Shrink a lot going through my dryer. Try to buy a six up. But also for this price of a sports bra it is thick and good quality fabric just the design was off
1.0,Asian sizes. Lining looks like dryer lint.
1.0,As you can see in the picture the straight bar piece is missing on one of the earrings.  Without this piece it can't be put through the ear.  I'd like to return them but no return option is available.
1.0,Sent this dress back. Way too small. I usually wear a 12 but ordered a 14. When I tried it on the side zipper had a gap of at least 3 inches. Pretty dress but seemed cheaply made.
1.0,I should have read the reviews before purchasing.  The logo is too far down on the material so when rolled the cuff covers the logo.  The beanie itself is just too large and doesn't resemble a normal beanie at all.  My son took one look at it and put it back in the packaging.  It also took 2 more weeks to arrive than expected.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,"I purchased this dress for an upcoming wedding. I needed the dress to come soon, so I paid an extra $30 for express shipping. I was extremely disappointed with the dress. There were multiple holes inside the dress and the zipper was broken. I tried the dress on once and the zipper had completely stopped working. I am extremely frustrated. I reached out to the seller, requesting a refund and they had asked me to pay for the shipping myself instead of just emailing me a prepaid shipping label which was $16. So far I am out a dress for the wedding, the cost of the dress, and $46 for shipping. I will update this post when I get refunded and see how the seller handles this but at this rate I would not recommend to anyone."
1.0,I didn’t realize it has “666” on the front of this shirt.  I wanted to throw it into a trash receptacle away from my house!
1.0,This did not look as cute as what the picture advertises it as. Cheap quality button up robe looking like dress with just a piece of silk string to tie around your waist. Returning this.
1.0,These were made of the strangest material ever. It says 100% Cotten but they feel and sound like corn husks. My son wouldn’t wear them and nobody would buy them on resale 😔. They also shrunk to a tiny size.
1.0,Horrible sewn in face to look deformed and now they refuse refund or exchange. Dont order save time n money
1.0,I thought these would be small acrylic molded earrings. They are just flat looks like it was printed and stuck to a foam board. They sent and extra pair of flat pumpkins I guess to try to make up for fake description
1.0,This arrived with one side damaged and really dirty.
1.0,Poorly made.<br />Nasty fabric.<br />Don’t bother.
1.0,Broke the same day it arrived.
1.0,"Sadly. ..Even 3X,  too  small in arm  holes, & across chest.  Returned."
1.0,Ripoff
1.0,"Does not look as pictured. Very gold & blue where the photo looks more holographic pink. The white stars aren’t anywhere near perfect. I ordered a smaller size Bc it was oversized, still expecting it to be kind of big. Honestly it is HUGE and really long. Not very flattering."
1.0,Does not look or fit like pic. Fabric very thin
1.0,Not I expected
1.0,"They will be going back, the Lapis earrings were scratched.  It was like the blue color was painted on the earrings, not good quality."
1.0,This product is from China how do you expect it to fit Americans ?  It's so ridiculous that things are not American made and we continue to sell this junk made in China and charge top dollar for cheaply made products.... Not happy at all....
1.0,Looks and feels like rubber
1.0,The spacer does not fit will not be folds of the mask. Returned the item.
1.0,Wore one time and my finger poked a hole<br />Would not recommend

1.0,Very disappointed.  Very cheaply made
1.0,Too small sleeves too short for a 2 X
1.0,Don’t like this skirt...doubt I will ever like or wear it!
1.0,I could not fit my leg in the pants... No really... I gave them to my 90 lbs step daughter to wear for PJs. They were Mens XXL
1.0,i should have returned. they are to tight on my toes i will have to cut the toes off to see if they will work for me.
1.0,"First shift I fell flat on my face. They catch the grip causes you to fall. I fell at work requiring a trip into my own ER, employee health, day off work and knee injury. Do not buy them !!!!!"
1.0,"Top is fine, bottom is a small if you're 200 lbs! Seems mismatched"
1.0,Above my ankles are swollen and bruised. Thought they just needed to be broken in but wore them all week and nothing. Wish I could get my money back!!
1.0,"The product was incredibly cheap and formless -really just a sewn-shut square of polyester. Missed my window for returning it, unfortunately. Went straight to the Goodwill pile!"
1.0,"Took twice as long to get to me as was promised. And it was made out of cotton instead of a combination of wool and polyester, as promised.  It was 97% cotton."
1.0,Very disappointed.  I took a chance and soent alot of money (for a piece of wood) first off i was so excited to be receiving this today. Sadly it was in 2 pieces! And its so tiny anyways. Not happy
1.0,"Tried to wear it one time and it's already broken. Once I got it loose enough to go onto my wrist, I went to tighten it and that's when it broke. Into the garbage it went."
1.0,Oversized and very sloppy looking. I should Have returned it as I have never worn it
1.0,"Costume like quality, doesn't fit right and the service I got trying to find the original review was terrible. Wouldn't recommend."
1.0,This ring is very cheap looking.  The eyes are huge and take up the whole face.  It doesn't look like a cat at all.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:855ff313548caca91ff35b389cdf6f95]] The product is of poor quality and is not recommended for purchase.
1.0,wore these 3 times and already have a hole in the heel.
1.0,This item is so very disappointing... I ordered a XL.<br />I wear a M-LG the arms and shoulders are a SM - M<br />Chest M-L lower body XL. Sad! This item looks very disproportionate.
1.0,This is marked as a 2 pack but only one arrived.
1.0,"It does not fit my watch, too small"
1.0,Dead on Arrival. Did not work after charging. Returned
1.0,Poorly made and material is too thin
1.0,With the picture it looks like it is going to be long but when it arrived it was not long but instead wide. Do not like it and it smells pretty strongly of a perfume or incense.
1.0,"My immediate thought, was how cheap this product is.  This is not a &#34;marble&#34; rosary. The beads are not marble stone, they are marbled plastic. If you are looking for true stone, do not buy this product."
1.0,"The shoes are really bad don't buy them , they fall off my sons feet."
1.0,To small I'm waiting for my return
1.0,"I was looking for a novelty pair of socks for under $10... guess you get what you pay for! The colors are off, it’s a cool blue/green, the trees are different (not that big of a deal), but mainly only half the sock has print. This was going to be a Christmas gift so I’m disappointed. Spend the extra money and shop somewhere else!"
1.0,"Terrible mask, I doubt it really works! The holes are so bug and the mask is huge! Still never used it because it looks ridiculous."
1.0,I love the look but I got 4 pair and they break in the middle if you barley put pressure on them. I had two pair come already broke.<br />Poor poor poor quality
1.0,"I thought it’d be more partial of a loop, and thicker. This actual size doesn’t even work for what I need. I had this in my cart for such a long time. :("
1.0,Wwaayy too short and did not look anything like the pic
1.0,Pretty disappointed. These were suppose to be glass plugs and they aren't. They're acrylic. Debating whether I should send them back or not...
1.0,Too small texture horrible am so disappointed
1.0,Flares are way to big couldn't even wear them.
1.0,Was not happy with this purchase at all. The torso is sewn correctly but the sleeves were way too big for size.
1.0,"Cheap, ugly and does not look like photo. Returned this item."
1.0,Only 1 star because zero stars was not an option. Terrible quality. Super small.... my cat now has a tank top... low low quality
1.0,"Took a chance on this XL even though I’m usually a Large or Medium... Being too big aside, this dress is awful.<br />Completely unlined, nylon zipper with no hook at the top, black fabric that’s fairly thick but, for some reason, can still see light through. There’s no fabric or care label anywhere, but it feels like some sort of polyester.<br />The mock turtleneck height collar is uncomfortable & has a loose tie feature that just hangs there. The peplum waist overlaps in front, so just lays there.<br />I’m thinking the overall blah of this dress is because it’s all one sub par fabric - no stitching features or buttons or trim of any kind. Looks unfinished & quite uninspiring as is, so maybe a good seamstress can help."
1.0,broke the first time I wore them and I had to pay to send back.  Shipping was more than the glasses.
1.0,"This took a month to arrive, because it came straight from China. The color was beige, not brown as it appears. The quality was horrible. The bottom hem curved out, giving the shirt a little bit of a bell shape. Not attractive at all! The style is cute though."
1.0,Received a Dodge Lanyard#
1.0,I so wish I seen the reviews on this worthless sweater!! I ordered a 2X and received a 2X that looks like an X-Small! Its like a child's size! Not to mention the quality...Ugh!!! Now dealing with the company...its all HORRIBLE!!!! Save yourself the hassle DO NOT PURCHASE!!
1.0,I was looking for this type of pants for work. The color and material were nice. The fit was wrong in multiple areas. I am curvy petite and it do not fit well at all. I had to returned them.
1.0,Plastic clip snapped off after a couple swimming days in our pool. Not happy at all..
1.0,"I paid $30 for painted beads that appear to have been dipped in blue-green paint. The longer I have had them, the bluer they have turned. I am so disappointed with is purchase and it’s poor quality. These are not malachite, and I am not sure what they are, but poorly painted junk"
1.0,I wear a medium. This fit like a 4x.  It was way to big
1.0,Could not manage clasp.
1.0,Wasn't what I thought it was.
1.0,"Bulky, clasp hurts. Did not come with free return shipping so I did not get a full refund.Bummer."
1.0,Didn't
1.0,"badly stitched, poor quality"
1.0,I ordered these shoes for my grandson and he absolutely loved them. The lights quite working so I returned them with no problem and was sent another pair. Now the second pair will not work. Don't buy these shoes!!
1.0,"These earrings are advertised as ""clip"" earrings but they are actually for pierced ears. I returned them and the vendor was very cooperative in reimbursing me."
1.0,I won't order from this store again. It's missing the gemstone completely. It's not even in the bags. So the manufacturer  has zero quality control.
1.0,Extremely small mirrors make it awful to look at anything through them. Unlike other brands for the same price this one has a huge piece between the eyes. It's like if you crossed your eyes and stared at your nose. Constantly noticeable and annoying. Worst buy!
1.0,Not  good  I have this for a month and the color is faded out
1.0,Jacket fit my son great but pants was way to big
1.0,Not compression and not to size.
1.0,"This is not like the other dress I ordered from Miss May, this one came from a different seller at a cheaper price, much longer delivery time and ended up being an inferior product, it seems to be a knock-off?  The dress was not made from the expected, thicker spandex material, there was no stretch to this garment AT ALL making it almost impossible to put on with no zipper, the tag in the neck had been cut out!!  I returned it immediately...I will now pay the $21.00 more and order this dress directly from Miss May."
1.0,"Turtleneck is  likely all spandex, or majority  spandex with about 3% cotton. Runs small. XL fit like a M. Nothing as described. Returned."
1.0,The dress is a super thin material so if u dont have a barbie body forget it cause it shows everything
1.0,I really loved this ring i was disappointed when it broke right in half and i just threw it in the trash not realizing i still had the time frame to return it. It lasted 1 month to the day.
1.0,"For biking shorts, they create more problems than they help. I get it, bike riding can make your but hurt but I would happily wear no underwear before putting myself through this pain again. I commute via bike everyday, and love myself a good spin class but the most memorable spin class was the one I spent trying to pull these down to prevent a blister in the worst place ever!!! DO  NOT PUT YOUR BUTT THROUGH THIS."
1.0,Runs extremely small for an older man’s physic
1.0,Way to small for a size 10/12!  I regret this purchase.
1.0,"Very unhappy. Setting isn’t marked. It’s not silver. Very cheap. It looks and feels like plastic. I bought this because the original pendent I wanted that I bought from a different vendor never came. I’m not going to bother returning this because my first go around was such a pain. There doesn’t seem to be any point. Transactions such as these make me think twice about purchasing from vendors in other countries. I give up on owning a nice yellow sapphire pendent. If you are looking for something appropriate for a child or tween this is it, but if you expect quality, I’d look elsewhere."
1.0,Runs too small. Xl fits like a medium
1.0,"These gloves are so huge, they won't for my six year old nephew let alone my 18 mo old son"
1.0,Cute but runs small. Zipper broke.
1.0,"Blouse fabric was not as expected, too large mostly on the sleeves.  Poorly made."
1.0,cute but cheaply made. It broke after one day of wear. 8 hours of that day were spent driving.
1.0,Definitely returning these boots. Toe box is very tight even with thin no show socks.
1.0,"TOO TIGHT<br />TOO SHORT<br />ABSOLUTE CRAP<br />Might for a 115 pound, short, woman!"
1.0,"I was excited to try these since they are supposed to be a knockoff of a popular legging. Seemed great at first, but within a few hours the seam at the butt ripped open. I do not have that big of a butt! Never had this happen with other cheap leggings. I wanted to exchange them, but they have the nerve to charge return shipping. Not worth all that trouble for $12 leggings! They are soft so hopefully other people have better luck!"
1.0,"Did not look at all like the picture, the quality was incredibly cheap. Not worth it, don't bother purchasing."
1.0,This hat looked decent but it didn't fit comfortably at all and it was so poofy it looked weird.
1.0,"I am not at all happy with this purchase.  I bought two and gave one to a friend.  The first time I wore one, I noticed that the seams have come apart at the waist and on the hem of one leg.  After one wear.  Ridiculous!  This was a total waste of money."
1.0,couldn't even get my toes into the slippers!
1.0,Horribly made.  Plan to return them.
1.0,"Very uncomfortable, made foot pain worse"
1.0,This dress is completely see through. I ordered a large on purpose so it would be comfortable. I will never wear it though because it is completely see through!
1.0,I was very disappointed in just how cheaply made this think looks.  Not worth the money to return so just trashed it.
1.0,What a P.O.S. White gold? I don't think so. White gold plated? maybe?!? obviously plating sucks... After 8 months those earrings look like well look at pictures and decide yourself how do they look like. Will never buy from them again...
1.0,"These could have been amazing but for $20, they were such a huge letdown. That show is full of amazing quotes and they weren’t even used with these keychains. Not worth the money."
1.0,Garbage paint came right off
1.0,Slinky weird fabric ... going back
1.0,The material was so uncomfortable and it did not look anything like the pictures showed. Very disappointed in the product
1.0,"Not happy because I doubled checked and it said it was a necklace and that is what I was expecting, when I got it, it was a bracelet, which I don't want"
1.0,DO NOT BUY ! horrible quality super cheap ! color comes off !! bad quality! it breaks easily and weighs nothing at all
1.0,Item arrived damaged. Strap not attached to romper.
1.0,"The size was not as advertised, and the feel of the fabric was not very nice."
1.0,I read the reviews so I bought them one size bigger than I wear. They are still snug. I am using them for shower shoes on vacation. They do not look like would not hold up with much wear.
1.0,The three pack isn’t the same material as the single shirt and doesn’t fit the same
1.0,the picture shows the mask covering the left side of face which i wanted but recieved mask that covers right side of the face. wrong discription in add
1.0,After a day or 2 it just started coming unhooked from the fitbit.
1.0,"Wore the first day, it bent!<br />Afraid to reshape, fear it will break"
1.0,Cheapest quality shirts I’ve ever purchased.
1.0,Extremely small the 3X looks like it would barely fit a size 910
1.0,"Poor description inaccurate website photos that are misleading. 2-piece but does not say the helmet itself is 2 pieces leading one to believe the second piece is chin strap to hold it on, which it does not have. Loose on child too tight for adult. Flimsy crap plastic and overall poor quality and presentation."
1.0,"Wrong color, wrong length. Ordered what Saab pictured green and short. Received purple and long. Second time ordering. Same problem. Returning. Completely incorrect product description!!!"
1.0,these earrings broke after three days of wearing
1.0,ring to big for normal sized nose ring
1.0,Cheaply made.  Never will order from them again.
1.0,"Such thin, cheap wood that it snapped in my pocket after 3 days"
1.0,"This dress is poorly made and ill fitting. I was going to give it to my 12 year old daughter, then I just decided to return it."
1.0,"I was so excited to receive this dress. It was exactly what I was looking for.  Unfortunately, it arrived with a hole in the zipper seam and an additional hole in the closure. Extremely disappointed. I can't recommend."
1.0,Constantly pulls out my hair. My hair gets trapped between the fan&gets trapped in the dangle decorative on the bottom of the fan.
1.0,Not wroth it
1.0,Buyer beware. You will NOT receive the item shown. You will receive a cheaply made imitation. You couldn’t pay me to wear this. I was mortified when I opened the package.
1.0,The inside material stuck together and a once great belt turned out no so great after 2 years.
1.0,They showed up in pieces :-(
1.0,"This dress was very large and fit me like a potato sack. If you have to have this dress, I recommend ordering a size or two smaller. There is no shape to the dress and it just hung off of my body. Very unattractive. Not cute in the slightest bit as it has no curves to it or anything. Even using a belt with the dress didn't help the shape of it."
1.0,After the latch got stuck and  wouldn't come undone I ended up having to cut it off me.
1.0,"These are small opal earrings in a flower shape. They are absolutely gorgeous. The opal picks up light and shines it back in beautiful multicolored sparkles coming out of the black base color. The color pop is simply amazing in these earrings. Unfortunately within about 30 minutes of wearing them my ears started to burn and one of my earlobes began to swell. Since I am allergic to nickel I figured these would be safe to wear. Sadly, I was wrong."
1.0,"True to size in width but not in lengrh and wouldn't have fit properly in my ear, and the picture is misleading. I got a 00 (10mm) hoping that I might get the color variation the picture shows. But it was almost a completely solid dark green with no variants. At almost $10 per plug, it's not worth it."
1.0,"Sloppy sewing,looks terrible."
1.0,My glasses were broken I’m returning smh not happy at all
1.0,"I ordered a XL and received a medium, not just 1 time but twice. This was very inconvenient for me, when I'm leaving for my trip soon."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:5789f88402bddaa6fe64958ac32317de]] I just received 4 watches that I ordered from the same brand. I like the look of the watches<br />But this watch is Crap! Watch don’t even work! The second hand keeps stopping no mattter how much you try to move it!! What a rip off!  I don’t believe Amazon allows these guys to sell there product,"
1.0,Looks good except for when I wore it to the pool. It started to have fuzzy fabric come off on my first outing. I can’t wear it for the second time since it looks old and ugly now.
1.0,The mask arrived with a crack in it where the strap is attached. It was not cut properly as you could see lines where the cuts where supposed to be. The material the mask is made of is a very thin cheap plastic. Expected it to be better quality.
1.0,This material is not what the photo delivers. It is a cheap thin polyester type of material. Not impressed to say the least.
1.0,"These shirts are made of very high quality material but I have tried to order 4 different shirts and none of them have fit very well. If you are very thin than these shirts will work pretty well but otherwise look in other places. Firstly, the sizes are both in Chinese and English so beware of the differences of those sizes. Thee sleeve lengths are perfect but the torso sizes are very skinny. I usually buy large in American Sizes but would definitely need 2XL in these. Also, be prepared to pay for your own return shipping if and when they do not fit."
1.0,Bought these for my girlfriend to wear to work. They're transparent so that's a no-go.
1.0,"This bracelet broke within two minutes of me opening the package!! FOR TEN DOLLARS!? IT BROKE! This is not a bracelet that will expand or compress, it is made of cheap material. Such a pity because it’s really cute. :("
1.0,Blue dress is cheap I won't wear nor will my daughter. Pockets not flattering
1.0,Only lasted a few months
1.0,The size is to small! More for child size
1.0,Loved these! Put them on...and pop pop pop pop. Broke right away. Beads everywhere. What a waste.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! This has the worst odor. It smells like rubber and pesticides. I would not let my teen daughter wear it for fear of what the smell was. It was left on an end table overnight and when we went out to living room the next morning, we couldn’t stand to stay in the room to have our coffee. We had to air out the house!!! DO NOT BUY THIS. Only have it a star so I could write this review."
1.0,Man these put black cotton ‘dust’ all over everything. I really wish I had taken a photo of what it did to my dryer. I had to return these after seeing the ‘dust’ all over my child’s clothes and crib…smh
1.0,Broken when received<br />One had back broke off. Very disappointing they were for a wedding<br />Should wrap better
1.0,"Doesn't fit at ALL like the picture.  It looks like a ""moo-moo"" on.  I will never wear it!  Don't buy it."
1.0,Did not run.
1.0,Product wasn't what was described.
1.0,Was not what I expected at all.
1.0,It’s weird cheap feeling material
1.0,Short band and hard to push buttons for change.
1.0,"Buy a size down, cheap material, ripped the first day worn just when tying the strings. Would return if it weren't too late since its already ripped.."
1.0,"This dress looks like it was made in a high school Home Economics course! Also, no size tag on the dress. Amazon photo is deceiving of its quality."
1.0,Not actually stainless steel.  The entire pendant discolored to the cheaper material underneath and the design actually wore down.  Extremely disappointed.
1.0,By far the worst buy ever!!!!!<br />First day use and fold apart.<br />I want a full refund.<br />I gave this as a present and I don't have words to explain the embarrassing
1.0,Didn't like it after a week it broke! Not happy!
1.0,Waaaaaaay too small
1.0,False advertising.  I ordered  20 inch socks.  I received 16 inch crew socks.  They are much shorter and much  thinner  than I  ordered. Don't  bother with this product.
1.0,"This was put together sloppily. It is no where near center, which means it won't work. The stone itself is nice though. If it had been assembled properly, & usable, I would've given a 5 star review for the price.<br />I'll be returning this for a refund."
1.0,Very small! My 2yo can barely get his head in it.
1.0,Not at all what the pic looks like not Cotten it’s polyester and well ugly
1.0,Great for two weeks then the hinge broke which rendered the case useless. Use was normal (I don’t even snap my cases open and closed) so it wasn’t user error. I wasted my money on this - don’t waste yours too.
1.0,The clasp for the strap to attach to the dress was sewn in the wrong place so it was not wearable.
1.0,No es lo mismo color  que muestran en la foto<br />Me entristese
1.0,Runs small I got a 3x it fits like a small
1.0,They fell apart and the stitching came out after 3 wears. I have 3 large holes in them making them unwearable
1.0,I would give 0 stars if I had that choice. Size chart is soooo wrong. Add at least two sizes up to your original size. Have to give it away to somebody cos it will cost just as much to return as the shorts itself.
1.0,So bad. Not at all what it says it is.
1.0,use it one time and it broke...
1.0,4 months in and they are already broken. They fit a little funny over my glasses but were comfortable.
1.0,"Larger than I expected, one pearl is missing. Not sure what to do with it."
1.0,it was impossible for me to wear it. So i offer it
1.0,The description greatly states that this comes with 6 bandanas and it only comes with 1
1.0,Too late to return.  Dress does not fit as pictured. Clingy.  Not loose fit at all
1.0,bogus
1.0,"The shirt was sewn crooked so the stripes are off it's ugly. and too big. And the collar is weird. The material is weird.  It's wrinkly and swems like it always would be. The color is not what expected as well. Sending it back, it's awful. When I say the material is weird, it's not like T shirt cotton it's a blend of polyester some cotton and some spandex, which need not be in  T shirt. It's also made in china. Over all, if you want a real T shirt do not buy this one!"
1.0,I've had it a few weeks and all the colors have since turned. No more cheap beads for me.
1.0,TINY! This item is not even an adult size. I couldn't even get this medium over my chest and I am a size 8. This is also NOT a sweater dress. A sweater is knit and has stretch. This is like an orthopedic bandage with no stretch at all. AWFUL!
1.0,The locket won't stay closed its broken and I have no idea how to return because they are no instructions for returns
1.0,These are very cheaply made in their construction and begin to come apart very easily with even one wash. They are a firm/not soft texture and are scratchy. Also do not fit a big butt comfortably.
1.0,Don't buy! These are see through. Waste of money.
1.0,"Way too small, I like them long, this is not"
1.0,Its wide it looks short n wide not like the picture
1.0,"Terrible quality. There were strings hanging, it’s the type of material that will shrink the first time washing and drying. In addition, there was no tag in the shirt specifying the material and cleaning instructions."
1.0,"This coat was a joke. It's so disproportionate that it looks hilarious. It definitely does not look like the picture, which is such a shame. The body is huge like a tent but the sleeves are so tight that they fit my three year old."
1.0,"I got a totally different dress,  It was tan and a had a few rips. I guess they should do better at checking their returns."
1.0,Nothing like the photo. Waste of money.
1.0,"Does not stay tight, always adjusting."
1.0,These goggles broke after about an hour of use. Total waste of money. The rubber piece around the eye disconnected.
1.0,This is sized way too small to be called an XL.  I’d need to order a 3XL to fit me based on the XL I got
1.0,This broke not long after I received it.
1.0,This is meant for women with small breasts. I wear a C cup and all this did was drag my bustline down! Don't recommend for C or larger cups!
1.0,"Will not work with pants etc, way too small.  The coil stretched out with just trying it out with very little stress on it."
1.0,El anillo se empezó a descolorar una parte era platiada y la otra amarilla muy poca calidad del material
1.0,"I finally put the decorations up for December and upon driving in the highway for 15 minutes, one of them broke off and hit the car behind me at 80 miles an hour. I thought it would be at least strong enough to hold its own on the highway but unfortunately it is not. Now I have useless decorations because one is missing and I refuse to drive down the road looking like mutation of rudolf."
1.0,"They looks used and old , and bigger than I expected."
1.0,The color arrived (both the gold and green) looking like they had sat in the desert sun for a year and all the color was bleached out. The green kaftan looked like a faded mint green and the gold looked like a faded sand color.
1.0,"Flimsy material, photo gives false perception"
1.0,Ordered XL gave me a medium
1.0,"I ordered a 4x, thinking I would order a size up from what I needed for my husband, a 4x fits like a small, it fits me perfect, and I'm a small, 5'2 124lbs. He couldn't get his arms even in it. Unfortunately, just a waste of money and am very disappointed that the vest isn't even close to the size it claimed to be."
1.0,"There were only 4 cors in the bag. Yellow, green, purple and silver. What a disappointment. I really wish I read the reviews before I ordered be cause it looks like I'm not the only one who was duped. Will not order these ever again."
1.0,This band is very difficult to put on and take off- it’s really poorly designed. I will be returning
1.0,Size runs small. The medium fits like an extra small.
1.0,Not a soft product size is not true with fit
1.0,"The pendant is beautiful and the packaging and presentation are on point. However, the ad says the chain is strong and I wouldn’t agree. The chain is cheap. And the necklace I received wasn’t made correctly, it had a jump ring at each end of the chain instead of a clasp at one end. I guess you get what you pay for!"
1.0,Very cheap material and hot
1.0,Colors come off on wrist
1.0,"Item made really cheap. You get what you pay for. Arrived bent, broken due to careless packaging."
1.0,Not as thick as it had looked in pictures so I returned.
1.0,Too small it looked much bigger on Amazon
1.0,Turtleneck had 3 slits/holes in the front of it.
1.0,Bought 2 of these dress and they both ripped in back the first time I wore it. Cheap! Don't buy!
1.0,Sleeves are super short. It took months for delivery
1.0,"I don’t recommend this shoes, paint full to wear it"
1.0,My daughter loved these shorts and they fit well. She wore them to gymnastics practice twice they ripped the very first time they were placed in the wash machine.
1.0,I hate these pants.<br />Won't wear them.<br />The fit is way to baggy .<br />I'm surprised they had such a good rating<br />Makes me question the ratings on amazon<br />Wrangles cargo pants are so much better
1.0,"I wore these maybe six times before the rubber/plastic tabs wore off, making these useless."
1.0,The material felt cheap.
1.0,"The cloth is nice, however, I’m not sure what the blue spots are supposed to represent, but they look like a pen leaked all over.  Shipping took a long time. Awaiting another version.  Disappointed."
1.0,Some of the links weren't properly secured and the necklace kept coming apart.
1.0,wAy to long long and bulky.
1.0,I got a large. But I received a medium. The fabric is itchy and stiff. Also it doesn't hang like the picture. At all. Including the V top part of the sweater. It's much too revealing and will look odd if something is put under sweater.
1.0,Do not buy! Its very pretty. But it fell apart the first time I wore it.  Should have returned it!!!
1.0,Muy grande soy talla xs salio talla L
1.0,"Fabric is mostly (cheap) cotton - very stiff and wrinkles easily.  Looks nothing like the picture on the model and fit is odd - while the sleeves are uncomfortably tight, the body of the shirt is way too oversized and knot does not lay nicely/looks awkward.  Color is also not as pictured; the gray does not have the spacedye effect shown - it's just a plain drab solid gray."
1.0,"I bought this shirt for my fiancé as his Christmas present. He wanted something from Polo that is purple so according to the picture on Amazon this shirt looks perfect. However when I got the shirt, it did not look anything like the picture. The shirt is simply white and purple stripes. It does not look purple overall at all like the picture. My fiancé did not like it so asked me to return it. We did not even open the shirt to try it on.  I returned the shirt and was told that they would charge 20% restocking fees. Shoppers beware."
1.0,These come in one size fits all. I am an average sized person (5'6&#34; size women's size 8) and these are ENORMOUS. They didn't work for me at all because they were just too big.
1.0,These were horrible pants. I returned immediately. They are completely see through. The material felt cheap and odd. Nothing like what was pictured.
1.0,"Looked so cute online. I look like a sack of potatoes in it, there's no shape"
1.0,Thing fell apart after two months.
1.0,Had to request a return.  The pic shows  numbers that can be seen. When I rec'd this I could hardly see  the numbers...very light grey...silver<br />If I can't read the time not worth the watch. Photo is misleading.
1.0,“Pleather” off the toes scrapped off after one wear to school. Toddler shoes should be more resilient than that.
1.0,"The material is terrible, it’s see through! I so want my money back. I guess you get what you pay for right?"
1.0,"I ordered an XL, had to return because the size is wrong. Cut more like a medium"
1.0,Extremely thin material.  Its see through and  strings are unraveling
1.0,This product arrive bent and lopsided. Not able to wear it.
1.0,"Nothing to like. Flimsy, stained lenses, scratches your nose. Doesn't cover whole eye area. Don't buy."
1.0,"This skirt looks well made and very cute. Unfortunately, I was unable to try it on because there was a giant cockroach pressed into the layers of tulle. Super gross  🤢"
1.0,The review does not deserve a 1 Star.... it's actually perfect in everyway.... I was shipped the wrong color because I ordered the matching pjs.. boyfriend shirt style PJ's.
1.0,I wear a large in US sizes. I was told to order 2 sizes up. I ordered 3X to be safe. It is way too tight. The colors are not as bright in person. I will have to give this away.
1.0,Extremely small.  I used the measurements provided by the seller and the shorts were at least 2 sizes too small
1.0,The hat is a cheap Chinese made copy. The patches are loosingv threads the hat is stringing to pieces. Should have known from the price.
1.0,Lamentablemente no me ha llegado el producto y NADIE me responde por ello
1.0,One of the sleeves had a small hole on it that quickly got bigger as soon as I tried it on. I haven't had them on for 5 minutes and the hole keeps getting bigger. It seems like this is a really bad quality and it won't last me a lon time . I am very disappointed with my purchase .
1.0,"In the photo, this dress appears to be quite cute, flirty and fun.  In real life, it's very odd in the cut and design.<br /><br />The arm holes are way higher than I can wear, plus the ""cute"" cutouts on the front are right where a bra or cami strap would be, which distracts from the cuteness.  Unless one is small-breasted and is willing to go braless (fabric super thin) or wear a strapless or cups... straps will show.<br /><br />The fabric is almost like a paper.<br />The scalloping look is cool, but feels like it'd be so easy to snag/tear.<br />The color is very pretty.<br /><br />But the dress, as a whole, just doesn't work."
1.0,It is bright orange with bright blue and a cream not the fall colors I had thought I ordered
1.0,Doesn't fit normal.<br />Missed return deadline and I am the loser now.<br />Will know to stay away in the future
1.0,"Bought a size bigger than usual tomake dure it was loose forsummer wear. Bust area looks likeot isstretched but turns outitis notmade right. Button holes are not lined up and stiching is loose, bad quality!!!"
1.0,"If you've ever seen Dwight's aunt in the Office, this is pretty much what she's wearing. It's not cute, it's a huge 1960s style moo moo. Not good. Don't buy. For real."
1.0,This dress matches the pictures not the one with the model but the other one. It’s a cheaper version. It’s EXTREMELY itchy like unbearable as if you were wearing bar wires. It’s not true to size. Save yourself the time don’t get it.
1.0,I ordered these along with another pair on Prime Day and the gauge was so big it tore my ear. I am so bummed because they are adorable. This is the second pair of Lesa Michele earrings to do this to me. :(
1.0,Ugly! Cheap quality.
1.0,No structure to it. Will be returning it.
1.0,I bought 2 of these bracelets. Both of them broke as soon as I slipped them out of the package. Not worth the trouble I went through to get them. Very disappointed. These were supposed to be gifts.
1.0,&#34;silver&#34; ends of both earings were bent when I got them
1.0,"These are some really,  really cool shades and I was stoked on them, but they broke so easily and quickly. I'm do bummed :( The side bar just snapped off when I put them on."
1.0,Weirdest fit ever ! If your looking for a Batman costume go ahead .  Comes complete with wings .
1.0,"My son is 18-months old, and was super excited to wear his first pair of shoes.  I was attracted to the light weight, no-tie features.  However, when my son attempted to walk on our tile and wood flooring, he kept sliding and falling down because there was absolutely NO TRACTION on the PLASTIC soles of these cheaply made shoes. The reverse of what one would expect from a shoe.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:  The Coodo shoes are dangerous for children of any age.  These so-called sneakers should be removed, immediately, from any household, and certainly from Amazon's inventory.<br /><br />What should have been a joyful memory quickly turned into a joy-kill experience.  Never again."
1.0,"Don't BUY, just fades away..."
1.0,"I bought them for my girlfriend. They were suppose to be blue, as advertised, but they are WHITE; and one of the stones are hazy.<br />Now I have to go through the trouble of returning them and find another earring to buy with BLUE color."
1.0,Doesn't work!!!
1.0,I bought this for my boyfriend and I. I have the all black with one blue bead. I wore it outside for about 5 hours while shopping and the sun ruined the blue bead to the point of it almost being white. After only a few hours outside my bracelet no longer matches my boyfriend. I wouldn’t have worn it outside if I knew it would fade so much after just one day
1.0,"The zipper didn't lay flat and made the skirt stick up, I thought the material was pretty cheap as well. Style and fit were fine."
1.0,Gave them away they look more and fit like women's jeans
1.0,I did not like the material and style!
1.0,"The material feels like a costume, not comfortable to wear long term"
1.0,Got this necklace and it was so tangled I can't wear it and no backings to the earrings
1.0,Very cheap and flimsy. One was already ripped when I opened the package. Do not recommend.
1.0,I have 3 stones that have already fell out only after less than 2 weeks. Would not recommend.
1.0,"I should have listened to a previous reviewer and not bought this bag.  This product starting leaking from the water exit valve immediately after the bag was filled.  I could not tighten the valve enough to stop the leak, which continued all night and soaked my patio rug.  I liked the idea of the bag, the handles on the bag and the weight of the bag, but I would not recommend buying this bag because of the leak."
1.0,The interior pocket ripped within the first 6 months outside of Amazons policy.  Not high quality
1.0,Horrible color. And the spikes are yellow not even green. Do not suggest wasting money on this.
1.0,Ordered before. Ordered same size but this time fit much bigger.
1.0,Damaged product. I’m not happy. I planned to wear this out tomorrow but obviously that won’t happen. Multiple stains all over the dress from top to bottom.
1.0,"Las tallas son mucho más grande que lo indicado en la table, exageradamente grande. Una talla L es como una 2x visualmente Horrible deberian debolver el dinero o enviar una talla que realmente aplique."
1.0,This shirt is horrible quality. It was sent to me with a hole & threads loose all over. Sizing runs small too. Do NOT recommend!
1.0,The Chain was broke when I got it.....but for the price what can you except.  Why sell something that is broken.
1.0,Broke in two weeks and I had it protected in my pocket.
1.0,Neat mask but was disappointed as the picture showed the tongue lite up and that is wrong it doesn't.
1.0,The moment I took this out the plastic I realized the quality would not be of what I was expecting. While I will say It looked warm I didn’t like the material it had a shiny sheen to It instead of a regular matte cotton material that I was expecting.
1.0,"This did not work for me at all. A refund was not an option. The adhesive does not seem to work well even though the wings and theory are nice. May work for others, if your bust is heavy like mine its not a good option."
1.0,"Crappy fabric.  This is not a sweater.  Its like rayon.  Super long.  Im 5""4 and it was almost to my ankles."
1.0,These sandals are not leather.  I have to return them.  Very disappointed
1.0,Not the material I was excepting for yoga/workout pants. Really thin material. Unforgiving
1.0,"did not fit well, and thinner lenses,"
1.0,I feel like the other reviewers got a different shirt than I did.  The quality is terrible and there is no stretch to the polyester fabric.  The neck hole is too small to fit your head through!
1.0,"My son bought this bracelet for his girlfriend.  Unfortunately, it was very fragile and she lost it after wearing it a very short time.  It either broke or opened without her knowing."
1.0,"Bought this for my 4 y/o grandson as he specifically wanted red, yellow and blue. I was sent gray, tan, green and purple WTH???"
1.0,Horribly cheap. Ripped the first time he wore it. Does not hold darts well.
1.0,Requested a return
1.0,"Not counting my wedding band, watches are the only jewelry I wear.  When I see a reasonably priced watch that I like, I'll buy it.  This was a Vine Voice (free) item for me to review, but I'm expected to be honest.  Honestly, the only thing I liked about this watch was the band.  Here's why:<br /><br />1) The display is basically unreadable without moving your wrist around to catch the perfect angle to reflect light off the silverish display.  Most of the time all I see is a black face.<br /><br />2) The light for night illumination is about equal to a dying firefly.  I didn't realize it was working until I went into a totally darkened room to test it.<br /><br />3) The most inoffensive description of the instructions is 'something was lost in the translation.'  Wow.  An hour I'll never get back, or want to repeat.  I'm afraid of using the timer or other modes because I don't want to have to reset the watch if I hit the wrong button.  Which is what I did three times before quitting.<br /><br />For the positives:<br /><br />1) It keeps perfect time, but so does my $10.98 Casio that is a bit over 5 years old.  And I can read the Casio with a quick glance.<br /><br />2) I like the band.  I'm going to put it on the older brother of the Casio in the pictures.  It's 11 years old, and was only replaced because the band broke.<br /><br />This watch is extremely difficult to read, set, or use."
1.0,"Este producto no he podido usarlo, él tornillo que agarra la evilla, vino dañado, y no se puede usar el cinto.."
1.0,"The quality was very poor, sorry, I have returned the boots. Please credit my account accordingly. Thank you"
1.0,You sent the wrong product twice!!!!!!
1.0,Terrible quality. Pieces falling out. Metal not cut right. Just a huge mess.
1.0,"I had to return these as they were made of super cheap material. Also it was small in some areas like my waist, but also managed to be too large in others such as my ankles/legs. The chain was broken as well. Had to return it for my money back. Really wanted a pair of cute joggers, these weren’t worth it."
1.0,This is the cheapest material I’ve ever felt.
1.0,I bought these shoes for my son (navy blue) and total disappointment.  They are sparkling shoes more suitable for girls than for boys.  In the photo what looks like white mixed with blue is actually glitter.
1.0,Rose gold color were awful. The chain was shorter than normal. I returned it.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY. This watch band itself is fine. The buckle... is terrible. It failed on me yesterday and now my watch is no more. I commute by bicycle and without warning, the spring pin that holds the metal buckle on failed sending my watch off my arm and into traffic. Spend some more money and get a watch band form a company that uses better materials."
1.0,Very bad experience<br />It came with missing the most important part which close the chain<br />I am disappointed
1.0,Don't bother...pretty sure these aren't solid sterling silver and they actually arrived with all sorts of idk what on them...tarnished maybe? One was inside a plastic bag and the other was loose.
1.0,Don't not buy very cheaply made. They cut the side and was uneven the hook was coming off. Definetly returned
1.0,"Product looked cheap, material was not quality"
1.0,"If I wanted a used bra, I'd go to value village. This is disgusting. There's obvious stains and wear marks, including orange tint from someone's foundation. I can't get over the generous quarter size stain on the front of it. Not worth it, don't waste your time."
1.0,Terrible quality. Don’t believe they are real quay.
1.0,"I saw this dress on one of Buzzfeed's &#34;things that are trending on Amazon&#34; lists and thought with all the great reviews it would be a super cute, quality made dress. It was anything but....First off it was HUGE. Literally did not fit as measurements indicated at all. The bottom half (the skirt part) is made from the cheapest material that looked like what swimsuit bottoms are made from. The only positive thing was that the top was well made. I would highly recommend not listening to BuzzFeed and not purchasing this dress."
1.0,"If I know it came from China, I would have never purchased. Size didn't come close to an American size. Very disappointing."
1.0,came with no instructions of how to wear or layer it.  Also the shiel is so wrinkled from shipping without any protection you can't use it.  I've tried everything to flatten it out  but nothing works..  It is cute and would be a good product ifd it was mailed flat and wrinkle free.
1.0,"I regret not taking a picture of this top before returningit. The fabric over the belly is sheer and puffs out, causing you to look very pregnant. Does not lay on body like it does in the model in the picture."
1.0,"Band arrived having already had a number of the links removed, which I found odd and have never seen on any other band purchase.  On one of the links the screw was already sticking out.  Tried to tighten it, wouldn't tighten.  Tried to remove it, wouldn't come out.  Luckily I have large but not huge wrists so I was able to remove the bad link, add in the ones that were previously removed, and it fit.  Also, the package did not come with the spring bars.  I cannibalized my old band and luckily the bars fit otherwise this band would have been useless.  As for the band, it is nice...seems to stick a little where the band attaches to the watch, but that may be because I had to put in my own spring bars.  Anyway, its a nice watch band, but the quality control is pretty poor for the cost of the product"
1.0,"Poor quality, seems don’t line up for buttons."
1.0,These are very cheap and very thin
1.0,"Order larger size , the seat is too tight . Another waste of money!!"
1.0,Extremely undercut.
1.0,"It was very pretty, but broke the first time wearing."
1.0,"I bought this product and loved it because of the color selection. Fast forward two weeks later, I was walking one day and the inside wire just snapped. I thought this was a gorgeous bracelet but ultimately it was cheaply made."
1.0,"Unless you are built like a child, don't waste your time on this shirt. I ordered this in an XXL even though I am usually a large and it fit more like a child's XXL. I returned it."
1.0,"The tassels aren't full at all. They have a flat, uneven look to them."
1.0,I really like it but the print didn’t last. Rubbed off within a few weeks.
1.0,"THE PICTURE GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT THE BOTTOM IS FLOWING.  IT IS NOT, IT FITS FLAT, IT IS KNIT AND IT DEFINITELY SKIMS THE BODY WITH NO FLOW OR FLARE"
1.0,XSM  on top & XL on bottom.  Had to send back!!!
1.0,I was shocked at the flimsiness and how cheaply made it is...bends like paper!
1.0,"Does not fit, I bought a large and it did not fit. I used the size chart and the large should have fit. Gave it to a friend who is really small and she had a hard time with it. Then I bought an extra large which is this one and I can only get ONE clip hooked. I am not overwieght I only wanted to slim up my waist. What a waste of money."
1.0,DONT BUY!!! BOUGHT 4 OF EACH COLOR ONLY RECEIVED 1 OF EACH!! SCAM SCAM SCAM!!!!
1.0,"Wore them once... split up the middle, if you know what I mean, and I wouldn’t even say they were tight or under sized. They have poor construction which is sad because they are cute and I was getting quite a few compliment."
1.0,Way smaller than described
1.0,"Great design and its suitable for kids, too tight for adults not much elastic if this is for adults !"
1.0,Felt that I was not true to size. Material doesn't look as rich in photo...poor workmanship.
1.0,"This dress was terrible from the moment I saw it in the package. It is nothing like what the photos would make you think. The dress IRL is scratchy and rough and not float at all. It looks a lot like the material my grandma had as drapes. It fits strangely, and the cut at the top isn’t nearly as flattering as the photo. Because the material is stiff, it arrived wrinkled, and doesn’t “drape” as shown in the pictures. I ordered the blue sleeveless dress. It isn’t showing as arrived by the shipper yet, but this is going back as soon as possible. Terrible purchase."
1.0,"These would be great boots if they could just handle water.. not made for wet exposure, surface peeks off, pictures show boots after half year. No warranty claims accepted if not bought directly from Hunter. Buy something else if you want rain boots. Totally overpriced, made in China not UK."
1.0,"The photos and the ad make it seem like it’s a nice sweatshirt, but it’s completely deceptive. The material is completely thin and the material does not breath nor does it match the size I ordered.<br /><br />Do not waste your money"
1.0,"Cute dress. However, way too small."
1.0,Too small and need to find out how to return it.
1.0,I wish I could give no stars the glasses look nothing like the picture total scam !!!!!
1.0,The clasp broke on this necklace right away!!  Very cheap chain that is connected to the element so you can't fix it.  Will not spend my extra time to send it back.  Don't buy it!
1.0,"Wrinkle , not a formal look"
1.0,even the 1X/2X was too small and I can always wear that size comfortably.
1.0,"They are very pretty, but the fourth time I went to wear them the stem popped right off when I tried poking it thru the pierced hole in my ear."
1.0,"I really enjoyed the fact these sandals were pretty cheap, especially since I was buying them so late in summer. My son normally wears a size 9, but I bought a 10 assuming they'd be a little big and he'd get to wear them again next summer... They came and were even a little small for him but not by much so I'd say they definitely run small. Within the first week both shoe straps have broken... on top of him complaining they really hurt his feet (assuming it's the sizing). I had pretty good expectations for these sandals, from the reviews. I'm pretty upset these were a pretty big let down."
1.0,"Had to return, ran very small, I thought it was cotton.. Felt very much like polyester"
1.0,Hard to put in but once they’re in they come out so easily. I wouldn’t recommend
1.0,"Do NOT get these boots if you are wearing them for a factory job or for work or much hiking outside. I had to get gel inserts after a couple weeks and then soon after that they completely broke on me. These boots are only for fashion purposes, trust me on this one!"
1.0,Flaws on almost every level of this! Gave it to Salvation Army!
1.0,This bracelet is extremely small even for a small wrist ... the 1st one was damaged and was sent back ... when I sent the damaged one back it has not been credited as replacement complete ... will not buy again
1.0,I bought a size up and they still didn't fit... Super bummed 😓
1.0,I ordered these because they were listed as briefs...they're thongs. Big difference
1.0,Meant for my granddaughter. Cheaply made. Metal ornament is cheap and could be a hazard.
1.0,"Very poor quality! Broke within a week. Contacted customer service for a refund or another product, and nothing from them."
1.0,Children's sized. Very disappointed.
1.0,took almost 2 months to receive cheap chinese junk! Threw them out as it was too much of a hastle to return them to CHINA. Would absolutely not recommend this company
1.0,"These Shoes.....Wrong size. Wayyyyy too big first off. Secondly, there is ink everywhere amd the SMELL that hits you soon as you open the package Confirms the dye they used. You can tell this was cheaply made like using spray paint on shoes to Fake a color! Another issue and probably the worst is that the style they send is Not At All the style you see and want from the ad page on Amazon. At all. You make matters even worse....They say you can return it but it is Overseas And You Have To Pay For Shipping!! So you'll end up paying more to send it back than these terrible fake shoes cost! BUYER BEWARE DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER YOU WILL BE AS PISSED OFF AS I AM, I PROMISE."
1.0,I don’t like this it’s to different color the headband is lighter  color then the mask
1.0,This is plastic and not very good looking at plastic. The description is totally misleading.
1.0,dont seem well made
1.0,Wore them less than 1 day and the ball pearl part came off of the stem. These are so cheaply made. Do not order.
1.0,Top runs very small
1.0,CHEAPEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN
1.0,It doesn't look anything like the picture. It looks like a toddler painted it! Looks awful! I can't wear it nor would I give it away. It's going right in the trash! It's not worth sending back. You DEFINITELY get what you pay for.
1.0,I absolutely love the print on this blouse. I hope to wear it poolside.But it was made in China it's too small and I need to return it.
1.0,Disappointed I received the wrong color.
1.0,Waste of money other brands that cost less  do the same.
1.0,These earrings broke 1st wear...very unsatisfied...wish I had another pair that lasted longer than one day...
1.0,Very small all the way around
1.0,"I had these boots for 1 month and I only used them for casual purposes, and they tore already , I’m disappointed ☹️"
1.0,Ordered wrong size by mistake. Returned.
1.0,"This shirt was nice quality and cute, however it comes with a typo!!! Having to send it back. Instead of the shirt saying ‘Fir’ as it’s pictured it says ‘Fin’. No thanks!!! This shirt is obviously a second and should not be sold."
1.0,They're paper thin and hardly do anything. My shoes have never smelled so bad. I'll be throwing them out.
1.0,"Does not fit contour of my head with braids.<br />Wanted to return them, seller decided to refund me the money. I am not able to use them. They are pretty."
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Dress is silver not gold and very cheap looking. It was very inexpensive but I was really just looking for the coloring to be the same or similar for a one time wear in pictures only. I knew I was taking a risk so that's why I'm submitting a review for others.
1.0,Very cheap material. Won’t buy from this company again.
1.0,"Cheep material, nothing like it appears on the website 😩"
1.0,Returned as this was listed as cotton when its 95% polyester.  Also the blue is more royal blue than navy.  Disappointing.
1.0,I never received my order! Can't get my money back.
1.0,"Doesn't look like picture, returned..."
1.0,I bought this at the end of February. Didn't use it until the first week of April. It is April 22nd now and I just noticed the handle is coming off. 3 weeks worth of use isn't worth $20
1.0,"My 8-year-old was really disappointed with this costume.  The cool accents that he really liked (like the red shoulder pad that sticks out) were not present on our costume.  Included instead was a flimsy black fabric shoulder pad.  The mask is the picture is deceptively ""full""; in reality, it is is a simple plastic half-mask that doesn't look nearly as good in person as it does in the picture.  We'll be returning this one."
1.0,The earrings arrived damaged.  The post was broken from one of the earrings.  Not Cool!
1.0,Necklace was broken very cheap!
1.0,"I ended up returning this as the fabric was cheap and shiny! Looked awful, and fit was not flattering if you're on the petite side. I'm 5'2"", 125."
1.0,broke in 2 weeks
1.0,"Cheap, not sure what kind of metal this is and I WOULD NOT let my daughter stick this in her ears.  I would not recommend this."
1.0,One of the ears was unglued. Came that way.  I had to glue it so my daughter could wear it for event.  Not worth what we paid for sure.
1.0,"I ordered the pink and white and they were both completely see through. I did not get what these other women recieved. The outfit was scratchy, cheaply made, and as I mentioned before see through. If it was better quality I would have loved it! However, even though it looked banging you could see all of my bits."
1.0,Painful after 20-30 minutes :/
1.0,I need to let people know that this dress is the meaning of HIDEOUS. I feel scammed but also it’s so ugly I even find it hilarious. Nevertheless 30$ went completely to waste. I bought it to use it for Christmas but this can only be used as a witch costume for Halloween. I want my money back
1.0,It was so tiny it was obviously made for a 10 year old child. I am a grown women with a size 10 shoe and this ring is so tiny it pinches my toe  (any toe) that I tried to wear it on!
1.0,Too Short.  I am only 5'6&#34; tall. very disappointed because it was very pretty.
1.0,"I read all of the reviews. Everyone said the same thing: &#34;So hard to clasp; breaks easily. Horrible, terrible, bad, other synonyms!!&#34;<br /><br />I thought to myself, &#34;Sure, hard to clasp... for simpletons! But, oh, I'm skillful. This will be a cakewalk.&#34;<br /><br />I ordered the earrings. I waited patiently for 2 days (Amazon prime, baby).<br /><br />Today. they arrived. While eating some chips and guac, I sat in front of my mirror and got to work. 5 minutes passed. Then 10. Then 20.<br /><br />I enlisted the help of my sister. Pretty sure she bent the rings out of shape further. My ear got really mad at me because I only put that piercing in 5 months ago and it's just a baby!<br /><br />So, in the end, I have wasted a bit of money.  The earrings are cheaply made and virtually impossible to put in.  Also, once they're in, I can't imagine taking them out!!<br /><br />Don't be like me. Save your moolah."
1.0,Turn neck green  and the chain broke after a few days.
1.0,"When I first got them in the mail they were packaged nicely and I absolutely loved the variety in the chokers. The colors and designs were pretty for all of the chokers; HOWEVER, they broke immediately as soon as I tried to put them on. They are cheaply made and will break off at the slightest attempt try and put them on. The hooks are too short. Will break before or after one use. And the rest of them won't even fit around my neck."
1.0,Half of the lights were broken
1.0,"Horrible quality, ships in a bag which obviously means the chain comes tangled. Ridiculously priced. Should've ordered something off wish for $1 to have received this quality ."
1.0,"This is a blatant rip off of RipNDip's mascot, Lord Nermal.  Don't buy this; it's stolen art."
1.0,It’s not working!!!!!
1.0,Not Flattering.
1.0,"Not as expected. This dress hung on me like a sack. There was literally no indentation for my waist at all. I'm 5'3&#34;, 110 lbs, very hour-glassy. I typically wear a size 4 in dresses but decided on ordering up to the medium because this is in Asian sizes. The size itself fit very well except that the fabric was so heavy it just pulled straight down and I had no waist. Not at all a fitted dress as pictured."
1.0,Material is weak and rips easily. Product should come in different sizes as well.
1.0,Disappointed. ...junky looking.  Snap doesn't work well.  Very hard to get cards out of the slots.
1.0,Im a xxl naturally and this did not fit at all. It was like a size large. I will not get again.
1.0,The band is uncomfortably stiff.
1.0,"Totally tarnished when I received it and the stones are all crooked. I am not one to return items, if I were this would go back. Too embarrassed to give this as a gift as I intended to."
1.0,"Cheap made, broke in a week."
1.0,"Smelled like chemicals, very strong"
1.0,The dress looks nothing at all like the picture. I don't suggest purchasing this.
1.0,"Weird fit, binding and unplesant. I have no idea how the model in the pictures is managing to make it look like a garment, because it certainly didn't work that way on me. Might work for the tall and slender type who would look awesome in a paper bag, but not for the compact and curvy folks like me. The material felt nice though."
1.0,"I SO wanted to like these earrings, since I wanted a special, “keepsake” present for my beautiful blue-eyed daughter’s 50th birthday. But they were a huge disappointment: the sapphires were nearly black chunks and I would not have given them to anyone, much less, for such a special birthday. They were prompt in crediting my account and made them easy to return. For that, I’m grateful."
1.0,If you have breast.. don't order this!!!!  I have a size C and this never even came close to fitting a real size for the USA!!!<br /><br />If you have NO BREAST.. this is for you!  If you have absolutely NO hips and your're 11 years old.. this will fit!<br /><br />So for USA persons.. THIS IS NOTHING CLOSE to your size!
1.0,Way to big for smaller heads. Work in nursing and this was huge on me.
1.0,I thought this had a Bluetooth availability. It’s just a beanie
1.0,Velcro isn't holding...keeps busting loose while wearing it...it fits well  it doesnt hold..is it.possible to get a replacement???
1.0,Did not fit as sized
1.0,The three that was worn this week cam apart!<br />VERY POOR QUALITY!<br />And I bout two sets of five... very dissatisfied
1.0,I did not realize until after I received the shirt that it is made of polyester. Fits nothing like the picture shows.
1.0,"I received my package and I was so excited to open it only to be disappointed very quickly. The entire outfit reeked of a strong mildew smell like it had gotten wet and sat in a closed tight space. I have a hourglass figure so I assumed I would be safe ordering a large instead of a medium for a great fit,  boy was I very wrong.  I was sent a size xsmall in the bra when I ordered a large in the entire outfit. I was so excited to wear this because it is very beautiful but unfortunately it’s back to the drawing board."
1.0,Check color before describe it black its but grey
1.0,pequeno
1.0,Cheaply made.  Got one broken. They sent another and that chain broke too.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Horrible! It’s so ugly! Looks nothing like the picture! There is no form to the dress! I am absolutely returning this. Do not purchase this. It’s a waste of money. I don’t write reviews ever but this, I had to. Please save yourself the money and buy somewhere else"
1.0,Placed it on my backpack like all the other pins I go— Aaaaaaaand it broke...easily at that. Cool pin but cheap material much?
1.0,Very poor quality material....
1.0,Cheap shirts that don't last got these for my son and first day he wears one was the same day I had to throw it away falls apart easy.
1.0,"I have purchased a few pieces from Netaya and have ""tolerated"" the merely so-so quality...until now. If there'd been a rating of NO stars, that would be the one I'd have choosen.<br /><br />This bracelet's online photo and description is deceiving. It is a hollow piece with no safety latch -- depending, instead, on just a spring-loaded hinge to hold the bracelet on your wrist, although the loss of it would be no hardship!<br /><br />It looks, feels and has the weight of plastic and I have re-gifted it to my cousin's ten-year-old daughter.<br /><br />By the way? NEVER purchase from this merchant outside the protection of Amazon's shopping cart. This is a pricey lesson I've learned the FIRST time and I will NOT be using this merchant again, nor can I, in all conscience, recommend them."
1.0,The top runs extremely small.  Teeny Tiny and I ordered an XL (I am a DD)
1.0,The optics are not very good... the colors and clarity are warped and sub par.
1.0,"False advertisement. Not pleased. The product claims to be 20 gauge, but it's simply not. I'd say it's closer to an 18 but I'm clueless. Also, upon having to wear it to a job I tried to make it work but my nose simply could not adjust to whatever this material is. That being said, the product isn't even clear, but cloudy. It appears to look like a pimple almost. Also the L hook has a rigid unfinished end that does not look safe enough to be used in this manner. Now I usually don't give reviews like this because I feel that most products fairly state accurately what they are before I purchase, but this did not do that. Not pleasedz There's certainly better options out there people."
1.0,I wish they would my room in the jeans for some womanly curves
1.0,"Cheap, cheap dress. Weird seams (shown in picture). It’s not the beautiful satin dress shown in the picture. It might be okay in a different color, but it’s horrendous in white."
1.0,The front is basically a pixelated print. looks extremely cheap. I would be OK with this for $5 but absolutely not for $20.
1.0,too big for my daughters head
1.0,Very cheaply made. Looks worn out of package. Way overpriced
1.0,These SUCK...do not buy them!  The chain slips right off the glasses...NO GOOD!
1.0,HORRIBLE not even close to the advertisement. Avoid!
1.0,This skirt is paper thin. It feels cheap because it is cheap. You really can't disguise that.
1.0,I received this necklace but it has the words I LOVE MOM ... grrrrrr I'm so mad it wasn't suppose to have any engraving..<br />Now what am I suppose to do with this ?? Very upset
1.0,Horrible. Lenses scratch so easily. Very disappointed.
1.0,sent bak
1.0,Made horrible
1.0,These are NOT as described or are the product in the picture. Do not order these if you want quality.
1.0,This dress is not red it look orange I was not happy about this purchase
1.0,"This product said it would not tarnish, that it was stainless steel, it's a lie. These are not steel, they are plated nickle, which I am allergic to. The only Steel part is the tunnel itself, but even with that being the part that is steel the plated metal fell off and caused an allergic reaction with my skin. I cleaned them every other day. Eventually they just fell apart and the rose gold color flaked off. Do not buy these if you are allergic to metals."
1.0,I've only had it for 2 weeks and it stopped working! Needless to say I'm upset!
1.0,DO NOT BUY. This is just a large t shirt with the arms cut off. Material is cheap and it’s super ugly.
1.0,"I liked the appearance a lot, but the elastics broke within three days of wearing it.  Very poor quality. If you decide to purchase this, don't plan on actually wearing it."
1.0,Its youth size not adults
1.0,It came apart after three days when I put it on my desk magnetic stand.
1.0,It’s pretty cheap. I barely got it today and was excited to try it out today at the gym. I put it on and my watch went flying across the room. The band keeps coming off. Like it’s super loose and not secure. I put it back together and same thing kept happening. I even tried using that extra little silver stick that came in the box. Maybe that was loose but the same thing happened. And it seems like the box was incomplete because its missing one screw driver and the tiny screws were all over the box I was missing one. Not sure if I dropped it while I opened it since they are so small. But is definitely not worth buying on my opinion
1.0,Cheaply made and with such a price you should expect a black bag looking jacket. Didn't look like anything in the picture.
1.0,"As described, the material is thin but the overall quality is poor. I purchased two pairs but they labelled differently. The elastane band around hips is almost non-exist so that they keep riding up my butt. They look nice but uncomfortable to wear; I tossed them. I didn't want to go through the hassle returning them since the order is shipped from China."
1.0,Got the band in and went to put it on my wife’s watch but it doesn’t fit. It’s slightly bigger but the packaging said the correct size for her watch.
1.0,It’s no wider than an ace bandage and there’s no way that would work for anybody that’s not super thin. And why would they need it?
1.0,It broke as soon as I opened the package. I wasn't expecting much for the price but this was basically plastic.
1.0,Broke after a week of wear
1.0,"Very disappointed in this product.  My grandson wears a 5T in all other clothes, these pajames wouldn't go over his head.  He cannot wear them, I wasted almost $30 on this order.  Very upset and disappointed."
1.0,Cute shoe but horrible wear . My feet hurt so bad after wearing these for 8 hours.. the buckle rubs and will leave a sore area on foot.  Wouldn't even wear as a house slipper .
1.0,Broke within 2 days. Terrible.
1.0,Poor quality. Not waterproof. Returning.
1.0,It gave me a 45 in. lace when it said 39 in. lace. I was very disappointed!
1.0,This is child-sized. Ridiculously short and small in the bust
1.0,It broke the moment my daughter put it on...the cat part was cute neckless was not so sturdy I kept fixing it and it kept breaking
1.0,It’s to see through
1.0,The most Terrible product ever seen with extra long shipping time
1.0,nothing special  nice picture but I WOULD NOT WEAR IT
1.0,But a pair of flip flops instead. These do not stay on your feet at all. Total waste of money they are not practical at all.
1.0,This shirt looks nice but the material is not the best. It has more of the jogging pant feel to it and it is quite uncomfortable. I would not recommend this.
1.0,Loved the fabric and look.  Zipper broke second time I wore it.  It was past the time that I could return.  Now I have to pay more and have a new zipper put in.  Should have just paid more money for a good golf name brand!
1.0,Order two of the same dress by accident. Both of the dresses came with several holes. The bags that contained each dress was also ripped. The outside Amazon packaging was fine.
1.0,Didn't like it at all. The material very thin & filmsy.  Pretty in ad picture - a rag in reality. Not worth 25 cents.
1.0,they are very loose. Poor quality
1.0,I ordered the recommended size L that I wear. My daughter who’s an xs said they were tight on her. They are short and low quality coming from China. I do not like this and I was very disappointed bc they looked cute on the site.
1.0,Nothing like the image and the sizing is way off! Really disappointed.
1.0,"I was VERY disappointed that the masks I received are not as shown in the photos.  They have a BRIGHT WHITE border (see photo) and, for that reason, look like every other cheap mask out there.  I would never have ordered them had I known the border was white and not purple.  Very misleading advertising."
1.0,Product was broken and scratched on both sides as if they had been srcubbed on concrete.
1.0,Fell apart after having it a week :(
1.0,Sad
1.0,"The OHIO part was way too large, reminded me of a kids play necklace. I was very disappointed. :("
1.0,Was sooooo small! And arrived out of the package broken!
1.0,Just got my package and the lens is broken from the frame of the sun glasses
1.0,dont like the way it fits
1.0,If you have straight armed glasses don't waste your money.  I ordered these for my son's Oakley Flak 2.0 and the strap would not stay on. I tried tightening the loops and nothing would keep the straps on. Yes they were cheap to buy but a complete waste and had to buy something different.
1.0,Order xl so it can be a little  loose. Still to small
1.0,Only worn during the school day for 3 weeks. They are completely destroyed. Very poorly made and a complete waste of money
1.0,This says its an adult mask....nope. Itsa child's mask. I'm not a child....
1.0,Not a very well made product and feels very cheap.... Did not fit as I expected it to. It run a little small
1.0,XXL IS MORE LIKE XS
1.0,"these are so thin, junk was expecting thicker material not see through"
1.0,The material is super cheap and the fit looks like an old fashioned flour sack. It is not really even comfortable enough to wear as a night gown.
1.0,"Way, way WAY too small. These were advertised as XL. XL kindergarten students maybe but an adult male? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA no way. I think these might fit a ladies size 5 or smaller but a guy with size 11 feet not even close. Junk. One tore out when I tried to put it on. Ripped the top right off it. I would never buy these again. I threw them away. Returning was too much of a PITA. Be warned - if you don't have very small feet and legs these will not fit."
1.0,Returned it the next day... Way too small!
1.0,Material way to thing on top
1.0,Thew it away.  Cheap and not as depicted.
1.0,not what i through to wrinkle
1.0,Extremely cheap. Ripped after 4 trainings...
1.0,This is an okay purchase. The earrings look really cheap
1.0,"They are cute, I ordered the 18s, which I've always gotten from multiple piercing shops with no problems. These 18g are actually 16g so I have to return them."
1.0,"This was a terrible purchase, over half of the lights were either cracked or did not light."
1.0,Cute but FELL APART ON THE FIRST WEARING!!! It was so embarrassing!!!
1.0,The item looks nothing like the picture that the person it selling. I was so upset when I got the item I paid for.
1.0,The waist band is super thick and binding while the fabric is sooo thin. Very unattractive on my stomach. Not cut and comfy as portrayed. The print looks cheap and as it is just surfaced dyed. I do not think these would last long if I could even wear them. These were a complete waste of money.
1.0,"The strap on this bag snapped off, less than a month after I got it, and it could not be fixed. Maybe there was<br />some defect in this particular bag but I suspect it's just a shoddy product."
1.0,"These will not properly stay on my ear, so I am unable to wear them."
1.0,looks pink in picture--10Cents is right price
1.0,Don’t buy! Didn’t last a day!!!!
1.0,"See thru, super short, too tight!"
1.0,"This dress was very thin material, but the really bad part about it is that The slits on the side came up to almost mid-butt  while the front and back drooped all the way down to about 3&#34; above knee.  If you can imagine that, it's a very awkward cut and slit.  It almost makes the front and back look like Long bibs hanging down ...  not a good look.  For the record, I'm 5'8&#34;  and bought a medium."
1.0,"CHEAP  I was sent 2 of the same color, one different"
1.0,Didn’t work for me but might b ok for others
1.0,The plastic hinge broken on the first day. The only reason the other hinge did not break is the screws came lose. Very cheap plastic. I'm immediately returning these.
1.0,"I ordered 3 of these pair of shorts a year ago, loved them. This time different horrible material and a little girls size. Very dissapointed."
1.0,"I am 33 weeks pregnant and bought this based on other reviews of pregnant ladies. But this dress is highly disappointing. The colors are much darker than pictured—I thought the flowers would be pink and light pink but they’re dark coral/almost orange. The fabric is similar to bathing suit material that makes it stretchy (which is nice) but that makes it shiny. Also, the dress I received goes straight down instead of being flowy like pictured and like other reviews. As a waddling pregnant person, that makes it annoying and difficult to walk in. It’s not what I expected, and it will be returned."
1.0,Was delivered with missing earrings.
1.0,Ripped the very first time she wore it along the seam. Waste of money.
1.0,Ordered a bunch of other stuff and the only only thing I didn't get was this. It's been months. Not worth it.
1.0,"Horrible make ! Not tule, not tutu material.  Literally feels like paper. Its not full all around. Its a bunch of strips of materials just hanging there.  The headband not only does it not match but its small. Probably fits my poodles head not a 4-6 year old. The only good thing fast shipping,  but im sending it back."
1.0,"I am extremely disappointed in this shirt. I did not read the label (my fault) and threw it in the washer and dryer to get it clean before I wore it to the gym. It is hand wash and dry flat. I don't know if your like me, but I don't want to have to put a lot of effort into washing my gym clothes. When I pulled it out of the dryer it had turned into a midriff top! I won't be wearing these anywhere, ever! The fabric is so thin and has no substance to it. Wish I could return it!"
1.0,"Super thin, at least 3 sizes too small. Would not recommend."
1.0,"This is not worth the money. It takes far to long to arrive (mine arrived nearly 15 days after the return window ended). It’s cheaply made, extra HUGE & overall, a disappointment. I’m bummed because the photos made it look great!"
1.0,"If I could give zero stars, I would. Do not buy!!!!!!!!! Extremely poorly made, material discolored and lines very uneven. Clearly just scam type of item."
1.0,Money wasted
1.0,Ill fitting and cheap. Top served it’s purpose for genie costume
1.0,Knock off . Can’t even spell exterminate right ! It was a waste of money and had a smell to it upon arrival . Wore once and was very disappointed.
1.0,"I ordered a small which is supposed to be a size 4/6 but when it arrived I thought it was a child's swimsuit. It might fit a size 0 or 1. Good grief! I did t bother trying it on because it was so obviously too small. For reference I am 5'3"" and 125 lbs."
1.0,UUUUGly
1.0,LOL I seriously felt like I looked like a sumo wrestler in these underwear!
1.0,Arrive damaged and poor quality.
1.0,I ordered this shirt in white and I’m very disappointed because it is very transparent. The fit is also a bit larger than I expected. Overall the quality is subpar.
1.0,The sizes aren't consistent. Quality is lacking but ok for the price.  I'm returning due to sizing.
1.0,"This is so uncomfortable. The straps inside the cups, meant to keep the bra up while using the cups open, are so close to the center they are almost covering my nipples. It also rides up and I’ve gotten clogged ducts only when wearing this. I wanted more coverage than the stretchy type but this is terrible."
1.0,It broke immediately :-(
1.0,"Really bled when washed on cold.  A tight fit around the bust, too."
1.0,Velcro strap came off and shoe was really snug
1.0,"So very disappointed with these shoes! They have great reviews and still...after my daughter had them on for a few hours, they look like this! Yes, they look nice and my daughter loved them, but the quality.... I have to see if they will exchange them..."
1.0,It was bent. It camecan without protective packaging except a thin plastic sleeve. Also the length advertised included the handle straight. When folded to roll the shade the reach is shorter than advertised. How can I send it back without packaging?
1.0,Me enviaron un pantalón muy grande y la blusa pequeña
1.0,I ordered grey for my son and the white heatgering in the product photo is silver. Recommend for girls.
1.0,"At first sight, this bracelet looks really nice, is p however it is poorly manufactured. It broke as soon as I tried to put it on my wrist. I sent 5 minutes chasing beads around my family room"
1.0,Looks nothing like what I ordered.so Not only did I received the wrong item but it completely does not fit and is poorly Made.
1.0,This was a very cheap product it was written water resistant but look at the photo
1.0,Picture was gorgeous when it arrived but VERY quickly faded and started to peel off the shirt.
1.0,"Couple of them came undone after one wash, cheaply made. To point of even keeping it."
1.0,"I can't believe they want $30 for this piece of garbage.<br />I could get a better looking, better fitting bustier by dumpster diving behind a 1970's Frederick's of Hollywood store.<br />This thing is HORRIBLE.<br />I guessed my size because their sizing chart makes no sense.<br />No cup size = flat chest<br />Straps are waaayyyyy back under your armpits, not where they're shown on the model.<br />It has the ugliest cut to the front bodice portion.<br />All the ""lace"" is garbage seconds.<br />NO ONE will look good in this.<br />Just run."
1.0,"Material was grossly cheap and tacky.<br />Please, IF YOU WANT BETTER QUALITY ORDER from  Valuefashion  they are top notch!"
1.0,"With no give to the material, even though I am small (wear size 2-3 pants, size 2-4 or S-M dresses) I bought a medium that I cannot zip up! and IF I were to go a size up, the bands around my waist would be way too big! Only buy if you are:<br />1. Small<br />2. Not muscular or have broader shoulders"
1.0,They were big for my face so gave them to my mother she liked them.
1.0,"Ordered a size larger than I wear, because I wanted to use it as a sleep shirt. So the 3x fit like an xl.!! VERY DISPOINTING!!!!!!"
1.0,Very hard to put laces into shoes and broke during first use.
1.0,"The top of this dress was very oddly shaped and boxy. I couldn't even differentiate between the front and back of the dress. I loved the embroidery, and if it hadn't been so expensive I would have kept the dress and worn it with a sweater on top as a skirt."
1.0,Plan on getting naked to pee.
1.0,"Very unattractive sweater; no shape, hangs uneven, lousy color.  Do not order this, you will be disappointed.  Like a big potato sack."
1.0,I’m tall so I bought an XXL size after looking at the size chart. But the sleeves didn’t even reach my elbows nor did the hem come near my waist.<br /><br />Don’t buy this if you’re taller than 5’10
1.0,Glasses lens scratched when arrived
1.0,worst quality. it was itchy. no stretch what so ever. the turtleneck was just silly.
1.0,Do not buy these. Terrible quality. They are very dull colors and I attached pictures comparing them to the beautiful bright colored ones I have received in the past. You can see in the pictures how cloudy and dull the resin is. The orange looks more like a dull amber.i was supposed to recieve 126 and I only got 111 so it's also a ripp off. I would suggest going with a different seller.
1.0,This is not real silver. I’ve had it for two days and my finger is turning ring. It has 925 stamped into it which seems to be false. It’s a beautiful ring just fake.
1.0,It did not prevent fogging of glasses lens when out in the cold weather with a mask on.
1.0,Break too easy
1.0,They feel awkwardly shaped and a bit loose on my face. I can’t get myself to wear them. I like my prescription computer glasses much better.
1.0,There was no baby doll with it
1.0,Not as represented
1.0,was pretty dry didn't clean as good as the cloths I buy at Pandora for my bracelets. Not the best choice and not cheap either.
1.0,"I opened the package and put on the necklace at 5pm.  By 6pm, the chain was already detached from the pendant thru normal wear.  It's a pretty necklace, but I wouldn't spend the money if I had it to do over.  Now it's going to sit in a drawer until I have time to take it somewhere to get fixed."
1.0,It's made so it looks goody unless you fold it over. I bought these scarfs because I have a cute cotton one that is nice to tie on real quick for my virtual meetd. It does not stay on. I've tied this scarf every which way possible and within minutes its sliding off. I'm not moving around a lot or anything. I am sending them back asap.
1.0,"Glasses are very dark, not as appeared in advertising.  I need to return.  Impossible to use."
1.0,The display bothers my eyes and is hard to read. It's like a Light Brite toy but with all super bright white lights.
1.0,The jewls are pretty! But the bioplast was to short for my Monroe piercing...I wouldn't never have bought if I had known they was super short! But I was informed by previous customers that they was super long! 👎 #fail
1.0,Bracelet just arrived. The skull is damaged/scratched badly.  Very disappointed.
1.0,These were not what was stated the size was not what was stated not even close to size stated . Definitely disappointed and would ever buy again from them nor would I ever recommend.  Very disappointed
1.0,"I ordered many of these beautiful looking cuffs just to find out that they are both facing the same way, which means that you cannot put them on the left ear!!!"
1.0,Doesn't fit a Samsung gear s3. The pins do not reach and the band doesn't match up.<br />Seller not very helpful.
1.0,"Don't be fooled, this is just a cheap piece of material folded over and sown together.  The edged aren't hemmed nor is the material anything of quality.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,"The armholes and neckline were poor finished, look stretched out. The fabric was not what I expected."
1.0,"Will not keep time, returning for a refund/credit"
1.0,I was so excited when I first put these in. They looked so cute but I quickly noticed the clasp opening. This happened a few times with me catching it before it came out but my luck ran out and now I don't have my jewelery and I can't get my money back.
1.0,We bought these so that my wife and daughter could have matching earrings at Disney World. The picture shows a nice shine but what we received were earrings that had no shine to them at all.<br /><br />Unfortunately these earrings missed the mark.
1.0,"I’m really upset with these. They seemed to be good quality but after a month I’m still dealing with color bleeding.<br />I bought three straps and all I have is issues with these. I collect watches and buy various different straps to mix and match with different watches but these have been horrible. I’ve gone through so many spring bars, it’s not even amusing. The straps themselves claim to be 200mm but I have fairly small wrists (185mm) and the damn straps don’t fit well at all. They go on the last hole and barely close. I bend the spring bars trying to force the strap closed almost every time, because the holes were not cut/punched large enough. I figured they would soften up over time but that’s just not happening. 3 straps are all money down the drain at this point."
1.0,"Very flimsy, smelled funny, had sharp splinters and leaves little pieces all over. Could not use"
1.0,Not even dollar store worthy.  Very very thin. cheaply made.
1.0,"Not worth the $23.99 I paid for it, let alone a 3 figured list price!  Poorly made, lining is cheap and almost feels like it is plastic.<br /><br />This should not be described as a tote.  Even though the dimensions are clearly stated.the bag is very small and will not hold much at all"
1.0,Horrible material. Bought this for a wedding. Day of wedding came took items out of packaging and bow tie fell apart.
1.0,I actually gave them as a gift and just recently was told they were two left feet
1.0,"When I went to remove an earring from the card it was packaged on, the ball came off the post. Very poor quality. Sending them back."
1.0,Not at all what is shown. Two holes for eyes...one for mouth. Then not as long to cover neck. The product I received looks to be nice and is good quality but just totally different.
1.0,This is my first time wearing the shirt. It’s super comfortable but THERE IS A TYPO!!!! The L is missing in the word should!!! I’m so upset.
1.0,arrive with out pants as expected.  I need to replacement or credit so I may replacement
1.0,Muy frágiles se rompieron
1.0,"Sorry but i didn't like this shirt. it Looks very chip and poor Material, feels like a Pajamas. not recomended"
1.0,A nice looking dress but not what I expected. I bought this dress for work thinking it was a nice structured dress. I was really disappointed to see the quality of the material ans no structure.<br />Disappointed.
1.0,Does not look like photo at all.  Very cheap and yellow glass.  Not even fake crystals.  Do not waste your money.  Had no idea this was shipping directly from China.  Misrepresented completely.
1.0,Took forever to ship and the color is not right and small pieces like chips
1.0,I really wanted to like this hat because I know my husband would like it ... but I can’t say I do. The logo is off center (as shown in the picture) which I can live with. But this one came in with the sew-in logo loose and several loose threads and the logo is only partially complete. Waste of money unfortunately.
1.0,Cheap af..you get what tou pay for
1.0,I got this for my mom. She's allergic to whatever chemical is on the mask and it made her face itch really bad!
1.0,"I like the design, but could not wear. The strings on the back were to short for my calf."
1.0,The size was not true.
1.0,This sweatshirt arrived marked as size Medium (USA) but it is clearly an XS size AND the sleeves were 3/4 length. I assume that for all of the sweatshirts being made poorly. The material and the quality overall is very poor.
1.0,It was just the leather band . I thought i could just snap fit bit in. but it was just the band
1.0,This is not modal at all. Rough material. Small too. Returning.
1.0,"I ordered 3x cuz that's my size.  They are body sucking every fat flab showing sheer nightmare.  If you are fit, I'm sure they would be great - no for the heavy."
1.0,I know its only a $20 pair of boots BUT they came shipped in a plastic bag. The boots were smashed up and wrinkled like some stacked bowling balls on top of them. I tried them on to see if they would straighten out but NOPE still wrinkled and smashed in at the toe and ankle. Was going to be a boot to wear to work but no even in the space to do that. Material looks shiny and plastic....sorry just a cheap boot and poor packaging. See pics
1.0,Recommended to entertain those with Alzheimer’s (busy fingers). There’s nothing to this when you see it.
1.0,Runs way too small + it shrunk so essentially useless and waste of money . Doubt this is real Nike too because the swoosh is not as pictured....
1.0,"Due to the small gauge size (6g) these were impossible to get inserted to my piercings. Just going to stick to harder materials from now on. If your size is as small as mine, don't bother."
1.0,"I did not like the fact that they are all cotton--""cotton kills"" if you get them wet. They are advertised as waterproof but when you open the package the first thing that you notice is that they are cotton.<br />I returned them."
1.0,The shoes came damaged
1.0,"The lining was fully exposed on one side of the breast cup. Otherwise, so adorable."
1.0,Baja calidad. Se rompieron a la 1ra lavada.
1.0,I don’t usually leave reviews but this is a crap hat. I straightened out the bill before taking the pics. The band around the hat is crooked as well. This hat is maybe worth half the price paid.
1.0,"Cheap, thread already falling apart before wearing."
1.0,Very disappointed. Ordered 2x and it’s not a 2x. Maybe a large at best.
1.0,Too small for passport
1.0,"I sadly tossed this hat out immediately. It was very hard (no bend at all) and, the material of the hat made it hard for the hat to stay on my head. It kept sliding up. Very disappointed."
1.0,cute earrings but that's where it ended for me...itch itch goodbye
1.0,Little kid's sizes. Tiny. Ridiculous
1.0,"I bought this sandals based on the good reviews not minding the complaints on the buckle, I just thought it couldn't be that hard to buckle up a pair of sandals, well I was so wrong, first of all the buckle on this sandals could not even allow a good fit around my ankle without it popping out, and I have a smaller ankle, I waited almost two weeks to receive this pair of sandals only to discover the terrible design on this sandals, I'm so pissed that I purchased this, total waste of my time. Definitely going back to seller!"
1.0,This jacket is made for normal size people with kids arms. Ridiculous!
1.0,I have contacted the seller waiting on a reply. It is missing a strap so it really it’s wearable at this time. :(
1.0,Compass doesn't work at all. This would get me lost or dead in the wild...
1.0,"Black lines up the inside of the legs converge on the crotch in a big black triangle that is VERY visible from the front, even on my too-skinny form. Great pants if you want everyone's eyes drawn to your crotch, unwearable if that's not your objective."
1.0,"For the price, these are awful. They are NOT silver as stated in the description. With in a week...these lost all the shine and revealed a reddish tarnished coppery look to them. The ""silver"" disappeared. The price is way too expensive for the beads. Very disappointed with the product."
1.0,I looked forward to receiving these but was very disappointed. The back has a slight protrusion which causes it to not sit flat against the ear or penetrate the opening.  This has caused an infection in my ears before so I will not ever be wearing them. The roses are open metal and very poor quality.
1.0,Received today and straps were ripped.
1.0,This is ridiculous. Any one can see that this is clearly not Elvis! I will not be ordering.
1.0,"Not happy with the purchase, the material was cheap and it was very wrinkled."
1.0,Need major massive biceps for this to fit
1.0,Items stretched to loose slips down even when folded of set in different fashions horrible item. Hard to breath material.
1.0,This outfit is so small my toddler could probably fit. Don’t waste your money. I’m 5’6 and 120 and it’s absolutely tiny. The suspenders and skirt come up to my belly button...& I’m a 32c and the top doesn’t cover 1/3 of my boobs.
1.0,These really easily ride up my leg when exercising. I went to pull them down and the leg just ripped in half. First time wearing them!
1.0,"In theory, the style of this tank top was appealing, for my workouts. I like that is has a scoop neck in the front and back, but that was the only thing I liked. To me the following issues were a problem.  The fabric feels very cheap and as such flairs away from the body at the hem. I bought two and sent both back."
1.0,Ordered a 8-10 M and gave it to my size 2 friend....super small!!! It is cute though.
1.0,Too cute dress. I ordered a size larger than I wear.  2x was like a size medium. Not happy
1.0,Product is already in the garbage. One clip on each strap isn't tight enough to stay in place even without tention. Complete waste of money. I'd give 0 stars if it was an option.
1.0,Wow! Never received a product so used and stretched out like this one
1.0,"This will be returned immediately. The clergy stole was not as advertised. The product did not even come close to meeting expectations. Typically, stoles have embroidery. It appears to have silkscreen. Extremely disappointed and I will most likely never purchase anything from church supply again."
1.0,These took forever to get to me. A lot of people said they were too long. Not at all. But the waist is way too big. Buttons are cheap and it’s cheap material.
1.0,Horrible picture is so deceiving I got a medium and I'm 5'7&#34; and it's so big in the top and super short and the print is so off feels like the material is made out of a cheap swimsuit
1.0,I love how they fit they are comfy. And soft. But after a few washes they start to unravel.  Now all the seams are coming apart. So it went from 5 stars to a 1 star.
1.0,Los aretes son demaciado pesados para el broche que traen mejor debería poner un gancho inclinado. Para que puedan quedarse en su lugar. No los puedo usar se caen fácilmente. Sería mejor gancho curveado.
1.0,"bought these for my son who is 10. got the large size 12-14 expecting them to be big, they were tiny! Same size as the Hanes size 8. Very unhappy"
1.0,No dir
1.0,OVERPRICED
1.0,It was out of shape and didn't fit well
1.0,Not thing it’s so tiny everything about it is tiny should b sold for 50.00
1.0,I guess maybe I didn't read well enough but this is more like a water shoe than a slip-on tennis shoe. I bought these as a gift for an an adopt-a-family project and ended up having to go and buy other actual shoes that could be functional somewhere other than a pool or beach. They don't even come in a box and the toxic chemical smell was nearly overwhelming!
1.0,"not slim.  arm holes are too baggy.  not made for untucked.  listed small was 28 inches length, it was 31."
1.0,Does NOT fit the Ace 3 as advertised. Disappointed.  Also incorrect colors sent to me. Instead of gray I got a white band.
1.0,I received a damaged returned item please be careful! No where on this belt does it say genuine leather which I thought it was required.
1.0,Cheap though
1.0,Awful quality. Very cheap and the metal is flaking already. Will be requesting refund.
1.0,Bad quality but I got what I paid for.
1.0,"Very poor quality, claims 100% cotton but its all polyester without any cotton. Bought 2 days ago, already started to rip. A complete rip off, Don't fall for the label and price."
1.0,"This is a piece of junk. Didn’t work . Made from cheap plastic . Would pay more to ship back ,not prime.DON’T BUY"
1.0,This is not a good wrap. It only goes half way up👎🏽
1.0,This was to be a gift for my niece.  It was too cheap for even a little girl.  The &#34;crystal&#34; looked plastic.  the &#34;chain&#34; was so cheap it looked like it would snap at the slightest touch. I returned it
1.0,Waste of money.. Lights work for 2 days. Then stopped.. Change batteries still no good
1.0,"This was a terrible bracelet. It had glitter of some sort on the face of it. It was stated to be sterling silver. I’m sure it was sterling, it just wasn’t very impressive.<br />I did not like that it was made very thin. When I picked it up out of the box it arrived in the glitter just fell off like dust.<br />It didn’t even arrive in a nice box, it was in a plastic bag in a cardboard box. Way over priced at $160"
1.0,Falls apart easily. Not something I wear because it's cheap.
1.0,"These are not true to size. I wear a medium (size 7), but the right glove was so tight that I couldn't even put it on."
1.0,"Wrong color not close, I would have kept black close to grey. Now I question everything about it!"
1.0,"I didn’t like the way it looked on me so I’m sending it back for a full refund! Thank you, Brenda"
1.0,it only last 2 months then it starts falling apart.
1.0,"The band appears narrower than in the advertisement. It was a men's size 10. The inscription is so so tiny you can't even tell what it is, much less read it. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Arrived with a long hole along the seam from the shoulder down the arm.  I returned it.
1.0,This did not work well at all. No matter how we tried to put it into the sand it would come right out. Not a good design at all.
1.0,"This was not the advertised product. This was not a traditional knit hat. It looks like they took a gray T-shirt, cut it up and made it in the form of a hat. Still feels like a T-shirt on your head. The logo looks ironed on. Also, they charge a lot for shipping. The cost for shipping was the same as the cost of the hat. I ordered four hats and they charged a shipping cost for each hat. Do not buy this product."
1.0,This is rose gold. NOT light gold like pictured. Can’t even wear because it doesn’t match jewelry
1.0,"I should have been smart enough to at least get this through Amazon (but I wasn't).  The Zoomie site is very deceptive, and you can easily end up getting a double order, instead of just what you wanted (it happened to me).  As you are going through the order process, they try to sell you on a ton of options, and when you finish passing through the order, instead of showing you the total (so you can confirm the order), Boom !!! Your order is final !!! (and you have no reasonable recourse).  When dealing with ""suspect"" vendors, it's best to go through Amazon for some protection (I certainly wish I had)."
1.0,Don't like this shirt
1.0,It had a bad smell to it. I refused to wear it. Stayed in the closet for a year and it still smells.
1.0,Not for plus size women
1.0,It is not super soft and has an ivory back which is kind of ugly it is not one color
1.0,No what expected is very poor quality breaks easily and is a pain to get it out of the roll.
1.0,fell apart the first time I tried to put it on- very poor quality :(
1.0,"The appear to be well made, and might be great for very small people, like pre-teen young people at best, but certainly not for any regular sized adults.  Even with the extenders included, it is impossible to get these on.  The fabric is roughly 6"" wide x 4-3/4"" tall over the nose/mouth part.  If I hook it around one ear, fully stretched as far as I can, it doesn't even reach the ear strap to my other ear.  It is short of reaching the front of my other ear by about 2"" at best.  And even if I could get them to fit, the facial covering barely covers your face from your nose to just below the lips, but certainly not enough to be under the chin.  There simply is not enough fabric.  If you are anywhere from a teenager to an adult, don't waste your money on these.  I gave them 1 star because the fabric is pretty good, but I do consider these to be a rip off.  I will see if maybe they will work for my 5 & 4 year old grandkids.  Probably too big for them now, but maybe they can grow into them.  What a joke."
1.0,Not very nice. Low quality Chinese junk.
1.0,I usually buy large. Too big.
1.0,Sizes should have been more clearly explained in the ad
1.0,"Stopped working the first night I wore it, at least it didn't cost much"
1.0,it looked cheap and was very tiny. not how it comes across in the pic.
1.0,"I was sad that the ""silver"" came off within the week of wear despite stating its 925. It was beautiful until then.<br />It will end up in the trash."
1.0,The slipper broke after several months. For the money they charged this product is poor.
1.0,"Image was too small to see.  I got rid of mine, not worth sending back.  :("
1.0,Ran short and wide.
1.0,"Terrible. I was given a kit that doesn’t even have the other half of the kit. I just have doubles of parts that aren’t needed when I need the brush, micro fiber, spray, and laces."
1.0,"Cheap, cheap quality! Had many loose threads and a lot of long one that needed trimming. The design on the shirts are cheap and can come off easy."
1.0,Pockets installed UPSIDE DOWN!!!  I couldn't return it in time because I was traveling so I guess It's mine. It's not that big a deal but if they are defective don't sell them for full price.  Disappointing.  Do they even do quality control?
1.0,This was not the dress I thought I was ordering. The style of the dress looked like the photos but the material was like spandex material not at all what I thought I was buying!
1.0,"I am so disappointed,"
1.0,Cheap lookin hat...returned.
1.0,"Earrings are pretty, however only able to wear them a short time, one of them broke away from the post while wearing"
1.0,Somewhat short lengthwise but the worst thing is that the seams at the top of the shoulders came apart in 4 places the second time I wore it so I had to get out the needle and thread.  Hopefully the rest will hold up better.
1.0,The waist band of these tights ripped as soon as my daughter put them on. She needed them for a performance and ended up wearing black leggings because we didn't have time to get anything else. Very unsatisfied!
1.0,"I wore them one day and both of the rubber ear pieces fell off. I don't normally complain, but these things broke within a few hours of wearing them."
1.0,This band looks nothing like picture.
1.0,"I was really looking forward to this watch strap, but one of the quick release springbars was too long.  One side worked great, but the other didn't.  The strap itself looks good, but useless due to the extra long springbar."
1.0,I'm typically a large but based on reviews I decided to get a XXL. It fit but still seemed small for a XXL.  I really wanted to like it but I'm unsatisfied with the quality as it looks and feels cheap so I will be returning this item.
1.0,Wore it once and the strings broke off.
1.0,"I bought two pair of these compression stockings for my father. He wouldn’t consider any other brand because commercials had him convinced that, unlike his other compression socks, he would be able to get them on and off easily.  He cannot. Such misleading advertising targeting our elderly."
1.0,"Nice material, but will not fit those with a taller booty."
1.0,Not good quality. Chain turned green before I got a chance to wear it!<br />Cute but not worth $
1.0,"Not worth the money. The arm snapped off within just two weeks. No pin, just metal so unless I use superglue, it's not fixable."
1.0,"These didn't fit the kids, and didn't fit the adults. They are also made of very thin plastic, and not what I was expecting."
1.0,doesn’t stick or together well
1.0,this could easily be turned into a dress for a woman
1.0,the bottom is huge Very cheap material
1.0,"Definitely not cotton, debatably Mordenmiss. I have five dresses from them, and the quality is always surperior. This is unwearable, itchy, thin, and ugly. Don't waste your money."
1.0,"I bought this shirt not just one size bigger, but three times bigger than I need. And it still fits like a medium to small large, no where near a 3XL. Cheap Company that does not even know what sizes mean."
1.0,Elastic band in the top was very scratchy not conducive for sleeping
1.0,Took weeks to finally arrive & the bill of the hat was 3 inches longer than any other hat I own!  It bugged me all day. Needless to say I wore it once & threw it out.
1.0,tried 3 pairs fir my wife and I for travel.  they were all bad fitting tight.  and recommend plain pattern as ‘Argyle’ had very bumpy inside stitches which made it difficult to put on snd uncomfortable to wear.  tried a pkain pair from another manf perfect!!!
1.0,The coat that was advertised was not the coat I received!
1.0,Cheap garbage material and looks nothing like pictures
1.0,The wait and then after the wait the left upper leg no patch like the others awaiting a reply and what my next step is return to have them placed patch or them send me patch and I repair.
1.0,Didn't make it three months broke in half.  Bad purchase.
1.0,I didn't expect much for the price but the &#34;goldtone&#34; turned black after one week of wear!
1.0,"If you are looking for a set of warm flannel pajamas, you will be dissapointed."
1.0,"I was so excited about getting this necklace. I wore it for less than a day when it broke when adjusting the charm. The chain is not good quality, love the charm though."
1.0,Zero stars actually. Product came completely damaged.
1.0,"Duh, a wrist watch.  some functions don""t work.  What do you expect for a $3 from China."
1.0,"awful quality, made my bellybutton green and it wore down the coloring in less than 2 days."
1.0,"I bought these masks and sent them over to my family when things began to pick up with the pandemic, and they were not able to use these without my mom altering them herself with her sewing machine to fit everyone's face. The mask on it's own, doesn't sit well on the face."
1.0,I bought these fir the summer and realized I paid too much money for a cheaply made product.  After two months of use over the summer they do not stay on.<br />I wish I could return them but it’s too late I will not purchase these ever again!
1.0,Dress it nothing like advertised! Fraud company won’t even issue return!  Changed us 115 x 2. Still no refund!
1.0,I was happy with my purchase at first but I take back my previous review- these photos shows about after 3months of use. Now mind you-my 3.5yr old barely wore this house slippers. I had to constantly remind him since it’s so cold where we live.
1.0,Okay so I bought this on my mother's account thinking that it would be a nice set of cool bracelets. I received one bracelet! They didn't mention that it was only one and made it look like it was a lot so that people could be completely ripped off. I never write reviews but this sucked so much I had to! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!! And to top it all off the bracelet fell off repeatedly and didn't click together easily which consequently led to it falling off in some class during the day and is now lost! This is a cheap piece of junk that is VERY expensive for what it's worth.
1.0,"I want to say I love this dress, but this isn't the dress I received! :c I ordered this dress, with one-day shipping, because I needed something sleek and classy to wear to a wedding. I originally planned to wear a dress I already own, but when I tried it on on Wednesday, I found out that the zipper wasn't working, so I needed to buy something QUICK and decided on this dress after reading several different reviews.<br /><br />In my package I'm pretty sure I got this dress instead: [[ASIN:B01FDCWI18 Nemidor Women's V-neckline Stretchy Casual Midi Plus Size Bridesmaid Dress]] I'll update my review with pictures to show the dress I got instead of this one.<br /><br />Now, the dress I got instead fit perfectly, and was really cute with the petticoat I purchased. I wish I could give this dress more than just a 1 star review, but I can't really review a dress I didn't receive! I'm going to contact the seller and see what we can do to have this fixed, but I don't think they can rush a dress to me by 4 PM Friday!<br /><br />I'm not entirely upset with the turnout, but I do wish I could have worn this dress instead!<br /><br />EDIT 06/24/2017: I've uploaded a photo of the dress I did receive. As you can tell, it's not the dress I ordered (the sleeves are very different, and they're flowy like the dress I linked in the review since I'm sure that's the dress I got), but it still looks cute. The fabric was soft and cottony with a good bit of stretch to it, and it looks really cute with a petticoat on under it."
1.0,Too small.  It looks much bigger in the listing. I selected it to wear on an omega collar. It is so small that it would not be seen in a collar. I have to return it.
1.0,"The gloves are cheaply produced, like worse than the stuff you get from the Chinese sellers. The rubber on the palms had seemed to leak into the inside, some of the pairs I got were the same hand. They're garbage. Don't buy them."
1.0,"The dress was way to short,  the sizing was way to small.  true it was marked xxl  but believe me it was not an XXL  I am not sure where the dress was made but it was not marked correctly !! How ever I did like the color"
1.0,"Very very cheap. Very narrow, gives me a headache in 10 minutes. Spend a little more for<br />Something better...."
1.0,Not a very good bag. Mine ripped the first few day I had it
1.0,Way too small. I even ordered a size bigger than we needed. Really difficult return process.
1.0,"The shirt that is pictured is contoured and tapered from the bust down through the waist. The shirt I received is not the same cut as pictured. It has straight line seams and is extremely unflattering. The picture also depicts the length incorrectly. The shirt pictured looks like the shirt comes to the upper thigh. It doesn’t. It cuts off right at the hips. The material is thin and you can see the bra. For the price of this shirt, you can do better."
1.0,"Lasted less than 2 months, luckily I had a bumper case on my watch otherwise my screen would have been cracked. Cheap pins, cheap leather, cheap product.<br /><br />I want a refund but seller is impossible to contact."
1.0,It fits so so small..it was not at all what I expected at all wear a 3xl and 5xl is what I ordered and it's still small!
1.0,Shiny plastic fabric gross and terrible for summer. Hard pass
1.0,"OUCH!!!! Super heavy & the gauge of the earring is so large it’s impossible to wear! They are incredibly heavy, way more than I can wear. And it took almost 2 months to receive them. Would not purchase from them again."
1.0,"Thoughtful packaging. Sunglasses arrived in a small box with a mini screwdriver tool, microfiber cloth and carrying pouch. To be honest it was a nice touch but immediately after taking sunglasses out I can instantly tell these were cheap glasses. The material feels cheap and the weight feels cheap. They're light but not in a good way if that makes sense. I can compare them to 99cents only or dollar tree and wish. I thought I was saving money but in fact I feel like I just wasted money 🤣 I do not recommend"
1.0,Very thin material and to say it runs small is an understatement. Pretty color though.
1.0,"I’m sorry I didn’t read the reviews! I fell in love with the glossy, rounded earrings displayed.<br />Highly disappointed in what I received."
1.0,China Junk that took way too long to get to us! - Save your time and money
1.0,"I'm 5""8, 150-160, and 36B.  The bust was loose and saggy, waist was wicked tight and in the wrong spot.  Dress bottom was on the tighter side, not loose and flowy.  Lastly it fell at mid shin.... not floor length.  If I wore platforms, it would would look ridiculous. Some how it managed to be to big yet to small, loose but tight, and way too short all at the same time"
1.0,"I was excited to try this out, really I was! But it's unfortunately, it's a waste of money. The magnet isnt strong enough to hold through the skin of your nose and it falls out every single time. It's such a bummer because I wanted to look cool and edgy, but this one just isn't it, kids. I'd look elsewhere."
1.0,The pin is to short for my watch
1.0,These sandals broke after 4 wears and seller wouldn't refund since past 30 days. Don't waste your money!!!
1.0,"I wanted to love this but the material was so cheap feeling, it was really awkward. I had to return it."
1.0,It's not ombre like the photo.
1.0,the product was dirty and dull
1.0,Inner lining pocket depicted on the side of the right leg when in actuality the pocket is sewn on the front of the leg.  I returned the shorts.
1.0,"This dress definitely felt like a costume dress. Cheap fabric, completely see-through, and a bit childish when on. I’m trying to find a dress for my bridal shower and a post-wedding celebration, and this just doesn’t cut it. You get what you pay for: a cheap look. Although it fit pretty well, was soft, and had some stretch, it just looks too cheap and too thin overall. But perhaps it’s just me. I’m looking for a more sophisticated and elegant dress. Don’t waste your time if that’s also what you want."
1.0,the description stated that the cap had a real tail but artificial cap.  the item sent was absolutely ridiculous.  for the money I coked I just threw it the trash and never looked back. but certainly wish I had never purchased. it was stupid
1.0,Do not buy!!! Not comfortable!!! Flattens face/nose/mouth!!!
1.0,"the ring was smashed , i would like it if i could wear it , it is too damaged ,,"
1.0,"Bottoms were great. Nice coverage and very comfortable. Beautiful colors and fabric. The top was very loose and offered zero coverage of my chest. I had read reviews that this suit is for small chested women, but I’m going to add...if you don’t have much up top at all, this top will leave you totally exposed at all times. Returned."
1.0,"This is about the strangest shirt I've ever tried on. It's long and narrow and cheaply made. It came all bundled up and wrinkly. Finally found a tiny tab that says 100% cotton. Needless to say, it was returned."
1.0,What a complete waste of $20! I purchased a similar sweater from a different seller that I loved. I ordered this one because it looked identical but was $10 less expensive. The first time I wore it it fell apart!! By the end of the day the sleeve was completely unstitched. This is my absolute worst Amazon purchase.
1.0,very narrow waist and heavy material
1.0,"I've worn Hanes cotton briefs for years and love them  Unfortunately, these are more like bikinis than briefs.  I ordered the same size I always wear but these were very tight and uncomfortable.  I wish I could return them but I put them in the washing machine before checking them out first."
1.0,absolutely massive sizing totally off
1.0,does not come pre hole punched...buckle won't lock at all. just returned it after having to suffer to wear it unlocked all day during my banquet bartender shift. please don't buy it
1.0,Sadly this turns skin green....definitely NOT STERLING SILVER.
1.0,Very flimsy and some of the rose gold is already chipping off - I will be returning them.
1.0,Broke bracelet and rough cut around the necklace
1.0,i wear size 8.  the size chart said to get XL. it was for a 14 or 16.  Had to return.
1.0,Chain broke upon me trying to open the clasp to put it on. Poor quality. I guess you get what you pay for
1.0,"not as pictured I bought 2,  neither have a wide neckline or are flowy. they are fitted at waist. not what I wanted."
1.0,"Mask didn't do anything to protect me from my reckless behavior, and when I tried to blame the god the police said I'm not protected. They must be liberal heathens."
1.0,Not a good buy but it was less than $10
1.0,Need return
1.0,The shirt actaully fit great except for the arms. For some reason or another once you tied it the side of the arm stuff out making you look silly
1.0,Way smaller than expected and not shaped like the picture. It was long and thin. Returned!
1.0,Does not fit like it should.
1.0,Too big. Order one size down.
1.0,"They are extremely stiff and they smell bad when they arrive. I’m still trying to break them in. Zero comfort, don’t recommend."
1.0,Ordered a xxl fits my daughter who wears a size M.
1.0,Unable to fasten it
1.0,"Does not fit well.  A large was too big and a medium was too small and both were made for a very tall person, as  there was a lot of extra material in the mid section."
1.0,I had to send it back. It's not stylish at all. The bottom fits tightly and the top is extremely loose.
1.0,I got the ring. I loved the ring. I wore it for 5 minutes before the stone fell off. Lost the stone in a parking lot. Should have known it was glued. Ever hear of a drill??  What a cheap piece of crap. I bought this blue calcite ring to help alleviate anxiety; guess the joke's on me.<br />Carol Levitt
1.0,Cheap don't work fell apart
1.0,"Got this for my husbands Samsung watch, it did say that it was to Compatible Samsung Gear S2 Watch which it was totally NOT!!! it was for a totally different watch. So disappointed that I was unable to return it and get a refund. So that's what you need it for don't get it!!!!<br />this is not  for the Samsung Gear S2 watch, it does not slide into the sides of the watch"
1.0,"They broke after 3 weeks of wear, poor fit"
1.0,Square n compass fell off when I put the ring on the first time
1.0,"I bought 2 sets of these because I used them as earrings. These are super cute but they easily twist. After wearing them for 2 days, the small one untwised in the shower and it was gone. A week later the biggest one fell off somewhere. Super disappointed."
1.0,Doesn't fit. Runs small<br />Can't return or exchange either.
1.0,Poor quality item
1.0,"Turned brown quickly, don't buy."
1.0,I wanted cotton handkerchiefs. These are a polyester blend and have more of a polyester than a cotton feel.
1.0,Horrible quality- should not be sold at all.  Is a rag with shape…
1.0,Not what it looks like in pictures. The color is way off
1.0,These glasses broke after wearing them twice. I would never buy them or recommend them.

1.0,Horrible shorts

1.0,Pin to short
1.0,I don't know any 3 year olds with a 7&#34; wrist. Mine is 7&#34; and I am 60. My granddaughters wrist is 5&#34; max.
1.0,THE EARRINGS WERE PIECES OF THIN METAL. THEYBROKE WHEN I GOT READY TO CLASP THEM TO MY EAR. IT WAS MONEY WASTED
1.0,Los aretes jamás me llegaron.<br />Por favor envíenmelos.
1.0,Horrible quality. Cheaply made.
1.0,I'm going to just discuss the fit. As far as the bust area if you have anything bigger than a B cup don't bother buying. The bottoms fit to your true size I can't say that but you may have to buy a top separately for a bigger bust. I'm only saying one because I really didn't like it after I put it on but it has nothing to do with the company.
1.0,garbage
1.0,"These are not at all what I expected in underwear.  They are made of material like in swimming suits.  As you can imagine, these would be awful to wear all day long.  Sweaty, hot, icky mess."
1.0,Do not order these! They are nothing like the description and the quality is horrible. I was excited at how cute these earrings would be & was sadly dissapointed. I would give 0 stars if I could
1.0,"Very poor quality, cheap, flimsy and out-of-square after one washing. Got them for my dogs to wear and can't use them."
1.0,Came too small
1.0,Giving this item 1 star because the description was incorrect and I was sent the beanie that I did not order! I ordered the gray one I was sent the blue one.<br /><br />The hat is very thin and runs small! My son is a huge Ryan’s World fan but keeping this item we wouldn’t be able to have him use it!
1.0,Él materia es muy simple.
1.0,Terrible size. Flimsy and bad quality. The print looks terrible. Very  Definitely not worth the buying.
1.0,Beautiful skirt but falls apart after two uses.
1.0,Very cheaply made. Son tore them up in a matter of days.I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,Even tho it’s say 3xl it’s really not it fix like a large
1.0,I didn’t dislike the skirt. I actually liked it. Just couldn’t fit it.
1.0,Too fragile.  They promptly fell apart before they were ever worn. Not worth purchasing.
1.0,Totally destroyed when hit by first gust of wind....  Stand completely inadequate.
1.0,"Ordered 2 of these for twin granddaughters, one was fine the other had defective elastic around the leg holes.  Very disappointed it was shipped in this condition.  Waste of time and money.  I had to pay shipping costs to send it back!  Not cool!"
1.0,Definitely not the ring advertised. The gems are glued on and not held on with prongs. I paid $100 for this ring and after I had ordered it the price was $2. The design on the bottom is not there either. Definitely false advertising. Not satisfied what so ever.
1.0,These things are huge and the 'gold' is not fooling anyone.
1.0,"This is an inappropriate pin for Children, and It is not funny."
1.0,Used it 2 times now it gets stuck and doesn't work.
1.0,"i was expecting a real watch not a piece of plastic. for the price that i paid, that was a joke on what i recieved."
1.0,NOT ACCURATE MEASURMENTS. YOU LIKE TO SQUINT?
1.0,"This a very cute dress but is way too small. I don't know if I didn't understand the color, I thought it would be black but look more like a dark olive greenish grayish. Kinda sunburnt looking."
1.0,"Probably it’s just my luck I guess so I got this watch and It worked perfectly for the first 2 days , on third day decided to adjust the time and it went out wheneve I try to open it, probably it’s not glued enough or something , just waist of 19$ too bad, I liked how it looks."
1.0,"Arms are way too small, although the torso fits fine. You won't be able to lift your arms at all, but the material is super cute! I ordered an XL and wear a US size small and it didn't fit."
1.0,The blouse looks and feels like cheap costume satin.
1.0,This was not as listed in the website.  Disappointed with the quality and fit
1.0,"I love this dress, the fit, the pattern, it looks nice. BUT the material is less than desirable. It feels like the 80’s pajama material that was banned because it is so flammable. It feels cheap and gross and not at all something I would want to wear in the summer. If it were a different material this dress would get 5 stars."
1.0,"It looked like it had been used and returned. The shirt had a hole in it,threads was coming loose,and the pull over hooded part had elastic straps on the side for a snug fit and they were broke!! Very disappointed will not buy again for Halloween 2019!!"
1.0,"when I order something that is supposed to be crimson, I do not want something that is hot pink."
1.0,The wearable length is way to short. It's more like 5.5 post length not long enough for me. I will hand it over to a friend.
1.0,"Stitching imperfections, crooked &#34;SOREL&#34; logo, suede is coming apart. Boots were not made well. Very unhappy with these $200 boots that were supposed to last me years, that did not last me two months."
1.0,Missing carrying case.  Returned
1.0,The buckle fell apart after 1 month.  I really like the idea and will try to repair it myself.
1.0,If your glasses have arms they will not fit in these felt sleeves. If you have clip-on sun glasses that you need to stash these might work.
1.0,They are very tiny more for a child
1.0,This hat does not fit to size. It's smaller than should be. Very sad i can't vear it on cold days. And i cant return it because i'm abroad.
1.0,"good starter corset I'll give it that, but it need new strings and runs TWO sizes small at the very least. I wish I ordered bigger than I thought I needed. I runs extremely small! I don't think it's steampunk at all its adequate.<br /><br />Update: I double checked the size I bought and I DID get the largest size they offered. I'm a size 18 and I ordered a size 32/5x and it bows when I tighten it and the strings provided are about 2 feet too small. It's pretty but not practical for any corset needs other than taking it off for &#34;quality time&#34; with your partner. Even then not worth the effort. Also the g-string that came with it was 3-4 sizes too big. Unless you are already a small women don't bother."
1.0,"I didn't want to give it even one star.<br />The product is yellow, not ivory as pictured, and it is NOT at all distressed. Very very disappointed. Was looking forward to this shirt jacket."
1.0,"This was not a good product at all!! I don’t have a large breast yet the drag string was coming out, stickers were sliding down and over all was not supporting my breast!"
1.0,"The jacket is decent for the price, drapes well, and is comfortable. However, after washing it according to the instructions, the poor thing looked like the cat attacked it with white yarn. I tried to remove the white balls, but the fabric was irrevocably scratchy looking. Have to give this one a thumbs down."
1.0,It doesn't hook well.  Please work on the hook. Thanks
1.0,Everything fell off as she walked
1.0,Don't waist your money.
1.0,Fit more like a long T-shirt than a dress. Very thin material.
1.0,if you use a otterbox this doesn't work. so it is useless to me.
1.0,Didn't fit im a lg so I got a xlg and it was still small
1.0,The embroidery is stitched so tight that it makes it very difficult to put on the socks and they leave an impression of the designs on your leg. None of my other compression socks fit like this.
1.0,So disappointed both of the just last one day
1.0,This shirt in a large would fit a small child..
1.0,"Loved this dress, really wanted it to fit. I'm 5'7' and 172 pounds, a little overweight but nothing crazy. I hoped this would glide along my curves, just brushing them, but I looked like a stuffed sausage."
1.0,Never go to wear them they arrived broken
1.0,The eyes are very spread apart I cant see in front of me there is no way of breathing in there not even a small hole for your mouth or nose and squishes your nose into your skull. Maybe will be good for pictures.
1.0,Made my finger green after 2 days don't buy if you want good quality
1.0,"This set does not fit like pictured - the bunched area on the top sat way too high for a normal woman's body. The shorts were also quite a bit shorter than what i had anticipated - honestly may as well wear the short with just panties...also, despite following washing instructions, the set shrinks.  Waste of money."
1.0,"Could not get into my ears, had to return them."
1.0,Super cheaply made. Broke the first tome my daughter put them on. Highly NOT recommend these.
1.0,Horrible. I ordered an xL and it fits like a medium. Never again. Don't waste your time
1.0,Shirt had a dank smell.
1.0,"It’s really cute, but it fits awkwardly on me and the top is small but the shorts run really big so its kinda weird"
1.0,You can not take out links so if it doesn't fit right you can't do anything
1.0,These earring are way toooooo long to wear comfortably!! The backs dig into your head from behind your ear! It doesn’t matter that the company practically gives them away for free with promo codes when they are trash anyways!!
1.0,More uncomfortable than a regular metal one.
1.0,The hat is made of stiff paper and was smashed in the product bag and box.  Permanent creases in the hat causing it to be mis-shaped and lopsided.  Will never purchase again
1.0,I have thin legs and couldn't even zip this boot up.
1.0,"one of the posts was bent when I recieved it, and the backs to the earrings don't stay on. will not buy again."

1.0,"Poor quality, cheap material, caps were children sizes , very cheaply made"
1.0,China size
1.0,"Waited over a month, for this to arrive and it was too small.  XXL FITS LIKE A M-L"
1.0,"Broke on the first use. Got to use it this morning for the first time. It opened great, collapsed well but wouldn’t slide all the way back. Now it’s stuck half way, it won’t close all the way and it won’t stay open. My previous umbrella cost less and lasted 10 years through some heavy use."
1.0,This thing lasted for about 10 minutes of flight.
1.0,This product worked great for two weeks.  Now the elastic is stretched out (from routine wear) and no longer holds my socks up. Returning.
1.0,They came bent and broken
1.0,"Difficult to return, and the white on shirt on the bottom flares out all the way around, horrible design."
1.0,"What a terrible product. Didn't last taking it out of the box. Stone was already fallen when it was open. I bought a garnet ring from them and even though it was not well finished, i gave them a chamce thinking it was only this ring and decided to buy the earings and same story. So bad quality how can amazon allow this kind of retailers."
1.0,To small and didn’t like the way it felt
1.0,Good looking and comfortable.
1.0,"The stockings either came with a run or got a run in them as I was putting them on for the first time....(the reason I can only give 1 star) I am returning them today. I will however say the control top is very nice and they fit perfectly, I ordered a small which is my normal size, and the natural color was an almost perfect match for my fair skin tone. If not for the run I would have given them a 5 star review."
1.0,"The sandals are made very well, however they are difficult to gt on over your heel. They also make you feet stink badly after just a short time of useage! If I had not thrown out the reciept I would have definatley sent them back. For now, I plan to cut off the heel strap and use them for yard work. Bummer."
1.0,"Cheap, did not have time to sport them when one broke."
1.0,I purchased  this bookbag for my daughter (back to school). She has been wearing it for one week and the zippers have already broken. I am very unpleased with the quality of this product. Terrible quality.
1.0,Wrong shade a cheap material
1.0,"Very poor quality, soles started to fall off after they got wet once."
1.0,Cheep material and way too small even though I ordered a size up. It was also gold instead of silver.
1.0,"One pair fell apart in my ear, very cheap"
1.0,It looks pretty but is so cheaply made that it falls apart as soon as you touch it. I couldn't even use it for the event I was going to.
1.0,Bought these as a gift. Pants are way too small despite being told to order up. Spent 12.99 in shopping only to be refunded 1.91 back.
1.0,The first one I bought has a hole. Got it replaced. The second one was ok but after first wash the stitch is coming off. Will not purchase again.
1.0,Not same as pictured and wrong size. I ordered 36 and I think size I git was 42
1.0,Neither watches work. The dail broke off one as I was setting the time. The other one just ticks in place. Too bad because they are cute.
1.0,Okay for small breasted women but does not support and wrinkles at the outside edges
1.0,"Material is very, very thin, not good for protecting the hair.<br />Fit is off lopsided.<br />You truly get what you paid for.<br />I only ordered one set and was sent 2 , and was charged for both. Will be returning the one."
1.0,"Poorly sewn together, size runs small...typical &#34;made in China&#34; craftsmanship."
1.0,"Returned, Buyer pays return shipping!!!!!!<br />Bathing suit is Very Well Made! I hate I have to return it. I would reorder another size but this seller makes you pay for postage return & I’m afraid to try the large. B/c if it didn’t fit then that would be More Postage Return Fee! So I returned it.<br />Measurements 36” Bust, 29” waist, 39” hips. Size 4/6 small or 7 Juniors. I ordered a medium & it was unbearably tight so unwearable. I Don’t know how much bigger the large is but would have to be Much bigger for it to be a comfortable fit. That is why I’m afraid to reorder. I’m just going to spend a little more money & go try on swimsuits & but one the old fashioned way, lol!"
1.0,"This shirt is cute. I ordered in 2 colors, but one came new with tag and bag. The other one came worn, no tags, and I cheap different plastic bag. Why do you sell things that are clearly used and returned from someone else?? I would’ve kept it, if not. Returned"
1.0,Really have to watch sizes.  What is an XL for us - is not where this was made.
1.0,The arms are really tight didn’t care for the ribbed affect looks really cheap
1.0,Terrible! Broke within 15 mins after wearing.
1.0,Lights went off in the second time my child wore them. Ripped off in a few weeks. Don’t waste money on this
1.0,The Charm started to peel the next day its a sticker. Horrible
1.0,This wallet is made cheap. I haven’t had it for two weeks and it’s ripped already SMH now I have to buy another one
1.0,I ordered two sizes up and it is still very small on me. I'm a little surprised because this usually works when ordering Asian sizes. I do not recommend that his one.
1.0,Ugh.  Way too small
1.0,"The piece looked very nice and fit very well, but its durability was extremely shoddy. After only a few weeks of light wear, the beads cracked and the elastic band snapped."
1.0,Ride up like crazy. There’s no way you can work out in these.
1.0,Can't add a photo because my daughter was mortified when she had this bathing suit on. It was a thin fabric but once it got wet it was so see through.  I 100% do not recommend
1.0,The guard chain came broken other than that it’s a very pretty bracelet
1.0,"Very silky fabric, not quite what i expected. Kind of cheesey looking. Fit is smaller than I anticipated. I'm 5'5 and normally wear a women's Small or sometimes medium. I ordered a large because it said to order bigger, and the pants portion were too short. Safe to say I was disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,The material was extremely thin and appeared cheap
1.0,Bought this for an upcoming trip and after a few hours in the pool the part where you hook in the snap tore off. Very disappointing. Luckily had pack an additional bathing suit that I got from Walmart about a year ago which has withstood an entire summer already and this trip as well.
1.0,"The bag is really cheap.  Looks nice in the picture, but very low quality.  It is also a lot smaller than your average beach bag."
1.0,Pictures do not compare to the size of the bag i actually  go.... awful!!!! Extremely misleading!!!! If i wanted a small purse i woulf of ordered one... i didnt... disappointed to say the extreme least
1.0,These are more for kids than a couple was expecting something more durable and able to wear daily. The charm is a very cheap plastic don't expect it to last long. I've gotten better lil bracelets for our lil girls before from a dollar store not sure if id waste the money if I even saw it in a dollar store to be honest. Very disappointed all around a complete waste of money!!
1.0,It was very cute my daughter loved it. Wore it once and the one strap broke... definitely not worth the price.
1.0,Terrible product! Even the buttons are different colors
1.0,is bat business. don't work. all time stop.  don't buy this.
1.0,Does not fit right it’s loose and lets dust in
1.0,This item material was cheap and frayed easily. I would not recommend.
1.0,Dress was made for a 5 ft 100 pound woman. Fabric did not flow.
1.0,Pants do not stretch well in the thighs! I hate these pants! If you are tall DON’T BUY!!! Look nothing like the picture
1.0,The pants were comfy for the one time I wore them. Too long but I could have hemmed. My biggest complaint is I washed & dried them and these little shreds of elastic came out on ALL the seams. I’ve never seen anything like it. I won’t be able to wear again because it looks terrible. I regret purchasing.
1.0,did not look like the picture.  does  not have the fuzzy ears or tail as it appears in the pictures.
1.0,Looked nothing like the picture. You couldn't even determine what the beads were supposed to look like.
1.0,hinge for clip broke after week of normal use. do not recommend to buy.
1.0,"I ordered the largest size to wear as a cover for summer tops. It is so small I can’t even get it on. This is more like a girl’s top, definitely not intended for adults. Don’t waste your money!"
1.0,What the hell is this......I'm not sure I even bought this??????
1.0,This product is a counterfeit and a poor one at that.
1.0,This tunic top was not as long as portrayed in photos. I bought this hoping to wear with leggings but it was to shirt and has a very unflattering fit.
1.0,Size does not match your size chart very disappointed
1.0,"Clownishly huge for a woman's wrist.  Heavy.  ""Voice "" is not human- computerized and is unclear and barely audible."
1.0,These masks turned out to be useless. Bought them for my nine year old daughter because the listing said it would fit a child and they were fun patterns. But they are so big they don’t even really fit me. Not stretchy and sturdy enough material to stay up. Might have helped if it was hemmed at the ends to give a little more body to help them stay on your nose. Basically these now sit in a drawer totally unused.
1.0,I wish i would never ordered them they are a waste to me I will never let anyone I know order these if asked  i had them on &amp; because they wereto big I fell down my basement steps  they are slick on the bottom i have not had themon since the day i got them
1.0,The wallet was damaged and wasn't new. It has been used.
1.0,"Lenses aren't cut the same as the standard lens, they are a hair smaller. When installed the bottom part of the lens doesn't sit entirely in the frame."
1.0,Awful. It's hideous and doesn't look like the picture at all. Sending it back asap.
1.0,"No right parents would spend so much for a daughter if they don't want to spoil their kids. So bviously it's for adult. However, the circumference of the wrist for this watch is only 18cm. For such a design it's not fitable for normal adult wrist. (I am not overweight person). Only for skinny women or a girl.... I do not recommand."
1.0,"first of all it is VERY small 3/4 the size of a replica (correct sized) one. the square at the bottom was hanging free when in fact it is no supposed to be. the engravings on the key itself are shallow and faint mine look as if i set it on concrete and hit it with a sledge hammer, the &#34;leather&#34; cord is not leather it is cheap stretchy rubber that snapped withing the first 15 minutes of me wearing it DO NOT BUY"
1.0,Don’t waste your money. This is a very low quality item. It broke the first time out of the package when it was being put on for the very first time.
1.0,After a few days on my daughter’s shoes most of them popped off
1.0,The picture is not Even accurate.  The sleeves are huge and the color is nothing like you see.  It is sort of a cross between pink and orange and just ugly.
1.0,Screen print is messed up. Where is Thor....
1.0,Runs small. It was too small to fit over my 4 year olds head. Disappointed because my son loves Spider-man
1.0,Product didn't match the image in Amazon. Not satisfied at all...
1.0,Not happy with these sunglasses because they are cheaply made &amp; it's not centered to where I can try to see out of them. And I know my ears are different length &amp; all but for these not to sit right or able to keep them straight to look out of them terribly made product.
1.0,They were a lot flashier than they appear in the picture so I returned them.
1.0,Glass fell out and I lost all my charms. Will not purchase another.
1.0,"Started falling apart the second time I wore it. the left sleeve seam is coming undone and all I've done is sit at work, nothing that would warrant it falling apart."
1.0,returned as no shape and not an attractive dress for body type also made poorly as top on one side not sewn correctly very dissapointed
1.0,"Material very cheap and shiny, slightest stretch distorts the fabric. Returning."
1.0,"This shirt is going to be return item.  It's a 2XL shirt, that's listed to be cotton linen.  The material per the tag however is 100 percent polyester (which explains the tight fit IMO).  My issue with this item though is that the threading near the shoulders and the upper back after a single wash is showing signs of starting to loosen / fall apart.<br /><br />The shirt hasn't been worn once, but is already looking like it's been through the wash a few dozen times."
1.0,I don't like the fabric.  It's shiny like an old lady's house dress.
1.0,They need to change the sizes. Mine was way too small. It suggests you order 1-2 sizes bigger. Too confusing
1.0,I wore these shoes 2 times before they fell apart. I wish I could get a refund or a replacement but it is a few days past the return window of 30 days. I'm guessing that is why there is such a short window because the company knows it is selling you such a poorly made product. They are more of a disposable shoes than a staple item. Unfortunate because they looked cute.
1.0,The holes in the strap are far too narrow to fit the ends of a pair of Ray Bans without ripping the threads out of the seam. Poorly Made Crap. Do not buy.
1.0,I was very dissatisfied with this product I've had it about 2 weeks it's already turn black and would not polish back up and then it broke off my neck
1.0,"This product was so cheaply made, I didn't even use them.  Went right into the trash. Ordering a different set from somewhere else."
1.0,Just badly put together.  I sent them back.
1.0,irritated my skin
1.0,"Some metal pieces of the jacket were rusted.. it damaged the leather as well... I tried in my body to see if it would worth to get anothet one, but i felt it uncomfortable in my arms. I'm returning it.<br />It comes in a nice bag for transportation though."
1.0,Runs VERY small.  My daugther is a tiny 11 year old.  Always the smallest one in her class.  I ordered the size 12.  It was way too small.  I would it akin it to size 6 or 7.  Colors were cute and it did look as pictured and we would have kept it had it fit.
1.0,Tassel was unexpectedly attached to the tam. Don't they know better? During the ceremony the graduates switch tassel to the other side. Don't buy this tam.
1.0,"These are super cute. Unfortunately I was unable to get these boots on my daughters feet. The Velcro on the side does not go down to the bottom all the way and the instep is too low to get her foot to go in. Really disappointed. Also, the buttons/Velcro are on the inside instead of the outside of the foot."
1.0,Not happy at all.. wore them once and at the gym the seem split right in the Crotch area...
1.0,Too tight tight in the hips
1.0,I wore them once and a stone fell out of it. Otherwise really beautiful and I received compliments the one time I wore them. They are a bit heavy if you have sensitive ear lobes.
1.0,I got the wrong size . Its an XL and its tiny . I cant even wear it .
1.0,Very thin and cheap material. The white is basically see through. I ended up returning the dress
1.0,Very tight fit especially in the hips where I would have wanted it to be loose. Not true to size.
1.0,Hard to put together
1.0,Received boy size
1.0,"Es muy feo y me llego con daño de fábrica, nunca lo use"
1.0,"Ladies, what you see as the picture is not at all what you will get. You will get a 100% polyester, non-breathable box blouse that is not even close to the picture. As women, we can pretty much tell what fabric a top will look and feel like when we zoom in to the picture: For me, I saw a picture of a cotton top, somewhat ""slubby"" with a little bit longer hem-really comfortable. This is short, super shiny,  and the collar is altogether different, as are the fit of the sleeves. Never even tried it on. i don't know how this seller can stay on this site."
1.0,"I really liked the way these looked, the shape and the color.  However, they broke after a few wears, which was really disappointing. The clasp became really loose and then failed to close and kept falling out."
1.0,"Let the record show that I am only giving this product one star because you're required to at least give that. The jacket looks and feels cheap, I ordered an XL because I wear large in my other jackets and I wanted this to fit bulky. It was tight! The measurements were off, its not even real jean material. I ended up printing out the return label the same day."
1.0,"The product description states these are “stretch, woven pants” like the polyester/spandex blend mentioned with the other colors. These pants are cotton twill, not anything like the product being advertised."
1.0,I ordered 6-9 months and recieved 0-3 months.  Such a pain to now have to return!
1.0,Much too big for my small fingers. Wish they came in sizes . Would have ordered all.
1.0,"While the quality of the necklace feels good, it arrived EXTREMELY tarnished."
1.0,"Terrible.  Way to small. I ordered an extra large,  I'm a bra size of 36 but like to order big. This was so tiny it didn't fit my sister who is a size 2."
1.0,Extremely small!! Fits a 13 yr old maybe n I bought it for my husband whose slim but fit n wears M
1.0,The purse itself was really cute but the strap came damaged. It was a shame because I needed it for a gift but had to send it back and couldn’t get a new one in time.
1.0,Not great for my son for soccer... Too hot and hard to breathe still
1.0,"This product was see through, bad material, and was overall not high quality"
1.0,"Unfortunately the color is not like the picture andthis is not for men ,this is a girls jacket ."
1.0,"Wore one time, frame broke, CHEAP !!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,"Cheap quality, very small, and it took a month to ship, smells like dead fish."
1.0,First time trying it on the strap broke unbelievable what kind of product this is
1.0,"Unfortunately I purchased this hat early, before I needed to use it so it's too late to return it. This hat is a copy of another hat which I already have. I wore it today and the sun burned right through the pink fabric onto my face. It's so thin it doesn't protect you at all, and has NO SPF protection though it states SPF50!  It may be good to keep the sun out of your eyes (with sunglasses), but it fits loose and has NO protection from the sun at all. The only thing good about it is the price and style."
1.0,I’m 6-2 and it’s made for someone 5-5
1.0,Very cheap quality doses not worth 2 dollars
1.0,made for a child not an adult
1.0,The waist band is horrid. A very large pocket with a small band of elastic.
1.0,I bought this for a friend and when I received it the rose definitely doesn’t not look like a rose. It’s super bumpy and disgorged in the middle.
1.0,These replacement lense claim to be anti-glare but they are not. I can see my eyes reflecting when i am driving. Extremely distracting.  I am annoyed that i spent so much money to replace my lenses. They make you pay to return the product so buyers beware.
1.0,Terrible quality and fit
1.0,I DID NOT RECEIVE MOLDING BARS ?!!!!? How AM I SUPPOSED TO USE THIS NOW SO USELESS!! I WAS GOING TO WEAR THESE FOR MY BIRTHDAY
1.0,Clamp doesn't close..
1.0,Quality and fit was terrible
1.0,sizing is wrong bought a large and it was  way to small
1.0,We are finding that the sizing and fit is all over the place with these retro style dresses regardless of brand. This particular dress (style: black/white checked button front with large front hip pockets) daughter said it fit like a strange sack of potatoes around the waist and top. It was not at all fitted as in the picture. Had to return. She orders a lot of these style clothes from Amazon and usually loves them but finding it is basically trial and error.
1.0,"10/10 would NOT recommend. I understand that it's supposed to be oversized, but even getting the small it fit like a large box."
1.0,If it's horrible
1.0,"Was clueless of it use. Once found out how to use it, it was too small & one strap broke easily."
1.0,"The pictures sock was not the named sock. I went with the photo and got something unexpected. Rather than return it, I gave it to someone as a gift. photos should match the product ordered."
1.0,Photo misleading.  Style hideous. Definitely not what is pictured. Way to small. Sizing is grossly incorrect.
1.0,Crap!!!!
1.0,"All the extra length of these 70"" ties is in the back.  The flared front is no longer than a shorter tie."
1.0,band broke in one month
1.0,"Purchased this product, which arrived today. I purchased this product based on the overall rating score & a few reviews. The next day, I took the time to read more of the reviews & view pics. After what I read, I immediately tried to cancel this order. My reasoning is due to poor fabric choice, poor sewing (stitching), and the big NO NO...this set is on here numerous times with a different company logo. That is extremely troublesome and I have caution lights and alatms blaring in my face and ears right now. The fact that there was no QA inspection of this product is also a huge problem, look at the misspelled logo for one of the numerous brands they slapped on this set. Amazon, really? How could you allow such an inferior product to be sold to your infinite number of loyal customers.  I am extremely disappointed that you all still allow this product to be sold on Amazon. Unfortunately, it was too late to cancel my order and I had to purchase another gift for the individual whom I purchased this set for, because I couldn't suffer the embarrassment of giving someone I care about a terrible product as a gift from me; but rest assured this product was immediately processed for return 5 minutes after I received it."
1.0,Very disappointed with this top.  Extra large is about maybe a large.
1.0,Best seller if you wanna wait a month for nothing. Your money back
1.0,"Pretty sure these are youth socks, not for men"
1.0,"I ordered the pink sweater, the style and cut are not as expected, the sweater looks frumpy on a body."
1.0,Doesn't look like picture!!!!!! Cheap knock off!!!!!!! Terrible!!! Dont buy!!!!!!
1.0,Bad! What you see in the picture is not what you get. It's a bait and switch
1.0,Appears to be red in photo...bag delivered was a darker cranberry. Leather was not the expected quality. Unfortunately it will have to be returned.
1.0,turned colors after a day of wearing it..
1.0,I received this as a Christmas gift and it worked great...for only four months. Incredible. I would give this a 0 if I could. It looks good but if it only works for a few months craftsmanship is terrible. Trying to get a refund or exchange- we’ll see how responsive they are...
1.0,The product isnt a original Oakley item. This is a cheap piece of crap! I have one original Oakley lanyard black and the material isnt the some! THIS IS FAKE!
1.0,Everything about this was off. The bottoms were too small and the top portion was too big.
1.0,These were way too small.
1.0,Absolutely tiny - not at all what I had in mind. I don't think I'll ever wear them. Too bad.
1.0,This is a complete bait and switch. Do not buy this hat. I finally found the orginal listed on Etsy as a gorgeous hand made product. It was a one of a kind and is sold now
1.0,Cheap! Latch did not work. Returned and got full refund.
1.0,it looks good but is way too small. do not waste your money. now what to do
1.0,"I was excited to get new gloves for my birthday and wore them the next day!<br />But, on the following day as I wore them, there was big hole in the leather by the thumb .<br />I wonder how and if I can send them back for a new pair."
1.0,"arrived uncharged, no possible way to open to view battery.  NO instructions included.  Only buy this if you want a bracelet that looks like a watch."
1.0,Advertised as for women.  I have a small face but they still don’t fit.  Maybe for little girls.
1.0,"Smallest size XL . It’s for a kid , not even adult size"
1.0,"How could you produce such a horrible product which looks nothing like the pic ? Cheaply made, and the design in front, doesnt have sufficient fabric to create the effect.  I threw it out.  I was shocked"
1.0,Very cheaply made already two broken haven’t had it for a day yet
1.0,To small if you wear 16 order a 5x per example.  I ordered a 2x and it fits my niece that wears a sz 8 US quality is not good at all
1.0,Uncomfortable horrible material
1.0,Don't waste your money! The Mazda emblem fell off the key chain within two weeks...
1.0,"I honestly liked the shirt and material, but it was not the same material as advertised. I returned the first one to exchangefor the correct shirt. When I spoke with someone at Amazon, she stated I would receive the correct shirt this time around, but I didn't. So therefore I returned the shirt for a refund."
1.0,The necklace broke two days after having it. Worst product ever.
1.0,"Sexy but one foot a bit larger than the other so it tends to flop and rub heel.  Toes slide out of the front. The most prominent thing is the toxic odor of the synthetic polymer the shoe is made from. .  I placed shoe on night table and went to bed, I had to remove it quickly from my room after trying and my entire room which is large stunk from the polymer or whatever is used for the dye or fabric. So it needs to be aired if it even fits well. I’ve donated."
1.0,Terrible sock thin thin thin not for boots. Make your feet sweat like crazy. I wear a lot of different kinds and am crazy about comfort/ cooling/ fit. They slide down constantly just walking. Don’t wast your money
1.0,I have metatarsalgia and thought these would be great.  They did fit well and stay on but the seam was thick and burned my soles so much that I had to take off after an hour of wear both times I wore them.
1.0,Extra large is more like a small size
1.0,Not as pictured and it broke after one wear
1.0,"Quality is poor.  Metal parts cheap.  Elastic band snapped, sending stones flying, without much effort."
1.0,"Material wore out of butt in just a few wears, bought less than a month ago. It's not ripped at the seam, it's the material shredding. I've bought better quality at the thrift store. These look nice. They have a lot of ridiculous accessories, lots of added detail, except no attention to the details that matter, like stitch and material quality. Should have known better. I would stay away from these."
1.0,The fabric makes it look super cheap.
1.0,Bands broke in less than a week of normal use. 2 of them broke within 3 days of wear. The plastic/silicon at the clasp is not durable at all.<br /><br />If you have a active child these absolutely will not hold up.<br />Do not recommend.
1.0,The clasp was broken and does not stay closed.
1.0,Very disappointed. I bought these as a gift for my sons teacher for Christmas and I thought I would be getting 4 pairs of earrings as stated in the pictures and all over the description “4 pairs”. I only received 1 of each design; so I only received 4 earrings in total. I can’t return as it’s intended as a gift and I can’t reorder because it won’t arrive in time! I’m very very disappointed I wish I could get my money back!
1.0,"The trim was pretty. The xL top would fit a short chubby body or short pregnant person. The bottom was for a short person, maybe size 8. I’m usually size 10 tall. Ordered XL as recommended by the website. Disappointed!"
1.0,Wore  the ring one week and returned it as the luster and coating had worn off on one side on the outside.
1.0,Framed is not smooth. Looks like cheep.
1.0,said it would cost more than it was worth to replace the battery.<br />In the trash it goes.
1.0,"Really huge and unsightly sunglasses, and I love oversized sunglasses! This was too much though. They also stick out far from my face.  I wonder if the other reviewers were paid to give these reviews...Its crazy!  I'll post a picture soon to show how they really look. And not an instagram pic.  Also, there are no refunds."
1.0,Hat was ripped at the top when I opened it very upset
1.0,Did not fit size says they fit also there are three pair and I didn't try them on at one time and when I tried a few weeks later to try on the last pair it didn't fit was told could not return !! Pissed all the money I spend here not happy
1.0,Material was a but sheer and cut was not flattering. Returned immediately after trying on.
1.0,"Whack, Dish soap works better and less expensive!<br />The Brush is trash!!! Over hyped trash!!!"
1.0,"The background picture is faded and low quality, and there appears to be some type of plastic melted on it. And the picture posted gives off the impression that the pendant is spherical."
1.0,If you are small chested(34/36 A/B) it does not give you that nice push up and close together cleavage at all. It actually made me look flat chested.
1.0,"I am a size 12, purchased a 2X and it barely fit. Button popped off the first time I tried it on. Very cheap looking, not worth the money. I do not recommend."
1.0,"I would not purchase this again. Very thin, when you hold it up you can see through it."
1.0,"my boyfriend ordered me this as a gift and i was very excited to get it since it was kind of expensive for me at the time. he ordered a size up on everything, i thought it would fit too, yet everything came borderline unwearable… i would order another but this was a gift and i can’t afford one myself lol. really disappointed"
1.0,"This was to be my Christmas eve outfit. I am normally a 14, but was afraid it might be clingy so I order a xl. I should of order a 2x. So skin tight. Back it goes."
1.0,Ese no fue el traje que compré me enviaron uno distinto
1.0,The hat is larger than the description and the color is darker.
1.0,In theory is this a great idea but it didn’t work.  The Y shape inside was too loose and floppy while the actual sports bra was too tight.
1.0,"I returned the top.<br />It didn't look on the picture, description was wrong.<br />See thru and poor, cheap material."
1.0,The necklace broke after taking it out of the packaging. The galaxy circle broke off of the link so there's no way of fixing it. Waste of money.
1.0,All turned Green after 30 days.
1.0,Probably the worst thing I’ve ever bought on Amazon! Poor quality almost like a disposable shirt wear once and throw out. It ran incredibly small and honestly not flattering at all even if it was the right size.
1.0,"I still have yet to wear this watch. It looked gorgeous however it is extremely huge for a feminine wrist. It came entirely too large and I would need to have 4 links removed in order to wear properly. I have since ordered a watch repair kit and after several attempts and 4 people giving it hell, it's still in pieces and unable to repair for it's normal capabilities. Do not buy this watch!"
1.0,"I'm 5'6 and it was floor length on me. Would be good for a Halloween costume but I would not wear it otherwise. Looks cheap, hangs weird and had a plastic odor."
1.0,I wear a size 4-6 and the medium was skin tight
1.0,not worth the purchase
1.0,Garbage. Mostly acrylic balls with spikes. Nothing like the photo!
1.0,Save your Money abs head to your dollar store and just buy 2 pair of black and white drop earrings. Not worth the money.
1.0,The black zebra stripe ones stained the ear pads on my expensive headphones. I was so mad that I took a chance on these cheap tunnels. Too bad because the colors and patterns are pretty and stylish for silicone tunnels.
1.0,I am 5'3&#34; 115lbs - I am barely an A cup and the small too doesn't cover anything. The waist is VERY tight.<br /><br />Bathing suit arrived quickly but ripped. For the price the quality is good I think I just got one of the messed up ones.<br /><br />GO UP A SIZE FOR SURE
1.0,"too small, unable to return"
1.0,It come broken and returned it & never get the glass back or my money
1.0,Broke after a week of wearing.
1.0,The fabric just seems very cheap.
1.0,Today is the first time my granddaughter wore her new sparkle shoes and they proved to be a poor choice. The stones have fallen off at the toes and will not last too many more wears. I would not recommend these for wearing.
1.0,"not a good fitting product and shrinks when you follow the washing instructions, I expect much better from duluth"
1.0,"These things are terrible.  They don't stay on your feet.  I have been pulling them up all day.  They will be going back to Amazon tomorrow.  About the only good thing about them is that you can't see them when you are wearing drivers or loafers, but that is mainly because they are bunched up by your toes."
1.0,Runs very small. Would not fit my hands.
1.0,"Not joggers, lie"
1.0,This is an awful product.  It is made of thin stretchy terry cloth-like fabric and has a very bad order. After the first washing the color quickly faded but the bad odor did not.  I tossed them.
1.0,It was a Christmas gift for my 53 yr old brain damaged daughter.
1.0,"Was not as described. Didn’t fit correctly, looked terrible, and was scuffed up and had holes."
1.0,"Didn't last a day, the frame cracked, cheaply made. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Jamás llegó este producto a mis manos
1.0,I've lost 100 pounds since I bought it and it STILL doesn't fit. Very disappointed.
1.0,Very slippery. My son fell multiple times. We stopped using after 2 days. Not good at all for hardwood floors.
1.0,Bien corriente lo regrese
1.0,The flare on the guage is a 0 not a 2. They are really cute once you get them in. Taking these out are a nightmare! Be sure to constantly turn these in your ears through out the day or your ear will start healing into the holes. I would not suggest purchasing these. Still trying to figure out how to get these out of my ear without ripping my ear!
1.0,I like this dress.As little long but overall a cute dress for summer.Cant beat the price for the dress.Not crazy about the colors but ok to throw on for summer.Definitly not a machine washable dress.Or dryer.Hand wash or delicate cycle.line dry.If anything a stretchy fit.Could of used a extra small
1.0,Feels like the cheap rings you'd get out of a gum machine...the matching earrings though are very nice
1.0,Everthing was off on this dress.  The fit was awful.  The stitching was poor.  Skip this.
1.0,Not like picture at all in style and fabric
1.0,I received the shoes the third week of February. It's now the second week of May the same year and the shoes are falling apart. Shoelaces lasted about 2 weeks and had to replace them. Overall junk!! Comfortable but junk.
1.0,I really like this but I am given this a one because the stitching came and I am not be able to use it very long.
1.0,Got an empty eye glass container. No glasses
1.0,the shirt is bug around the shoulders and the heart came off in one wash.
1.0,Scratch inside the lens I’m very disappointment  and I decided to return the items.
1.0,"Too stiff not as expected and too small, liked the concept"
1.0,Did not have the pumpkin at the bottom
1.0,"My daughter loved this watch and says it's the most &#34;comfy&#34; watch she has ever had, but it stopped working one week after we received it.  Physically, it is a really pretty watch and I like it as well.  Is there anything I can do about it?"
1.0,It was as pictured but doesn't really give support like I needed.
1.0,"The outside case is very durable, but the inside piece is very low quality. Low price did not trump the fact that with the inside falling apart, my glasses were not actually being protected."
1.0,Product did not fit like a normal medium. Color was nice.
1.0,"The '67 Impala had square tailights on each side. This is wrong, which frustrates me as a muscle car and Supernatural fan."
1.0,"Sadly let down by a flimsy safety clip. Mine broke within a few weeks and disappeared from the lanyard. Safe yes, but too flimsy compared to what is otherwise a very good product. Pity it’s let down by one little part."
1.0,"Appeared a decent belt, but the tiny screw that held buckle together came off, lost and it's so small I couldn't find a replacement screw... so had to return. I'd recommend putting some loctite glue on the screws before you use the belt. Nice belt otherwise!"
1.0,1 plastic clip broke on first opening and the plastic coil pulls out where it attaches with ease.  It screams cheap and weak when you see it in person.
1.0,"The lenses was popped out in the box. I was able to put it back in for a couple wears, but after that it just kept falling out. Plan on only getting 2-3 wears out of these glasses."
1.0,Used them a few times and then they started falling apart.
1.0,"Item runs true to size but they do not care how the fabric is cut.  I waited over a month to Receive this item as it was shipped from China. Upon receiving the item, the fabric was not cut appropriately as flowers were on one side of my chest and none on the other leaving a sheer white on one side.  This would not be an issue if you could wear a bra which do to low cut is not feasible.  Wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,"My wife laughed when she saw this, she said it should be advertised to fit on a child it is soooo  small"
1.0,Don’t get
1.0,My sweater came in and has a triangle piece between the L and the I and it wont come off since it’s iron on.  Also much smaller than I expected I normally wear 2x and I ordered a 3X to fit nice and baggy and it does not give or stretch at all I can’t even put it on. Will be returning.
1.0,too small! the material was what I didn&#34;t  expect. I returned it.  Still waiting for refund
1.0,"I really wanted to use these shoelaces.  I bought them for my 7-year-old granddaughter.  She can tie her shoes, but has trouble getting them tight enough to stay tied.  This is a great concept, but the magnets just aren't strong enough to hold together.  She would walk 10-12 feet, max, before they would pop apart.  Not worth the money if they don't stay together.  They are a bit of a challenge to put in--those screws are soooo tiny--but I could live with that if they worked.  Unfortunately, they didn't.  I'm sending them back."
1.0,Nunca recibí este producto
1.0,"I needed these in my life but they seem to run in a child's size? Extremely small, ripped the first and only time I wore them. Very disappointing, I had high hopes."
1.0,"I am 5'3, about 115. 34C,Usually wear S-M for top size, and S-XS for bottom. I already ordered the XS size, and it stil looks like a tent on me.Way way way toooooooo large! And the quality feels like sleepwear. I'd say it only worth $2-5."
1.0,"Bought this for my toddler in a 2t-3t. The shirt was so large that my 12 year old that is 5'2"" and 100lbs can wear it and it barely shows any belly. Ridiculous."
1.0,"I would have given it 0 stars if possible. I accidentally ordered the wrong mask and reached out to the seller immediately. No response! I waited 3 days and did so again, still no reply! Unable to track it and refuse to order the correct 1 due to what I would call horrible customer service. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!"
1.0,Not the color black as shown.  Disappointed!!!!
1.0,"I know stacking rings can be small, but this thing is miniature!!<br />I stack it with other rings and I have to hunt for it to see it.<br />I would return it, but on the order form it is highlighted if the tag comes off you have to pay a re-stocking!! Guess what; the tag came off when I pulled it on my finger!!<br />As I do not want to give this company more money I kept it.<br />I am very careful now when I order jewelry,  not to buy from this company"
1.0,Very cute and looks like the picture but it is impossible to wear it falls off even on the shortest link. So sad i was super excited to wear it.
1.0,"Pedí los zapatos realidad talla 8 y me los enviaron 41, demasiado grande para mi pié,  no los pude estrenar."
1.0,I don ot know  since it cam in 200mm and I needed a 22mm
1.0,Earrings very small. Photo is deceptive. Looks dingy like they about to turn colors.
1.0,At first I loved them today when I received but after wearing for an hour the right foot has stretched out and now the back won't stay on. I'm sad because now I have to return. I'm a true size 8 and purchased an 8 but maybe I can exchange for a 7??
1.0,I ordered a boys 16/18 and it looks/fits more like a 12/14.
1.0,Disappointed the zipper is broke
1.0,Not even a month and it broke loose. All of a sudden all the beads fell apart.
1.0,Beware!!! Got these for my neice because she loves unicorns. They claim to be sterling silver. They broke her ears out! Her ears look aweful!!! She has had to stop wearing earrings for awhile to allow them to heal. JUST AWEFUL!!!
1.0,Garbage - received on Oct 6 - worn about 6 times and it already broke.  Better off using Mission Belts which last longer and are better quality.
1.0,"Everyone absolutely loved this on my baby girl but I was mortified when it started to unravel in front of my friends! Talk about feeling like Cinderella when the clock struck 12, I was so embarrassed! This happen only after bring used 2x"
1.0,The Sock It To Me Women's Argyle Over the Knee Socks do not fit as expected.  They are described as women's but upon receipt I noticed that they are clearly labeled &#34;girls&#34;
1.0,Way TOO SMALL.  I am 38DDD and bought 3X and it still was too small.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,I hated them. I returned them. They are definitely high waisted and that is not in the description.
1.0,Very thin. When ordered I didn’t realize the color is apricot not a creme color. So it has a peachy undertone to it instead white with a creme undertone to it which is what it looked like in the picture. But no only is the color not nice but the weight of it is not nice. It’s very thin and thickish. Wish I would’ve returned in time but I might just give it away
1.0,"I returned this dress. Ordered my normal size and it was too small. The material is horrible - I could hear the static crackling when I took it out of its package and putting it on made my hair stand up. I personally can't stand clothes that generate that much static electricity so this was a big strike for me. The dress was also too short for my 5'9"" height. Bending over was risky business. Consider ordering at least a size up."
1.0,"Fabric too thin, bottoms non existent. This product should be marketed only to younger women."
1.0,They make a lot of squeaky noises when you walk.<br /><br />Wear thick socks if you don’t want blisters.
1.0,It’s extra large and extra long. Size down.
1.0,This was disappointing. I just received this in the mail and it has a hole in the front toe part and my baby hasn’t even worn them yet.
1.0,The red color leeched all over everything. Garbage
1.0,That's all my wife said before she to me to return them.
1.0,"Terrible. Don’t buy. Cheep, huge, smells bad. Nothing like the picture. I got medium and they are definitely extra large."
1.0,"I was so excited to get this, but when I opened the package I was so disappointed. It is very small. If you have a Pandora bracelet with other charms you can't see this charm. It's not shiny and the color is not vivid as pictured. I looked on the actual Pandora website and you can get it there for $20 less!! I will be returning this. I wish I could give negative stars!!"
1.0,Too large for a ladies watch it was returned
1.0,"Super cheap quality. Very see through, came extremely wrinkled, very large but also super short. Cheap feeling material, scratchy and loose strings all over.<br />Would not recommend these."
1.0,You can see the outline of underwear and bras. Wish it was a thicker material
1.0,I am not too fond of the materials.
1.0,These were like wearing plastic wrap<br />So thin and tore it Wasn't worth having them on
1.0,I got this shirt and really liked it however I wore this shirt once and and washed it after one wash the letters started to peel off.
1.0,"The 2nd watch has now failed. The 1st was dead upon arrival. The 2nd died within 4.5 months. So modifying my review as of November 30, 2019.  Previous review: We had a hic-up with the 1st watch not working. The company jumped on it and replaced the watch quickly and professionally. The watch is great to look at and works as it should. The quality seems to be all there with a sturdy band and waterproof to 200m body. All the necessary functions for diving, snorkeling and general outdoor action sports. Not too heavy either! Great value and less costly than many competitor’s watches."
1.0,Ordeted a size larger and it was still too small.  Very flimsy.  Returned item.
1.0,Item came with terrible stitching and the one section will need to be sewn before I can wear this. 🤦🏻‍♀️
1.0,"Item is larger then I thought,bad quality, and poorly packaged. It came damage."
1.0,Super tiny and can see through them
1.0,"Broke within a week, average use on car keys"
1.0,I would give no stars if I could an xl wouldnt even fit my very thin friends.
1.0,horrible the model of the dress they sent me<br />It's not the same as I bought.
1.0,"These come out looking good, but the rubber ends that go on glasses last only a few weeks.  Back to the drawing board on finding a good sun glasses strap."
1.0,"This is crap! I wasn't expecting much because of the low price, but just as others have said, they look nothing like what is advertised here or on the package (shame on me for not reading the reviews first). Don't bother with these, spend a couple more dollars and look elsewhere!"
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!  Waste of money.  They are super cute, but good luck getting them pulled up anywhere near your crotch, hips, or rear end.  I couldn't wear them. I weigh 118 pounds, 5'3&#34;.  There is no reason why these shouldn't fit me.  The nude part that starts at the cat ears, and continues up to the the waist line is waaaaaaaay to short to make it up to your waist.  When I did try to stretch it up my legs, to try to get them to work, well...... then the cat part just got pulled higher and higher and higher to the point that you would have to wear a SUPER short skirt for the cat to show.  I don't think these are returnable unfortunately, to get my money back.  =^-^=  :("
1.0,"I'm unsure of where to start with this but I'd give it 0 stars if I could. it looks like a regular black shirt that they just cut up. the left sleeve is cut at the bottom, its kinda obvious. there's no stitching at the bottom of the sleeve I was very disappointed. there are loose strings everywhere on the shirt. Not really worth it to send back but I don't really think this shirt is worth ordering"
1.0,Its not the right size can I send it back
1.0,"I ordered the recommended size and it fit not fit properly. While the dress fit, it was not roused. Plus, the dress just was not as pretty as in the photo."
1.0,Its not a Polarized. Also not a Night View Vision Glasses.<br />It was like a Toy Glasses for Kids.
1.0,"These shirts are nothing like what is pictured from this seller. I have also submitted a return, heard nothing back and now have had to file a claim. Don't waste your time or your money, you will be disappointed."
1.0,It won’t heat the jacket. I was in South Dakota up in the mnt lucky it didn’t get that cold or I would be really mad.
1.0,No support and definitely NOT a compression tank.
1.0,Broke immediately when removing from package pearls fell off
1.0,Too boxy!
1.0,false advertisement. wrong item came. looks nothing like picture
1.0,I was only able to wear each of these chokers once. They all broke within the first day I wore them.
1.0,This outfit could be beautiful if you have a body like Megan Thee Stallion.  I'm 5'4 130pounds it was not for me. The pants were too long and the middle of the pants sag. The top was loose fitting and I have nice size breast. 36DD I ordered a size small and it definitely fit like a medium on me. So if you curves 😉 this outfit would fit you best.
1.0,So I was super excited to receive this bathing suit. The style and cut was so cute and it looked perfect for my &#34;mom bod&#34;. Yeah I was so wrong. The bathing suit arrived stuff in a plastic bag for start. Then once I tried it on the bottom fit perfectly but the breast area was sized for someone who wears an extra small. Like are you kidding me?! Who orders an XL and expects a B cup at best in the chest area. Definitely not me. Such a shame because the bottoms fit perfect and it was such a cute style but now i cant even wear it. Can't believe I wasted money on this bathing suit.
1.0,Size is incredibly inaccurate. Buy smaller than what your second guess was.
1.0,"Ordered a size up and it was still too small, so I don’t think these sizes are accurate. Unfortunately, a no go for us tall girls. 5’9, 155 pounds and it left me no room at all to move. Sadly returning, because it looked cute. Wish the sizes ran more accurate, because the XL should have fit."
1.0,Much smaller than the size. Cheap material
1.0,"Fair Indigo advertises this as pre-washed/shrunk, I don't see how that's possible.  I purchased this dress in all three colors, plus two knit tops and one sweater from Fair Indigo (and had planned to buy a lot more).  Today was the first time I've washed any of their items.  I washed the red dress and the black dress, in cold water, air dry, I lost 4&#34; in length and 4&#34; in width on each, and quite frankly, they look horrible.  They were a bit snug before, now they're 1-2 sizes smaller.  And of course I'm a few days past the return window.<br /><br />Edit: I contacted Fair Indigo and Amazon and a return is in process.  I am happy with how both companies responded.<br /><br />As for how the dresses fit before washing, I would say that if you're dithering between two sizes, get the larger size."
1.0,Wasn't able to wear. Didn't fit like a X-large
1.0,I doesn't stick in your skin.
1.0,This watch is designed for ppl with SMALL WRIST.... would not wrap around mine... correctly.... gave it to a coworker
1.0,"Sizes did not the garment. Amazon will not assist u on the return, u have to the post office fee to return to Canada. I just threw them in the thrash, not paying a high fee to return."
1.0,Plastic clear shield had defective snap on side. Had to return the product. Product is not as described. Much cheaper quality than anticipated. I do not recommend.
1.0,The material and the sleeve was too long
1.0,I wore the hoop earrings for maybe two weeks and now one stem that locks the earring broke completely off. It wasn't worth the money if l paid 5 dollars l would not be so upset but 16 plus tax is wrong l wish l kept the envelope that it came in so l could send it back.  Money wasted
1.0,"The band looks great and appeared like it would work, but the band end slid all the way through the watch without locking in place. I tried on three different Apple Watch versions: 3, SE, and Ultra with the same result."
1.0,it’s just ok
1.0,It fell apart after I wore it 2 days
1.0,Broke in less than 3 months! Not durable.
1.0,Mi wife Wore it once and the stitching on the side of one boot broke.<br />Don't waste your money
1.0,They are mis-represented!  Very cheap and can not get them to close on ears!!! BEWARE OF SELLER!!!
1.0,Ordered 3x and it says 3x but clearly looks like a medium. Way too small and too thin. Very cheap looking pants.
1.0,2-1/2 months of daily wear and the soles and toes are worn through. These are the shortest-lasting shoes we have bought.
1.0,My bad...did know it would show all my lumps and bumps...lol
1.0,Don’t buy this it was so loose straps very very funky I returned it
1.0,Didn’t get on ✖️ 4 a gift. O really is a postage issue. I would have loved them I’m sure
1.0,Would give zero stars if I could. It came to me broken.
1.0,"This is not at all what it looks like. It wouldn't even fit my 4 year old, it doesn't have arm holes, and it doesn't have the pink pom poms on the edges. Terrible. DO NOT ORDER."
1.0,"The color was nice but it was not what I expected. It had no shape to it. The hem line under the bust was off, it was normal in from and as it wrapped around my sides it dropped significantly to almost my lower back creating a bubble like bulge."
1.0,"The case is beautiful, but doesn't last. I had it for only two months before the hinge gave out, which was not due to overuse or abuse. It still looks almost new, unmarred inside and out. I wish I could return it, but the return window lasted for one month."
1.0,Too tight on shoulders and arms and also way too short... I always wear an XL that’s why I was shocked at how off the sizing was on this one. It also smelled like someone else’s nasty armpits. I’m guessing it was returned previously then sent to me. Absolutely unacceptable & disgusting.
1.0,"I do not understand how this dress got any good reviews. It is made out of what can only be described as raincoat material. Actually, more like the rain fly on a tent. It weighs three times what you'd expect from a dress. And it is wrinkled in quite the same way you'd imagine it would be wrinkled given that it is made out of raincoat/tent material. Also I'd never iron it, because I would assume it would melt. You know--because it is made out of a tent? Coupled with the fact that you cannot return it via USPS (and thus must drop it off at a UPS store which is annoying) makes me need to say: do not buy this. Seriously. It's a tent dress. Just don't."
1.0,"Supposed to be stainless steel but I'm allergic to them, turned my ears green and itchy. Waste of money. Too bad cuz they're cute"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:96c22a36ce9120bb9bc2c199de0bf532]]
1.0,Mother had it for a month never wore it and the gold faded
1.0,Gave these to my son for Christmas and they ripped less than a month later with little use. Not made very well.
1.0,Not bodycon unless you order 1 or 2 sizes down.
1.0,These are tiny.  Can’t even tell they are blue.  Very disappointed.  Returning.
1.0,Too small<br />Way too small
1.0,Looked super cheap.
1.0,"I received these they were damaged in shipping. I wasn't able to even wear them, also they are so small you can't even make out the dolphin! I'm very disappointed!"
1.0,"So pretty and cute and flattering tight sexy look BUT I hate the material it's like dense polyester so I may never wear them. I'm really into comfort vs cute, has to be both for me to give 5 stars"
1.0,These shorts showed up missing buttons I cant even wear them
1.0,It broke (snapped in the corner) when I put it on my phone.
1.0,Normally i wear M in all tops. Ordered a L and it was way too small. Im a 34c bra size.
1.0,Not only was the shipping cost outrageous to get it in a week-it broke when I put it on my daughters head as part of her costume for a dance competition. Garbage
1.0,This material is that super synthetic slick almost shiny stretch Compression fabric<br />I might had given them a chance if they didn’t run so small. I normally wear a xl-xxl and these fit like a medium . This material is not squat proof either.
1.0,"Runs very very small! Kid sizes, I can't use 🧐😦"
1.0,I ordered a 34 for my husband & got a size 42!<br />I'm thankful that I have a 6'1&#34; 260lb son who was able to fit them.
1.0,Ugly hat.
1.0,"Cheap trucker type hat, with sticker<br />Way to small for adult male<br />Ships from out of the country, manufacturer only wanted to credit me partial since they didn't want to pay to ship it back."
1.0,Very low quality!! So disappointed
1.0,I'm so disappointed! I was so excited about this top. It doesn't look anything like the picture. The fit is awkward.  It's really short in the front and back isn't nearly as long as in the picture. The seams on the side are crooked. One follows down your side while the other is half down your side and half over the side of my waist.<br />(I wear a size small but reviews recommended going up a size so I ordered a medium.)
1.0,It took many hours to charge the battery pack initially. The battery pack is relatively heavy. I bought this for my 97 frail father. The vest together with the battery is too heavy for him. The heated area is not that big. The most annoying point is that it kept turning off by itself.<br />Returning it.
1.0,After the first time I wore these the fingers came apart. Threw them away. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
1.0,Bought as a birthday gift to my daughter and she loved it….the only thing is that the moonstone fell off as soon as she put the ring on. The stone snapped back in but kept falling out….you get what you pay for I guess. I ended up returning the ring.
1.0,"Pants are way too Big with no tummy control, For the ones looking for that!! So if u have a little FUPA, It will look a Hot Mess!! And The Top is way Too small! Which means it DOESN'T FIT TRUE TO SIZE!!! And its that's shiny costume material! Very itchy! When i emailed them about it, They said ""just give the outfit to a family member,  I'm sure they will like it!! WOW!!!What a Joke! I'm dropping this trash off at my local UPS store right Now!"
1.0,DID NOT FIT AT ALL
1.0,Do not waste your money on this item. It is ugly and cheaply made. It does not look as pictured and will not look elegant in person.<br /><br />Cheap! You get what you pay for.
1.0,INSANELY SMALL buyer beware
1.0,I didn't like the items because of the size and how it fit. XL and 1X were too small.
1.0,"Very cute, great quality, but this is HUGE! I'm regularly a small, but I'd need an extra extra small for this dress. Super bummed bc I really liked it. I'm 5'6"", 132 lbs."
1.0,"So, I was looking for a bag that I could add to my spring wardrobe rotation. This bag almost fit the bill except for the cheap tube looking purse stap hastily tied inside the bag, and the purse fob that does not appear to match the purses hardware. The bags overall construction is really cute. The hardware's and purse strap are cheap and dont look like they are part of the bag at all.. now I'll have to see if I can find a cross body bag strap that matches the soft rose. Not pleased. I got this last year and have yet to wear it because of the unsightly strap. I dont recommend unless you're planning to rework what should already be finished."
1.0,I already sized it up but it was still too short. Too bad. Had to return it.
1.0,One of the magnets was weak and got weaker so it opened up very easily.<br />The handle should have been placed on the opposite side. So it stays closed securely.
1.0,"Not what I expected. A bit of a cone head shape, smelled. Not near big enough."
1.0,"I bought a size 9 and it was very small for a function to go, it wasn't what was advertise on line, I called Amazon the said they are giving me a $5 credit for the inconvenience and I don't see that on my account.  Not sure if am not looking properly"
1.0,not able to return
1.0,DO NOT BUY FROM THE SITE! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SAVE YOUR SELF FROM STRESS!! I ORDERED 10 DIFFERENT ITEMS FROM THIS SELLER ALLEGRA K AND NOTHING... I MEAN NONE OF THE ITEMS WERE GOOD. BADLY SEWN. I THREW EVERY ITEM AWAY. PLS PLS PLS SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!
1.0,My boyfriend for some reason wanted this watch. He seems to think it’s cool but he has a lot of actual expensive watches and although I didn’t expect much for 25 dollars. The box it came in was smooshed and I’m glad the watch wasn’t actually damaged. Then there was like lint all over the diamonds like someone wore it for like a few weeks and put it back. I picked it all off before giving it to him. What can I say. I’m sure you could get better nicer watches for 20 bucks at Walmart.update: left wrist green. What did you expect. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1.0,This shirt was ridiculously small!  Wasn't happy with the plastic design either not worth the money .
1.0,The curved part was too small
1.0,I had these in light tinted orange (no longer available) and I was in love. My hubby bent the frame and I got these but the lens seems to collect all the dust and oils apparently flying around my house. So I put my old lens on this frame
1.0,More of a cropped hoodie. Not your average normal length. Good Material and Gray color is more of a brown
1.0,Bought these for my father as a gift and they didn't even fit his feet. he fits a 9-10 and they did not feet. Im a women's size 7 and they fit snug on me. Very disappointed. Does look like the picture though. Didn't take any pics because I returned them as soon as I got them.
1.0,Not true to size and material quality wasn't good.
1.0,They are horribly small
1.0,"In description it states that the dress in flowy, super stretchy and a 4XL will fit a size 26-28. All of which is not correct. It had little to no stretch or flow and looked like a size 18-20."
1.0,To limited in adjustment. Uncomfortable on my head. Totally unhappy with the product.
1.0,"Oh no. This is just bad. The fabric feels awful and is truly hideous. It’s flimsy and scratchy and the print is ugly.<br /><br />This is a poor edition of the 80s revival. I couldn’t even find anyone who would take it for free. Maybe there is a elderly person with macular degeneration that would take it, except that it isn’t even soft.<br /><br />No."
1.0,"It's really cute but it's missing gems, I found 1 that fell inside the little baggie but there was 5 more missing. It looked odd when u wear them"
1.0,The cat piece broke off and we were left with just the chain.  Flimsy.
1.0,It was listed as a 2 pack. I only received 1.
1.0,"Originally, I LOVED this watch band! The print is super cute and I got several compliments on it when I wore it to Disney World.<br /><br />I have only been wearing the watch since the beginning of June. It’s only the middle of July, and the watch looks dirty and dingy because it has yellowed over time.<br /><br />I don’t wear make up or use chemicals around the watch and the closest I do has been a couple of pool side days with a 5 year old where I used sunscreen on both of us. Even before that day last week, I noticed the watch was showing yellowing and was no longer a white background.<br /><br />The colors haven’t faded on the floral or leopard print at all, so I’m sure the bit of sunscreen that might’ve gotten on it didn’t cause the yellowing either - although like I said, it was yellowing before last week’s adventures pool side."
1.0,Poor quality. Looks like a cheap costume piece.
1.0,not what i thought bad product
1.0,Did not fit the hat correctly sent it back not worth the money
1.0,"The men’s XL was actually a women’s 3XL.  The sowed in tag says 3XL, but the paper tag says XL, and the zipper is on the opposite side of normal men’s clothing."
1.0,POORLY SEWN/CONSTRUCTED. Very Small!  Thread hanging out all over. Very cheap looking. Disappointed now have to physically find another birthday gift in haste.
1.0,We've only had this scarf for 2 weeks.  It already doesn't work!  Very disappointed!!!
1.0,"The &#34;XL&#34; that chose is not represented when I received the item. I usually wear a &#34;Large&#34; but because it's an online purchase, I have it an allowance so that if it's too big, I can adjust it myself. Another this is that, the fabric is horrible. I hate it and would like to return it."
1.0,"Looks like painted on silver.<br />Stone fell out after 48 hours.<br />I wasn't expecting much for the price, but sheesh!"
1.0,Ordered two sizes up. Still did not fit. Did not return. Ended up throwing it away.
1.0,This strap is great for hanging your glasses around your neck but it doesn't hold your glasses on your face.
1.0,I can't even put them on. There made backward
1.0,This was lost in the mail for a while! It came today and it's nothing more than a mask. My glasses steam up like every other mask!!!
1.0,The alert bracelet is missing one of the most important things on it and I am very upset about it.
1.0,"Runs very small , and the flower which was “hot glued” fell off the first wear. Very disappointed. You should order a size up and sew on the flowers because this can be a choking hazard . Products should come in better quality though. Ridiculous"
1.0,Went right into the garbage. Terrible
1.0,Wanted this item for my daughter and was extremely disappointed when it arrived. Just going to throw it away.
1.0,Got the supposedly large sweater today and it’s so tiny. Also you can see where the iron faded the fabric. Don’t let me start with the fabric it’s so thin this couldn’t warm you up. Maybe it’s ment for the inside. But this is definitely super small and not a large. If your considering buying this don’t. It’s pure garbage. To top it off it’s for my step daughter it’s her Xmas present I’m so screwed.
1.0,The case is a cheap piece of rubbish. Not Cerruti.
1.0,One the the earrings is bent... so disappointed 😔
1.0,"Just started to use it and it broke apart in pieces, durability sucks big time. And of course the return window expired 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"
1.0,Looks very cheap and fake. Not like pictured.
1.0,Poor quality - shrunk up after the first wash and doesn't shrink up well.
1.0,Washed and did not dry and none of them fit! Very disappointed
1.0,was not what I thought.
1.0,Size is not true to fit.
1.0,Cheap.  Wristband is not for a man unless it's a tiny Asian man.
1.0,"This product is not as pictured! The front was fine but the back Aubie Logo coloring is off. It is only black and white and wouldn't look nearly as bad if the black and white where switch but definitely off and does not look like the photo represents. Pics attached. Undecided if I will keep. Also, I ordered a size L based off reviews and the large fits like a medium so definitely size up."
1.0,It fits like a stretchy TSHIRT.. I returned it
1.0,"Not satisfied at all with this product, only one sandal for $14. Shouldn't it be a pair??? TWO feet."
1.0,"Only part of lens that was clear was dead center.  So if you wanted to move your eyes side to side or up and down to see anything left/right above or below what was directly in front of your face, the glasses were useless.  While they were very light, they felt cheap."
1.0,See for yourself THIS is within a week. Need I say anymore. SOME of the $1 earrings I buy from the CORNER STORE last longer BEFORE they Changed.
1.0,I do not like that fact that it fell off my arm within several days of wearing it.
1.0,Good vest but took them way too long for my items arrived.
1.0,Front gems fell out constantly.  Lost 2 pair in 3 days.
1.0,"This is not made of sweatshirt material and is actually very thin. The color is way off, and more of a bright yellow. It’s fitting but also on the smaller side. I bought this as a gift and am very disappointed."
1.0,The long piece with the writing fell off after 2 days.
1.0,This product came broken.  The hinge part was open and the piece that connects to the charger fell off before I even put it on my wrist.  This product was heavy and would have been great if it was hinged properly.
1.0,Material is cheap and the dress is nothing like the seller has advertise waste of money
1.0,Bought for a wedding. They didnt stick during the test run kept lifting. D size boobs.
1.0,"I ordered a 5xl and it was really tight also the top part cut is really low not what is shown on the picture.  The bottome skirt cut just didn't fit my curvy body right. I ordered a dark maroon color and it's not what is shown on the pictures. Very disappointed,"
1.0,"As a nurse I am on my feet all the time, and decided to look into compression socks to wear to help lessen my leg fatigue. So I ordered a pair and when they arrived I was pleasantly surprised by how soft they were, and that they looked like regular socks. When I tried them on they went all the way up to my knees and felt great, but as soon as I started to move around the began to lose their grip and slid down my calves.  I saw that the same people had wide-calf compression stockings and when I went to return and exchange, they had no return policy what so ever. Terrible customer service, will not be buying thru them again. I feel like if you will be selling on amazon, there needs to be better customer consideration and a return policy should be available, especially if you are just going to exchange products."
1.0,"Pretty disappointed with this all around. Material is thinner than expected, the pumpkin looked like something you’d do at home with an iron, and the color was not even close to what was shown."
1.0,Wanted these for Valentine’s Day but did not wear them
1.0,suppose to be for lg calfs.. pfft
1.0,Terrible quality very short not good fabric and not flattering at all
1.0,El artículo no es la talla  que publican calidad del artículo mala
1.0,I dislike the fact that when it arrives it has a stain on it.
1.0,"I returned this. It is NOTHING like the picture or the pictures in the reviews. The fabric is less than tee-shirt thin, there are no thumb-holes and the garment was too small. I'm normally a size medium in tops and I ordered a large based on reviews. It still didn't drape like the photo and the arm length barely covered my wrists and was rather tight (and I have thin arms lol). One wash and this would probably have holes (that's how thin the fabric is!) and fit a 13-year-old! Very disappointed because I planned on wearing this to girls night out and couldn't."
1.0,"These are awful! They don't absorb much, stay wet on your skin and only last for a feeding or so depending on when you leak and let some milk out. I will not be repurchasing ! And it soaks thru the front part which its not supposed to do my tank top gets wet !! Not good at all."
1.0,"One sir sure fits horrible, so I will not buy this again."
1.0,"Cute, but tarnishes after the first use.  Would not recommend."
1.0,"Worst item I have ever purchased on Amazon.  Cheap looking and tarnished.  Amazon, you should remove this item given your usual high standards for quality."
1.0,This was broken
1.0,just terrible!
1.0,This watch was very small more like a childs watch. I have a very small wrist and it was way to tight even on my wrist. Had to return.
1.0,"Same issues with poor quality - had prescription lenses placed in frames, earpiece broke in less than a year.  Never ordering these again."
1.0,Disappointing product. Dollar store wallets are better. This arrived as a piece of felt that a kid cut out.
1.0,"It doesn't make me feel confortable, doesn't adjust to my body."
1.0,Horrible is all I can say. Very milky diamonds!!!
1.0,It say ‘Field Hockey’ in giant print on the front of the mask. The picture did not say that! Extremely disappointed.😩
1.0,I guess the photos of this mask on people may have been digitally altered or they had the world’s tiniest noses. The mask does not fit comfortably nor does it look “right”. My nose was squashed and looked distorted. Also masks have a plastic protective sheet on both sides that needs to be removed. The plastic sheet may stay in the mask after you have taken it off.
1.0,Horrible product. The description does not say this is made for a child / the skirt literally was made for an elementary school child and everything looked and felt super cheap. Went in the garbage!
1.0,Returned. Ran way to small in bust area.  I’m 115 and size c
1.0,My Sunglasses arrived today but they are broken. I was going to wear them for a party but now have to return them. Disappointed!
1.0,"Too big,doesn't look like the picture"
1.0,"I love this blouse but it's way too small.<br />It took forever to arrive because I think it comes directly from China, and I have ordered 2 sizes larger.<br />Hopefully this works.<br />It's very cute."
1.0,"Not as advertised. The picture sows no holes on one side of the band, just like the Apple bands, but there are holes on each side."
1.0,"Doesn't fit in the pandora bracelet, too big!! That's something that needs to be advertised because I bought for nothing 😒"
1.0,the clasp broke before the first time I even put it on
1.0,"Very small, doesn't hold much. I would never purchase from eBags again - beware of eBags &#34;very strict return policy&#34; even when unused."
1.0,"Beautiful but the battery needed to be replaced the first week, and the watch no longer keeps accurate time; it runs slow. I am returning it."
1.0,It said petite large. But these run even small. Don’t fit even a 13 yr old.
1.0,Cheap looking dress. Poorly made !!!!!
1.0,Bag overall is perfect size. However the coloring is off. Looks more like a deep gray. Not very satisfied.
1.0,"This look like they ve been worn , colour is not like picture look like cloun shoes"
1.0,"The leggings are not compressive or flattering, so they are not for working out. Once I decided to return, the seller started writing emails to me asking not to return. I had to pay for return label. I am curious if I will get a refund at all."
1.0,"Do not buy this bikini! It is completely see through, and when I tried to return it the only option available is to actually PAY for the return!!!!"
1.0,Does not fit well and not as shown in modeled picture
1.0,The quality of the fabric was ummmm interesting at best. Tissues are thicker.
1.0,Felt like I was wearing a potato sack
1.0,The medium is too big. The small is too small. Why are sizes 28-30 and 32-34? What about 30-32? That’s a huge size disparity. I have the same model swimsuit from 1 year ago I medium and it fits fine. This year’s medium is significantly larger than last year’s. Good luck if you are in between sizes- you may not find one that fits
1.0,Horribly cheap fabric that pilled after one wash
1.0,I only received one!  Incredibly frustrating! I understood that there was to be three and was a little surprised to only find one in my box!  Now I can't find how to get the other two that I paid for!
1.0,I want to return it but I can’t find the email to print and return.
1.0,Tele muy elástica y la talla demasiado grande
1.0,Very small - not like photo
1.0,"artículo de pésima calidad, no puedo estar más de dos horas con el tapabocas puesto, mis orejas están irritados, pésimo producto, pese a que es size L"
1.0,This is definitely NOT a sweatshirt. This isn't even sweatshirt material.
1.0,Belt buckle did not last a week. And they won't return my money.
1.0,Nothing like the picture. Do not look tye dye at ALL. They also are huge.
1.0,This are the worst socks I’ve ever tried. They don’t stay in place at all. Really really poor quality.
1.0,So small you can hardly tell its 2 bunnies or hardly read the words.  Not what I expected for a young girls necklace.  Waste of $$$..  Disappointed!!!
1.0,Don’t fit as expected
1.0,Broke first night
1.0,Width and arch are proper however not the correct flip flop in box.
1.0,"Every single pair of shorts has a defect.  The seams have come apart on every pair, one of them has a broken draw string, and loose thread all over them. These are not worth the money."
1.0,"Band does not stay tight, which is a shame because it is super cute.  After a few minutes of wearing it would be so loose it could slide off his hand."
1.0,After a month turns my finger green and rings looks horrible
1.0,These are not what i order the sent my some amazon jeans plain blue jeans and i ordered the Hale jeans brand. Thee jeans had no studs on the front or back of the jeans nor ripped at the end!! Complete false advertisement!!!! Do NOT buy these
1.0,Got 2 orders of 10. It was supposed to be 5 boys 5 girls total 10 boys 10 girls and I got 8 girls and 12 boys. Not good that was the reason I got 2 orders👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
1.0,Not a good looking mask.  Color was yellow.
1.0,These did not stay on my baby girl.  At 5m they are now a little tight for her to wear.
1.0,I ordered a women's size medium my usual size and they were so small that the actually fit my 8-year old.
1.0,"Nice boots but the calf size was as if it was made for a woman that is a plus size, too bad I really liked them but they had to be returned😯"
1.0,The skirt is extremely thin and runs small. Not worth the money.
1.0,"As I recall, the online specifications for the watch indicated a watchface diameter as 42 in, which I ignored. Had I realized that it was 42 mm, I would not have purchased it, as I have a relatively narrow wrist. I am currently in the processing of returning it.<br />I wanted the day/date feature because my life as a homebound retiree has very little structure. The size of the day and date display is miniscule, especially for such a large face."
1.0,"Maybe it's just me, and it won't be a problem for you, but it was WAY too big for my nose. It looked ridiculous."
1.0,"Top does not look anything like it does on the model. Its bigger than expected, the material is stretchy & not flattering AT ALL! Knot on the side looks terrible. I didn't even try it on. When I pulled it out from the package I was immediately disappointed. I am returning this top."
1.0,I don’t even know what to say. My package came covered in someone else’s hair. I was too weirded out to try it on.
1.0,It is stamped 925 silver so that's good. But underneath the stamp it also says china meaning it probably cost nothing to have made. At least its shiny.<br /><br />UPDATE: Pieces started falling off. Going to return. Not worth the money. Going to return and buy from different company.
1.0,These are not stainless steel or hypoallergenic- do NOT buy these. It was more of a hassle to return them.
1.0,The metal peace on the belt broke off it’s not made very good faulty design it’s not easy to tighten up on your waste I ordered 2 of them I think I will be sending them back I don’t recommend wasting your money on this belt not worth it maybe try a different brand this one is not worth the money
1.0,"Unpleasant, thick knitted fabric. Poor quality seams & decorations. Quality not up to par."
1.0,If the glass face was not shattered I'd love it.  I requested a replacement.  I hope they don't give me trouble.
1.0,Not to true to size at all. This XL could not fit my six year old granddaughter. Will not order from this company again.
1.0,Loved the shirt but the seams came apart with the second wash.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"The item arrived quickly, BUT...stones fell out of it just after the return date.  I think they should last a bit longer than a month, personally."
1.0,The fabric looks different in the photo. And the color said its golden but I received an orange one. SMH.
1.0,She didn't get to wear it once.  Washed it and all the print is falling off
1.0,There was a hole in the inflatable horse!<br />Garbage
1.0,"I bought this shirt because it was a nice looking shirt for under $10. Unfortunately, I sent it on it's way back shortly after I received it. I didn't mind that the material was really thin. But the fit was horrible. I ordered an XL but it fit like a medium. And the material was stretchy and clingy. It was just horrible. It just clung to my body and was not attractive at all! I've ordered several tee shirts in the last few months from Amazon and they all fit perfectly. Not the case with this one."
1.0,The color was burgundy not red as it is shown in the picture
1.0,The tshirts was good but too small.
1.0,This clothing is made with stolen art work. Do not buy. They stealing from a starving AMERICAN artist. Why are they doing this? Because the are thriving scum.
1.0,It was supposed to be red but came hot pink. Not a huge deal but it’s really short. The width of the tank fits but not the length. I don’t foresee myself wearing this frequently or ever.
1.0,These have got to be fake. They don’t say made in the USA. The pair on the right were bought in an Oakley store in person. The pair on the left are these from this purchase. They feel cheap and really tight.
1.0,Se me deslizan como si fueran pequeños y pedí mi tamaño usual
1.0,The denim was too rigid
1.0,No way a ford authorize product.<br /><br />Looks like a t-shirt you would get at a beach shop
1.0,"Very pretty, but very delicate and fragile. The bracelet broke before I had a chance to wear it."
1.0,"I took a risk on this because I wanted a jean skirt like this one, quickly before a trip to New Orleans. It was TINY, I normally wear a 10-12 and ordered the XL. There was no way I could even button it. Like other reviewers have noted, the hemline was off and it wasn't wearable even if it were to fit. The quality of this items seems very low."
1.0,The label in the pants had one size printed on them then there was a sticker placed over the label with a different size .
1.0,Too small for a 6 year old and the insert is bigger than the mask.
1.0,"Esto se parece más a un disfraz de Halloween , de una tienda barata.<br />Mala calidad y malas costuras .<br />Color distinto , tiende a ser más rojo naranja"
1.0,"I normally wear a size 13 or in some athletic shoes 14. The largest size in this boot is a 14 and it’s too small. The inserts are also crammed inside and all bunched up, but even removing them it’s still too small with even moderately thick mid weight winter socks. I’m not some giant guy I’m 6’1, don’t have wide feet."
1.0,"Nice jacket and a good price BUT the zipper is on the wrong side, like a woman’s zipper. Uncomfortable. After 71 years of zipping up right handed, I have to learn all over again."
1.0,It was made for a toy doll... ridiculously small.
1.0,"The headband is very pretty, but it is all metal.  My 4 1/2 yr granddaughter loves the look of it, but it hurts too much to keep it on more than 15-20 seconds.  She is very disappointed because she so much wants to wear it.  I would not recommend this for a small child"
1.0,this product was broken when i opened it. there was no return information or paper in the packaging. it doesn't matter to me if i spend 3 dollars or 100.00 i should receive the product i paid for in good condition not garbage. DONT BUY THESE PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!
1.0,I never review items but. This item fell apart after a few months. I have barely left the house this year so I am pretty sure it was light usage. This is basically junk stay away.
1.0,Looks like a woman’s wallet instead of men’s checkbook
1.0,"Company did not send me size requested, and they didn't have the scrunch butt, they are not the tik tok leggings they claim to be! So disappointed!"
1.0,The waist band sits right in the middle of my boobs. It has no shape.
1.0,"This belly chain fell apart within weeks of purchase.  I only wore it a few times before the chain just snapped.  Flimsy, low quality product.  If it had only cost a couple of bucks, no big deal.  But with a $16 price tag, I expected much higher quality."
1.0,"Did not like these, I prefer a wider band at the to and the breath ability was poor."
1.0,"This dress was terrible. Very cheap material, extremely short. Looks nothing like what the model is wearing"
1.0,Not true to size AT ALL. I am 4’11 and 170 lbs. I wear a size 10/12. I purchased an XL and I couldn’t get one thigh in this shaper. My normal size for panties and girdles is an XL. The material does not stretch an inch and it’s very thin. Do not purchase unless you’re a size  1 and under
1.0,"A lovely purse, but the smell of plastic was overwhelming when I removed the purse from the plastic bag.  Sorry, Amazon, I know the smell of leather, and this is not it.  I thought the price was too good to be true.  It's a knock off.  Going back."
1.0,"Cheaply made, not worth a nickel"
1.0,only a child could wear this hat.
1.0,"The gauge really big. It said it was 14g, but is was much larger than that! Very bummed"
1.0,I had to return this term. I’m normally a small but ordered a medium just in case. The material was very thin. I’m 5’4 & 158lbs.
1.0,"This dress is not as shown. First, the fabric is a cheap silk-like fabric but not silk, and is not weighted. The actual fabric is so light that it doesn't compliment a figure at all. The length is about 6 inches shorter than the image, meeting me mid-calf instead of sweeping the floor. The zipper is poorly made and catches, the cut out side is elastic, so it bunches up and hikes the skirt length even more. The neckline is also elastic and baggy. This was not cut to fit any woman's body. It's baggy in the chest and torso area as well. I gave it 2 stars bc at least its the advertised color."
1.0,Pin fell apart for no reason  on day 3... unable to find the pieces in field... don't think I will trust it to keep iwatch safe
1.0,It was great at first but the band just wodent come of I had to spend 1 hour trying to get the dam thing of
1.0,"It's nice looking and well designed. The waterproofing is great, especially considering the price Sadly, it stopped telling time after about a month of normal use."
1.0,The material is great but the stitching on my order was horrible. Ripped on one of my the thighs on the first use.
1.0,Not worth your money. Ive had them for not even 3 days and the crystal already fell out of 2 pairs. I bought 5. Save yourself and buy something better. Also bend very easily. Ive had 2$ earrings better than these.
1.0,We received the wrong glasses.  They were purchased as a gift so were not returned.
1.0,I dropped it and the diamond insert cracked in half
1.0,I’m dissatisfied with this Jewlery I thought it would have industrial bars included. So I had to buy them separate
1.0,"Do not buy. It does nothing for anyone, even if you have small boobs. I am a full D cup and purchase the D cup ones and they are horrible."
1.0,It is too big. Cannot be adjusted. Totally a waste of money.
1.0,They are see through.  More like tights
1.0,"Do not buy this dress. It's absolutely awful not cute like the picture says, and it looks like a funeral dress. The worst part is though the terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible material"
1.0,Dress is gorgeous but the back is not suitable for anyone other then a slim figure. It fit everywhere but I couldn’t fasten the back properly as it was too small.
1.0,"These are TIGHT. I can normally comfortably wear a 2XL workout legging, sometimes even an XL, but these barely fit on my body, popped seams around the crotch almost immediately, and kept folding down during my workout. I’m not sure if they were meant to be tight as part of the design, but I know that I won’t be purchasing another pair."
1.0,Too small for the size given.
1.0,Disappointing. Beads were goldtone not silver. Threading was extremely thin. No polishing cloth...which is probably just fine because it's doubtful that the goldtone was dipped over 925 Sterling.
1.0,They are so small I cant even wear . how can I return them?
1.0,"This is probably the ugliest shirt I have ever received. It's not tie dyed, its a print, it's way too small, the material is like spandex and it looks nothing like the picture, to say I'm disappointed would be an understatement"
1.0,"I ordered these in an x large and the label indicated that was the size I received.  However, these were sized more like a medium.  I couldn't barely squeeze them on over my hips.<br /><br />On top of the incorrect sizing, the fabric was much stiffer and scratchier than I would have expected based on the loose and flowy look in the product picture.<br /><br />These were a big nope for me.  I would spend my money elsewhere."
1.0,"I didn't even try this top on. I took one look at the color and the quality of the print and knew it was a return. The colors are much brighter instead of the traditional red, white, and blue. And the print looks cheap and not like the pictures. The material of the top feels as if it could be comfortable, but I do not recommend the stars and stripes design at all!"
1.0,Fits for a child.
1.0,5xl fit like a Large
1.0,It was cheap it broke on the 2nd day I had it .. cute item thoe
1.0,Grand daughter in law ordered - apparently not what she expected.
1.0,It looks beautiful but i am disappointed that it breaks after one month.
1.0,Fits two sizes too small
1.0,My son say's they are not blue but purple and they are smaller then they say. Not good at all.
1.0,I purchased two sets of slippers as gifts.  Both pairs came severely deformed. Very poor packaging which is just a bag and slippers were just stuffed inside. They have this awkward bending that have made them very uncomfortable to wear. Returning these.
1.0,"I really wanted to love this piece because I’m all for organic cotton clothes.<br />I also already had other Prancing Leopard pieces and really loved them.<br /><br />The material is very soft that’s for sure and comfortable to wear.<br />But unfortunatelly this jumpsuit is not a win.<br />The sewing comes appart on the waist elastic and the one on the legs is not straight ....<br />On the one I received, the sewing on the left side starts on the side of the hip and when coming down ends up ... at the front of my ankle ...<br />For the pretty expansive price I expected better quality."
1.0,"wold not purchase again, leverback smaller than average and uncomfortable, also picture deceptive, earrings smaller than pictured"
1.0,Not a good quantity shirt
1.0,I received this necklace broken to pieces
1.0,Came in package broken! What a waste of money!
1.0,Straps need to be another 3 -5 cm in length to be workable with boots.
1.0,Straps are way to stretchy and there is no support.  Would not purchase again.
1.0,Item not true to size
1.0,This is made out of the cheapest material I have ever seen! Granted it only cost like $14 buy this is cheap. But I am keeping it only because I like the saying on it so not sending it back.
1.0,This was no where near the size of a Google Pixel.
1.0,Item runs extremely small. The XL is more like a regular medium. Also arrived with a crusty brown stain on the shoulder of a white shirt.
1.0,Super cute dress however it was my size and  looked like it was going to fit just fine(actually big) I could not get my arms in the sleeves.
1.0,Very uncomfortable and too much material around my neck. Wasn't impressed with the material. I'll never wear it so I will give it away
1.0,"A bit disapointed in this tool. Some of the charms are very difficult to link on to the bracelet, and not sure exactly how this tool helps. i find a large paper clip works better. Maybe some kind of instructions might be helpful to the users. Even a index card size would be helpful. i wouldn't waste you money."
1.0,not Silver very small
1.0,These we’re comfortable but the waist band was very loose and doesn’t stay up.
1.0,the lights button broke n my grandson has already worn them today.  I received this item yesterday.  I will put a stop payment on amex...
1.0,"The cut of these shirts is not a slim/athletic fit as advertised. There is no taper in the torso, and to get sleeves that fit your arms you would have to get a size larger then what you would normally wear, but then have a baggy torso."
1.0,This is definitely not a unisex jacket. The sizing is off so you better order up at least 3 to 4 sizes. The cut of this jacket is definitely for a woman. It is VERY cheaply made and most definitely not worth the money be ware DO NOT BUY THIS!!
1.0,Even using bigger size it gets my shoulders entangled in such a manner that it is hard to just lift one arm...
1.0,Upset that I'm missing some of them
1.0,Don't waste ur money I just got this bracelet it is very small did not even fit my wrist and I have small wrist...and it looks and feels like something you get for 99cents for little kids
1.0,"I ordered the one with the male on it and received the female necklace. It was supposed to be a present for a boy, so I was unable to use it."
1.0,"Band looks nice, but would frequently become detached from Fitbit"
1.0,"I generally wear a medium but ordered a small due to other comments. The small was a right choice. It fits perfectly throughout the body, but uncomfortably tight at wrists and ankles. The fabric is as thick as a heavy sweat shirt."
1.0,There is no way they are for 2 to 4 years old<br />They would fit a 9 year old
1.0,"I saw the wordmark in other photos but ordered anyway because I felt like you wouldn't see it once they were on.<br />The way you out them on puts the ""Ukes"" on the inside, facing the neck - except the way it lays on me, you can totally see it, and it's tacky.<br />I am in the process of returning all three that I purchased. Maybe once they create an actual logo and make it smaller I can purchase these again, but for now I'll have to go with Pilotfish (even though they have far less variety)."
1.0,Sizing is way off.  I normally wear a L but I like my vests to be big so I ordered an XXL.  Let’s just say it wasn’t A pretty sight.  It looked like it was made to fit a child.  It was more crop too  Very disappointed
1.0,"It's less than one star, but I'm being forced to pick a star.  I was so excited to get a new leather murse, OMG IT SMELLS AWFUL, I've sprayed Febrese two different times and nothing.  I'm going to throw it away.  I hope I don't get arrested for illegal toxic dumping.  How could something smell so bad?"
1.0,Smelled moldy
1.0,"I was disappointed in these sunglasses because they were not the color I ordered. They aren't orange, they are red."
1.0,If I could give this zero stars I would.  The string is frayed at the crucifix and they are just ugly.  I bought these as a gift for my husband and will be returning them.  There was a tag on them that said &quot;Fashion Jewelry&quot;  Really???  Pretty inappropriate.  A Rosary is NOT &quot;fashion jewelry&quot; !  I cut off the tag and went so far as to wrap them but after further consideration  decided I am not so  desperate that I would give a gift to anyone that I think is just awful.  The offensive tag didn't help.
1.0,Wish I could rate this Zero stars. When item arrived it looked just like the image above. I wore mine for maybe 3 or 4 days before the color started to fade and I had to take it off.
1.0,Awful! It is nothing like what is advertised. The material is very cheap. There’s cheaply designed lace which takes away from the lock. The other material is cheap. The zipper had a defect and could not be repair for the material was so poor that further damage would have occurred. Size incorrect.
1.0,The bracelet looks more the green & does not match the picture as the picture looks way greener
1.0,Way too loose. Looks like it’s a maternity swimsuit
1.0,"El agarre es de plástico muy delgado, y se quiebra facilmente"
1.0,Poorly made<br />Not useable
1.0,Clasp broke on the 2nd wear.
1.0,"My bad, I ordered a size too big n I cant bother to return it"
1.0,"Las bandas no son compatibles con el reloj Samsung Galaxy active 2, las compré y son las anchas que el reloj, no le quedan. El vendedor no me ha dado respuesta y borró el producto por mi comentario y lo volvió a subir después. Es una estafa."
1.0,as soon as he got it buttons fell off and had to be real sod back on and a strap on the coat sleeve very disappointed
1.0,"This hat arrived with the logo patch glued on...not sewn on.  More importantly the logo patch was almost falling off...the adhesive they used was failing miserably...with just a light &#34;tug&#34; on the logo patch, it came off in my hand!  Although the hat fit on my head...the whole hat seemed to fit somewhat strange...almost as if it was sized for a young boy.  The only reason I did not return this hat is that I bought a new regular plain black hat locally, and had the logo patch sewn on!!!  Nice patch...terrible hat!!!"
1.0,Will not buy again
1.0,I got this for my 5 yo daughter and the shoes are tiny. They would even have fit her when she was two. Very disappointed. This shouldn’t be advertised up to 6 yo.
1.0,"I wore these things for like 2 like seconds and they immediately started to fog. The suction was great, but didnt fit to my head, especially around my nose."
1.0,I overpaid for these. They are soft silicone and nothing like the original nose pads on my Oakley glasses except for the size. The silicone is so soft that it doesn’t stay put in the clip for more than a few days at a time.
1.0,Looks like a kitchen towel
1.0,"Tried using this last night in class & on the first down dog, it was slipping off my feet & I could not do the pose correctly. I was trying not to slip with the socks on. Therefore, I completely took them off so I can continue doing yoga poses comfortably. These socks are definitely NOT good for yoga exercise. It may however be great for Pilates machine workout or just walking around the house on wood floor or tiles."
1.0,"Cute in theory - but horrible in real life. It is see through... So you've been warned. I was thinking I could just use it as a swim cover up - but the strap broke. Ugh. Plus - this must be made in China, because it is cut small. On a positive note, it's a pretty pattern. 😒"
1.0,"If you have sensitive ears, don't buy these! Made my ears swell up horribly. And also discolor fast."
1.0,The quality is aweful.  It was see through and  very much drapey.  Too much of a pain to return.
1.0,Hinge on the one came broken.
1.0,Shrunk to tiny would not recommend.
1.0,"The sweater was cheap made, and really bad fabric. Really ugly!"
1.0,"The strap is crap! It opened up and the watch crashed onto the concrete, breaking the charging port glass! Now I have to pay to get it fixed. I am not happy and am obviously returning the band!"
1.0,There's a big pucker where one of the back seams meets up with the elastic waistband. The extra material from this pucker digs into my skin and it's extremely uncomfortable.
1.0,I couldn’t even figure out how to wear this dress out of the house. It was like a robe. Also the color was not the red it seems in the picture. More like a faded dark pink. Disappointed in this product.
1.0,These are garbage.  They don't fit my 5 year old's glasses.  Tried to return but missed the window.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,"The magnification is ridiculous,  it's suppose to be a transitional lense but in stead is blurry for close reading and for far viewing,  not worth the effort."
1.0,The item arrived with red ink marks on the back of the item.<br /><br />Disappointed
1.0,I didn’t like the material and the stitching at the seem of the crack was done horribly. I packed it up and sent it back.
1.0,"They don't have that compression fit like the tommy copper fit, they just feel like regular tights which now I hated I spent my money on them😢😢"
1.0,This ripped before I even had a chance to wear it. I was trying it on and all of a sudden a huge tear appeared in the back of it. It looked nice so it's too bad it was of such poor quality. I'll be avoiding this brand in the future.
1.0,The on/off never worked.<br />I had to return it.
1.0,"The product is clearly described as ""One size fits all"" and ""for all shapes and sizes"" on its Amazon page. It's not. It's child sized. Painfully tight on the person I wanted to gift it to, and I couldn't fit it on me at all."
1.0,"I wear a 10.5, so I ordered the 10-11.  They were too small and had to return."
1.0,"No es el color, la tela horrible un robo 😡"
1.0,"cheaply made, belt loop feel off as soon as I tried to run belt thru it. wouldn't buy again, and not for the price I had to pay."
1.0,It doesn't fit on my gear S2
1.0,Fraud
1.0,I like  the bracelet a lot but they broke my skin out had to sent them back.
1.0,Was not good the zipper would not work
1.0,Poorly made looks like a Halloween costume. Cannot wear in public.
1.0,"I didn't expect top shelf product for this price, but I hoped they would last longer than a few days. They are cute and shiny, so the small kids will like them, and they are ok to throw in a goodie bags for kid's party. 4 of them came with the key chain ring broken off. The sequins easily fall out and are not easy to reverse. It's not like the sequin pillows, where the sequins flip easily back and forth. Some of the pieces don't want to reverse at all."
1.0,"The filigree was nowhere near as fine as depicted. There also was no velvet bag, so it makes me think I got a knock off."
1.0,"I should have listened to the others who mentioned how terrible the fabric was.  I liked the style and it fit great, but yikes, it did'nt feel good at all.  I would buy it again if they changed the fabric because it was well made."
1.0,"I looked twice to see if there was a nose adjustment bar. The description said there was...there wasn't. They don't fit the face snugly; these masks protect no one. They are useless, and ill fitting, and they cost way too much. I am not at all happy. There is no slip accompanying these mask so no returning them. I am out $21.00"
1.0,"I know these are all natural but there are a lot of imperfections in these.  I would have returned them if I could but they were purchased ahead of time as a Christmas gift and by the time they were opened, it was too late.  Disappointed in the quality...."
1.0,Did not fit my watch slots
1.0,I purchased these as a Christmas gift for a 9 year old average sized boy. I got size 10 and they are too small length wise. I am very upset that I purchased the correct size and these run small a complete waste of my money since I can no longer return.
1.0,I’m not sure how they expect you to fit your head in the neck hole I literally had to cut it to put it on the first time I wore it. Don’t recommend
1.0,3 xl not even a xl ! won't buy ever !!!!
1.0,made for a small frame man. Cheaply made
1.0,First time I went to use it it fell apart
1.0,Hated the color..was supposed to be tan was more like a dingy purple color. It smelled moldy. And the material was awful.
1.0,The band broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,"After only wearing a few times, one of the Onyx inlays fell out."
1.0,Nothing heavy about this item
1.0,Started to fall apart in less than 3 hours of wearing the around the house!! Very disappointing
1.0,Broke after one wear.
1.0,Had problem with this item
1.0,Revived them wore them once and the seams came loose so they have holes in them
1.0,"Material is cheap and not the same as image, very thin material"
1.0,"I was very excited to receive but they are totally not as described. They are the too,too small. I would describe them as a swimming cap material and fit. Very unhappy."
1.0,"Expensive for several miniscule flimsy plastic pieces that tore apart.  They split open going over the earring posts.  I only managed to fit one of my earrings with a sleeve in one ear and it was uncomfortable.  Also, the sleeve doesn't let the earring sit flush with the ear so the earring ends up drooping downward.  Only the metal post will fit into the plastic backing, the plastic sleeve will not.  It's difficult to trim and test the backing fit without splitting the sleeve.<br /><br />I was hopeful in spite of the same warnings from other customers.  Didn't work."
1.0,Bow to small
1.0,I only received one piece with this. I cannot use it at all. The hair keep falling out. I even try to do my sister hair and it still doesn't work. I watched a few youtube video to know the instructions but still have to give up on using it.
1.0,"Loved for the few days they worked only one lights up now, still waiting for refund,,, so I’m being nice by changing it to 1 star instead of 2"
1.0,This was a decent sweater. The washing suggestion was cold water gentle cycle which we did. The navy color in it spread all over the sweater. Ut is completely ruined.
1.0,Only received the outer shell. The description states it comes with the inner jacket as well. I like the quality of the outer shell. Just wish it would have come with both pieces.
1.0,I didn’t like this fabric at all! Still wrinkly after steaming!
1.0,"The bracelet was already broken when it arrive, and i dont know how to get in touch with the saler."
1.0,Fell apart after wearing for leas than 29 minutes. The dangling part is just glued in.
1.0,This purchase arrived broken twice. Plastic is inferior quality.
1.0,"I know the ring isn't thousands and much shouldn't be expected of quality however I did expect more than my gf to get more than 2 days off wear out of it. I contacted Amazon, who swiftly sent me a replacement with no problem, however the second ring received only lasted about 4 more days than the first. You get what you pay for and honestly this was just a temp ring anyway for us so it wasn't a huge deal. But if you plan on long term wear please spare yourself the hassle and don't waste your money. It's a gorgeous ring, which is the shame of it."
1.0,"I ordered a pair of these sunglasses a year ago and absolutely loved them. I ordered a second pair and am completely disappointed. Within the first day the lenses popped out. I popped it back in but now both lenses have repeatedly popped out and one is lost (assuming it fell out somewhere). Very disappointed with these as the first pair was great, and the second pair were clearly very cheaply made."
1.0,This is paper thin. Not gift worthy at all! There should have been some kind of description.
1.0,"These slippers are horrible. Even though they’re cheap in price it’s still not worth it! I’m going to invest in a more expensive pair on Amazon. These fit weird, little to no fluff right from the get go which made my foot slide around like crazy while walking. I have to wear socks with them every time! Literally after one week of wearing them they are falling apart. The rubber sole is becoming detached from the slipper. All I do is where them in the house while I sit at my computer and work. Don’t buy!!!!"
1.0,"The actual dress is different fabric, no shine, very casual. Not like Amazon picture at all"
1.0,Cute in the picture. I have no idea how you could wear it out. The slit started almost at my waist!
1.0,"so i purchased  PAIR OF  'crocks"" for my 10 month old niece.  these shoes are big enoug for a 10 yr old not a 10 month old they say size 18.o on the bottom and the form says 10 month old.  not sure what 10 month old wears this large of a shoe"
1.0,"ZERO STARS!!! Ordered this on may 11th 2020... here we are August 1st and still no keychain! ***BUYERS BEWARE*** THIS IS FROM CHINA AND THEY ARE SCAMMING FOR MONEY! If you don't consistently email them, they'll figure you forgot and keep your money."
1.0,"Should have paid more attention to reviews.  I purchased a pair for myself and for my daughter in California and received mine one day prior and she received hers yesterday and both have broken clasps. I would have overlooked mine but to have her tell me that hers were also broken in another state really pissed me off. Now she has to pay to have them shipped back and so do I and the cost is $4.98 for me, no telling what it is for her.<br /><br />So much for me surprising her with a gift just because at her office."
1.0,It says it’s free returns but I bought it and even with deodorant and taking a shower when you put it on it starts to smell after about five minutes. I reported this to the seller and they won’t let me return it there just saying they’ll refund me half the price. So faults advertising fax and I don’t recommend the shirt the quality of the fabric is cheap
1.0,Not as prescribed
1.0,My watch stopped working after 3 months and I have no idea who to return it to. Please help!!!!!
1.0,Pretty but I returned. Too long and too big to replace my current nose ring.
1.0,Bad choice.
1.0,"This is a petite L, the pants went up to my shoulders, the waist was way too small and impossibly tight elastic, and the pants themselves could have fit three people in below the waistband.  Horrible!"
1.0,arrived in a different color than I ordered. thought it would be something cute to stay warm in. nope the jacket runs small its super thin. kinda reminds me of 1980 track suits but without the swush noise they made.
1.0,Cheap better to spend the money and get wood ones.
1.0,They were WAY to big!!!! Definitely not your standard size!
1.0,The earrings are low quality and are not hypoallergenic.
1.0,Overall awkward fit. Thin. Felt cheap.
1.0,"I got this for my fiancé, turns out, it was youth sized.  So my son got it instead."
1.0,"SO MISSHAPED! I am so disappointed in how this worked out. The skirt material is cheap and crinkly, it really short and just doesn’t look right when you put it on. Buyer be ware"
1.0,The stitching on all the caps broke. Maybe mine we're defective. Won't be buying from here again!
1.0,"top did not fit well for larger chested women, however, the real issue is with the return. it says Free Returns but this is not the case. you have to contact the company and pay for your return shipment so you end up losing 1/2 the money OR they refund you half the money and you can keep the suit (that doesn't fit). the quality of the suit and everything is fine, not great, but fine. mostly, i think it's deceiving to say this is a free return when it's actually not."
1.0,"Beautiful hoops.  Every pair was lovely.  The only problem is the metal is quite fragile and you only get to wear a pair about 4 times, then the metal breaks.  I am so sad."
1.0,"Fabric is too thin and clingy, returned"
1.0,Failure after just 5 charges...<br />Quality poor.<br />Given this high orice...not good as a stand alone jacket!!!!
1.0,Way to long for someone who is 5’2
1.0,was misled to buy this as it was advertised and placed under solar watch category.  will not visit this website anymore.
1.0,"My earrings are nothing like the ones displayed online. The diamond part is round instead of squared off,  the back part is more of a goldish color than  chocolate brown and they're scuffed"
1.0,I used to own the same hat in the picture. The hat and the skateboard were both light forest green. I lost the hat and wanted to replace it. This one is dark green with a black skateboard. Not what is pictured.
1.0,Broken and two different colors
1.0,One had sewing not even finished so unless I wanted a hole by side of my crotch these were just horrible made. The others were deformed and fit horribly. Some didn’t even go to the top of my butt cheeks and others just deformed in other ways. I wouldn’t suggest anyone to buy these.
1.0,cutes off circulation on your feet.
1.0,"Shirt fit support small. I didn't have time to send them back until today, but unfortunately they wouldn't take it back due to return date was closed on March 4th. Now I am stuck with two shirts that do not fit my kids even though I order the right size they usually wear. Shirt just runs super small."
1.0,They are a weird shape on head
1.0,Not what I expected. Big hole in the waistline. I will return this for a full return.
1.0,"Dont like iT at all, offers No protection, price was right but wouldnt buy iT again"
1.0,"SO DISAPPOINTED. I literally JUST pulled the bathing suit out of the bag and first thing I notice is the top seems so incredibly flimsy and seems to offer no support whatsoever, just hangs like a too-big t-shirt. Put it on and the strap breaks, like the plastic hook holding the pieces together is practically made of rubber, not to mention the actual rubber inside the strap pulled apart like a knife cutting into butter. I didn't even pull it, just simply slipped it over my head and POP. Its a shame because the bottoms are actually kinda cute and decently flattering. Will definitely be returning."
1.0,I ordered this sweater for myself in my usual size (xl) and it is TINY. I had to give it to my 11 year old daughter. Disappointed. Pretty color but shorter than the picture.
1.0,"I ordered all four of the colors, all of which were great except for the white ones. I have ordered the white boots five times, and each time they have arrived used, damaged, or with faulty construction. I really liked the first three pairs of boots. I ordered all of the other color, and wanted to complete the array of colors with the white boots. But my experience in trying to order a pair of the white boots has been frustrating. I attempted to contact the company several times to see if they would try to address the problem, but I was just told each time to wait until more boots became available on Amazon's website, and to reorder them again after returning the pair I had. After doing this 4 times, and now the 5th pair is also a problem, I will have to give these boots a one star rating; which is too bad because they are really nice boots if you can actually get a pair that is made properly and is not used or damaged in delivery. The company does not seem to care about their boots arriving in good condition, or the trouble customers go through when they arrive defective. So it's really a roll of the dice."
1.0,Couldnt get it on
1.0,Not as advertised. Measurements we incorrect.
1.0,watch did not make it through January and was a Christmas gift. I wish I spent more money on a better quality watch
1.0,Loved this skirt in the picture… hated it on. I returned it.

1.0,Just was no true to size
1.0,The latches broke when I tried to put on my Fitbit
1.0,"These earrings was big, flimsy, and poorly put together. Do not buy or waste your money on them."
1.0,"These sunglasses feel like the frames are made of tin. Literally, tin cut from something the thickness of a soda can. They are definitely light, that's the positive. Other than that, you can find glasses at this price or half the price that will last you years instead of a day if you're lucky, maybe a few. I would look elsewhere."
1.0,This looks absolutely nothing like what was presented.  No sequins it’s a bunch of BS!  Do not order from this seller!  No stars here!  Ordered March 13 and received July 10.
1.0,I ordered this dress in small and mustard yellow. I was going to use for our thanksgiving party.. I was excited to get it but to my horror I got a large blue top that is made of felt.. 😒😔😢😬<br />So yeah I am not a very happy camper right now.. should've just gone to tjmaxx.. for $29.99 I could've gotten something I wanted.
1.0,Didn't fit my glasses well and broke.  It went into the trash.
1.0,Dress is cut kind of strange.. fit was not flattering on me. Returned.
1.0,Fit more like a dress
1.0,"Very disappointed because I was looking forward to wearing this. The material was cheap, thin, and see-through. The top v-neck portion of the dress did not fit right and was drooping. It also took longer to arrive than it was supposed to. I’m returning. They also make you pay for shipping to return, so think about that before you purchase this."
1.0,We were very disappointed.  The dress did not look like the photo and the material was of poor quality.  Also the company's customer service was not professional in the email.  The tone of the email was disrespectful.
1.0,Bands broke after not even 2 weeks of getting them. Extremely disappointed.
1.0,Material was very poor and it had stains on it!!!
1.0,Button fell off after 1 day
1.0,The color is gorgeous but the fabric is stiff and felt like I was wearing a burlap sack - returning.

1.0,its fake leather
1.0,Never got to use this because it broke as soon as I tried to put in on my daughter. Very poor quality.
1.0,Volcro picks at back of neck
1.0,Very thin & cheaply made. They became pajama pants immediately
1.0,"didn't like the fabric, or the color"
1.0,I’m returning the item for a credit.  The quality is not as expected.
1.0,Garbage. Bra did not stay in place during gentle Wash.
1.0,Material is nothing close to what's shown in the picture. It's too thin almost like a slip. Not satisfied
1.0,Skin tone is almost orange. terrible image quality
1.0,The product looks nothing like the picture and the red stripes that you see in their picture are actually neon pink. I am not impressed with this shirt and it runs very small!!
1.0,Nope don’t get they are like paper
1.0,Didn’t come with the fabric/material to put over head and wear as a apron
1.0,"Material sucks, very baggy (not slim fit) had difficulty with zipper"
1.0,Not for colored people but whatever.
1.0,They look nothing like the picture and their waaaaay to big for anyone
1.0,"NOT Cotton, 95% Polyester. Returning…"
1.0,I did not like the pearl necklace.  I am returning it and reordering a different style.
1.0,"I loved the picture of this dress when I ordered it - I couldn't wait for it to get here! When I received it, I noticed that the dark blue was a lot lighter than the picture, but figured &#34;oh well&#34;, it wasn't that big of a deal. Then I tried the dress on... All the lighter colored parts were completely see through! I will be returning this immediately! What a disappointment!"
1.0,The snaps fell off on the first use.  Don't  bother with this bag if you plan on actually using it. Not well made at all.
1.0,Looks weird and doesn't fit correctly.
1.0,Had to return. They are thinner so they rattle in the frames. Just barely touching them and they fall out.
1.0,The material seemed different in the picture ... fits smaller. You have to order a size up.
1.0,As far as I can tell it doesn't work
1.0,"This would be a great choice if you were looking to audition for Dancing With the Stars or Disney On Ice....It looks extremely cheap and &#34;costume-y,&#34; and is also the itchiest piece of clothing that I have ever put on my body.  I could only keep it on for a few seconds after zipping it up for the first time.  It feels as if the sequins are attached with fishing line instead of thread, and the sequins also make it very difficult to zip up/down.  Thank goodness for free returns...."
1.0,"This band will not adjust correctly to fit a 5.5"" wrist as advertised.  I have a 5.625"" wrist and the 44mm Apple watch slides up and down on my arm at the minimum setting."
1.0,Did not like the quality or fit of the product.  Looks cheap and the mesh is not strong enough to keep shape
1.0,I wish I had returned these. They don’t fit as expected and are very see through. Don’t waste your money!!
1.0,Was very small and covered with glue. The art is probably stolen and I could hardly even see what it was
1.0,"Pants and shirt were too small. The material was alright. Had the size been on point,I woulda been satisfied. For the price the material was ok. It's a jean outfit you can make better if your crafty."
1.0,Came already cracked then broke in half and its telling me I cannot get my money back
1.0,There isn't a pocket as depicted. Huge disappointment.
1.0,It came apart! I want to return it but it’s too late!
1.0,hard - really hard to get the wrinkles out
1.0,"I received this watch band 2 days ago, and instantly loved the color.  Yesterday was the first time I used it.  The color is already rubbing off.  I’m very disappointed."
1.0,"I wasn't expecting much for the price I paid, nevertheless I still paid money for this. This is just pure garbage, horrible quality, distorted lenses, cheap paint job, lenses fall off. It's just pure garbage, don't buy!!!!"
1.0,"These pants made me laugh! I’m 5’ 6, weigh 155 pounds. I normally wear size 8 (M). I ordered these in size L, so that they would be comfy to wear around the house. They are so tiny, I could barely squeeze into them. Also very long. I am too busy to bother to return them. Going to Goodwill."
1.0,The bust area was way too large. Had to return.
1.0,Does not stick it starts to peel off as soon as u put it on also no lift at all... Don't bother buying it does nothing of what it says it's suppose to I've bought others from different companies and those do work excellent but not this one from this brand.
1.0,No seriously listen to the rest of the one stars I had high hopes for this and it just fell apart the first time i wore it i was so angry.
1.0,"This looked like a nice belt when it arrived, but looks were deceiving in this case.  I bought this belt in mid July, I hardly ever have occasion to wear belts in the summer since I usually only wear them with long pants or jeans, so it got very little use until September.  Since that time I have worn it probably about 2 months worth of use.  The back side of the belt started to wear some at the belt hole I was using by October.  By the end of December it had worn completely through the backside piece of leather and some sort of black liner stitched in between the back side and the top side.  The top side is still holding together well, likely a higher quality piece of leather, but with the backside torn all the way through, the belt is almost unusable now.  I have leather belts I've worn for well over 20 years that are still in very good shape.  This is either a defective product or just a poorly manufactured one.  The company had no interest in seeing photos of the belt, they just denied my getting a replacement, or refund.  I recommend staying away from this product and the company, both are substandard in my view.<br /><br />NOTE: I am very judicious about giving poor review as anyone can see from my profile, however this product and the company lack of interest in resolving my complaint warranted this review.  I never had a direct reply from the company, I only learned they denied any replacement or refund when I inquired again through Amazon.  Photos attached show the how bad it is after only a couple of months worth of wear."
1.0,I ordered a large and my boobs are 36D and it was too small
1.0,"I will never buy anything from this people any more,I order a black boot as was showing on the pictures and they sent me a white one, I called them back to return or exchange but they said I orded the white one, so read the description again to see where it says what color was and there was nothing about it.Now if I whant to fix they mistake I have to pay for 2 shippings, because they blame me for order the wrong color. So if your are thinking about buy from these people,DON'T DO IT but if you do, good luck, you are going to need some."
1.0,"This swimsuit is way too small and can't be a size 10 in girls. Runs really really  small, I don't recommend."
1.0,Ni loca lo compro de nuevo
1.0,"these shoes started to fall apart after just one wear.  The velcro strap fell apart, and the metal loop that holds the velcro came loose. we had these same shoes in a smaller size that we purchased from a different seller and they lasted and held up so much better.  It's unfortunate because they are my son's favorite shoes and we needed them in the next size up.  We are returning these."
1.0,When I saw this product I was excited because I've ordered other things from this brand and their tops are so cute and true to size but the pants not at all. For one they are so see through. Two they did not fit. I'm a 14 so when the size chart says xl is a 16 that is not the case at all. These pants fit closer to a size 10 or 12. I am returning them tomorrow. I'm so disappointed.
1.0,"we are using these for our fourth graders to carry a few folders and some pencils around during the day. They are ripping, strings are fraying, the grommets are falling out, and they are really dirty already."
1.0,1st time washed the decal completely came off.  Very disapointed.  No stars
1.0,Did not like the fit. Gave to my granddaughter she loves them.
1.0,"Don't waste your money, after thoroughly reading all the reviews I felt confident size to buy. Unfortunately I did not fit at all. Too big on the top even though I am a add. I was traveling out of the country when it was delivered and I missed the time frame to return. A complete waste of money."
1.0,ITS WAY TOO SMALL  WHAT A WASTE
1.0,[[VIDEOID:804944ec6ecef6356b7d24c6b8235e14]]
1.0,Poor quality if this snags on anything it'll break immediately. Could've gotten better quality at the dollar store. The only good thing about this is the picture itself the rest sucks.
1.0,watch did not sit properly on the hand plus it did not work so had to return it.
1.0,I ordered the “rainbow” variety. The image on the site looks like a mix of blue pink and purple. The item sent looks nothing like that. It’s a white necklace with a few specks of color. Very disappointed.
1.0,Zipper broke with 1 month of purchasing it. $425.00 jacket. Called ScotteVest and never received a return call.
1.0,"I loved these hoops at first, they are so easy to open and close and never fall out, BUT the opal in it started coming out and now only about a third of the jewel is left. I wear these in my tragus piercings and it’s been feeling inflamed and swollen lately, which is why I took it out to begin with. When I took it out, and piece of the opal park was in my ear piercing which was why it was becoming inflamed and swollen. At first I would have said 10/10 but now I DO NOT RECOMMEND due to the hazard they pose."
1.0,These slippers fall apart very quickly! Don’t waste your money I would not recommend these slippers!
1.0,They are thin and flimsy and see through.
1.0,"There must be an office where they sell and pack the orders for these glasses. There is only one of two options as to how things work there.<br />1. These people come to work and spend all day laughing as they fill orders, while they picture their customers surprise at receiving comically large glasses they cannot wear.<br />2. They are giants, at least nine feet tall. Descended from a race of people whom these glasses might actually fit.<br /><br />I would return them, but it would cost more than its worth. Save yourself the trouble by not buying them."
1.0,Torn even before I tried them on then I tried them on and they ripped more. Total waste of money DO NOT waste your time or money on these cheap pants.
1.0,Very thin and cheap. My active son got snags in every shift… have already thrown away 2. Disappointed
1.0,This shirt is absolutely horrible. It's not a real tie dye shirt. It's literally all print. The model wearing the shirt in the photo isn't wearing this exact shirt. This shirt is a replica of that one. The cuts are ugly and the material of this shirt isn't good for a distressed look. Returning
1.0,"The dress quality feels good, but the first one I ordered was a return without new dress tag, missing size tag. I ordered a second one, even worse, missing beads."
1.0,"The fit was just okay, but the orange color is not as pictured. It's more like a rust color than a bright orange. It's the wrong color for summer."
1.0,"Horrible tank top, fit was awful. Too big and cut was weird underneath the arms and back. Even if I had ordered a smaller size I don't think it would have fit right. I washed it hoping it would help it did not. Waste of money can't wear the shirt."
1.0,"Firstly, according to my Dad, they did not work.  Secondly, what he got were a pair of red clips.  Not at all functional, or as described.  Glad this popped up to remind me to return them."
1.0,"Even after cutting the elastic every inch all the way around, way too tight. Hated that I couldn't use it. Fabric exactly like one my mom had from the dimestore over 50 years ago!"
1.0,The color does not match the product photo. No white in it at all... way more beige and blue than pictured and less green than pictured. Not sure if I got the right product since no one else complained of this though.
1.0,Looked nice but fell apart a week later. Was only on with a house key & key fob.
1.0,Very cheap. Do not buy.
1.0,This is a toy I wish I had knew that before I buy it never will I buy like this again the cost was to high for a plastic toy watch
1.0,"I just received a necklace today, but it was NOT the one I ordered. I ordered the bird pendant, because my friend loves birds. Instead, I received a tree of life pendant, as you can see in the attached photo. I’m not happy."
1.0,"Cheap thin cotton mask, light weight not much protection."
1.0,"Ring has tarnished, changed from Stainless Steal to Bronze."
1.0,"Blazer fit fine. However, the quality of the blazer was poor, the suing was sloppy, and within a week of wear the blazer ripped."
1.0,Very disappointed for the cost
1.0,This item is so much smaller than the size..it’s a beautiful gown but not intended for anyone except skinny women..I am a 2X but with this gown I would have had to have had a 6x..this made me feel so sad and depressed..this is body shaming
1.0,"What is this? A hat for ants?? Very small, not stretchy. Would barely fit the head of my nine year old - def not made for teens or adults."
1.0,Worst choice.<br />No wonder why it was too cheap.<br />Definitely regret buying these items
1.0,"Looked like a nightgown in person.  It's almost a joke,  don't waste your money for this satin nightgown....I returned it."
1.0,Like see through
1.0,"This purse is clumsy and clunky.  To keep it from gaping open, you have to fiddle with two side snaps."
1.0,Dont waste your money! These look nothing like the image. They look like giant pigs.  Completely dissatisfied!
1.0,Cheap quality. Looks like night wear.
1.0,"I ordered this bra and got it just one size larger to make sure it fit and it was still too small. It also has no wire and the cups were deformed. When it is on, my chest looked misshapen.<br /><br />I did like the fact that it came with an extender and straps but, that's it."
1.0,Kept slipping off my head :(
1.0,"This product was overall very large, I ordered a size medium which would usually work perfectly but it fit as an extra large. I’d suggest buying 1 or 2 sizes smaller than you normally would."
1.0,The item that we received was NOT as pictured. The photo makes the pendant look very cool- the actual item looks like it came out of a gum ball machine.
1.0,"Did not get these at all, I received a &#34;Charlestone lifetime plating&#34; clear jeweled earring necklace combo. Ordered for my sister in law to wear to a wedding that's happening tonight. Completely unsatisfied!!!!"
1.0,I didn't  like the material
1.0,Cute shirt but is is see through and would need to wear a strapless bra.
1.0,"Bad sizing, no instructions , too many pieces , bad material"
1.0,"Do not waste your money on this. I realize this will be inside of my purse but what is the point of a brand new item if it comes scratched?? These people are ripping Buyers off. They probably use leftover plastic from who knows where and mark it up as $20 to sell it. Also, if you don't like rattling noises in your purse, don't buy this as it makes so much noise inside with all the stuff rubbing on the plastic. I will buy some fabric and sew a liner for this as the noise really drives me crazy."
1.0,"These pants are too short. I am only 5'5"", but they barely come to my ankle and since they are flared slightly they look ridiculous. Also, the waist is probably the size of an XL. I ordered a size small. They are way too short and way too big in the waist. Just strange. The fabric feels soft and wonderful, but for over $100 they need to fit right. They will be going back."
1.0,"This is hands down the worst product I have ever purchased on Amazon. Without question.<br /><br />The zipper clasp is on the left side, the opposite of traditional clothing, which makes fumbling with the incredibly cheap plastic pieces insanely difficult to do. The zipper is seriously made of plastic. PLASTIC. The components are tiny like they came off of a toy. Oh and by the way, don’t wash this trash with any other clothing because it will bleed the dye into everything else in the wash with it. I ordered the fluorescent one, and now my work shirts have a nice green glow permanently stained into them.<br /><br />If I could give this product a zero, I would. I warn you all, DO NOT waste your money on this worthless crap. STAY AWAY!"
1.0,Sticky backing took adhesive off when removed so beard would not stick
1.0,"They didn't fit right I'm returning them, I need a refund PLEASE<br />Added to my written review<br />When will I get my refund PLEASE. November 3ed 2022"
1.0,Material. Size not correct
1.0,There was no magnet to put in the nose
1.0,They're too wide for my Withings Activite watch and I have to return them.
1.0,"Estoy muy decepcionado con la compra que hice de este reloj,  en realidad no es impermeable puesto que ya me presentó un filtrado de agua  en el cristal , eso dañó la coloración de las agujas.<br /> Por mes me atrasa 10 minutos.<br />Estoy muy disgustado por la mala calidad.<br />Actualmente Quiero aplicarle la garantía."
1.0,After 2 hours these pant stretched so badly I looked like I was wearing a diaper. I was constantly having to stop what I was doing and pull up my pants. Ridiculous. Never buying this brand again.
1.0,"I think overall the product quality is ok, but there is a major design flaw - the back string is so thin and it hurts.  I cant use them."
1.0,I sent back . Don’t like materiao
1.0,"These fit really well and I liked the look. But the came apart at the seams inside the footbed within a few days. I sent them back for an exchange and the second pair had the same problem. Due to an unfortunate accident with a power tool, the second pair got a big rip in the top of the slipper. I was surprised to find that the outer material was actually a very thin layer of suede over a foam material. So, not exactly real leather, just a leather veneer."
1.0,Nice .. but broke really quick
1.0,"Barely got to use the product as it ripped within a week of use. Looked nice, held my things, a bit small but no point if it breaks after barely using it. Terrible product. Dont buy! Do something about those straps!"
1.0,They look like a school art project. Cheap looking and small like scraps
1.0,Didn't fit at all.
1.0,I had gotten this ring for my wife. And with in a couple days one of the stones fell out the prongs are very thin. Contacted seller and never received any contact back. It is not worth it.
1.0,&#34;turquoise&#34; is a blue far from what the pic shows. Shirt is a cheap fabric and is short and wide right out of the packaging. Didn't even try on as I can see it's going to be one of those fabrics that rides up. Disappointed but will just keep shopping.
1.0,Cheap. Half of anklets did not work. Came broken
1.0,"Bad material, it is broken after a few months."
1.0,Crap!!!
1.0,They are supposed to be XL.  They are BY FAR too small for my American hands.
1.0,It came came with somebody's underarm deodorant on it
1.0,These pants stink. They smell like chemicals and Icsnnot get the stink out.
1.0,This shirt is made TOO SMALL. I ordered an XL and it fit like a medium. Then I ordered a 3xl and it fits like an XL. I needed a 90s style shirt. You know really baggy and long. I guess I need a 7xl for that.
1.0,Cheaply made and the item was delivered broken
1.0,Too small. It fits a child. I gave it to my niece age 8yr.
1.0,SHIRT RUNS VERY SMALL
1.0,Poor Quality does not work
1.0,WAYYYYYY too thick. The band is extremely thick and adds a ridiculous amount of bulk to any watch. The overall product is extremely firm and takes too much effort to fit to your wrist. Not happy. Not worth the money
1.0,Don't buy.  Like all the one and two star review state...it just broke.  Didn't even know when.  Lost a pendant I have owned for over 35.  Very disappointed ...to say the least....no I'm pissed. I have not owned a chain in my life that just broke for no reason.
1.0,"Terrible quality, the top is for a teenand the bottoms are for a child. No hem in the shorts or top. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Clearly this product is way shorter then it appears to be in the picture. I am 5 foot 6 inches so it's not like I'm super tall. It states that this is a midi dress but clearly it is not. I was going to use for a work Halloween costume however it is not an appropriate length to do so. Im returning it immediately!
1.0,Zippers were tore when arrived. Gold strap too girlish for a man. Doesn't look as manly as I think it should have been.
1.0,I normally wear a 2XL comfortable and bought a 3XL so it can fit loosely and it fits me like a XL. Runs extremely small. Disappointed. 👎🏽
1.0,Didn't like the fit or style. I'll be returning this
1.0,Did not fit. Very cheap crap from china.
1.0,"Muy mal material, lo use 3 dias y se puso verde aparte me irritó la piel"
1.0,This bag stunk so bad of chemicals.  I have to say that this is the second bag made in China that I had to return because of a really bad odor.
1.0,"Didn't like the fit at all. Very awkward to get into. Ended up giving it away, I doubt if I could have re sold it. AND it would cost as much to return it as there is NO FREE RETURN. Very disappointed."
1.0,Not meant for normal American adults. If you have a very small head and face they may fit you.
1.0,I am a 5’8 155 pounds and this fits absolutey way too small. Looks nothing like the picture. Fits like a small shirt. Cheaply made.
1.0,This looks like a Steve Harris tie
1.0,Too small and cheaply made.  Fits like a regular shirt not a coverall that’s hangs.  I ordered a Large and I am a true Size 8 so it should have been oversized but it fit like a tshirt hanging only to my upper hip.  String used for the the coverall is very poor quality and seems very fragile and would not last long after a wash.
1.0,Oh man were these some cheap quality shorts. Not worth the money.
1.0,It’s ugly.
1.0,Came in melted together!
1.0,I bought a bifocal  but it came a simple reading glasses 🤨
1.0,The lens on the right side works well enough.<br />  The lens on the left side is out of focus at all distances.<br />  Since I read with my left eye the glasses have very little value to me.<br />  David Edwards
1.0,Chain broke after Two weeks
1.0,Very cheaply made.  Loose knitted.  Won't fit on my head properly.
1.0,More than 20 duplicate names and had to write in over 25 players that should have been in the package. Just a terrible product.
1.0,This runs extremely small.
1.0,Shrink the very first time it was washed. All the threads from the tassels on the yoke part came off and threads from the kurti stitching hanging everywhere!! Pathetic buy
1.0,"low quality bag, felt apart"
1.0,Did not last 1 month of light indoor use...
1.0,The shoes are very large.
1.0,Received a 5xl and looked like a regular large. Bought this for as a gift for my mother and was very disappointed.
1.0,Too tight.  Had to cut the waistband to be comfortable.  Strangling my balls.<br /><br /> I read the reviews about how poorly undersized they are AFTER i purchased.  I would order up 2 sizes on what you think would fit.
1.0,These just pop off my jeans all the time and then I get stabbed by the pin.
1.0,Very loosely made material. Stretched out quickly so got too loose. Did not survive washing well. No where near hospital quality.
1.0,Terrible product. Hair tie pops off. Big and bulky and hurts to wear. Do not recommend
1.0,No eh podido aser el retorno del producto porque piden muchas cosas la tienda que segun ellos dicen tener no tienen lo que ocupa y asen perder mucho tiempo y no quieren regresar el dinero ..... Estoy muy molesta porque es un producto caro y de la mala calidad nada qye ver en la foto
1.0,Returned item. Too small.
1.0,this dress is way to thin... you can see right through it.... even with a slip... this dress is more like a cover up for a swim suite if your at a pool party.
1.0,I got this for my kid as a Birthday gift. Within 2 days  it stopped working.<br /><br />PS It also arrived with corroded Batteries inside of it.
1.0,"Low quality, itchy material. Kinda tight at top of sock and I don't have very big legs. Arrives with a hole in the bottom of the right foot."
1.0,Too looks nice and fits to size but did not receive the skort that is suppose to come with it.
1.0,"It doesn't fit the best, but it is manageable. It took about a month or so for it to come in and the overall quality is pretty low."
1.0,I don't wear clothing with logos and/or writing on it. I don't know how the hell I missed it but this crap is covered in writing and logos.
1.0,The dress was too small for me even though I ordered a larger size.
1.0,I would not re buy this type. I have to glue it.
1.0,I donated it. Not flattering at all!
1.0,"We loved the idea, but the valves on both are completely defective - they pop open in under 110 seconds...we taped them closed. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Broke the first day I wore them
1.0,Cheap and so small... not worth it..you got to assemble it yourself ..
1.0,Returned.  I've removed links from watch bands before.  This one was impossible.
1.0,"So bad quality, is the batter one to clean, doesn’t work as expected.  The bad one smoothie blender."
1.0,The whole top section of the back is sheer and the rest of the dress is so thin it's definitely see-through. No way the model in the photos is wearing this white dress. The photos do NOT represent it accurately.
1.0,After wearing these one time to workout in they had a huge hole in the crotch...
1.0,Very disappointed only recieved 72 not 88 and got alot that were the same like 12 of same one 14 of another and a dozen little tiny black bead ones..what I did get was good quality except the little black beads..won't buy from this company again.
1.0,I bought this hat as a gift for my 7 yr old nephew so he could look like Pappa while they fish. Although the hat is great - the packaging was highly inappropriate and offensive! Super unhappy!
1.0,Poor quality<br />Broke instantly. Returned
1.0,It didn’t hold up. Should’ve returned it right when broke !!
1.0,Most of the reviews are spot on!! Cheap thin material and stitching loose everywhere. Runs so small I’m thing not even close to the size I ordered. I returned it.
1.0,"The sunglasses straps do not fit on any of my sunglasses snug. So they aren’t very useful, I will return soon. But look super cute!"
1.0,I got 1 then had to replace it to no good junk
1.0,"Looked super matronly, unfortunately."
1.0,"I was disappointed that I received 3 of the same color after ordering blue, black and grey."
1.0,Was 4 sizes too small
1.0,"Cheap quality, looks nothing like the photo. Not a true wrap dress and is definitely not flattering. Length is not a true maxi dress if you are over 5'8""<br />Bottom line, don't waste your money."
1.0,Not true to size.  Looks a little frumpy.
1.0,Good reading magnification for very short distance.  Dizzying for anything else due to uneven surface of lens.
1.0,"Returned crappy material ,2 front panels too high and seam not sewn ..not worth the $$"
1.0,Not an XXL. More like a men's large.
1.0,I ordered an XL it fits more like a small to medium
1.0,I guess the dress design is great but I was expecting a darker color and I don't think it is the monitor fault.  I don't believe this is the same dress that I received.  I had so much happening in my life that I let the window lapse for return but I sure wish I could exchange if for another color. This dress was brought because it appeared to be the same color of my nephew's wedding but it was so far off I didn't wear it.
1.0,Unfortunately they looked cheap so I returned them.
1.0,They sent me a wrong color and also<br />Really bad quality<br />Don’t recommend
1.0,I received an empty package set was nowhere to be found
1.0,Runs super small.  Cheaply made.  Doesn't look like image
1.0,"I purchased an XXL however, these are about a US size Medium. These advertised they are fleece lined and they are not. There is no fleece inside. The photo shown in the advertisement did not have these huge square pockets on the front. Which I didn’t really care for at all. I am stuck with them because I don’t live anywhere near a drop off site to return them.. also, they are extremely thin, not as described"
1.0,Order Purple for a Birthday Gift. Item that arrived was orange & label said purple
1.0,Poor quality and poor service
1.0,i look like harry potter kms
1.0,The spelling is so BAD it isn't even funny. The worst part is... I bought this for someone as a joke.
1.0,Not the best fabric at all. It feels really cheap and it's wait to short for me and I am 5&#34;5. It comes with a piece of fabric to tie.. but there are no loops at all. Really a waste of money.
1.0,Bought this bra to wear under a dirndl dress for an Oktoberfest party. I got a size up and it's a bit snug so I would suggest two sizes up and also a size or two bigger around. (Comes with extension) The bra will do what I need it to do but the reason I gave it one star is because the metal on the strap was rusted and stained the bra on both straps! I wonder how much moisture got to it before I got it. I'm so disappointed. I was looking forward to this bra after all the good reviews from busty women like myself.
1.0,The outer material peeled off the first week after bought. And the material inside is a cheap material and dyes the skin...
1.0,"Poorly constructed, no boning, ordered 5X received M"
1.0,"Shipping took a very long time.  It came in a flimsy package in a flimsy wrapper and turned out to be a flimsy shirt.  Not a true hoodie.  Could not wear this outside weather less than 70 degrees.  It is very flimsy and the material looks like if you brush by a branch or a hedge, the threads will fray out.  You know like cheap stuff from bad manufacturers.  My wife paid about $50 for this thing that is just a little thicker than a Tshirt.  It was a gift and I tried to return it but the customer service never once responded to my many emails.  Finally they replied to my wife's many emails and demanded a receipt.  They sent no receipt in the packaging and no packing slip.  She had the order n umber from her records but they would not accept that.  I would not do business with them even if they had a good product because of the poor customer service but because the product is inferior and very over priced I recommend that you stay away."
1.0,Mine stopped after 10 months. The answer from warranty was to try and get me to replace the motor myself for 50% off. No product support.
1.0,2 out of six socks are in bad bad condition
1.0,"Ordered 2 pair of shorts. One came next day Prime. When I switched to different color I did not catch the other pair would be delivered like a month later (my mistake). When I caught it (about an hour later), I cancelled the order but they shipped it anyway. They msg'd me like 3 days later saying the item had already been shipped. One reason I always do Prime only now. On top of that, the large size is more like a medium to small. Wife weighs in at 125 pounds and the large is very tight - don't fit. Upside, they fit my skin and bones 14 year old granddaughter."
1.0,"Extremely poor quality.  The stitching was VERY crooked, broken and weirdly overlapping in places.  The bloomers aren't really bloomers, there is no elastic in the leg holes and the back of the panty is so skinny it covers nothing.  It's basically a baby thong.  Once my daughter is potty trained it will look inappropriate for her to wear them...at least with a diaper she's properly covered up.  You get what you pay for I guess but for the same price on the Target sale rack I get something good quality."
1.0,"The hat fits too tight, you'll get headaches. The color changed from grey to more of a purple."
1.0,Looked durable in the pictures but they fell apart with light use and there is little arch support. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Very inferior product, too light"
1.0,The elastic waistband way too tight and not a good explanation of outfit!
1.0,These gloves do not come in a box that is easy to dispense.  They come in a cheap plastic bag. There is no sanitary way to dispense these from this bag.  This is an inferior product for too high a price.
1.0,I’m returning.  Not even quality enough for super casual trendy accessories.
1.0,"Wore it once and it completely fell apart.  I loved the fit and looked very nice on, I only wore it a few hours but all the seams were undone by the time I got home."
1.0,So pretty but not for thin and fit girls with bountiful areas up top!
1.0,I liked that it said sweet home. I didn’t like how quickly it began to change colors.
1.0,Runs incredibly small. XXL Fit the recipient (who wears a large) as if it were a small.
1.0,"Too big, too flimsy"
1.0,Was not sweatshirt material my fault I should of looked at descriptions better..I returned item did not like it
1.0,More like a back in the day outfit or Halloween costume.
1.0,"Worst product I have purchased on Amazon,don't do it!!'n"
1.0,These were obviously from China. They were tiny
1.0,All around not what I was expecting! The footy part of the sock awkwardly fit and also had bits of red sewn into the toe area. The inner seam is sewn crooked as well. I'm returning for a refund.
1.0,They don't fit comfortably. The fabric is cut all wrong
1.0,Rings were not what I expected no where near  Poor Qality
1.0,Made in China lols
1.0,"The image online looks wonderful compared to the mask itself. This mask is very small and tight. Additionally, the rhinestones are falling off already, and the mask does not stretch very well."
1.0,It's soooooo short. I like minis but this is a shirt!
1.0,they will not stay on mother's feet while sleeping
1.0,I thought they came pre wrapped. I can't wrap it properly
1.0,Frame Leans to the left
1.0,"Really???? I’m so disappointed, the dress in the picture was so beautiful and this was what I got for my daughter 16th Bday. NOT COOL!"
1.0,This garment is cheap quality. It is not as descibed and does not look like the picture. Very cheap. Disappointed.
1.0,The neck is completely stretched out and enormous.
1.0,This is a cute suit but was way too small. There is no internal band on the top so if I raised both arms above my head I would have been exposed. The top doesn’t have enough support to stay in place.  I’m not sure a larger size would have fixed this issue for me.
1.0,"I love these gloves! But after less than a week, they ripped. I’m so bummed. I’m hoping to receive a replacement."
1.0,Like wearing a tent :(
1.0,"First off, the pictures make it look like there are colored sequins in the design. Not the case. It is a picture of colored sequins printed on to a giant piece of cloth.<br /><br />Second, the mask is ridiculously huge. As a bigger adult, it about covers my face and neck. It's as if someone took a neck gaiter, cut it in half, and attached strings to it. Lol don't buy it. Your Cookie Swirl C fan will just be disappointed and annoyed."
1.0,"I found this dress under warm winter dresses, the fabric is so thin it feels like a soft t-shirt material.  It just doesn't work for me. I'm not even trying it on. I'm returning this dress."
1.0,Cheap sending back!!!
1.0,Color and fit were not for me.
1.0,Very  malleable. I put the earring backs on and the whole earring just bent downward with little to no pressure.
1.0,Poor quality came broken
1.0,this looks better online.  the material is a yucky feeling material.
1.0,"We purchased the ""child size"" cap for an 8yo girl who is on the smaller side. We should have listened better to the other reviews about the sizing. A more adept description of this product would be toddler's size. If you are purchasing for a 2-5 year old, maybe it will work. Do not even attempt for 7 and up. It is not stretchy like you would think of a tradition knit cap. That said, it is a really cool beanie and we were disappointed we had to return it."
1.0,"It was a great shirt, but way too small. A 2XL is literally a size Medium / Large."
1.0,This was the worst fitting bra I’ve ever purchased. The bra was a 6x and didn’t even fit my 32 B sister.
1.0,The material is awful.
1.0,My daughter is 4ft11 and this is EXTREMELY small and disproportioned for  her - the arms are tight and zip won’t close on the back- the top portion is too short and whole dress is not long enough - not happy at all!<br /><br />She wears size small for everything and is very petite and short for her age so would not suggest
1.0,The dress is nothing like the pictures and it’s See-through
1.0,I literally can't even believe that these arrived in this condition.
1.0,Would<br />Not even consider this a spanx
1.0,Pretty rings but they turned my finger green after a couple of wears
1.0,Fast delivery!!  Would send back..colors are not the same as in picture.
1.0,Saw a bunch of people wearing this raving about it. The sleeve is one size the whole way down so the wrist area is extremely large. The material is not at all as listed and has a weird smell.
1.0,I purchased 4 sets and I payed $120 for it and non of them fits us all are very bad quality and the fit is so bad! I tried to return and they ask $60 for return!!! Don't buy!!!!!
1.0,Wouldn’t buy again. It’s cute but the worst material. So scratchy and ripped in the wash after washing one time.
1.0,I was so excited to get this in the mail and when I got it open it was broken!! I am really disappointed. I wasted my money on this thing. The only thing I like is how fast the shipping was and if it WASN'T broken it would have a good amount of stretch.
1.0,"Xl was really small, really short inseam"
1.0,Sent back was way too small... not actual US sizes
1.0,I normally wear a 6/8 in pants and ordered a LARGE and they still don't fit.  The cut and sizing is all wrong.  So disappointing.
1.0,Material is awful.  Size is miniature.  But it would be adorable if it fit and were in better material.  Then I would pay double!!
1.0,Not floor length as pictured and sent me two sized larger than I ordered. Buyers beware. It’s more of a shin length dress and I’m only 5”4 not that tall....
1.0,[[VIDEOID:fb98bcd82ed1b5f7684952186f806102]] My daughter ware and it made colors on her hand so please if you are buying this ring for someone or you don’t buy it because it is not that good
1.0,I wear a Medium. Bought a Large. Way to small. Buy up 2 sizes.
1.0,"Few days of use, and it is broken."
1.0,"Purchased on February 19, arms fell off on April 1,  AWFUL"
1.0,"Advertised as coming with screws, questions asked says it comes with screws. Did NOT come with screws"
1.0,Received hat folded and rolled up to approximately 2” x 5” and placed in a cellophane. Hat (fedora) shape is completely ruined.
1.0,"I meant to return this dress but shelter in place orders had just came in when I was going to and I never got it to the UPS store, which is fine as it wasn't expensive and I used a giftcard. I ended up donating it. It did not fit well. If you put the sleeves on your arms were pinned to your side and the cut was not flattering. I am broad shouldered so maybe it wouldn't be so constricting on your arms if you have narrower shoulders, but overall I was not impressed."
1.0,"I know it's not just me, but I received a set and the left lens was significantly darker than the right. Very distracting! I requested a replacement, and Amazon sent me a new pair. Same thing! Is this a ""feature""? Because to me, it's not usable. Perhaps it's a bad batch, but I returned both sets and I'll get my glasses elsewhere."
1.0,Dislike product
1.0,"Immediately returned the product. It was made of extremely poor quality plastic. Fragile beyond belief and plain ugly and uncomfortable. It just a real disappointment. This product was the worst I have ever purchased on Amazon.  Save your money, time and effort.  I gave it one star because the rating system does not accept zero stars."
1.0,Very cheap quality and  very small
1.0,I got a bunch of these for family for Xmas and they loved 😍 them.<br />So I ordered one for myself!<br /><br />Edit: Well after 2 months it's Bluetooth is starting to have an issue staying connected to my phone! Keeps disconnecting & reconnecting repeatedly! Bummer!
1.0,Cheap thin strap..Don't reccomend
1.0,"The belt broke the first ime that it was used. All the pins fell out on the first day. Not worth returning, not worth the money."
1.0,"While the product looked cute, I received an apron for a 40 year old rather than a 30 year old. So I had to send it back. The description of the item is incorrect."
1.0,"Horrible, very poor quiality, ti was broken.... Cheap....the stones where out of their site , i need to used adhesive, but the brigth where out."
1.0,"The style is cute, discolored to fast for the cost. More like a dollar store item."
1.0,Shirt was vibrant at all it was dull and looked kinda faded.
1.0,Very sharp screws or rivets whatever is holding it together cut the inside of my finger badly as I tried to put it on.<br /><br />This item should not be allowed to be sold.  Terrible.
1.0,Stolen artwork. Real artist is called brinkreder
1.0,"Only a few of these worked, and those only if you used two fingers to press on both sides at once. Buy the blinky rings instead for a bit more, most of them worked and everyone loved them!"
1.0,Broke after second use.  Strap separated from bag.  Do not buy
1.0,Material is like polyester
1.0,Broke when I was trying it on - very cheap and poorly made.
1.0,"It would track sleep - if it didn't just fall off in the middle of the night. It could provide feedback while working out - if it didn't fall off if it touched anything at the gym. The silicone band is attached to the unit with one single eyeglass-size screw. Silicone is soft and flexible - it goes right around the screw. It's too bad. I paid for this item, and I can't even wear it or use it anymore. Save your money. Don't buy this."
1.0,THIS WAS THE WORST DRESS EVERY WILL NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN!!!!
1.0,Opened the package and the writing was already torn. I am going to exchange for another pair and hope it doesn’t have the same issue!!!
1.0,"Cheap made, ...bought a large size for my mother who wears Medium size and still didn’t fit...too small!!!"
1.0,"I first want to start by saying I loved this swimsuit in the pictures, when I received it and put it on I absolutely hated it. It did not fit well at all. It does not fit at all like the pictures show, and I have big boobs and they surely did not look as good as the ones in the pictures. It has zero support. The crotch area is larger than the butt area which is not good at all for a big booty. I am not fat or heavy by any means but this thing was very unflattering, I actually cried a little because it was so horribly fitting because I did love it in the pictures. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
1.0,I bought this watch for my father and the mechanism failed in a few months. And he is retired and never did anything physical while wearing watch. Don't waste your money.
1.0,These earrings are junk and not advertised to what they truly are.  They are heavily tarnished and looked like they were 12 years old.  I would not take these even if they were giving them away.  Don't waste your money.  False advertisement is the best description for this item.
1.0,"I went a size up like suggested and at first they were tight but now they're worn in and fit fine. I can slip them on with a little effort, without using my hands which is exactly the fit I wanted.<br /><br />Problem is the souls are treacherous and are going to end up killing me if I don't find something else. They're a cheap plastic like rubber that just slides around everywhere on my hardwood and tile floors, especially if there's a little water. Its like trying to walk on ice skates sometimes. I hate them and they're going to get me killed one day. I'm going to end up slipping and bashing my head on a counter or something. I'm looking for something better because this is stupid, and completely voids any positive qualities of these slippers. It doesn't matter if they fit or if they're comfortable if they're trying to constantly kill me! I'd send them back but I don't have anything else to replace them with yet.<br /><br />Also several of those leather ties came undone and I had to fix it with some needle nose pliers. Hard to do and a little time consuming. I suggest tying another knot around the original knots to keep this from happening, making larger double knots, and using some pliers to make the knots extra tight."
1.0,"wrong color, it is not the same as the photo, very disappointed👎🏻"
1.0,Awkward straps and too baggy in lots off places .
1.0,This ring is nothing like the picture. It had a very low price which should have been a clue towards it quality. For a kids toy jewelry box it would be ok.
1.0,Loved how it looked. But it was waaaay to big
1.0,This was the worst purchase I have ever made through Amazon! The top of the robe is perfect the bottom isn’t wide enough to cover my croch! What good is a robe that doesn’t cover the parts it’s supposed to cover!?!
1.0,"No me agrado la tela, muy mala calidad. Corre muy pequeño."
1.0,"This shirt looks very different from the online picture, also the color is a bright red verses a maroon color. It was not what I expected and I had hoped to return it, but that doesn't appear to be an option. It's ugly... so I just threw away $20 bucks. Ugh. Guess I'll donate it."
1.0,Disappointed earrings is one long and one short in length
1.0,"My headline pretty much sums it up.  My daughter usually wears a size 8. I got the 10 to see how much bigger it would be. Well, after 1 wash it shrunk down smaller than a 8. When she tried it on she said it was scratchy. It definitely is not soft like the description says. And it definitely shrinks. Don't believe the description."
1.0,Beautiful snowflake but the chain broke the second day we had it with gentle handling.
1.0,"Not wide enough to absorb sweat. The cooling action only lasts a short time when initially wet. Don’t waste your money. I tried to return it and they want to charge $3.97 postage on a $10 item, ridiculous."
1.0,Not so comfy....not so warm....I bought this to wear in winter apparently made the wrong choice...it kind of fits strangely...it doesn't cover the chest nor legs because it doesn't cross properly and keep opening  up....oh and the stitches are poor as well....it's been only few weeks since the purchase but the stitches already opening up...
1.0,Waistband on every pair I got has came unraveled.
1.0,I receive a dickes man jean instead . Big mistake it was a gift . I had no option to stick with the stupid jean i dont have time for returns .
1.0,I just ordered 2 pairs and it was missing a small earring also the back magnet for the big ones. So I can’t wear them
1.0,"Poor quality item. The fabric was frayed on the edges and the color was off (I ordered black, but it was more like a navy blue). Wish there was a return label in package."
1.0,The adhesive wouldn’t work for either of us(bought 2 sets) the fit wouldn’t sit right. These are just front covers not actual inserts.
1.0,Very big binder for a big wallet.
1.0,"i got two leggins of Jed North in gray and black camo and its perrrfect!!! so i was so exited and ordered one in blue; when i received them and tried them on it felt like too much extra space for stomach and less space for butt so i returned them... then i saw this new item and i loved the gray and ordered them and they arrived in blue, i returned and reorder in gray again and guess what? reveived in same blue as in the first time. i contacted amazon and let them know about this problem, then after i decided give another shot and order them again cause i really really liked them in gray, they look so much better than gym shark leggins. finally they arrived yesterday and its gray!!!! yay!????<br />but no!!! i wasnt even able to try them on- it goes a little higher my knees and thats it!!!!<br />returning it!!!!!"
1.0,"Awful material, much thinner than expected. Ordered a size up so I wouldn't have to worry about the stretch making it see through, but even without stretch it was very see through.<br />Not a flattering shape for small chest or those who lack curves. Immediately returned."
1.0,"The style is great, but the earrings are very poor quality.  Returning."
1.0,Weirdest  fit of any bra I have tried. Not at all like the photo. Will be returning this bra.
1.0,"I loved the color and style and fit but there is something wrong with the material. It clings like static. It said machine washable on here, but after fighting with the static I looked at the inside and it said dry clean. I took it to the dry cleaners and paid more money and problem still existed. This dress is not reccomended."
1.0,"The designs are cute, but they don't stay up."
1.0,Did nothing. Not even sure the purpose. And horrible for small hands.
1.0,Horn broke off when I closed the car door.
1.0,"Not long enough, pull on toes while working"
1.0,This review isn't for the shoe itself since my daughter never got to wear them. It's for their incredibly inaccurate sizing. According to their sizing chart a HCD 25 is a US size 10. The shoes I received were size 25 but they were at least two sizes too small. The shoes are very cute and if they ever fix this problem (I noticed a lot of other reviewers were having the same issue) I would probably try it again.
1.0,Way too big for kids. Didn't work at all
1.0,They break too easily
1.0,Unbelievably cheap. Looks horrible. Super thin material.
1.0,No me sirvió vienen muy gruesos no entran muy ajustados y. Duelen:(
1.0,"Poor quality and terrible looking.  They took a regular t-shirt , cut half the sleeves and the bottom hem off,  left it unhemmed, and called it a sleeveless workout shirt."
1.0,Very Flimsy for the price and the sizing is way off. A small is very large.  Tried to return it and I have to send it to China and pay for postage. Will not buy anything that isn't sold in the US again.
1.0,I thought this would be thicker than the coats in Walmart but it was twice as thin for the same money.
1.0,"These are NOT unisex glasses, purely female."
1.0,"The bra sucked. The band around the chest doesn't support the cups. I am a b size, and my boobs popped out the top. Absolutely no breast support. The picture was carefully taken to avoid showing too much."
1.0,"Worst, cheap.  Not even toy.  I didn't expect good quality because it is only $2.5 per pair but it is all defect on some parts. Legs are not open and close.  It is not mirror either."
1.0,Very cheap looking ring big disapointment it looks nothing like the picture the paint is raised and the lines are crooked what a waste!!!
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap fell apart after only 1 use
1.0,These are not the actual copper fit compression socks. I have ordered them before and these are some knock off in the same packaging.
1.0,Literally the thinnest socks of all time! They fit perfectly and have an the awesome heel gel so they don't slip but they quality of the fabric is entirely too thin. I got holes in the toes on the first wear!
1.0,Terrible. Terrible material. Terrible fit.
1.0,"Very disappointed. Looked like it was made from a shiney cheap fabric. Definitely not a sweater by any stretch of the imagination. Also, smelled horrible. I mean really horrible. Didn’t want that smell in my house, so straight into the trash it went."
1.0,"Within two days it turned to rust, it was for my daughter and her friends I had to return because it was horrible color."
1.0,My toddler bent the sunglasses and they broke in seconds. False advertising!
1.0,"This item is just a waste of time and not worth the money. Seriously! Its very cheaply made fabric with a logo on it. You are better off going to a fabric store and cutting an item or cutting a piece clothing that you're going to throw out. If you buy it, you will see that this is such a scam."
1.0,Deceptive advertising. I was expecting 2 shirts but only received 1. They should include a photo of what is included in the 2 pc set. Disappointed with the quality for $30 for 1 shirt.
1.0,"Poor quality, broke at first trial to wear. It is not expensive that's why I didn't care, but I got used to buying inexpensive things from Amazon that were surprisingly very good. This one is not one of them!"
1.0,"Bought two Bluey sweatshirts for my two Grandsons, and I can't even give them to them for Christmas, because the quality of the material is so poor, and they are way too small! I am very dissapointed! Hopefully will be able to get a refund! Please don't waste your money on this company!"
1.0,"Simply put, my helmet was stolen while using this lock the very first day I used it during midday.  I was parked in San Francsico, which is known to have high rates of theft.  If you normally park in areas that are less prone to theft this lock is likely to be a good deterrent, but in practice is easily broken.  The T-bar that is used to connect the lock to the bike is fragile and can be snapped off easily.<br /><br />Overall, the lock is easy to setup and use, but I would not suggest using this method to secure your helmet.  Locked saddle-bags, or carrying the helmet with you is the way to go to ensure your helmet wont be stolen."
1.0,Useless product
1.0,I loved these boot. Super cute. But poor quality😖<br />They broke after the second wear.
1.0,Most of them didn't work very disappointed
1.0,"No zipper on these which would sure help to put them on.  Name peeled right off while I tried to put on, no biggy.  Nice & thick, 7m.  Soft soles, just a little tougher thank the. Nylon tops.  Would I recommend?  Only if you have narrow feet & thin ankles.<br />I'm returning them."
1.0,"The product is described as ""cocktail dress"".... it is definitely not a cocktail dress. I would describe it as a swimsuit cover up, based both on looks and material. The material is that of a swimsuit."
1.0,This was actually broken when my niece opened it as her gift. I need to do am exchange:(
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!!! These socks are too short, nothing like the picture stated.  False advertisements"
1.0,"Biggest mistake ever! If I could give negative stars I would. Within the first 3 days the handles broke off. I thought, ok I will just use the shoulder strap. WRONG that broke 2 days later. I do not carry much in my purse. Nothing heavy. So disappointed, it is cute, but falling apart."
1.0,The adjustment mechanism catches the material creating pulls in the nylon. This makes it impossible to adjust and the strap becomes useless
1.0,"I am allergic to non-precious metals. The listing didn’t say it was silver PLATED, so I bought this thinking I’d be ok. Within days the playing rubbed off and revealed a non precious metal, which ultimately caused a painful infection in my ear lobes."
1.0,"UPDATE: I made an appeal with Amazon about this lack of refund and was denied. The owner said I didn’t not include the return label in the package, which I did everything they asked! DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER!!!<br /><br />The dress was pretty but it was a little big and my boobs looked pointy so I wanted to return it. This seller is making excuses to give me my refund when it has been more than 10 business days and the website says they give free refunds. If they don’t want to give free refunds then they shouldn’t say they give free refunds. I’m also waiting to get my return shipping refunded."
1.0,This product did not include instructions on how to shorten the wrist band and I cannot find how to contact the seller to ask them for it. cute enough but unusable unless I shorten the wrist the band.
1.0,The top was nicely done except the lettering after two washes started separating from the fabric?  Not happy with that!  Very disappointing!
1.0,La talla que dicie es la de un niño de 12 años.no de aduto.
1.0,I ordered a size up and dress was still too small especially around the arms. I usually wear a large and I ordered an XL. Very disappointed because I wanted it for a wedding. Fabric gives no stretch and is a bit see through.
1.0,I ordered this product for church and after ordering it a size larger it was yet too small. I was very disappointed.
1.0,Smaller than 00
1.0,actual size is much smaller than originally advertised.  Unsatisfied.  Trying to charge me a return fee to return item even though I have paid for it and the size is too small.
1.0,"The material was so terrible (so thin it literally felt like paper) and the inner lining wasn’t even the same pattern - it was white. I mean, of course you’re gonna get a crappy dress for this little amount of money… but it’s not even worth a penny in my opinion."
1.0,Bummed I didn’t get a case like everyone else. That was a selling point for me. The glasses are good enough to keep.
1.0,"These are huge and very thin. I wanted to return these for a full refund. I was given 2 options,  1, give them as a gift to someone ,2, keep them for half of a refund. Give these as a gift? Are you kidding me? I'd be embarrassed to give these things as a gift to anyone, I'd be embarrassed to give them to goodwill, and if I keep them a half refund theyd just be taking up space in my dresser drawer. Lesson learned."
1.0,"Can barely move in it because of seams, thin quality compared to similar ones I’ve ordered online."
1.0,Broke first attempt on trying it on. The size was right but the strap wasn't the best. The silicone doesn't stay it falls off. Didn't work for it!!
1.0,Ring stone went missing within w couple of weeks. I don't think ill purchase again.  No good!!
1.0,The circles will fit oddly in itself. Can tell it’s cheaply made.
1.0,I have bought multiple times in the past. Now product cheaply made. A couple months after ordering reflective stitching came undone. Had to sew by hand. Not worth the expensive price.
1.0,"Cheap material, mine came with a rip in the back where it laces up"
1.0,The plastic piece kept slipping down off my head whenever I made a slight move and also broke easily.
1.0,"I am very disappointed in this item because I thought it would fit my ice skates and I could not even get one skate in there. I spend allot of money on Amazon, and I have has 3 bad experiences. and now I can return this item when everything is still in contact."
1.0,Ordered for our trip to Disney.  Ordered the adult Mickey and Minnie ponchos and received both Mickey instead of one of both 😕. Also ordered two youth Minnie's and they were perfect..  oh well
1.0,I am 5'5 and 115lb and these are to small
1.0,"They look rather cheap, they look like they belong in my daughters dress up bin."
1.0,I received this mask defective.  I wore it to work and noticed that the wire part was on the chin part of the mask. Very embarrassing. Not happy with this mask.
1.0,The collar and hem wrinkle and bunch in the wash. It’s small.
1.0,don't get me wrong. it's a nice & interesting ring. Problem is it broke after 2 weeks of wearing it. I take very good care of my sterling jewelry & was severely disappointed. If the seller is willing to work with me & repair or replace ring I may change my review.
1.0,I specifically got these rings because it says “stainless steel” it changes color on your finger…
1.0,Broken in less than an hour.
1.0,Thin and smelly
1.0,The neck shape does not look rounded as it should be… is kind of crooked
1.0,Grossly mis-sized. This is even smaller than a JR x-large.
1.0,Don't buy if it is important to you that it's all cotton or mostly cotton. This is definitely mis-labeling.
1.0,"Bought this for my 2 year old for our vacation. The product itself is well made and very cute but it will not fit a younger child. My daughter is 30lbs and this slid right off her wrist. My 4.5 year old, 45lbs fits this fine. Would not recommend for a child under 4."
1.0,Fit very small. I ordered a 2xl and it fit like a medium.
1.0,They were horrible. My daughter did not like them. The colors were awful and the beads were too loose. We are returning them!!!!
1.0,Insanely small!  I ordered an xl and this fits my daughter's American girl doll as a dress.  So so wrong
1.0,"When I tried in the raincoat, it felt like I was wearing my shower curtain.  The material was also very see through and cheaply made. I do not reccomend anyone to buy this raincoat."
1.0,Wore it twice and it tore up the back.....super thin material.... :(
1.0,"I think this material is like nylon, you cannot breathe through it with even without the filter, it's just pulling air from the sides, horrible design."
1.0,Ripped after one use
1.0,This product does not match the website photo at all. We ordered white but it was very beige. Also we ordered our typical sizes (small and medium) but they were WAY too small - even when my “S” partner tried on the “M.” Yuck. Not worth it.
1.0,"Patch was too small, and looked fake"
1.0,This is not the one from social media the material is Flemsy
1.0,"Not a fan at all. Found them to be small, scratchy and gave them away."
1.0,I order the necklace that said kind and queen but I got one that said demon and angle
1.0,"thin, see through, they ripped the first time I wore them"
1.0,Returned. Very thin material and doesn't look anything like the picture.
1.0,don't believe the sizes on the shirt ordered a XXL would fit an extra small person and returning was a hassle couldn't understand the email I received so just gave it to a friend. no stars for this.
1.0,Very very small fit.
1.0,"This item was received broken, I am surprised why would this be sent broken"
1.0,Venía un poco roto
1.0,The waste part is way too big around but too short do it fits terribly. Was a waste of money it is very uncomfortable to try to wear.
1.0,"Very cheap looking.  Would have returned it, but I missed the window due to a family situation."
1.0,"With no reviews to go by, I chose a medium, my typical size. I'm 5'6 130 lbs. it was huge on me and the length is almost below my knees. It looks like I'm wearing a tent! They do not have a size small so for the price I paid of $6.00, I might try to take it in myself."
1.0,This dress was supposed to be a large. The top and sleeves are so narrow and tight. The dress proportions are out of whack! Don’t waste your money!
1.0,Yes this is authentic chain mail but the descriptions are completely inaccurate. The body and arm length are significantly longer than advertised. It also says that it is 15lbs and mine weighs in at 20lbs. everything except the material was falsely advertised. I would like a refund.
1.0,I returned this item because it did not look like the picture. There was no gold on it so the shapes didn’t look defined like they do in the photo. Definitely get what you pay for - very cheap looking.
1.0,"Pretty to look at, but not at all flattering on the ear.  All kidding aside The back ball part resembled a growth behind my ear."
1.0,"Bought this sweater for myself - normally wear an XL, ordered an XL - fit is not loose as shown. Also the color is very different. The lower panel is a blush pink type color in the picture - the sweater arrived with that section as a burnt orange color. I had my daughter try on the sweater. She normally wears a Medium and this XL fit her.<br />Would not purchase again as the color was as large of a deterrent as the fit."
1.0,Sizing is huge. Ordered a 3-6M and it’s at least 2T size as compared to other clothes.
1.0,I have order the watch band under different names three times and none of them fit.
1.0,Poorly made. Breathing filter circle are easy to fall off
1.0,"Too small for my arms. Too short. In the dresses defense, I'm a 6 foot tall powerlifter. Still sad."
1.0,"I was excited to get this, based on the reviews. But the item I received felt like a woven plastic bag. It's like wearing one of those wicker baskets. Also, the arms are really tight. Returning."
1.0,"Not even same jeans! Different color, different waistline, flare leg super small compared to pic. Thank goodness Amazon makes returns so easy. 🙄"
1.0,These cut deeply into my ankles after 6 hours so I have painful red marks and bruising. Also they didn't stay up well. I have other compression socks that were less expensive and more comfortable. I wish I could return these but I already wore them all day. Bummer.
1.0,Too big. The picture makes them appear smaller and they take up your whole earlobe/s.
1.0,"These goggles would have been perfect IF they actually fit over my glasses, and over my helmet! What a fail on this company."
1.0,the armpit part of the dress is too tight
1.0,HORRRRRRRIBLE QUALITY! DONT BUY! BEWARE!
1.0,I ordered these to help with plantar fasciitis but they didn't fit. Now I'm stuck with them because it will cost me a 20% restocking fee and 20% return fee.  It's not worth it for me to pay all that so now I have to find someone who can use them.  Be very careful and read everything carefully before you buy them.
1.0,"Don't waste your money. They're cheap (yes I know they didn't cost much), but really cheap and have a multi colored lenses that you look through. Throws all colors off and gives you a feeling like you're tripping. Unable to wear for more than a few minutes."
1.0,Ordered an XL to be baggy for sleep. Shirt is MASSIVE however can barely get leggings on. They’re almost as if they’re made for a child! How ridiculous.
1.0,Refund don't waste your money
1.0,"Very low quality product.  After a few months of occasional use, while carefully taking them off, one of the legs (temples) snapped at the hinge. It is made out of very soft, low quality plastic.<br /><br />To top it off, I contacted the seller to inquire about the warranty on this product and have not heard back.  Maybe this review will make them contact me."
1.0,You get what you pay for. Would not recommend
1.0,Bracelets turned within 3 wears of them. Did not get them wet or anything. Faded from simply wearing a few times. Very disappointed.
1.0,Shelf Bra and basic crew neck tank ordered in the same size yet the shelf bra was way too small while the tank top fit perfectly.
1.0,I wore this for 1 day and the band broke and the beads went everywhere. Very disappointed.
1.0,Size runs way to small.
1.0,I would have won a wet t shirt contest with this shirt and no water.
1.0,So the way it fits isn't the main focus but the legs are a little tight. Disappointing seeing as I went an extra size up to avoid this issue. My main focus is these pants look like great quality and stylish but in reality it feels like cheap trash. It looks like crap and will give you all the style that Walmart shoppers have. If you are buying this it's probably for comfort and storage so good news for you the main pockets are too small and the leg pockets don't have velcro or close. These pants suck so go to a store and get real ones done make the same mistake as me
1.0,"Ordered a bracelet, I have normal to smallish wrists, this was so small but couldn’t even get the ends to meet let alone clasp!!!"
1.0,Are too small
1.0,Don’t waste your time or money
1.0,I decided to give this one to my mom who is a size 12...
1.0,Same as before h ou w much did I pay for membership? I feel that you have charged me twice for membership
1.0,Didn't like the material as ND chain broke quick
1.0,fits Weird  Will return
1.0,looks too cheap for the pricing it has. My wifes came  with no tags and ripped very disappointing.
1.0,So ugly. I hate that the top is not adjustable and the bottoms are huge. I’m usually a small but these fit like a large. Returning immediately.
1.0,"Grey pants in size medium were too small.  Same pants in black, size medium, fit perfectly."
1.0,Wasn't made well
1.0,save your money this is basically like just putting on under armor definitely not a posture shirt. disappointed for almost 100 bucks
1.0,"Very dark red color, only showed iridescent color when directing a camera flash on the material. Very disappointed. Returned."
1.0,"Cut slim at hips, not suited for a curvy figure. Would be perfect for slim, boy shaped bodies."
1.0,There is a zipper on the side... I order an XL and they still didn’t fit.. they aren’t at all what I thought
1.0,do not fit as expected
1.0,This watch you constantly have to keep moving ur hand or else it stops.  It's great looking but I'm sad to say it's not a functioning watch.  All day I had the wrong time.
1.0,"The shirt fits fine, but didn't have the ""included"" light which defeats the purpose of the shirt."
1.0,This item is a sweater not a wool coat .<br />Material looks and feel like cotton .
1.0,"While this band looks really nice, the magnetic class is so weak it routinely comes on class and watch falls off.  Also the band is almost too thin so it looks disproportionate on the larger Apple Watch. I"
1.0,Cheaply made. Awkward fit. Not worth it.
1.0,Why is there a child with an semi-automatic gun?
1.0,Way too small. Don’t order this top. Cheap quality and you can’t return it.
1.0,"Very unhappy with this purchase.  First of all, the sizing is waaaay off.  I ordered 2 different sets of pajamas, in 3 sizes each, for a total of 6 pairs.  I ordered these in sizes 2T, 7, and 10.  I'm including pictures of these pajamas with Carter's pajamas laying over them.  The carters pajamas are size 2T (dark blue with dump trucks in my photos), size 7 (light blue with seals & polar bears in my photos), and 8 (because I couldn't find a size 10--these are white with snowflakes in my photo). The difference is ridiculous.  These are 100% cotton, so no flame retardant is used and they are supposed to be snug fitting pajamas.  That alone was enough for me to return them.  If that was the only problem I would have just switched the sizes, but I was also not happy with the quality of these.  The print of the polar bears on the pants was not great....in many areas I could see patches of blue coming through, and they weren't even being worn.  I'd imagine that the print would get all faded & cracked after just a few wears.  Also, on the shirt, the polar bear was a very thick, shiny print that was a magnet for lint.  In the photo I'm attaching it looks like it's wet, but that's really just how shiny the print was.  I wanted to like these, because they're really cute, but I was very disappointed."
1.0,Did not like the material.  Too flimsy and it fit a little tight.
1.0,Didn’t care for the material. Difficult to wear.
1.0,"I am a special educator and need my students to be able to read my lips as some have hearing impairments, but these are horrid.  The fit is huge, not sure what is up or down... No bend for nose, it fits weirdly, just overall not a good product!  It fits up terrible, the plastic is so big it sticks to my chin!  The stitching if the plastic is just bunched up, so it's not a clear screen to begin with.  I shipped all the way to Bermuda, as that's where I live and got charged $25+ for shipping!?!?  Please, don't spend your money!"
1.0,Broke while I was putting it on beads went everywhere very disappointed
1.0,"only ONE comes with lobster claws big enough to clip onto anything,  All the others that you get are too small to even maneuver or do anything with. Throw it in the trash. Waste of money. The description is very misleading"
1.0,Small and fack
1.0,Bought this as a gift. It runs really small.
1.0,Not worth the money. These gloves are way too thin I rip more of them putting them on then anything else
1.0,Horrible Fabric.
1.0,Ripped the very first time I wore them. Poor quality. Not worth the price.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:1f10307377d1a8c6fbda1c0ed8f6275b]] I’m pretty frustrated. I have a genuine Under Armour mask, and it’s fantastic, so I decided to try these lighter-weight ones.<br /><br />They’re called “Fashion Masks” on the packaging. No mention of Under Armour since they aren’t genuine! They’re made in China. When you pull the mask out, the two sides are bonded together, and you have to pull them apart. The edges are a bit rough.<br /><br />It feels fine on but is very thin. Cheap.<br /><br />This company also sells one that says “Adidas” (and looks identical in every other way).<br /><br />Don’t buy these."
1.0,The pin’s don’t lock properly; band will come off.
1.0,Construction was way off for size
1.0,There was nothing good about this sweatshirt or the seller. They sell child's sizes and call them unisex. Then give you a hard time when you aren't happy. I double checked the size before ordering and it clearly states in sizing info men's sizes. Do not order from here
1.0,This is terrible. Looks nothing like the photo. So cheap. And is quite ugly in person. It fits a little funny as well. Don't waste your time on this product.
1.0,At least 4 sizes too small.
1.0,"This is gorgeous, but, sadly the sleeves are way too small.  I purchased a 2XL and could barely get my hands into the sleeves so I don't know if the body would fit as I couldn't put it on.  My daughter who wears a Small was able to get the top on but even she struggled a little with the sleeves.  Deeply disappointed as I so wanted to wear this beautiful creation."
1.0,Boots were way too wide and don’t really fit.
1.0,This blouse was such a disappointment. It was WAY too small. Made a great gift.
1.0,ORDERED A 3XL FITS AS A 1X. NEED TO RETURN. MATERIAL FEELS CHEAP AND NOT VERY STRETCHY.
1.0,"This product is not comfortable. Even though it is made of thin fabric (polyester), it is hot and scratches your skin. I do not recommend this cover up. I had the same one in cotton and loved it."
1.0,"I had to send this back, it was cut very large."
1.0,i order<br /> xx larger and still to small  waste on money
1.0,"I wish I could give this shirt zero stars. It took WEEKS to get it. Then when I opened it, the seams are on the outside of the shirt. Also, the color I received looked nothing like the advertised color. Buyer beware."
1.0,Not padded on top. Very thin material. If the actual product is pictured I would be surprised.
1.0,"This fits about 2 sizes smaller than it states, is super thin, and so flimsy. There is no way any posture correcting could come from this. My normal bras and sports bras have more posture support than these. It is so thin it is basically see through and it is a very rough fabric."
1.0,Not the same quality as the original 2020. Very poor construction adjustment does not work. JUNK !!!
1.0,I washed them one time and already had holes. So had to throw away 2 pairs. They run smaller than expected
1.0,"I did not receive the same dress from the photo!! The white of the dress is like a wrinkled linen material (as shown in photo), but the colors at the bottom is NOT  extension of the white fabric! Instead it’s a piece of striped color cotton sewed to the bottom (not even the same colors shown in photo). In addition, a sticker tag was placed on the inside of what is the FRONT of the dress instead of the back (thicker to cover cheat/breast area). I’m not returning it because I need a swimsuit coverup for my daughter, but don’t feel that I received what I ordered!!!<br /><br />I just scrolled at the additional photos of the product and actually found what I received, the the photos of the girl wearing the dress.... NOT THE SAME!!"
1.0,"Quality is good but sizing is off, way off"
1.0,I followed the sizing guidelines and purchased these.  They are huge.......I could wear 2 sizes smaller.  They also ride up terribly bad.  I would not purchase again or recommend!!!
1.0,"It broke like a month afterwards and I didn’t even use it everyday. But for what it was worth, it was beautiful!"
1.0,Poorly stitched. The inseam sticks out at the shoulders just a cheaply made piece of garbage.
1.0,I bought a 3X long. Could not button it up. Much smaller than advertised.
1.0,Gloves are not as described. In 35-degree weather my fingers were freezing. They are not warm at all. Do not recommend these gloves.
1.0,"Item delivered 6/23/2029. Today, 8/24, item is completely unusable! Machine washed on delicate since purchased and it came out today with the seam on left from shoulder to bottom detached."
1.0,not a good product at all.
1.0,I bought this in an xl and it doesn't fit. It is for women with no boobs. Ugh was excited about it.
1.0,Arrived broken.  Waited too late to return.  Would not purchase again or recommend.
1.0,Too complicated!!
1.0,If you are bustier like me you will need a coupke sizes up. No stretch to the fabric at all.
1.0,The pins are extremely hard to get in an out to adjust the band. The band breaks all the time. The watch face cracked.
1.0,"When I recieved these watch bands neither of them fit my 42mm Galaxy Watch.<br />I was disappointed, because the description stated that the bands are able to fit the Galaxy watch."
1.0,One wash of this poorly made product and they are falling apart
1.0,Poor quality fabric. A rip off!
1.0,Not nearly as nice as the photo and the sizing is a joke.
1.0,Package came with soap costume only
1.0,I work in a freezer and these gloves are crap
1.0,Potato sack<br />Save yourselves the trouble dont gamble like I did you might just be left holding the bag . Brought this dress along with another one to have a choice as to which one I would wear to my God daughters wedfing which is this Saturday. An Epic Fail both dresses missed the mark. Horrific run the other way do not take a risk on this dress
1.0,"false claims as usual.  Many promoters have made unfounded claims for the ability of amber to improve night vision. They have employed mass solicitation, usually by mail. The Federal Trade Commission has correctly ruled that such practices are illegal since the lenses do not perform as claimed.&#34; - Forensic Aspects of Vision and Highway Safety&#34;, Merrill J. Allen, O.D., Ph.D., Et al<br /><br />While yellow lenses can be effective for foggy or hazy daylight conditions, they are not effective against headlight glare and should not be worn at dusk or night"
1.0,Lenses outer film deteriorated in a short time.
1.0,Not much of anything in the paydirt only 3 little flakes of gold  2 little pieces of silver and no platinum at all hope you're luck is better than mine
1.0,I love this but it's way too short to be a dress on me. I would wear it as a top but it's too tight on the bust. I know I should have sent it back sooner but I put it away and forgot about it. I would love to get it in a larger size xl would that be possible
1.0,Upon opening it I noticed right away that the seam stitching is pretty weak. I'm a size 7/8 and ordered two sizes up for just in case and it barely covered me! I hate troubling with returning items so had to order a different pair from elsewhere for before my trip. I have a bubble but so maybe it's not for bubble butts? lol Bummer. The seller was good about sending it right out though. Good seller.. Not so good product for me.
1.0,"Fit everywhere but the bust, was not as casual and loose as I expected."
1.0,Bought 3 and the supposed 5xl was the only one that fit anyone and she's The smallest daughter that wears a size 8/10 Misses. Real disappointed 😞. Need a refund immediately.
1.0,The gloves are ridiculously too large.  My husband is 6 foot and has really large hands and the gloves are even too big for him.
1.0,"I got a regular long pair months ago, fit great, last long as I ordered a 3x. This time after quite a few months I decided to get myself a capri pair at the same size. It runs at LEAST a size or two SMALLER than the 3x I originally got. Dissapointing"
1.0,These cami’s are not flattering. The thin straps are really thin and flimsy looking. The white cami is kind of see through so you can see the paddings. Not flattering at all.
1.0,"It is not a sweatshirt that is what the picture shows, but a tshirt, very thin material. Very disappointed on this purchase. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1.0,Not true to size at all so Disappointed
1.0,Broken poor quality
1.0,"This was very pretty when it arrived, but before long it turned a terrible ugly color. I only wore it once or twice and stored it in a jewelry box. Do not recommend."
1.0,I live the shape of their glasses but I was disappointed the frames had glass lenses. When I wanted to add the Rx it broke the glasses. It's not made to get Rx put in them.
1.0,Terrible fabric. Cut is way shorter than image shown. Spend your money elsewhere
1.0,this  bag  is  so  small  more  for  a child to  expensive  do  not  recommend.
1.0,Cheap material. Returned
1.0,"I didn't like it at all, it was very thin, and the color was not what I ask for, I asked for red, and it was orange. so I returned it."
1.0,The best way to describe this shirt in blue is the painting shirts we had as kids for art class.
1.0,Uncomfortable to wear; difficult to put on and take off.
1.0,Return because they fit tight on me
1.0,I ordered the XL. It fit great EXCEPT there was absolutely no room for breasts. I'm a DD and the bust was designed for someone no larger than a B. Extremely disappointing because it was really cute otherwise.
1.0,I don't like at all
1.0,The product is poor. And the color fades too. I am so disappointed In it
1.0,"Well this thing didn’t even last a full hour, it’s huge like a size 12? It's too big for my thumbs even. I snapped a pic for size reference. The way the metals are soldered together is so cheap, off, and flimsy. I really do love the elephant pendant but the execution of functionality is poor."
1.0,It's extremely small and poorly made.
1.0,Tiny.  Doesn't fit at all as pictured.
1.0,"cheap looking, more like a cover up or pj's than an actual dress :("
1.0,"Extremely see through. I had on seamless, nude underwear and you could see it."
1.0,This is a poor made outfit . Shorts are cute but jacket does not look anything like the model and it’s looks like a lab coat . Material is not ver giving and or nice . Color is though as expected . Very vibrant
1.0,It feels like filled of paper inside. Like I cringe of weird sounds when pressing it. supposed to be fluffy and chubby. I'm sorry bunny but I am not going to keep you. Will return.
1.0,Very cheap looking item... Threads hanging everywhere.
1.0,"This picture is nothing like the shirt I received. It doesn’t have the same look or cut and it is more sheer than the picture. I don’t think I’ll even be able to try to make it look good, so I’ll be sending it back!"
1.0,"Honestly, the worst quality fabric I've ever felt in my life. They're also a very strange shape. The waist is too large but the thighs are strangely small."
1.0,Not a real size 16 at all. Too small!
1.0,I returned these. They are huge.
1.0,"sem came apart within two weeks, took a long time to recieve in the mail."
1.0,Bought to wear on the airplane.  Too uncomfortable to wear at all.  Tried to give them to someone with very skinny legs and they gave them back.
1.0,Horrible quality! I was not expecting it to be top of the line but I received it and the inside was falling out. The holes on the side were not fully through and the backs are smushed in. Pictures listed
1.0,wore twice and broke.  Returned
1.0,"It is wayyyyy to small for my chest! I sized up a size from my normal size, and it won’t even button the smallest button!!! But I absolutely need this dress for a pinup event since I have nothing else to wear. Looks like I’ll be sewing a Modesty panel in"
1.0,"Socks felt great, but developed holes after first time of wear."
1.0,"I ordered a size larger so I got an 18, these fit my size 8 grandmother perfectly 🙃 Ridiculous"
1.0,I even tried to cut the opening bigger but it was still too uncomfortable to wear!
1.0,Fabric didn’t look as nice in the photo and it’s too short. Short and wide
1.0,Ordered up in sizes because of all the reviews. Don't order this shirt if your more than a medium because im pretty sure that's what a 3x is.
1.0,You cannot see the engraving... It's tiny... This is also not pandora comparable despite the search results... Refunded with ease
1.0,"Thin, cheap but was expensive for what I got"
1.0,"Like, I don’t even know what to say here. What a huge let down. These shorts look so cool but the sizing is so incredibly off. I’m a 28 waist. I ordered the large. As you can see, I’m a good 2 inches away from even being able to button them. I could barely get them off my butt.. I want to give them to my tiny petite friend, but I also want to see if I can maybe just add a side panel to make the waist an actual 28. I would absolutely not recommend these to anyone with a waist larger than 26 inches."
1.0,After about. Month of wear turned colors and skin also.
1.0,Pattern and fabric does not match. Tie and bow are a darker flannel material.
1.0,"My original review of these pants was glowing. But my subsequent orders have failed to live up to that review.  Since my first order I have ordered 2more pairs of xxl at different times. The first pair was cut and sewn strangely resulting in a very poor fit.  On my 2nd attempt I was sent an xl instead of the xxl I ordered, which I verified.  I already had an xl to which I compared this mistakenly sent xl and found the second pair was not only the wrong size (should have been the xxl) but it was also much much smaller than the xl I already have.  I won’t be ordering from this company again as their quality assurance is extremely poor. It was pure luck that the first xxl fit."
1.0,Misleading. Only received the top.
1.0,Not sterling and detail rubbed off - charm is copper colored now
1.0,"Sizes are extremely small, ordered a XXL and would not button over my chest... also length is super short"
1.0,much too thin
1.0,"Returning bag, poor quality!"
1.0,"Poor quality and doesn’t fit. I am 5’5” and 130lbs with athletic build and this product was incredibly uncomfortable to try and fit on, I ordered a medium because of the dimensions listen and it’s incredibly cheap material with one way stretch. I wanted this to be way cuter than it was, now im just trying to return it."
1.0,Do Not Buy!! They do not work
1.0,Yikes. This dress is all wrong on me. Could’ve been pretty but I look like a kid dressing in her mom’s clothes and the wide skirt hit my hips weird so I looked like a sail to a ship. I found way better quality dresses VFShow on amazon.
1.0,"Material is thin, a little see through, itchy, and probably not breathable. It looks like a nightgown but I wouldn’t even wear it for that because of how the material feels. Going to process a return. It fits too tight in the chest area and I’m a 34/36. The length was right at my knees."
1.0,XXL is way to small. Sizing chart needs to be better. I was really looking forward to wearing these. Now I will need to give them to a small child. Very dissatisfied.
1.0,The material was so thin it wasn’t comfortable. Definitely would order a size up if you’re thinking about buying.
1.0,It came damaged.
1.0,I ordered these for work purposes. Brought them with me to have them put the lip ring where I had it pierced. Was told they aren't even big enough. Couldn't use them so a waste of money.
1.0,Too small and  requested a 5x because the 3x was too small need a much bigger size.Thatnrand runs on the too small size. I guess I need a 7 x
1.0,came completely broken.
1.0,Way to small didn't fit my two year old daughter seems like it would fit a doll and not warm at all way too thin
1.0,"I have loved every Mountain Hardwear product I have used and was extremely excited about saving up enough money for this jacket for a 4 day backpacking trip in Aspen, CO. Unfortunately on Day 1 of our trip bushes along the trail brushed the side of the jacket causing the shoulder to rip open. I had been wearing my jacket for not even 2 hours before it completely tore open and started pouring out down. A small flexible bush branch shouldn't completely rip open a jacket advertised as outdoor equipment, especially under the name Mountain Hardwear. I am very disappointed I did not even get one good use out of a brand that I have loved on a jacket I paid hundreds of dollars for. Would not recommend to anyone. Spend your money on another option. I also reached out to Customer service multiple times with no response."
1.0,This item was broken when I received it.
1.0,This hat looks nice
1.0,It definitely runs very small and is actually very odd shapes and cheaply made. I will be returning mine. I don't recommend it.
1.0,Not true to size definitely size up a size or two
1.0,The color was not the same as the picture but materials was good
1.0,"not cute at all, frumpy. super thin. SUPER DUPER short arms. Buttons barely sewed on, just cheap."
1.0,"This dress wasn’t flattering at all. I actually ended up cutting the bottom half off, and wearing it as a top. Anything below the waist was very flat and doesn’t fit the body. It has potential, but it wasn’t for me!"
1.0,The material is too thin and reveals too much.
1.0,Horrible! The balls literally crumbled in my fingers like they were made of sand when I was screwing them on! And I know for sure my fingers are not that strong.
1.0,"Nothing I like about this anklet, too small and broke just as soon as I got it."
1.0,"I fell in love with this necklace because of the color and had to order it! When I got the package, it was a complete letdown. The color was completely off, a weird shade of pink and the necklace looked so cheap. I contacted the seller for returns 10 days ago and am yet to hear. Don't waste your money on this."
1.0,Came of when wearing
1.0,these are like to pieces of cardboard sewn together with the scratchiest felt around it. they are awful!
1.0,cheaply made. paint started peeling off after a week. dont waste time
1.0,Not even sort of the same bag as pictured - this is either a knockoff or just misrepresentation.
1.0,The latch is not made of spring steal and will not stay latched.  The bracelet fell off the second day worn and the latch will no longer hold.  Returned for refund...
1.0,The gray in the sweatsuit is more like a pewter which I didn’t care for too much. Additionally the colors on the suit don’t match each other🥴 The last photo is a true light gray comparison.
1.0,Not happy at all! Before I purchased I checked the size chart got a size bigger and its still small. Very annoyed and not pleased at all....
1.0,"Had to return, their largest size was too small for my size 12 feet."
1.0,This bag is nice to look at but it only lasted a few days. It is large and obviously  intended to hold a lot— but it cannot. One of the grommets immediately came out and the bag had to be discarded right away.
1.0,These lasted one week before the bow came off and the buckle.
1.0,It's so tiny you can just break it by looking at it.  It's like nothing you've ever seen in your life; it's a deceitful product don't buy it.
1.0,Was not a shoe
1.0,"Since I received these socks we have recharged the batteries to full charge 5 times. The first time they lasted about 5 hours on the lowest (green) setting. On the 5th time they lasted about 1.5 hours on the green setting. The battery life after the first charge was not very impressive, but now they are almost worthless after less than 2 months. Not sure if his is typical, or maybe we just got a couple of bad battery packs. In either case, we now have a $50 pair of regular old socks. Not happy at all."
1.0,Stitching that connected the back adjustment strap to the hat literally just fell out the second time the hat was worn.  It fit me out of the box and was worn loosely so definitely defective stitching as I never even adjusted the hat..  Returned it.  Was a shame because otherwise it was a very nice hat.
1.0,They were broken when i recieved them.
1.0,"This product is nothing what it shows or describes. Cheaply made, and looks nothing like the picture.  Very disappointed. Would not recommend this at all"
1.0,"My daughter ordered these for the look, specifically the blue lenses to go with her swim team outfit. They have yellow lenses and a different case. Even the frame on the goggles is different.<br />We returned immediately."
1.0,Picture is deceitful. Fabric cheap and sheds. Front is longer than back. Back of jacket is very short. Misrepresentation of merchandise. I’m extremely mad. Returned it asap
1.0,The dress is cute but came with a horrible fishy smell. Would not buy again for this reason
1.0,There nice shoes but way to small I wear a 9 in other Sandles and tennis shoes but these size 9 sandles squish the sides of my feet have not even worn them yet due to can’t walk with my feet being squished
1.0,Purchased these as a gift for a friend's bday gift. As soon as the she tried them on the zipper broke not very well made at all. I was so embarrassed.
1.0,Se rompieron de 2 usa no son buena
1.0,"Came apart,and I never even put it on,the rose just came off,no good"
1.0,These are the cheapest looking things I have ever seen. And the lenses are so thin they are like a film.  Don’t buy.
1.0,It ran REALLY small.  The fabric was very thin; you could see through it.  The construction was very poor.
1.0,"Very cheap material, too cheap to be moisture wicking. Very short length."
1.0,This sweatshirt is very strange looking. The material for the stripes are an odd shiny material. I tried to return it but no response.
1.0,"I received my sweater today I ordered an XL because from reading all the  reviews it runs small so I figured an XL would fit best it's way too huge and worst part is it came with 3 holes in it..Horrible material,, I'm very disappointed. Waste of money"
1.0,The right shoe did not work even after I tried charging it
1.0,My son really liked the band but broke very quickly. Very disappointed that it didn’t even last a month.
1.0,This item came in way to big it's not an actual size fit. I ordered more clothes from Amazon it's taking way longer for clothes to come in then anything else
1.0,It was really nice when delivered.
1.0,"Padding is too hard, very uncomfortable. It feels like falling on small stones."
1.0,Just fits all wrong. This dress could be so cute but it’s very strangely<br />Cut.
1.0,These pants don't stretch very much. They are super tight on my calves and I have to constantly pull them up at the waist. I would have returned them but they charge a restocking fee.
1.0,"super thin, nothing like the picture"
1.0,"Finally wore the bag and it tore open with just a lipstick, iPhone, and visa inside."
1.0,"My wife liked the keychain, but after she used it one day if fell off the keychain.. No where to be found!"
1.0,"Very poorly made. The red tassels are not as reflected in the photo. The tread is not as heavy and flowing as in the picture but is  very light, uneven and asymmetrical  . Just a waste of money. It went to Goodwill. I figured it would be more trouble to send it back."
1.0,It's sad that this company is charging $55 for a pack of masks during this Coronavirus pandemic knowing that people are desperate. I'll pass.
1.0,"These shoes showed up with uneven band widths.  One band is insanely loose and the other is insanely tight. Honestly, not worth returning for the price. I'm"
1.0,"Pretty and not heavy. However, they literally fell apart into several pieces after first wear. :("
1.0,It’s just printed on there it looks bad
1.0,"Ok, so, the pictures look great, and I was tempted and bought this ring. The only positive thing is that it fit. The gold is clunky and thicccc thick looking. It's much bigger than it appears to be in the picture. Or maybe I have small hands? Either way, the stones were not even in the pattern of a rainbow! Disappointed."
1.0,Not what I expected! Sending this back
1.0,"Way too small for me.  Fabric is lightweight and it pretty, but the XXL ran small."
1.0,No good..
1.0,It’s too small. I ended up getting refund.
1.0,"the color is not the one in the image, which is a very bright blue, it is really pale and the color varies, one earring is lighter than the other.  Disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,Band feels plastic and too cheap
1.0,I have bought many cheap nose studs. This was a whole other level of cheap. Every rhinestone fell out within 3 days of wearing.  Every single one.
1.0,I order a S and M and the invisible zipper on both burst. My mom had to sew me into the dress as I needed to wear it that day. Other than that... cute dress.
1.0,"It looks MUCH better in the photos, but it's made of cheap light plastic. It makes your fancy Apple watch look like a toy. It's going back."
1.0,"The “gold” coating broke as soon as I took them out of the box, right in the bend where the earring meets the ear when it’s on. Had an immediate response to it and the whole place got infected. Don’t buy these."
1.0,Product is not as described.  No compression at all.
1.0,"This is a completely inaccurate description of this item, it is very heavy, it is not rose gold it is completely white! And the picture does not show any white on it at all.... and now I'm stuck because can't even return it because of all this corona crap...... DO NOT BUY!!!"
1.0,These goggles scratched up after a few days of wearing them. I have only been wearing them for 2 weeks and can barely see out of them. Poor quality.
1.0,I wasn't happy.
1.0,I had to throw these away.  The chemical smell was so overwhelming even after washing three times.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"It fit ok, after 2 washes decal has started cracking badly."
1.0,"It broke immediately as I was putting it on for the first time,,!! And....no....it wasn't too small and I was not pulling n it....just popped."
1.0,I bought this key ring last month. Key ring already broke off. What a waste of money.
1.0,It's way too big and you really cant press anything on your phone and it gets ball of fuzz after one use.
1.0,"Uncomfortable straps set way too close to the neck, creating added pressure. That plus boob loaf, don't bother."
1.0,Romper was way to big my daughter wears 18 to 24 month that's what I ordered and it swallowed her also note the picture the bows are just strips of fabric you tie yourself waste of my time to order
1.0,"I thought I was waiting months for this shirt because it was on back order, but it actually shipped from China.  It took ages to get to me and I thought it was going to show up a soft, cotton shirt, but it came as a cheap polyester shirt.  It was labeled as black but as the material stretches, it looks navy (probably because it is white on the inside).  The leopard part also has random green spots of dye and it looks like something got on it.  Do not waste your time or money on this shirt!"
1.0,For the price this was very disappointing. Smaller than expected and cheap looking. I was not impressed with the quality of the amber for the price paid. All and all a disappointment and it was returned.
1.0,The ball on the buckle fell off after a couple of days.
1.0,The quality is horrible and neck looked crooked when I put it on
1.0,Este reloj salió averiado solo funciona unos instantes y se detiene.<br />Una lastima<br />P
1.0,Melted after 5 seconds on the press at 320 degrees. Not for sublimation.
1.0,"So the crazy looking reflective shorts 🩳 stood out as an interesting buy for a festival I was soon attending.<br /><br />Well be aware it by no means looks like the pictures. It's just grey shorts, with a very faint reflective coating. Totally returning this junk."
1.0,Way too small! You can see my original bag is what I was really looking for! So I need to return and order a larger one the same size as you see in the picture.
1.0,Bad fit ! Huge and missing tie
1.0,"Half the airflow does not hit your face.  Not the best design.  Otherwise, a fine odd looking hat."
1.0,Bought the bracelet and the first one broke. I was returned it and sent another one and that cord ended up breaking also. Unable to return as all of the beads were lost.
1.0,Came broken. Very cheaply made
1.0,The vest was too small.  I cannot write a review.<br />I had to return the item.
1.0,Size extra large for my daughter who is a size small
1.0,Wrong size I ordered 00 but what I got was smaller
1.0,"Bought for my bridal shower but will be returning. I ordered the blue with white floral print but the dress arrived in a very dark navy leopard print. Most edges are serged, not hemmed, and there is loose thread dangling from the ruffles in the skirt (see picture)."
1.0,Ordered two xxl and it would<br />only fit my wife in my most desirable dreams:-)
1.0,"I ordered Mens XL, these are kids sizes.  Don't order they are false advertising."
1.0,Really weird fit. Returning.
1.0,"It fits very loose all over but then has these tiny armholes?? I don't have large arms or shoulders, it's just made very poor :(<br />Another item tossed into donation bag!"
1.0,Much too long
1.0,"The description picture makes you think that you will receive a pair of form fitting slacks with a nice weight to them, instead you get very loose thin cheap fabric that is not form fitting and has no shape to them. Waiting in anticipation for my deliver was a waste of time."
1.0,I don’t have this so I must have returned it.
1.0,"Are you kidding, an XXL was more like a small."
1.0,"Lo usé 2 veces y el tejido ya empieza a lucir gastado. La pretina inferior, que entalla la cintura, ya se aflojó. Al borde de la cremallera tenía hilos sueltos. Es de pésima calidad!"
1.0,"barely two months and thrown away, it broke"
1.0,"Love casios, but this one let me down. the green light works but just barely, it’s very dim."
1.0,Color is much more of a peachy color
1.0,It doesn't come with a place to put the button threw
1.0,Beautiful pants ridiculously sized
1.0,I purchased this as a gift for a woman in my church who loves Hello Kitty.  I did not notice until someone pointed it out to her that it is pointing the middle finger!!
1.0,After one wear ripped and he's only 3 months.  Very disappointed cause I love the outfit.
1.0,"Way too overpriced for less than a pound of cheap plastic. Poor quality, poorly decorated. Horrible product and horrible costumer service."
1.0,"Was excited to were this comfortable outfit on my plan ride. However, the material is very thin and shiny. Was expecting for the material to be more sturdy."
1.0,Ugly......
1.0,Terrible. Snapped right in but could feel the looseness of the lenses. Do not buy.
1.0,"looks like a pajama shirt, not what I expected,  picture makes it look likes its cotton or fleece material. Feels like spandex material. Looks cheap."
1.0,"Not really looking at all, will never wear, would be good play Kelley for a kid if it was a smaller size"
1.0,"$27 to buy it, $20 to engrave it at the mall. . .2 days for it to fall apart.  Not a reliable way to be identified in an emergency.  Love the concept & style, hate the execution."
1.0,"I ordered the “D Sky Blue”. Instead of a faded pale colored dress I received a bright bold bluish purple and pink dress. Totally different colors than the listing. The colors are so off putting. It’s super ugly. Besides that, it fits like a frumpy robe. Very unflattering, disproportional, and absolutely cut and sewn differently than the dress in the photos."
1.0,Fits as expected. But when I finally put it on I went to put my hand in the pocket and realized that the pocket was not fully sewn shut. So it is useless
1.0,"Don't buy it. It looks nothing like the picture. The whole mask is BLUE! And, of course, not returns are allowed. I wish I would have read the reviews before buying. I was in a rush. Just hoping someone will read mine and won't make the same mistake."
1.0,I returned it as soon as I got it. It looked awful and cheap in person. It was super long but tight when I tried it on too.
1.0,"I have the original Magpul strap but I liked other Leofoto gear (mini tripod) so I thought I'd give the Leofoto strap a try.  I used it trouble-free for months, but this weekend on a simple walk I heard the most awful sound and turned to see my Sony A1 and 100-400 laying on the concrete.  The strap had been connected to a Kirk QD lens plate that was firmly mounted to the Sony 100-400 lens, and the strap let go of the plate, allowing the camera and lens to crash to the ground.  At first I was surprised and assumed that I had failed to fully engage the QD connector, and I blamed myself.  But when I picked the camera up and firmly inserted the straps QD connector firmly into the QD receiver onthe lens plate, I was shocked to see that with a moderate tug, I could pull the camera/lens right off of the connector.  I grabbed my Magpul strap when I got home and tried the same thing on the camera found that it held firm.  I'm not a big patron of Magpul as it is a firearms company, but I will be using their straps, NOT Leofoto's.  I now face an expensive repair bill as my lens sustained some minor damage on the camera mount plate and it is on it's way to a Sony service center for repair."
1.0,I saw these shoes and just HAD to get a pair for my son. My mom bought a pair for him and those didn't work only the left foot lit up and they'd were a inch or two small. ( if you buy a pair AND they work. Make sure you order a size larger they are a little snug)  I had to return them. So I saw these and thought there were better than the ones she bought. They were from the same company but different style shoe. I figured there wouldn't be a problem. Again here are the new pair plugged them in charged them and then only the right foot worked. I should be able to purchase something and they work. Not keep returning them after one use.
1.0,Bands are very stiff and doesn't always snap on to my Fitbit.
1.0,"The quality and appearance are very good.  But the side which shows is too large to fit through the shirt button holes so you must button the shirt by sliding the back plate through all shirt holes rather than the  conventional way a shirt it buttoned.  This makes it very awkward to button the shirt.  The studs are completely backwards.  I made it do for the occasion, but do not recommend and will look for another set.  Not a big loss at $11, just lots of aggravation."
1.0,"I'm a 44D and I ordered an XL, which according to the chart should fit but the cups were sooo tiny there was side boob all over the place!  No chance of ever wearing this, unfortunately.  Would have been super cute if the cups were proportional."
1.0,I have 3 skirts I cannot wear. Unlike the fabric the elastic is rough and chafes--it's so uncomfortable! Very dissapointing
1.0,Horrible. Look for yourself
1.0,Sort of feels like a sports jersey. Also super thin
1.0,"The color and graphic on the shirt are exactly like the picture. The fabric is very soft and has a good weight to it. The fit however is very large! When you click on the size chart blue link it states that a small is size 0-2. This is a mens size small, not ladies. Sadly it will be going back."
1.0,Its very hard to charge watch
1.0,"Update: While this winder seems to be well-made, every watch I have on it stops if it is left on the winder for between two days and a week. The four watches on the winder are: 16610 Rolex Submariner, Oris Big Crown ProPilot 41mm, 1966 Omega Seamaster and a Seiko Cocktail Time. Each watch eventually stops on this winder - the Rolex after only a few days, even at 1850 TPD. The Oris stops after about a week. The Seiko, somewhere in-between. Strangely, perhaps, the vintage Omega lasts longest, sometimes up to 10 days without winding. At first I thought it was just the Sub and that there might be something wrong with its rotor - but after wearing it for a week straight, it never stopped and kept perfect time. Then I noticed the others stopping too. My guess is that either I got a bad one, or it's a design flaw having to do with the angle of the winders. I'd be interested if anyone else has experienced this.<br /><br />Second update, Jan. 2021: All my self-winding mechanical watches have stopped on this thing. It's basically a display box at this point. It's really disappointing."
1.0,Arrived broken so disappointing
1.0,Purchased as a 2x and came to me as size small adult. My daughter put it on and fit perfectly. Will be returning.
1.0,Liked not a thing.  Worst produce ever bought.  Amazon should be ashamed for selling such a poor piece of merchandise.
1.0,"This is not the dress I got. The dress I received  in not a V neck. It’s a cute dress, but not at all what I wanted. False advertising!!!"
1.0,Inexpensive but looks very cheap.  Could not give as a gift as intended.
1.0,Wore it once and was pulling it up all day. The cups are too small but a larger size would have been too big around my body. Very uncomfortable.
1.0,"Items are cute but unusable. I ordered 0-3 months as baby will be a newborn and newborn size isn't an option. Package said size 3m. I opened it and onesie is European size 70! That's the equivalent of a 9m onesie. This is not a one-off mistake as both the 1st Christmas and 1st New Year onsies, and tutus are size 70."
1.0,Just don't buy it!! Trust me! The pictured skirt is no where near what the actual skirt looks like! It's a very thin material that looks more like a simple flat swim suit bottom wrap; there is no pleated or flowy feature to this as the seller states. You would have to buy at least 4 of these to acquire the amount of material the pictured skirt has.
1.0,These socks are awful. They are very short and do not stay up. I am returning them.
1.0,Is was itchy and cheep looking.
1.0,Necklace looked so old and worn out. Not happy with the look at all.
1.0,Very heavy and looks cheap
1.0,"I was excited to see this swimsuit online, however in person it is terrible. The fabric is thin and the top is weirdly sewn. I have a bunch of workout tops this style and find them to be super supportive in the bust and comfy, but this swimsuit is cheap and the bust has zero support. If like me you see this and think YES! I love my workout tops like this perfect! just don’t waste your time it’s not great. I would give zero stars if I could."
1.0,Shirt came but had underarm stains on both arms. Yuk!
1.0,I received the damaged item.
1.0,"I ordered the burgundy and it’s more of a dull brown color, the material is that of a T-shirt. Very disappointed and returning."
1.0,"With the 1st wash it came out with all these lint balls. It is sewn together poorly. You shouldn't charge more than $15-$20.00 dollars because you can tell it is made poorly when you wear it. I am now using the outfit as pj""s."
1.0,The jeweler misspelled the name “Faith” instead they spelled FAILH.
1.0,Don't waste your money.  Broke in less than a month under normal use.  Never used for anything except wearing to work (desk job) and around the house.  Never got wet.  Just poor quality.
1.0,The earrings arrived broken and taped together! As crazy as that sounds it is accurate
1.0,"The ruck came in really fast other than looking really good, the ruck is very cheaply made which all the inside stitch came undone within the first 3 days of using it, also 2 of zippers have already broken. Overall for the price of the ruck I can't be mad because it turned out to be a lemon!!!"
1.0,I guess you get what you pay for. Watch arrived and looked good but it didn’t run.
1.0,Much smaller than typical sizes in USA
1.0,Ordered size I wear however it did not fit way too small had to return...
1.0,just didn't work.
1.0,The fabric was a funky shiny stiff.<br />The pattern was pretty but they were two sizes too small
1.0,"This is a costume, not a formal dress. I found it to be poorly made. The dress shows a floor length gown. It’s actually a high-lo with a train. The top is itchy to the child. The back buttons were not properly sewn on. The buttons were sewn to the loops as well as to the dress. It would be okay for Halloween or play time."
1.0,"Not worth the cost. Comfort is OK, but purchased better fitting underwear for $13.00 for a 4 pack at Costco, NOT $20.00!"
1.0,"Stolen product from MacDoesIt. Get your own ideas, thief."
1.0,The insides are completely ripped up after a little over a month. Poorly made.
1.0,The fabric pattern of this dress looks nothing like the pictures. I felt like it was a very childish print. The dress made me feel like it was something I would have had as a little girl to play dress up. I wish I would have gotten a picture before returning it.
1.0,These are so thin you could see a freckle on your back end. Beware
1.0,Love the look!  There are so thin and fragile.  When you put the back on it literally bends the post.  I don’t think I will be able to wear these too many time before the post breaks off.<br />I wish the gauge of material (silver) was better quality.
1.0,This hat was just plain ugly and I donated to Goodwill.
1.0,Beautiful but not a good purchase.
1.0,"Do not order this if you are expecting a sweatshirt that has a tye-dyed look. It is seriously ugly, horrible fabric and it came with big whitish spots on the front. So cheap looking, hope I don’t have to send it back to China and wait for refund. Waiting for a response from customer service."
1.0,The watch band
1.0,picture clearly shows a burgundy suit with gray IT's RED with black lapel it's not a slim fit
1.0,I liked the material sizing was way too big on the sleeves..
1.0,Product came with sewing defects!!
1.0,"Bad quality, save your money"
1.0,"The picture shows a black shirt with black stitching.  I received a black shirt with white stitching.  Its hideous.  Not happy with material either.  I wanted a T-shirt, this material feels nothing like cotton.  Its thick and just not at all what I expected.  If you want a t-shirt make sure you order 100% cotton.  I'll be returning this.  I ordered another one as well but I haven't received it yet.<br /><br />Returning second shirt as well.  Stitching much more pronounced than on photos.  And material is too thick.  Not a fan."
1.0,"These are not kids masks. Way too big. They fit my face well, but I don’t need anymore masks, the kids do!"
1.0,I ordered the 6pc silver set and ended up only receiving a 4pc set.
1.0,"Waste of money. I would have returned it but ripped when I tried it on. Very cheap, thin material."
1.0,"It looks exactly like in the picture, but the sizing is totally off. I had ordered XXL and when it came I was really disappointed with the sleeve and body length."
1.0,What in the world is this dress? Definitely not as pictured. There is no lining. It's pretty much a mesh thing. Quality is pretty crappy too. Waste of money.
1.0,"I payed was a size 12, and got tricked!! You gave me a size 11 with a size 12 sticker, and I wonder why they didn't fit and was way too tight!!!!! Never again"
1.0,Uncomfortable<br />gave them away cause the nose area was supper irritating for some reason.
1.0,The zipper came right off of the right front pocket the second I tried them on. Garbage.
1.0,Definitely made with cheap materials
1.0,This machine is a pile of junk that's all I got to say about it it doesn't work very well at all
1.0,It looked nice... wore it my first day of school. By lunch it was broke. Very disappointed. My husband tried to fix it but it was unfixablez
1.0,The neck is weirdly wide and the shirt (size L for me) shrinks such that it ends up very short and wide.
1.0,They fell apart right away….dollar store crap
1.0,"i’ve had if for about a month now and i don’t wear it everyday and it’s already turning silver. it’s a shame because it’s really cute, probably my favorite necklace"
1.0,Very poor quality! The glitter has all almost fallen off and one of the ears has almost broken off.  :(
1.0,Clip broke off after about 2 weeks (normal use)
1.0,"Junk. Flimsy, weak, thin. Couldn't handle one key on another keychain."
1.0,Very small. Don't stay in my ears.
1.0,Where’s the top part????
1.0,Colors are OFF
1.0,It’s only 3 mo old and zipper won’t work
1.0,No good isnothing like the picture
1.0,To small they won't fit in a eyebrow etc they are way to small around
1.0,"I had big expectations for these socks and they are a huge disappointment. I tried a pair of black ones in a pair of booties and they seemed fine, with little riding down. This morning I've got a pair of nude ones with pumps. Absolutely horrible fit and fabric. In 2 minutes they were down in the shoes and when I tried to pull them back they ripped off. Do not recommend at all!<br /><br />Update 04/04/2017: So far,  I went through additional 4 pairs, black & nude, and I stand by my initial rating. These socks can't be wear with pumps, just with boots, to not be seen how easy they ride down.They fit on my feet as in the picture, but they stay that way only for few minutes."
1.0,"Ordered XL, unfortunately they will barely fit my wife. Much less. 200lb adult man."
1.0,"Though the style is cute, the chain is really thin and the necklace looks cheap overall. The round charm at the end was received with the gold chipping off on the edges."
1.0,"Came broken sadly, love the earrings but they wont clasp shut so cant wear them. Too big of a pain to return"
1.0,I ordered an 1/2 and got 7/16. I know this to be true because they match up perfectly with my current gauages.
1.0,"Kill your feet, plastic cuts into the  toe and sides of your feet!  They also make your feet sweat in the heat and slide around.  I would not recommend!"
1.0,Very difficult to get on and off.
1.0,I’m not pleased at all.... the adhesive peels off and sticks to ur fingers and your breast which brings me to my point tht it doesn’t hold up. 👎👎👎👎👎👎
1.0,My son's right shoe won't charge. 😣 He only wore them once! He's so bummed!
1.0,Broke on the second day I wore it. Total bummer.
1.0,"If you are looking for minimal coverage these are the 'pasties,' for you!"
1.0,"It's beautiful and I did have to have a link taken out. But that is normal. After 3 months, the glass fell off for no apparent reason. And the hands bent then fell off. I'm not someone who is hard on watches; just the opposite."
1.0,Returning these. Totally pointless because the string is too short. It’s only as long as the sleeve of the jacket and does not account for going across the back too. The mitten itself is very small too. Maybe would have fit a one year old but not my three year old.
1.0,I bought 2 pair of these and the frame broke on both of them in the exact same spot so the lens pops out. My daughter is not a rough kid either. She’s never broken any other pair of sunglasses.
1.0,I knew the dangling parts weren't sterling because I read the reviews. I only cared that the hooks were sterling because I have sensitive ears. You can see 925 on the hooks in the photos. The earrings were exactly as I expected - sterling hooks with cheap metal dangles. One was slightly bent but I thougjt it was no big deal because they are actually pretty costume jewelry. But I wasn't expecting the weight. I read the reviews but didn't believe they could be THAT heavy.  Oh yes they are. They ARE THAT heavy. They make my lobes sore! Who approved the material used to make the earrings? Has no one in that company actually tried them on?  I'm going to throw the dangles away and keep the hooks for cheap earrings that need sterling hooks.
1.0,Product arrived damaged
1.0,The dress is a horrible fit and the material is cheap and awful! I refuse to wear this dress and I've even tried to give it away with no luck.
1.0,Not as pictured.  High crew neck not scoop neck. Returned product<br />Reordered same dress from a different company it was great just as pictured
1.0,They were supposed to fit 38C to 40B. The band measured 31&#34;. There is no way a 31&#34; band will fit my 40&#34; ribcage.
1.0,Fastener fell off when trying to put on.  Less than desirable
1.0,"Did not show, or mention that they were mirror glasses. I like the frame, but I had to send them back."
1.0,"Looks smart, but the sizing is way WAY OFF, I ordered an XL and it looks like something made for a child, wasnt even able to get it close enough around my waist to *attempt* zipping."
1.0,"The steel bones bend and are flexible, this will not work for the purpose of waist training, if only it had real steel bones then it would work perfectly. Not only that but it is not shaped with a curve on the front panel, I bought size small so I only need a real waist training corset for some touch ups on my waist and the curve on the front panel is necessary at this point, because this corset makes it look like I have a belly."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:9dcc15c0a9db18faef2f18c7f7aac851]] From afar it looks good but up close it looks like a sticker.  I thought it was a cloth band, should have read the description before purchasing."
1.0,"Very very small , the size of a purse."
1.0,Picture on site showed socks of a certain leng. Upon receipt discovered ankle length and very tight cuff. Would not recommend
1.0,Waste of money! The dress doesn't look anything like the picture. Just a sack.
1.0,"Super thin material, like a hospital gown that’s been washed a billion times. Wrinkles at the slightest movement. Took me about 20 minutes to steam out the wrinkles and as soon as I put it on, it was all wrinkled again. It’s also a lot longer than I had hoped. I really wanted to like this shirt. Total bummer. I’m 5”4 and 200lbs and ordered a XXXL. Save your money, I wasted mine."
1.0,Does not fit. Leaks coffee grounds. Not made for standard Kcups
1.0,broker the first time
1.0,The pads flip over inside the bra and can not be straightened out
1.0,So small I had to return.
1.0,Large is way to large more like XXL.  Poor sizing...
1.0,These sandals are not made to last.  In just 3 short months of wearing them the bottom sole has separated from the main shoe from the front toe to the arch area.
1.0,"Ordered RED. Received ROSE RED. Cannot use for intended purpose of supporting football team during rainy season. Here's the coat color next to what is an actual red fabric. Cannot use this coat in this color. Need the RED that I ordered. Otherwise, great jacket. Too bad it will not be used."
1.0,Each side of the emblem is thin plastic that were glued on with horrible glue - they both fell off the first time I wore it. Seller not making good on bad product.
1.0,There were broken when they were delivered so not happy with them no good
1.0,Ugh The flare is huge doesn’t fit.
1.0,Strap broke after I had it less than a week
1.0,after thee days<br />it wasn't silver anymore
1.0,The one that I got did not connect to the pavloc app or to your phone. I have tried trouble shooting it but it still doesn't work.
1.0,What else can I say?
1.0,Do not buy.  Not as pictured or what's in the description.  Sent me Individual cut up 386 high drain and a couple of 301 low drain.  See picture.  This is FALSE ADVERTISING.  Their description and picture shows 386/301 MULTI-DRAIN which is what I want.  If I could give a negative 5 stars I would.
1.0,They are fit for a person with a large face/head. Had to return.
1.0,"I was excited to get this dress for my bridal shower. However, the dress that I received was nothing like what was listed here. The only similarity was it being white. I ended up renting a dress."
1.0,"I am giving this shirt 1 star and am returning it for 2 reasons. First, the material feels extremely synthetic. It feels uncomfortable to wear. I would return it simply for this reason alone. If I would have felt this shirt in the store, I never would have tried it on. Second, my specific top has a fabric flaw on the shoulder. The dye did not transfer and my shirt had a noticeable white spot.<br />Both problems create a shirt I don’t want."
1.0,I would like to give review be Since I can’t because the glasses was broken when the package was delivered
1.0,The needles don’t fit the belly ring
1.0,Chain broke as I tried to put it on. Globe broke when I was trying to fix chain.  Never even got to wear it. Boo. :-(
1.0,"to be honest i hate it because mistake i did, i didn't check the size of the wallet it's too big you can fit passport in it easy and hard to keep in your back pocket"
1.0,A los 2 días de postura se puso unos de los botones negros
1.0,"Gave 1 star as 0 stars were not an option.  Very, very flimsy.  Kept it anyway.  Wish I would have retunred it after seeing how flimsy/loose the quality was.  Clasp broke in a little over 30 days. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Buyers Remorse!!"
1.0,"The watch does not clip in properly, can’t be used. May bother to return it. Had such high hopes."
1.0,"Received an email from the company before package arrived to tighten screws. I righted the screws and it still broke by the 2nd day of wearing. Couldn't find the screw that fell out, so it's now useless. Would not recommend and would not buy again."
1.0,Didn't fit  in need to.exchange to small er zize
1.0,The chain broke within 30 minutes of me wearing it.  Very cheap quality.
1.0,This sword is absolutely awful. The sword is “kinked” in 3”three areas so it does not point straight. Definitely not worth the money.
1.0,"It look very cheap and a piece was missing awful, The price says it all. I thought I was getting a good deal. Will never buy this product"
1.0,Pretty but....Not as expected 😕
1.0,Do not buy. It's not even tailored properly. The fit was very weird.
1.0,I knew going in that this was costume jewelry.  The stone fell off within hours of wear.
1.0,"This photo is not accurate, the dress does not look like it. No slit or flare, it is one length and looks like a bag. Going back"
1.0,"Dont waste your time, product is cheap!"
1.0,Hate this purse.  Strap sucks and jewels get snagged on everything. Its also very stiff. Was serviceable  for Halloween but I definitely will not be keeping it.
1.0,I read that it ran small so order a size larger. I did. I still need two sizes larger.
1.0,"The measurements are HORRIBLE., I’m 5’9 180 and I wear a l/xl I ordered the 3x because I wanted a baggy fit and it fits like it’s a large…… I barely got it past my thighs smh"
1.0,I'm gonna say that doesnt look anything like the ring I ordered
1.0,It is way too small.<br />I don't care for the material.
1.0,"First of all, the stones don’t match up when the ball is screwed up so it looks weird. I unscrewed it a few times to be sure. Secondly, it’s a ball instead of a flat back. Who wants that digging into their skin?? Such a waste of money :( I’ll be returning."
1.0,"Received these on Saturday used today. Craftsmanship terrible!!! For what I paid for these, it is unacceptable ! Paid 27.50 for it to come a part on both sides!! 👎👎👎👎👎😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 You can have these back. Very Disappointed!!👎👎👎👎👎"
1.0,It was broken when I received it.  Dire tionsenclosed were for a different watch.
1.0,I need  a 22 mm hublot ladies clap gold buckle
1.0,"The product was described on the website as ""47% Cotton, 43% Polyester, 10% Spandex"" which would make it a stretchy knit. It is made of 100% cotton and a twill weave so no stretch. Definitely not as comfortable as wanted. The color is not as muted as the website shows ( I know the colors can be off on the screen but this is really different) Very disappointed."
1.0,"Very nice, light and comfortable. However, the stitching around the bust is rather tight fighting hard to put on with out tearing, very disapointed in the manufacturing of dress. Would have been better if it had been elastic :/"
1.0,Very disappointed how it wore out in 1 month. Also it’s falling apart
1.0,Everyone I know that owns one of these works in Operations or Supply.
1.0,Had to return. This ring was so stretched out i could fit three fingers in it and i ordered a 6. My regular size
1.0,I like but the dislike is that when I received my items one of the studs is broken.
1.0,Chinsy cheap material poorly made. Don't buy.
1.0,"Ordered a plain, solid yellow keychain that glows in the dark. Wanted to customize it for my husband for Father’s Day. The one I received has writing on it and definitely does not glow. I even held it to a lightbulb to “charge” it just to make sure."
1.0,Total waste of money. Very poor quality.
1.0,Package arrived empty!
1.0,"Not at all as advertised. Very poorly made; already has snags, lacks shape and the actual knit looks nothing like what is photographed. Still wearable, but does not look at all like photograph. I guess you get what you pay for..."
1.0,It broke within 10 minutes of kids playing with it.  The blade broke clean into.
1.0,"The bra is just okay. It was meant to be a tank top type bra like the ones that are popular right now. But, it is not. It is more of a sports bra than anything. I got the white and you can see my skin color and the pads. The straps are not adjustable and the bra band underneath is very tight. If you have a bigger bust, I would recommend sizing up. However that may make the straps too big on you. I do not recommend this item."
1.0,Wrong sizing very small non stretch
1.0,The sweater is heavy but the red looks like it was painted on the fabric  It feels nice but it is cheap. I should have read more about it before ordering.
1.0,Cheaply made and is not true to size
1.0,"The shirts were delivered in the worst condition I have ever seen ship from Amazon.  I buy a bunch of stuff and I am familiar with oxfords.  The sleeves were different and stopped just below the elbow, and the shirts buttons did not align properly.  I would steer clear of this product and whoever sells it."
1.0,"Super tiny, I buy a lot on Amazon and this is the first dress that was way too small"
1.0,"When I was purchasing all they had available was Sm and Lg, so I got the small and crossed my fingers. It is way, way too small for me to wear comfotably. Aside from that, I am not going to send for a Lg or Med now that the Med is finally available to order. Because the material itself does NOT feel like a ""cotton blend"" unless the cotton part is 5% and the rest is polyester or something similar. Whatever the ratio, the polyester is very dominant and not at all a softened polyester. Very abrasive on the skin. I can it it causing irritation and micro-tears with how coarse it is. It literally feels ""crunchy"" like plastic and the image looks crunchy when stretched, like pieces of the image are coming apart with the plastic polyester material itself. Not good at all."
1.0,Tore in three spots as soon as I started to pull them up
1.0,Doesn’t come with chain. Comes with rope so<br />am a little disappointed
1.0,"This set is super cute. We ordered a 16-18, but it does not fit any 16-18 year old boy I know. We bought this for a 14 year old boy and it is way too small for him."
1.0,The sequences are already falling off and I’ve only tried it on once. It is also very scratchy.
1.0,the absolute worst bra ever!!! I will be returning for a refund
1.0,"The color was not brown, it’s yellow. The bag is much smaller than pictured"
1.0,Item came broken very disappointed since I left for vacation the next day had to purchase one on vacation which cost way way more than I wanted to spend on sunglasses
1.0,Terrible product it is not a scarf..its weird.  Looks like a bib with a sheet mask attached.
1.0,Too small and weak to keep piercing on
1.0,"Heavy, too big and gaudy looking. Going to return them."
1.0,Trash!!  Gloves tear when putting them on.  Do not purchase!
1.0,These are totally sheer. Not worth it!
1.0,I received my glasses wore them once screws fell out to small tried to fix and they broke. Not happy
1.0,"Ordered this for Christmas for my Ariel obsessed daughter. Didn’t work, tried changing batteries. Returned and ordered a replacement and the replacement didn’t work either. Finally just got my money back."
1.0,"Chinese sizing. Too small.<br />If you insist you want this, the order AT LEAST a full size bigger than you think you need, probably 2 sizes larger.<br />Thin material, not worth it, save your $$. Too bad."
1.0,the item was smaller than picture showed very miss leading
1.0,Comfy but came a part after 4 days
1.0,"I read the reviews and saw these short run small. So I bought the 5xl thinking they would fit perfect. Absolutely not, the 5xl is more like a medium. Do not buy unless 6you are a small adult or buying for a child."
1.0,Ordered my daughter a 2 and they fit like a 4 in big kids!
1.0,"I got the white, gray, and black one and it looks nothing like the photo."
1.0,"I thought the fabric was cotton fleece. It was thick flannel. That would not be wearable in Miami Fl at<br />anytime, so I returned them."
1.0,Many of these arrived broken. The screws that were supposed to hold the arms on were not threaded and just fell right out. They were not functional as glasses.
1.0,"HORRIBLE, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY."
1.0,It was cute but more so for a man than a woman. It reminds you of a plastic Halloween costume hat with a cheap fabric on top of it.  You could not shape or bend this hat at all!  I ended up keeping it because it would have cost me more to return it than what I paid for it.
1.0,"When I tied the mask on, it bent slightly. This slight bend cracked the paint in the mask above the nose and the paint flaked off between where my eyebrows would be. I don’t recommend this item."
1.0,"I can’t say I love these, they are super thin and I just can’t say I like them."
1.0,"Earring back was difficult to get on, the hole felt like it was not big enough. Post bent when trying to get back on."
1.0,Poor quality. Much smaller than expected.<br />Awful
1.0,"There are a couple of things wrong with this product. First, the bottoms are thicker than the top? Like, the top looks like it just has one layer and the bottoms are significantly thicker. So, consistency would be nice. Second, the bottoms are way too small. I wish they allowed you to choose different sizes for the top and bottom.<br /><br />I love the color, though."
1.0,Disappointing. The fabric is a loose weave and thin cotton flannel. There were two holes in the seams: one on the shoulder and one on the sleeve hem. Rather disappointing but glad I caught it before gifting.
1.0,"The zipper Broke/split first time I put them on. Other than that Pants fit great and are warm, used them for skiing."
1.0,"Cheap hard plastic. Practically useless, even as a costume prop."
1.0,"I wanted to like the dress, I got the black and white chevron. The top was good quality but the bottom was completely see through. Super disappointed. It will be returned."
1.0,This shirt is completely see through. It looks dark gray but it’s black very loose stitching making it see through.
1.0,"I feel like this is false advertising. The gloves say ""gel"" on them, and it advertises itself as padded, but there is basically zero padding whatsoever in these gloves. They do nothing to help prevent your hands from hurting while biking.<br /><br />I was going to return them, but someone wanted them for lifting weights (which requires no padding), so I gave them away instead."
1.0,"Turns green (brown) at the bare touch of water.  Very frail. You get what you pay for.  But jeez, that was a very quick turn!!"
1.0,This caftan was nothing more than a thin rag that falls apart the minute you put it on. I ordered two and threw them both in the garbage. What a waste of money.
1.0,Awful fabric super scratchy
1.0,Came without one of the buttons required for the straps
1.0,You have to pop the eyes out in order to see
1.0,"Totally different from picture. Absolutely disgusting. see-through. No way to put a brawl or anything under, don’t waste your energy money time or excitement on this item."
1.0,I will NOT be buying these again
1.0,"I decided to add pickup covers to my flying V kit guitar but I couldn't decide whether I wanted black or chrome.  So I bought both. One of the chrome covers had a dent. Small but noticeable to me. No problem, I have the black covers. Except that one of the black covers has hole cutouts for the polepieces. I ordered covers with no holes.<br /><br />In short, both are useless to me and I'll have to return them and buy something else.  I read the reviews that said to buy better quality. I thought at least one pair of these would be good. I was wrong. Don't waste time on these. Just buy good quality stuff. This stuff shows and if it's worth doing it's worth doing right.<br /><br />Oh yeah, chrome looked best."
1.0,"I am very angry with this product. The picture that is advertised shows a long oversized tunic, but that is NOT what I received. I ordered two sizes too big and what I got was unacceptable. When I order something online, I expect to receive what I see in the picture. My oversized tunic was seriously too tight and more of a crop top. I was jipped out of my money and I am furious"
1.0,Thought these would be tight since they’re compression. These are huge and baggy.
1.0,I did not like this. It did not stay secure and weak.
1.0,Way too big for a newborn.
1.0,There was nothing in the package I received.
1.0,"The first bottle I tried to use would not spray at all. On the second bottle, the top keeps popping off when spray. Unfortunately I can't return because I didn't try them right away."
1.0,This is my third magnetic bracelet and second Willis Judd. I love the other two and this one looked cool so I got it. Pros: looks good.  Cons: long links mean I have to choose between very tight fit or way too big. The smaller blue links are rubber making spring bar removal  difficult. Bent every pin in included vice tool. Finally got them with an old spring bar tool I had. And last complaint is magnets are weak. I hang bracelets on steel gun safe when not in use. Other bracelets hold nice and tight. This seems like it'll fall off if I bump into safe. Not sure whether I will return because after all it does look cool.
1.0,Very small. Def not an XL.
1.0,Runs small. Had to return
1.0,Not worth it at all.
1.0,"I really love these dresses every time I wear one of them the compliments won't stop. I have purchased the longer sleeves and now the sleeveless. I am VERY disappointed at the quality. I received the red and cerulean blue, the red, heart-stopping. the BLUE I had to re-order because the zipper was faulty on both of them."
1.0,"I live in MN, and I got these for the cold weather.  It says -30 degrees.  Not even close.  My hands were brutally cold at 10 degrees."
1.0,"The clasp does not lie flat at all! I have no idea why, I'm a size 4! It needs a magnet or even a small butting snap to keep it down."
1.0,No me agradó q son demasiado planos. Y no se veían con buena calidad.
1.0,"product says it runs large, but that is an understatement. I bought the 0-6 month size and it is more like an 18-24 months size range. Cute outfit, but so disappointed my baby can’t wear it now."
1.0,Had armpit deodorant marks<br />Cool fabric returning and ordering again hopefully they get it right next time separate the used ones from new ones
1.0,Returned them... super cheap and weird material.
1.0,Cheap fabric and runs way too small
1.0,Very cute but way too big
1.0,"Description  States 17 inches however when I received this it looked like a choker on my neck I have necklaces that are 17 inches and they reach all the way to my bus line,  also the craftsmanship on the edges where they are tied off is very poor and elementary school student can do a better job, I am very dissatisfied with this product and I definitely do not recommend it for anyone to buy it"
1.0,I paid for yellow gold earrings and I received what looks like silver. I cannot return them because I have cartilage piercings that have been slow to heal. I am dismayed that I have paid so much and I did not get what I paid for.
1.0,Even though the script and font were next to what was supposed to be engraved both names and phone numbers were wrong.
1.0,The chain is very cheap. I bought 2 chains now for it. Now I gotta buy another one. I love the moon but the necklaces keep breaking and getting caught on something
1.0,"Bought a XL , which would usually fit my husband comfortably. It arrived an he couldnt even get it on, it was so tight. Called to return it, they sent a 2x. We recieved that, an it was Same thing. I would've sworn it was the same size that's how tight this one was also. To boot, I purchased one in late October and the second in the beginning of November AND I STILL HAVE THEM BOTH. Trying to return them has been horrific. Dont waste your time or your money."
1.0,They do not fit crocs and fall off all the time. They also are not soft and thus not flexible. I returned them.
1.0,"Way too small. I wouldn't recommend.  Maybe for a baby or todler,yet the chain is probably too long and delicate for a kid. May be good for someone looking for a miniature one with less sent."
1.0,Way to big for smaller faced people. Love the style and everything else.
1.0,runs small and short
1.0,Does not fit properly base upon US size chart
1.0,Junk! Plastic clasp in the back broke after 2 months of little use. Waste of money.
1.0,I wanted this product for underneath my daughter's dresses. They are way too baggy and fit large.
1.0,This was complete garbage. The ribbon is cheap and scratchy and the metal charm came broken off in the packaging. You get what you pay for.
1.0,"None of these fit outside of the one that's squiggly because they're too big.  The only reason those fit is because you can squish them.  Even then, I've already lost one."
1.0,"I purchased this as a gift for one of my sons. Purchase date was Dec 9, 2015.  I paid extra for express shipping.  It still took 3 weeks (After Christmas) to get this item.  My son had it on for less than an hour and it broke.  Very disappointed."
1.0,I received this shirt it was ripped the ribbon was missing and it had a stain on it and it was missing one of the color circles a mess
1.0,"Way too small, ridiculous!"
1.0,"I'm 5'8"" and 195lbs. I ordered an XL and it fit a little loosely, but did touch the floor. However the print was very cheap looking. I am not happy."
1.0,Bought this item for my wife. After a little over a week the band snapped and all the beads fell on the floor. Waste of money
1.0,"couldn't sync to phone , app sucks"
1.0,Absolutely horrible ! The day after my husband put it in his mouth. His tounge swolle up and burns really bad ! I had to take him to the doctor and have him put on Antibiotics and he has to follow up with his physician. This is absolute ridiculous. DONT BY THIS PRODUCT ! Do NoT !
1.0,Horrible. Spandex-like material that looks horrible on anyone.
1.0,"Super thin, runs small, cheap product. Waste of money."
1.0,Another accidental order from China. Ridiculous!
1.0,This top was way too baggy so I returned it.
1.0,It is about 3 sizes smaller than ordered. The sleeves are more of a cap sleeve. This was put in the good will due to not fitting anyone I knew.
1.0,"Dress had no shape and the material was very cheap, sent back."
1.0,"Pretty irritated as to how much it cost compared to how cheaply it is made. The strap that is glued on already broke off once, and it’s so delicate that our child can barely play with it for fear of breaking it. A toy that goes with the costume is supposed to be able to withstand a kid playing with it! I would not recommend this product and based on the poor quality, question buying anything rom this company in general going forward."
1.0,"This were cheap, flimsy and easy to break apart which made the battery available for small children to swallow.  I would not recommend them for children of any age."
1.0,not working after new battery
1.0,"Ordered larger size based on reviews, garment still short- does not hit knees as pictured. Colors were off. Not keeping- did not return due to cost."
1.0,I normally wear a 2x.  I ordered a 3x to be safe…..no go….so I returned and ordered 4x.  Pants won’t even come close.  Definitely sized for leprechauns.  And the quality is what expected from a $50 costume.  Lucky I’d it last more than two wears.
1.0,Las devolví
1.0,Not made to last very long
1.0,"the item is not proportioned correctly, shoulder width is small  sleeve opening is really small."
1.0,(...)<br />This is the worst toy I've ever had!  It doesn't have a full color in the light; the light doesn't glow strongly all the way to the end of the saber.  I wasted my money and I was sad and disappointed.  The blades don't go all the way in the handle either.  The company should make this better.<br /><br />(...)
1.0,This shirt was terrible.  The front is thick plastic and would be so uncomfortable to wear.  I paid $21.00  for this then found it at Walmart for $8.  Returned immediately!!
1.0,"Let's start with the the fact that you have no idea what colors you're going to get. The pictures show like 4 different palettes and the color option just says &#34;Multi&#34;. Well, it doesn't matter anyway, because the whole thing was smashed. Every color, the mirror, everything was little tiny pieces."
1.0,"received product and very dissapointed, it was very cheaply made, chain was so thin it broke.....do not order this junk"
1.0,This product clearly states that the pants easily convert to shorts- they do no such thing.  These are long pants ONLY- there is NO option to zip off into shorts.
1.0,First time I put on it fell apart and I had to throw it out! Very cheap quality! Waste of money.
1.0,I expected more than a piece of plastic ~ no man I know would put it on! It may work for a rear view mirror ornament
1.0,Broke within minutes
1.0,If I could give this 0 stars I would. The clasp broke as soon as I opened the package. What a waste.
1.0,Runs small...  is not as full as pictured...
1.0,Way too small this a kids/girls watch
1.0,Wristbands fit very tight they are very small
1.0,"This dress is awful, cheap material and the sixes are off. This dress should not be sold to anybody."
1.0,"This shirt was not just too large, it was enormous. I ordered a small (the smallest size available), I usually wear an XS. Reviews said this ran small so I thought it would fit reasonably. It was absolutely huge. It goes down to 3-4 inches above my knee and the arm hole goes lower than the bottom of my bra band. Since the shirt has no labels it is possible I was sent the wrong size. Also this shirt smells terribly and took 5 full weeks to arrive."
1.0,"It is loose, looks more like a cheese cloth full of holes! It does not stick to your hand. Very disapointed."
1.0,"Bad quality, chain and pendant are discolored.<br />Very disappointing to receive it in this condition as it was a gift for someone."
1.0,The ear snapped off the gold one within 24 hours.
1.0,Clip broke after 1 use . Battery died after 2 days . Compass is garbage
1.0,"They are so poorly made cheap plastic, uncomfortable to wear and can’t even fit right on my son’s face. I returned it a few months ago, and still haven’t gotten a refund."
1.0,"I bought one of these about 18 months ago, and it's been working awesome. It was whisper quiet, and worked very well. I bought 3 more , and they are as loud as rock tumblers. I wish I would have kept the packaging and sent back."
1.0,cheap don't waste your money
1.0,Does not hold glasses well felt item was just too cheaply built and is a poor product
1.0,"If I could give less stars than one I would. This ring appears to be metal in all if the pictures, and no where on the listing does it say that the ring is SILICONE. This listing is deceiving. Save your money."
1.0,"There needs to be more necklaces,earing sets for NFL teams.This one is the only one I found.sad that it has no team."
1.0,This is a cheaply made product and looks more like a 60’s moo moo for 9 month pregnant woman.
1.0,Loop broke off after a couple wears. I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,"It was supoose to be for work. I live in Kingston, Jamaica and we dont wear casual clothes to work so this came as a disappointment.  On the screen it looks like decent material ...easy wear dress that you could put on when you have no major meetings or such, just a regular day at the office..<br /><br />However, the material is aweful..it is cotton to start, which one would not expecct of a work dress and then on top of that, the cotton is thin and just looks like something casual or worse something a child would wear like a house dress...sigh...."
1.0,Cute! If you like green skin.
1.0,very unhappy with this product. i am an extra small in everything i wear top wise and this is way too short almost like a youth size and im only 5/2 so its not bc of my torso size
1.0,"Very cute...but clasp is soooo strong it’s really difficult to open especially after you put them on. Being so small and tightly clasped, made my ear lobes sore."
1.0,This head piece came broken. . Its not worth the money. . Very fragile. . It won't last a day
1.0,"It was super cute, but I was extremely disappointed in the quality. For such good reviews, I didn't see anyone having issues with getting it wet, but I suppose its fine if you just want to sunbathe or walk around. I went swimming and it became discolored in the most embarrassing places. Currently returning. I will not be purchasing from this seller in the future."
1.0,Nice jeans! But they sent the wrong size and wouldn’t take them back
1.0,Didn’t work at all
1.0,The item pictured is not the item I received. I received a mustard/green sweater. That was also not appropriately sized either.<br />I contacted the seller for a return and have not heard anything back.
1.0,This is a normal mask with no extra room to accommodate singing. This product is an ok regular mask but not for the $20 it cost me.  Don't be fooled by the description of this product.
1.0,The Small Fit as a Large.
1.0,"What a disappointment, would've given this dress a zero star rating but of course there's no option for that. Terrible asymmetry and obviously no care taken whatsoever when this dress was made with stripes in mind. The top as well as the bottom portion of this dress could have been sewn better by my 12 year old son.<br />So poorly made that I'll never wear it.<br />Back to the company it goes!"
1.0,Not what I expected. Runs way too small.
1.0,"Not windproof, used only once at beach and flipped open."
1.0,"If you’re looking for your next Halloween costume, here it is!"
1.0,They were so thin
1.0,"These socks are incredibly thin and sit very low on the ankle.  It's not at all what I was looking for, but might be just right for others.  (I have four other pairs of much thicker and taller Fila socks that I really like, and I thought that's what I was buying.)"
1.0,Sent me the wrong colored jeans.
1.0,I was excited to get these scarves as I thought it was a good deal. But I only received ONE scarf when description and title explicitly states 2
1.0,"Not what I thought, fell apart . Sent back!"
1.0,First off I only received 2 bracelets not three like the description states. As well as these look very cheap and poorly made. Don’t waste your money on this.
1.0,This bathing suit looked great... for 3 wears. Then it faded so badly it’s not wearable. I would be embarrassed to wear this suit! Don’t buy this bathing suit if you would like it to last a full swim season... because it won’t.
1.0,"I was very excited to get these and these types of masks are my favorite to wear. I have a white one from another brand and was excited to get black. However, as other reviews they are very thin and smelled like petroleum. The smell went away after 30 mins. I would not recommend these."
1.0,Zipper broke off immediately
1.0,"Love this bag but stay to fall apart already, the inside stay to fall apart the zipper fall off"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:3da26029f15a63f609118bed50601d73]] Not only was the skirt too small but the lining was ripped up Merchandise came damaged
1.0,"cant see well ,there is a big differemce between one glass and the other one on top"
1.0,****warning****<br />These are not stainless steel. Very thin and turn quickly
1.0,"If you’re looking for an overpriced oversized tissue, then by all means get this. But if you were looking for a sweater that won’t fall apart when the wind blows then definitely don’t get this one. I will be returning this pos as soon as possible. It was not at all worth the price they’re selling it for. I wouldn’t even pay $5 for it!!!! Disappointing!!!! To say the least."
1.0,"Fake, do not buy."
1.0,They are hard to keep up tend to fall frequently. I felt like I was constantly pulling them up. “Tummy control “ does seem to have anything to help with that feature.
1.0,The brand of the sweatshirt was not as advertised.
1.0,"Product not a direct OEM replacement band.  Cheap quality, pivot holes off-center.  Panerai OEM deployment buckle did fit fit correctly."
1.0,This was plastic and ugly
1.0,"Frames are very poorly made. Right side broke at the joint, got them repaired at a local shop and then the left side broke in the same spot. Ridiculous. These are supposed to be high quality frames. They're not."
1.0,"I did like the quality of the frame. However, these were advertised as polarized. They even came with a card to look at to &#34;see the pattern.&#34; They did nothing. Nor did they pass the old &#34;computer screen&#34; trick. I used a polarized pair I had and looked at the pattern card. Guess what..... I could see the pattern. Sorry, but despite the great reviews by others, I am returning these glasses. If you advertise polarized, sell polarized."
1.0,"poorly made, broke twice"
1.0,Only received one!  WTF
1.0,Nothing like the image. Cheap fabric. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"The principal behind the product is good, however the phone is not very secure. I have had the phone fall off the armband several times. I emailed the company and after 10 days with no response I purchased another more secure armband."
1.0,"cheap, crappy, run WAY small- i know they are first knuckle rings but only fit my pinky - says they are a size 4."
1.0,Not flattering and very snug in the chest.
1.0,runs wayyyyyyu too small.  My xl was more like a M.
1.0,Hated it stop sell it
1.0,One earrings had a bent post and the other was completely broke off. Terrible quality
1.0,"Ordered 2 sizes larger than needed, still way small fitting arms and wrist bands miserable. Sent back."
1.0,"I ordered the denim blue because the picture looked cute. Yikes it is not. This is a dark blue that doesn't even show the black parts of the sheep. It looks like white blobs all over the scarf which maybe could be cute, but isn't. Sadly I'll just keep it because it came from China but this will definitely be the last thing I order from the seller."
1.0,"This is the second pair of yoga pants I've bought in the past month that show my undies in down dog. My sister has a pair without the see-through, so I was hopeful that I was choosing a safe brand this time. But 90 Degree has poor quality control, apparently, and there is no way to tell whether you're getting a good pair when buying online. I missed the 30-day return window, of course.<br /><br />In the photo I stretched the pants over a white and blue box, and you can clearly see the blue stripe on the box. Best I could do - there is no way I will attach a photo of my undies showing through, so you'll have to accept the substitute. I guess these are going to Goodwill, and I'll go back to wearing my 15 year old Lululemon."
1.0,"I love this beanie, it fits well and is very comfortable, but it has fallen apart despite washing it less than 10 times in a mesh sack used to wash delicates. May want to revise your stitching and put these through some serious QC before listing these as high quality because it's misleading."
1.0,Just received my order. It is missing the screen protector. In the box was only the band and tool.
1.0,I was excited to receive this item however; the item I received differed from the picture displayed.
1.0,Not sweatshirt material.  Decal on front makes it look cheap.  Disappointed.
1.0,"The fabric of this shirt was awful.  It was thin and rough, and the blouse did not drape in front like the photo.  It just looked terrible when I put it on.  The company refunded my money without any problems."
1.0,The adjustable string tore on the 2nd day and I couldn’t wear it anymore! It’s flimsy material.
1.0,Never got item so I guess I can't really rate it. I did however order a white and a black one just like the pink and the chains broke first time I put them on. Horrible
1.0,"Broke as I tried to adjust it, but it's pretty."
1.0,The band is cheaply made.  The clasp on one side of the band would not stay locked in. I wore it once and almost lost my fitbit. It's in the garbage now.
1.0,It didn’t fit my bracelet. It looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,Backing would not stay on. Re-ordered and had the same problem twice.
1.0,"the gloves stated large,but apparently in China,large means small,because they were way too small."
1.0,"I returned this bra.  It fit poorly, the straps did not support.  Very soft fabric, though."
1.0,Much small than I imagined and the plate broke off within days. Very poor quality
1.0,Love the look but don't use it due to the fact it is incredibly hard to open.
1.0,"I bought these earmuffs for my son to wear when sounds bothered or distracted him. Unfortunately, they have never been used. This is not because he won’t wear them but rather they come apart each and every time he or I try to put them on him. In the trash they go. We will be looking for a better product. Avoid."
1.0,Terrible quality. Uneven thread and holes. Not worth it at any price. See photos.
1.0,Disappointed. Cute idea but half of the set wasn’t done right. This is a gift for my daughter’s boyfriend. The “his” side looks good but the “hers” side doesn’t look as good and has a dot above the H where it was engraved by mistake.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,"Four months after the original delivery date i was sent bubble glass around some badly placed pictures not a exactly ""globe like look"""
1.0,"Followed the size guide and ordered these in a larger size than seemed sensible - but followed their chart - they were HUGE. Even if they had not been enormous pants I would not have kept them after feeling the fabric, looked horribly cheap. You'd do better walking into any discount store. So grateful for Prime return policy. Ugh. Horrible."
1.0,Cheap material and the backings don’t fit the post. DO NOT BUY  The post broke when I tried to put the backing on. Worst cheap material ever
1.0,It's beautiful but not what was advertised. I wanted the earrings that was shown to go with a sea shell necklace and handband. That was a perfect match. It that was sent isn't. I'm disappointed I waited so long for it and it's not what I wanted.
1.0,Look nothing like pictures . Awkward face covering
1.0,Now keeps falling off very frustrating
1.0,Had to return and even the return broke off at the clasp.
1.0,2 out of 3 pairs were broken. Very disappointed because most reviews were okay. Sad and upset
1.0,Is not round like in the picture
1.0,Looks like a sticker was glued to the top that says “land rover”
1.0,PRODUCTO DE MALA CALIDAD EN RELACION AL PRECIO DE COMPRA.
1.0,Stone fell out after first wear
1.0,Useless to me as they are far too tight.  Didn't get them on.  I do wear a size 12 XW shoe so don't buy if have similar size feet.
1.0,"Not very good , the product is not wel made"
1.0,Not getting much considering the money you are paying for this. It's literally just an unfinished stretchy fabric. Ends are frayed straight from the package. Definitely not worth the money I paid for it and feel ripped off.
1.0,Did not like them
1.0,"Don't waste your money the product really is not that loud and service sucks and only a 30 day warranty!!!!!!  I had a defective one that I saved to give my Daughter and when she opened it up it did not work. I emailed the company to get it replaced and I was told sorry for the inconvenience and that my request would be passed on the the higher management. After two weeks of no response I called the company  and after loops of non person contact I finally got through to a broken english speaking individual, I asked to speak to a supervisor and got placed on hold for 10 minutes. then when the supervisor came on she informed me that it was outside of their 30 day money back warranty and there was nothing they could do. I stated I just wanted to have it replaced and she just repeated the same statement as if a recording obviously they will not stand behind their cheap Chinese produced Garbage"
1.0,cheap price- cheap product.  Turns ear lopes green in 1 day
1.0,I ordered a 3X and they fit my daughter that wears a 9 juniors.
1.0,"sent watch back after a month,stop working never received a refund"
1.0,"Bought these 6 weeks ago for a friend, he loved how comfortable they were but they completely fell apart, the soles completely fell off. He doesn’t work so wore these only for casual wear. Not recommended. Waste of money."
1.0,Still in pkg with tag on it. Wont wear but not worth hassal of returning
1.0,I am 5&#34;0 and it was way too short. It also came up shorter as I moved around. The dress came with a very harsh chemical smell. I tried washing it but the smell was till there.
1.0,"It's stamped 925.  ITS NOT!<br />I thought I was getting a hellofa deal!  Jokes on me.  Anything too good to be true, usually is"
1.0,The first clip I opened was broke. Had to fix with pliers.
1.0,"The dress looks so cheap, the fabric is like a thick lycra, so glossy y excesive bright colors, I choose navy and it comes an electric blue, nothing like the picture.<br />So dissapointed, dont like it at all."
1.0,"These blade style earrings are so small and barely noticable. I was under the impression that they would at least stand out a bit more than they do. 1 star, would NOT reccomend"
1.0,Fabric detail is way OFF!!
1.0,"Poor quality, but loved the look"
1.0,the attachment to the tent does not work
1.0,I should have read previous reviews...
1.0,"Very small, almost laughable if I wasn't so disappointed"
1.0,Super cheap quality of materials used in the product. Fake leather and cheap metal
1.0,This was supposed to be a 2XL<br />The arms were too short and too tight.  My husband will need a 3x because of the arms<br />Its a nice shirt but too small 6
1.0,This product didn’t even come with the belt. I’m extremely disappointed. I wanted this as a birthday gift & now I can’t even get any use out of it.
1.0,"Like others, I sized up but the shirt was still child-sized. Unless you're a very tiny person, do not order. Even then, you should get the largest size."
1.0,The sun glasses did not sit on your face and the nose pieces were not comfortable.  I returned them.
1.0,"Its very thin, was missing the nose wire. Quickly sewn together and coming apart. Waste of money."
1.0,Not at all like the picture. I returned it
1.0,very cheap broke that first week fairly easy so i was a bit disappointed obviously.
1.0,Ran extremely small
1.0,Great product easy to use and instructions are good one down side is that my buckle is broken. I hope I can get just a buckle to replace great belt but I'm sad it's not put together properly. Just once you get it check it.
1.0,shrunk one size after first wash
1.0,These are terrible one of the gloves ripped on the palm the first time I went skiing. Very poor build quality
1.0,"I don’t know how it fits because I could even get it on! Very cute looking, but I will never know because I had to return. Customer service was very nice, though."
1.0,"Nothing like the picture, very poorly made."
1.0,"Way too small<br />I order an xl in everything<br />Ordered an xl, Fit like a medium"
1.0,NO LOS RECOMIENDO PARA NADA.. SON TRASPARENTES Y LA CALIDAD ES FATAL
1.0,Very cheap looking! Poor quality! Don't waste your $$$.
1.0,"It broke while I was putting it on. Really small for average size wrist. Waste, would not recommend it at all."
1.0,This product is very inferior. I gave it away to goodwill because it will not be of any use to me.
1.0,The tags were sewn on the outside of the pants! And the sizing is way off - the waistband is quite small and the fabric does not stretch well over chubby baby legs.
1.0,The material was thin and cheap.
1.0,This umbrella blew inside out the first time I stepped out of my car.  Four Ribs Broke the FIRST time I used it.
1.0,"I’m returning these<br />The good: These have a good amount of compression and great stretch without becoming see through<br />The Bad: They pick up and eat every tiny piece of hair, fuzz, and lint so unless you have a lint roller with you 24/7 and use it after every time you touch something containing any of the things listed, they are going to look trashy."
1.0,The shells and fins arrived falling off of the crown and glue strings were hanging off everywhere. Pretty shore this is a dollar store crown and someone glued on the shells with crappy glue .
1.0,"Usually wear a large in women's shirts, I like the little extra room. I heard these shirts run small so I got an XL fits more like a medium. Cute shirt very very dissatisfied.😠. Wasted money on that one."
1.0,"Too small, not worthy your money.  I have an average head on the smaller side and I keep my hair trimmed short no additional hair wigs or extensions.  I wanted to love these Caps unfortunately they are just but piece of trash.  Had bought 2 caps, wasted my money.  I didn't open them until today, its too late to return"
1.0,It  was not what I expected it to look like looked cheap and zipper tore up after using it for only 3 days. I would not recommend it to anyone don't waste your money.
1.0,Very poor quality.  I dont believe its sterling silver. One broke coming out the package and the one I wore broke out my neck horribly.
1.0,"Wasted money....should state proper for baby ears, not adult.....I gave them away. Very disappointe."
1.0,Enough said. That's over $10 per pair of socks.
1.0,"The pictured dress is not what arrived. I got a t-shirt dress with a small amount of rouching at one side, very disappointing"
1.0,The red color is a hideous neon orange.  Returned for black.
1.0,Cute style terrible fabric
1.0,"Rather than having a natural look, the bl and white colors are sewn in strips so looks more like a ""jailbird"" cap."
1.0,terrible product ordered  XL  they sent 3X and they were to small shorts were made very poorly made. Also they had a very cheep price but charged a 15 dollar shipping charge so I could send back for refund. I learned my lesson always buy  with amazon shipping then you can recoup your money if product is good.
1.0,"I was disappointed with this bag because when I received it there was a cut in the canvas. I don't know how it passed manufacturing inspection. It also looked cheap. However, it is large enough to carry a lot of things."
1.0,The material is so slippery that I can't even tie it on my head without it sliding off. I have a few other ones of different styles that work much better. This product absolutely does not work for the purpose that it was made.
1.0,Poor quality.  Ring broke in two in less than a month.  Very disappointed!!!
1.0,"This shirt looks nothing like the photo.  It is incredibly cheap feeling, the fabric has balls on it and it runs very small.  I am a medium and but in this shirt I would likely need an xxl."

1.0,I like the products color scheme and feeling of the fabric although it's a bit to short for me. Will need to find another size for the shirt.
1.0,"I don't usually write reviews but wanted to let others know about this scarf. It's not horrible, the colors are true to the picture and its thin (expected that due to price) BUT the one I received is no where NEAR the pictured length and could never be confused for a shawl. I have many scarves and this is on the shorter length of any of them, and definitely not the newer &#34;blanket&#34; like scarf look it's advertised as. The price Is so low I don't really care but if looking for a blanket scarf, go elsewhere."
1.0,Quality is not as good as the impression given in the description. Unfortunately missed the return window due to vacation.
1.0,I like it but in broke several times what can I do about that
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:e633add8f60534bd865474f12ab1b925]] I am completely dissatisfied with this purchase. My son's pants looked brand new when I put them on, but by the end of the day, they looked as if  they had been washed and worn repeatedly. Also, The straps on the pants torn. I'm disappointed."
1.0,Makes your skin green if u wet it
1.0,I wear a 34 DDD I PRDERED THE 34 DD and the cup was PERFECT but the strap was like a 32-30 !!!!!! Way too tight
1.0,Broke the first time I put it on
1.0,So tiny it will only fit my 2 yr old daughter wrist.
1.0,"Unfortunately, as you can see, my hat looks nothing like the original. My hat looks like someone used an off-colored iron-on patch."
1.0,"I really liked the look of this item, but it never arrived."
1.0,Sizing appears to be wrong. Too much time wasted putting them on
1.0,Do not recommend. Very cheaply made. Could have come out of a bubble gum machine for 50 cents.
1.0,I sized up and the dress still did not fit it is a beautiful dress though but you have to be very careful dealing with the sequins.
1.0,it fell apart.  Not worth the money paid
1.0,Does NOT look like picture.
1.0,I don’t like the fabric-feels cheap and doesn’t give like you would expect exercise pants to give.
1.0,"The product is cheap, does not fit is not true to size at all."
1.0,"cheap fabric, lapels don't lay right and are huge.  and runs large everywhere"
1.0,I bought these as a replacement for one i lost from a gift. My ears itched and the plating wore out with 2 weeks. Buyer beware
1.0,"I bought two of these because I thought they looked super cute and were a great price. Sadly, when I received the package, the quality of the material was cheap and the color was not a true representation.  I bought the scarf that was supposed to be beige with black dots, but it is more khaki with black dots.  To top it all off, after I purchased it, it said that it would take 6 weeks for delivery. I would return it if it wasn't so difficult.  Let it be known-you get what you pay for."
1.0,super cheap. as the price indicates. Almost like wearing a practice penny(jersey). I have broad shoulders so this was really tight up high.
1.0,These were the hardest pair of house shoes that I’ve ever purchased
1.0,"I order these sock in size small to wear with my loafers but it is too big. It does not stay on my heels and keep sliding off. It became annoying as I tried to pull them in place every step. Disappointed, will not purchase again."

1.0,Broke after two weeks
1.0,I very much do not like the fit it is cheaply made and nothing like advertised
1.0,"I ORDERED A LARGE AND IT WHEN IT CAME IN, IT WAS SO SMALL I COULDNT EVEN WEAR IT. I AHD TO GIVE IT TO MY NIECE WHO IS A SIZE 0. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
1.0,"These are listed as having a 1.5 mm ‘stone’, this is incorrect!  They are just under 0.5 mm and are a huge aspiration hazard for anyone with a piercing over 22 gauge!  If you have a standard 16 or 20 gauge piercing, these will pull right through!  The ‘stone’ is smaller that the ball end."
1.0,"No filter included, should have said something about that and I would have bought the inserts, had a lot of time to buy it!"
1.0,"Don’t do it. The wrap is not a one size fits all. The straps that goes around the arms hurt. I’m 5’7, 165 and this thing was on my like a blanket but the straps were too tight around my arms. I was so bad that I requested a $5.00 refund. Don’t purchase this."
1.0,Out of the package I could already see that is was poorly stitched. I will definitely be returning it back.
1.0,It runs small so order a size larger.

1.0,mask was smashed during shipping. fits crooked
1.0,"What was shown was a larger bag and was a tote, what was sent was a small draw string bag so small I could not even fit my wallet in it. The other 3 pieces that were supposed to be included in the order were of so poor quality and very flimsy, none could be used. Will never order from that site again"
1.0,I did not get the 18 in chain that was suppose  to come with it
1.0,It's ridiculous with these pants.I ordered a 2x.My daughter is a size 6 and the pants fit her perfect.You all need to do better with sizing.I ordered these pants for a concert.Now I have to go buy another pair from someone else.It's very inconvenient to do this.0 star
1.0,CHEAP AND BULKY
1.0,When I placed my order said  46 count and received only 23 .. bad experience
1.0,Too small by far. Waste of money.
1.0,Too large and not form fitting
1.0,"Beware !Amazon becoming like eBay .<br />Item featured shows 2 shoe expanderz but only one sent. Please read description carefully. I was fooled. Thought I was purchasing 2 items.<br />UPDATE-<br />item fell apart after 1 use. the black ""pressure point"" inserts broke off, cheap product. DONT BUY !"
1.0,"No me enviaron lo q pedí, no estoy contento y no pediré mas ninguno."
1.0,Cheap plastic fabric. Sized for Asian people.
1.0,very uncomfortable to wear. bad quality. i wish i could get my money back. do not buy.
1.0,"Based on other reviews, I ordered my customary size.  I will be returning it as it is way too small. I suggest you order up one size at least. Loved the colors and pattern. Fabric was soft, although thin, but I intended to use as beach coverup."
1.0,"I purchased the rose gold flower design. This belt is insanely small... like to the point that makes me wonder if it’s actually intended for children. I purchased another belt by the same brand, and while the material is different, there are INCHES of difference in length between the two (see image). This belt has no stretch and does not have any adjustment options. It also looked kind of cheap and tacky up close, which surprised me as I have purchased many items from this designer before and have always been satisfied. This is totally going back."
1.0,"I ordered these to go to an amusement park. The first one I took out of the package immediately fell apart. The straps came loose and it took several minutes to put it back together. When I tried to put my glasses on the strap, the piece to tighten was loose and my glasses fell out and onto the floor. Definitely not something to wear on a Rollercoaster.  Not sure what to do with them if they can't hold glasses. Slingshot maybe?"
1.0,ITEM WAS NOT SIZE AS STATED ON TAG OR AS ORDERED. VERY DISSATISFIED
1.0,One of the balls fell off within less than a month
1.0,The long strap ripped away from bag on the first trip
1.0,the graphic itself is poor quality and the shirt fits super weird. The neck hole is too wide for some reason... I took a chance and kept it to make a gym cut off tee.. but their is no redeeming this shirt and the obnoxiously wide neck hole.. The Sukana design is super cool though. Should've returned it and never taken a risk on it.
1.0,These feel cheap and are hard to slide on and off.  I would not recommend this product.  This is one I plan to return!
1.0,"Locks only work on round underwrite, not flat undrewire. So that was a disappointment, could  only fix one undrewire bra."
1.0,Update: after 1 week the hing pin started falling out. After about a 1/2 of working and a pair of pliers I got it back in. Next day I am leaving the Dr. office look down the watch is gone I back tracked checked car and house. Best guess pin fell out again and watch fell off some time that morning. Way to expensive for 2 weeks and gone
1.0,Love the style Chains are not durable tore up on first wear
1.0,I ordered these early for a Christmas present since I was already buying other socks for a birthday. I got them out today to get them wrapped and noticed they don’t have a band at the top. They just stop and roll down like they were never finished. So strange. I don’t think they will even stay up!!! I wish I could exchange them!
1.0,Terrible shirt cheaply made
1.0,The sweater is very loosely stitched and mine had holes in many of the seams right off the bat. The sleeves are sewn strangely so I have to roll them quite a few times.
1.0,Didn't realize these were from China. Took months to arrive and they arrived broken. If the studs weren't broken off when they arrived they might look pretty nice. I'm bummed because the picture looks very nice
1.0,Wore for about 3-4 weeks…. The bling portion peeled of (loose for a few days then completely fell off!
1.0,It says it's 100 0/0 silk but it's NOT
1.0,The hat wasn't worth the little money I paid for it. It looked way better in the picture.  Stop selling this junk!
1.0,"Cost me over $3 to return this item. I’m 5’3”, weight 138lbs and I bought a small. It was way too big. So I decided to return the item, over $3 to return the item."
1.0,Poor quailty
1.0,Really wish this would've been elastic.
1.0,The belt is nothing like picture .. very poor Quality .. The material is more of a costume material that is for kids I would not recommend to purchase this item
1.0,To big for my son
1.0,Bought two pairs. Neither fit my sons.  To small
1.0,"Super cheaply made.  Save your money.  Get your own mask and decorate.  If you come to New Orleans, just go to any gift shop and get one to take home with you.  They are much prettier, and you can see what you are purchasing beforehand."
1.0,I don't recommend these because the bag is very cheap and the stone was out. Had to glue it back in.
1.0,This product is made of view thin and see through material. Do not expect to wear without something under or over.
1.0,Very small pendent
1.0,Returned it!
1.0,This is extremely cheap and humongous - it has no shape at all - the drawstring does nothing to make it flattering - it’s like one huge box of fabric with not a single detail - no pockets - nothing
1.0,"Poor quality, poor fit. Very baggy, not flattering. The elastic around the wait was poor quality and did not sit as shown in the pictures as advertised. Overall, I would not recommend, nor would I buy again."
1.0,"Way too small, tried to send back, but it goes to China and cost more to send international than they are worth!"
1.0,Color as expected. Nice look.
1.0,Lasted only a week and broke from the top.  It good quality
1.0,Not sure how they fit I can't get them on you don't make any mention of somebody being overweight and can't reach there feet if you can't reach your toes you can't get these things on and that's the way it is ...... my fault not yours but I guess you should note that in your writings or something... I have a device that I can slip my socks over and get them on ... these socks won't work with it.. they are  too tight IT bends it over and you can't get your foot in it sorry they look nice ....
1.0,It made me sore. Not real at all
1.0,Bought in May started peeling off about a month ago (Only had this for 4 months). Scratches easily and the back is just as bad. I would not waist your money on this. It won't last and it is now too late to return it. We have to buy a new one.
1.0,Never wore it everyday or readjusted. Used it no more than15 or 20 days and it broke in to pieces.
1.0,Product didn't come with screws nor the screwdriver. Was very sad because its so pretty.
1.0,Runs way smaller than advertised.
1.0,No good fit
1.0,"You get what you pay for . While it was really cute , Mine fell apart when putting it on for the first time ."
1.0,"I bought a size L/XL, since they don't seem to offer a plain XL. It's far too tight and short, more like a Medium than anything else."
1.0,Horrible!!! Do not buy!  Returned to kohl’s.
1.0,Christmas present for my daughter and first day a stone fell out. Don't want a refund would like a exchange
1.0,I really liked the look of this band for my watch but the magnets have not held up at all. Would not recommend this and I have already bought a different band for my Apple Watch.
1.0,Stretched out too easy and also didn’t stay in place very well.
1.0,Horrible quality
1.0,These are available on other sites for 2.00 and also the quality is of low grade. Not a good product ..the picture appears much nicer..must be the lighting..
1.0,Just cheap
1.0,NOT FOR SENSITIVE EARS!!!!! My ears swelled up within 30 seconds of putting them in!!! Lying advertisement!!!!
1.0,"As cute as this was, it did not last long. The clip broke off after a week of using it :("
1.0,They arrived bent. I tried carefully to fix them and it completely broke. Barely any pressure broke the arm right off. Not even worth $5 you can find this quality at the dollar store. I can’t believe I paid 10. Lol.
1.0,the shirt was completely different and it was very large
1.0,Terrible fit. Cheap cloth.they run up your behind. No fly.
1.0,"Soaked in salt water, washed more than 5 times, still heavily color fading. It is just a piece of junk.  Do not waste your money. Since the label has been cut, I cannot return it any more, got 50% refund."
1.0,Does not fit. ..slides around and falls out.
1.0,Well I did like this until a stone popped out
1.0,"This product arrived as promised, packaged beautifully & looking great. That is where the greatness stopped. Once i opened the package the scarf (infinity: sewn together) unraveled & i was left with a piece of fabric that was anything but an infinity scarf. It would need to be sewn all together again to keep the scarf from unraveling further. Very disappointed. Not worth the $10 it cost at all. Save your $ & keep scrolling ... unless you have sewing skills to completely re-do."
1.0,"Looks nothing like picture. If I did not know this was the US flag, I would not be able to tell looking at item"
1.0,The picture made it look like it was a set had I known it was just the house coat 🧥 I wouldn’t have got it complete waist of money
1.0,Beautiful design. Bad measures
1.0,This extra large has been handed off to my size very small daughter.  It was very inexpensive but still not worth the money.  She will get use out of it as a beach/boat cover up.
1.0,"Arrived well packaged, but broken - unfortunately no return policy! I was excited to have this piece."
1.0,If I could sue these people I would.  The size chart is a joke.  The pants look horrible. Nothing like what we see in the picture.
1.0,this item was shipped fast...  however When we received this item my husband went to try them on.. and as he was undoing the Velcro that covers the zipper on the leg.  the zipper was not properly sewn in . We sent the product back and its being replaced . Hopefully this rain gear is worth it ..
1.0,"Size is not true, wore both shirts hate them but cannot return now. If you want to buy you need to buy 3x the size you normally wear"
1.0,"My wife said that the second time she tried to wear these, the backs didn't fit right and they fell off."
1.0,Not what I expected! So disappointed!
1.0,"Son lentes de sol normales no funcionan para ponerse sobre lentes ,ademas que no incluye los accesorios que dicen en el anuncio es una verdadera mentira"
1.0,"I normally take a large, so ordered the xl.  Came and I couldn't get it on, so returned and tried the 2xl.  The top was ok, but the bottoms didn't even come to my waist.  They were under my bellybutton.  Had to send that set back as well.  I generally follow the rule that if an item of clothing is coming from an asian country, that it runs small so size up.  This is way too small and they need to rethink their sizing for the american market."
1.0,"I purchased collar replacement after my dog was able to take it off during night and broke previous one. Same thing happened to this one a few weeks after purchase. Collar is only used during the nights, expected better durability."
1.0,This looks like a one piece it is not.  It comes with black underware thing.  The sizing is way off.
1.0,Pay attention to the size because these are huge AND VERY heavy! I can't even wear them because they are too heavy for my ears.
1.0,broke the first time I  used it
1.0,The shoulder straps were too short making it impossible for me to wear. I'm 5'7&#34; so I'm pretty average height. Very disappointed.
1.0,There is no way that this product fits to size. Absolutely NO stretch to it whatsoever.
1.0,Color darker than picture
1.0,The mask wasn’t good. I could not really move with the costume. I use it for Halloween
1.0,stiching comming undone on pockets after 2 months.
1.0,I did not like the way they looked. White with gold lenses stood out too much.
1.0,BUYER BEWARE!!!! This item is something you would find in a bubble gum machine. So not happy with this purchase and now not sure if I would ever order from this company again.
1.0,"I wear a medium that bought a large for more coverage. The straps are literally at the armpit so no matter how tight or loose, it will fall to the side. This is only for the Itty bitty bc even the larger size did not cover underboob. One breeze away from showing everything"
1.0,I had this bag for only a few weeks when one of the interior pockets started to unravel and then one of the straps snapped. I'm very disappointed in the quality of the bag and wish there was a way to get a refund at this point.
1.0,Itchy and way too large. I like large scarfs but this was crazy big. Not good quality at all very cheap material!
1.0,Black center is just a plastic bead.  It has a hole drilled right through the middle.  One earring showed a hole in the center.  One would think that at least would be turned so that would not be visible.  Not attractive!
1.0,"Fabric is pretty, but not as bright as pictured. I have more then a few neck gaiters and this ones quality leaves much to be desired. Nothing but a simple surged stiched edge. No hem or secured stiching. I am worried about it lasting. Also the fabric is rough, not soft and when you have something sitting that tightly against your face and throat it should be soft and comfortable. This one  not so much.<br />For the price (which is what I paid for better craftsmanship in others) I would have expected the same. I would not buy again, and would recommend that others keep shopping as there are higher qaulity, better made neck gaiters for the price.<br />*well took away another star as I didn't even have a chance to use it and I saw that the stitching is unravelling! I wasn't thrilled with it (besides the print) so it's being returned. Defective as it is. One thing I also checked is in none of the pictures does it show the cheap stiching. They make it appear to be an actual hem. Don't be fooled!"
1.0,The size chart is wrong because its way too small
1.0,The material terrible
1.0,What do I think of these earrings? Not much  Gave them to my mom for a little Thanksgiving Day gift and both earrings were missing stones that were rolling around in the box they came in. Dissatisfied and Disappointed
1.0,I returned the earrings. I am an adult. These are for infants. The size is so small. On the bright side I have never seen such cute infant earrings before.
1.0,"The band fell apart after only a few days, I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,"This belt is purple, not maroon."
1.0,I ordered my normal size.  Way too small.  I would the 3X is more like a size 18.
1.0,Ridiculously sized small.  Bought a med for a small friend wouldn’t fit hope she will be able to fit and XXL.  Pretty color cheap fabric
1.0,"I really wanted to love this quarter zip but sizing is terrible and I'm convinced they were all the same size with a different tag.<br /><br />I normally wear a large, sizing said it ran small so got an XL, it was way too small, like young teenager small. Returned and got a 2XL, same, tried a 3rd time and got a 3XL, same. I still had all 3 at the same time before returning. They did indeed have different tags so laid them out flat on top of each other and they were the same size. Not scientific, but the light bulb turned on when all 3 came in the exact same size packaging. Disappointed."
1.0,Way too small. Returned it.
1.0,"They don't fit my ear correctly so they hang off the side, they're difficult to put on and just don't look how I expected them to."
1.0,looks more like a night gown it's way to big for it to be a size small
1.0,Material isn't nice at all. The picture of the top  is misleading.
1.0,Far too expensive for what the product is and it does not noticeably affect the fit of the hat.  Would not recommend this to any buyer.
1.0,"Are you kidding?! Just received this.... cheap, shiny yarn. Knitting you can see through. Different pattern altogether and the sleeves were 5 inches too short!! Picture looked like a thick, cozy cable type sweater. I received a package from China that looked like it was knit by a child with cropped arms and the yarn from a dollar store!!!"
1.0,Talla incorrecto la tabla es la de un niño de.12.años no de adulto
1.0,Just over a month of wearing it and the belt broke.  Tore completely apart at one of the holes.  So it isn't worth the money.
1.0,"Not at all like the picture, very cheap material...awful fit."
1.0,"Even though this ring was only $.99, it was a waste!  Many cubic zirconia look real.  This looked the opposite.  Secondly, the color shown on the website showed a blue/navy color.  This looked green.  Thirdly, the way the ""silver"" part was made was very poorly done.  And lastly, I ordered a size 8 ring and the little bag it was in said size 8, but the ring wouldn't even go over my knuckle.  If I had paid more than $.99 for this ring, I would have sent it back.  I'll just throw it out.  Don't buy it!"
1.0,Badly printed Marine Corps logo. More on the top and not as vibrant as in the picture. As you can see the picture is not out of focus. Would've overlooked it but at nearly $15 its going back.
1.0,Completely useless
1.0,"Super small! Inaccurate size chart, inflexible material for movement and thin. BUYER BEWARE!!! They claim free returns but you have to pay for shipping"
1.0,Description says for kids but it is way too big like an adult's mask.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:9ab2a613f8d7909556bc0948183a1efa]] The idea of it is beautiful but it broke five minutes after putting it on... my pinky. And this is the largest size they have granted my fingers are bigger than some... They’ve never broken a ring before just by wearing it. I don’t think it cost that much so I didn’t even bother trying to return it but I should let everyone else know that it’s really fuzzy and that rose gold color is coming off and I didn’t hardly wear it because it’s broke.
1.0,"looks nothing like in the picture, poor quality, I had to return it."
1.0,This was very very very very cheap
1.0,"Just received the dress today. I absolutely love the color and style, but was sad as I examined the dress out of it's package to see the seams coming apart.  This is very poorly made and inappropriate to sell in this condition."
1.0,Clamps were too soft from day 1. Cheap
1.0,"I like them, they're light but this is my second pair that broke in the middle after a couple of months."
1.0,"Waste of money I will never wear it, it's way way too big and will hurt my belly button if I wear it."
1.0,Wrong hat altogether
1.0,"Absolutely ridiculous sizing difference. Listing says it runs small. I'm normally an XL, I wanted oversized and flowy so I ordered the 4x. The inseam is so short it's painful, and the waist/bust line was tight! Don't get me started on shipping time.. Took weeks to arrive.<br /> BEWARE...THEY CHARGE $6 TO RETURN THE ITEM."
1.0,Box came smashed and the cheek pieces are way too high. Basically it doesn’t fit right at all.
1.0,Did not provide compression
1.0,My earrings arrived today with jewels missing from them. Cheaply made. Very disappointed and want my money back.
1.0,Not the kind of watch I like. Too many functions and hard to see
1.0,I think the colors were cute but I had to give it to someone else because it was way to small. I wanted in 2XL my size.
1.0,Typical tiny Asian-made item. Don't bother if you over 5' 5&#34;.
1.0,"While pulling glasses out of packaging , right lens fell out !!! Really!!! I only had them less than a minute. I popped the lens back in. Will let you know how it works."
1.0,I got the 16 ga 8mm ring. It's so flimsy / poorly made that it wants to twist instead of closing. I'm very disappointed.
1.0,Fell apart the first time I wore it.
1.0,It runs small and feels rough and cheap. I wore it only once.
1.0,Way to small for an XXL.  the XXL is more like a Large in girth.  XXL usually hang on me as I wear an XL.  This was so tight I couldnt even get it on.
1.0,I got the black and it was see through and did not hold my body together. I was hoping to wear this to work but I can't. Not sure what I'll do with it but wouldn't even wear it out regularly.
1.0,Horrible watch..bump my hand on the wall and glass broke..cheap crap..don't buy!!!
1.0,AWFUL EXPERIENCE . DO NOT PURCHASE ....RUN!
1.0,"This shirt is weird. The print is beautiful, but the feel of the shirt is not nice on the skin. It's kind of big on the top, lose on the bottom. Not a cute look."
1.0,Ordered a size small and they fit like an XL... RIDICULOUSLY over sized. Most likely going to return them. The top is super itchy as well.
1.0,Terrible fabric and made poorly
1.0,"Way too small for my nipples plus it's very bothersome that you cannot exchange the bar so that you could make use of the piercings even if they were too short, one side is def glued or welded to the bar"
1.0,Pieces break to easily not worth it
1.0,"This suit runs very large.  Two of me could fit in it.  After trying to visualize how it would look on me if I got a smaller size the answer was  NO.  I thought it would be cuter, and it just isn't."
1.0,"Absolutely loved these leggings at first! They fit great, the compression band makes me much more comfortable with my midsection after recently giving birth, the material doesn't look or feel cheap, they are matte and not shiny, and they are not see through!<br /><br />However, the first time I wore the black pair the seam at the top of the right leg meeting the crotch stitching split.  Very unhappy!!  Going to continue wearing the grey pair and see if the same issue occurs, but what a let down. :("
1.0,The very first day back I go this I washed it and the turkey fell off. It is poorly put together! Cute but poor!
1.0,"Long & big, returned it"
1.0,Not what I was expecting. Very cheap thin material. And I can’t even return it! Def do not recommend
1.0,Washed it and the water turned brown. Gross
1.0,It was a cheap watch know I know why. The display face is small.It would be a good 1st watch for a kid. Everything about it screams cheap down to wrist band.
1.0,"The lenses are large, but not oversized. Their frame and nose piece are very wide and, even after gently bending the bridge, these glasses will fit loosely. Their sturdiness reflects the price paid."
1.0,The glasses came with the lenses detached.  Couldn't figure how to snap them back in.  Returned them to Amazon.
1.0,"This is not steel bonded this is plastic, my item came ripped so it's completely useless"
1.0,"If you plan on using this as an earring, please rethink... Would not fit. Extremely small!!!!!"
1.0,These things do not fit on the glasses. I tried three different sizes of glasses and they still did not fit.<br /><br />I had no way to check them out because of the gap on the bottom.
1.0,Looked cute but quality is cheap and fits a small kid.
1.0,I bought them cuz my hubby is a very tall.and they fit like a belly Sher on him
1.0,"I didn't realize that I bought two of the same dress. They were very pretty, just too small for me. There was nothing wrong with the dress. It just did not fit."
1.0,You get what you pay for and this was trashed when it got to me. Not to mention shipping time.
1.0,The package was opened and either missing the clips or it wasn’t even included to begin with
1.0,"I'm extremely disappointed with this bag. In only 3 days, the zipper broke. I barely got the chance to try it out before it became unusable. I wish I could give zero stars because I'm so upset. Do not buy this!"
1.0,"After wearing just once, the gold peeled away from the gloves.<br />I returned the gloves."
1.0,Way smaller and cheap
1.0,"Daughter was excited about it and then it broke the next day. Upon inspection, it’s pretty flimsy and I don’t recommend buying this unless you’re ok with breaking your stepdaughter’s heart."
1.0,These aprons are not good. They do not get softer when washed. They just get worse. Do not buy
1.0,"I'm sure I might have liked this necklace if I was mailed the correct one. It's just too much of a hassle to return and re order, suspecting ill have to pay more in shipping back than the total price. Sucks! Really wanted to love this.. Instead I got a necklace about mothers, which I am not."
1.0,Arrived with a loose stone.
1.0,Cheaply made. Wings broke off the 3 rd day
1.0,can't even fit in the top :( runs too small
1.0,I had to send them back for I have a 58 chest and a 32 waist they didn't fit me well.
1.0,"Fabric is, well, weird. Very unflattering fit. Gave it to my daughter (21) and she just laughed when I asked her if she liked it :( too late to return now, so it goes to goodwill. Bummer."
1.0,The buttons are fake and the flap they are on is not attached to the dress so it looks and lays weird.
1.0,I bought this for my daughter and she wore it for 1 day and it snapped in half. Very cheap
1.0,"This dress was for my granddaughters wedding.  It didn't fit right and was poor quality.  The seller is in China and will try to give you an address in the USA for returns, but it was undeliverable!  I had to start an A-Z Claim.  Thanks Amazon for having that to program!!!"
1.0,I don’t like the material for the diamond
1.0,Not as great of a deal. Product was lower quality than i was hoping for.
1.0,was so excited for this to arrive. I am a bridesmaid and it matched perfectly to my dress. The pink piece was broken off the necklace. I'm traveling out of the country and don't have time to return. Disappointed at I have no jewelry for the wedding!!!!
1.0,"Hard to breathe in them. It may be great to use for your students who read lips, but at what cost to your own health? I would not buy these again.<br /><br />I would go with one with a smaller see through window, allowing for more fabric surface area to allow CO2 out a d Oxygen in."
1.0,I wear a 2XL & their 2XL was too small
1.0,retuned it 2x because the sizes were WAY to BIG
1.0,Both pairs that I ordered ripped in two different strategic places within the first week of wear.  Neither can be repaired.  The zippers seemed substandard too so there was some concern with them breaking but did not get to wear them long enough to find out.  They did fit nicely and there was no issue with the shipments.
1.0,"I was excited about these pants, but what I received was not skinny pants. the leg opening felt more like 2005 bell bottoms. The leg opening was too big and not the modern tight fit I was hoping and looking for. But the color was great."
1.0,Absolute garbage they don't even stretch it's such a Mis advertisement do not buy these unless you want some jammie pants that don't stretch they're like Silk boxers
1.0,I wouldn’t but unless you only want to wear them for a couple minutes. Most of them fell off within a couple hours of wearing them on my crocs. It’s a complete waste of money. They just fall off
1.0,"The glove size is wrong, a large (8) was more like a medium to small (7, 7.5) and very stiff. Finger length was completely off. Gripping an object was not easy because of fit and stiffness. I bought two pair and I’m sending second set back. Very disappointing."
1.0,"Listed as 2 xl ,received large,evidently sizeing a little off,lol,won't order again"
1.0,All of the green hair started shedding right away!  Returned
1.0,"The fabric is horrible, it’s thin and crunchy like tissue paper. Feels like it will fall apart."
1.0,"Too large for me. And I didn't like it, because it was different from the picture they are showing."
1.0,I wore them 1 time. They tore through the bottom. I had to throw them away
1.0,El diseno es bueno pero no sir en para la contruccion
1.0,"I absolutely love the watch. I needed an inexpensive everyday watch and this is perfect. There were other reviewers who complained that it did not keep time properly, but I have not had that issue. I have had this almost a week and it is still keeping perfect time. It is a manual watch which means no batteries and you DO have to wind it. I actually like that idea! The watch looks great and I love the clear front and back to see the gears.<br /><br />The only reason it is not a 5 star is the watch band is a little big for what was supposed to be a women't watch. I think my wrists are average size and I had to put in another notch since the smallest one was still too big and the heavy watch face would cause the watch to turn around on my wrist. Very annoying for someone who sits and types at a computer all day. Also the watch face was a lot larger than I thought it would be, but I have gotten used to it. If it was too small it would be pointless to have the clear front to see the inner workings.<br /><br />For the money, it's a great watch! I wind it a little each day and so far no problems. Again, it has kept perfect time since I received it early this week and you just have to remember to wind it.<br /><br />****UPDATE****<br />I did love the watch, but the pin broke that winds the watch and changes the hands. The pin is no longer locking properly and therefore the hands are not moving consistently. I am so very disappointed since I really did love this watch when I first got it. I made sure not to over wind the watch and was very careful with it. So, it was great at first, but now it's completely useless. Going to see if I can still return it."
1.0,"Most obvious thing, the body of the shirt was way too tight and small for the size I ordered. Two, the sleeves we're so massive. There were like parachuting over my arms, just flopping around like they were 10 sizes too big. I could have fit two of my arms in one sleeve. The colors weren't as vibrant as the picture depicted. I returned immediately."
1.0,They aren't hypoallergenic so I can't wear them without hurting my earlobes.
1.0,Have to send back. Maybe one size up will fit.
1.0,"What I ordered looks nothing like this images, and the sizing chart does not reflect what I received either. Probably one of the worse purchases."
1.0,"The type of fabric is not good, i meam someting Strong..."
1.0,"Cute in your picture but very cheap, indeed. I don't mean to be so blunt; however I've trusted your picture of the item; as well as your description of this item,& I do recall that your ad also stated that these earrings had a much BIGGER PRICETAG, before you placed them on this great sale!; however my receipt of them & My inspection, there is NO WAY that these earrings cost more than $1.00 for the manufacturer to make!  These are cheap and worthless!, & the portion that goes through ones ear is also FAR TOO BIG! These would physically stretch my ears holes! Please tell me how to return."
1.0,"The buckle on this item is huge. The watch broke in less than 24-hours of use. I do not recommend this product. Seller was great, processed a refund and I will by from seller again if I see a product that I am interested in."
1.0,: (
1.0,Vintage?
1.0,The beige hat is much darker than the picture and it is not at all packable. It came out with a huge crease that only ironing will straighten. I am returning this item.
1.0,"My daughter was so excited to buy this dress.  Looked super cute online, but in person, it's HUGE and seems like it's made of tissue paper.  Not flattering and just awkwardly designed. Definitely returning this."
1.0,Did not work as advertised.
1.0,"This particular item is too short, it keeps coming unstuck from my pants."
1.0,Not at all what I expected. Super thin and way too small.
1.0,"Ordered two different times for my daughter.  Both times item came as a necklace.  Necklace was nice, but she really wanted earings."
1.0,The case was hard to put on and once i did it made bubbles through all the sides on my screen protector
1.0,"These pants are poorly made and misshapen. I'm 5'9"" 135 lbs. I got the medium according to the website. The pants will not fit past my knees. If they did, they would be too short. The customer service department is not helpful at all."
1.0,"It sucks, save your money. Lights don't work and it is cheaply made for the money they are charging you would think you would get a better product. I want my money back!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,This product is made of t shirt material. The dress shown in the picture is not the same dress that has been sent. This dress is not worth $5.
1.0,"Cheap material, doesn't look like leather, looks like thick paper. Broke after about 10 min they were put on. Quit embarrassing as these were gifts for team moms.<br />Returned"
1.0,Bad dye job.
1.0,"the blazer we received was much, MUCH shorter than the one pictured...it fit like a regular length or even a short sytle blazer...not happy at all"
1.0,jewelry would not screw back on it was stripped so i am unable to wear it..complete waste of money!
1.0,"Even though it states that it fits small it was still too small.  I wear a medium in blazers and purchased an XL preparing for it to be big.  It was the right size for my 18 year old 89 pounds daughter.  I purchased this for my mothers' funeral, her favorite color.  To say that I am disappointed is an understatement."
1.0,"My son has only been wearing these since mid December. Considering they wear them at school and they were not in school mid December until January 8, I was shocked when they were sent home with him looking like this! Unfortunately the return window is closed but I have never seen such poor quality! This happened in less than 2 months!"
1.0,Broke the first time my daughter wore them.  They were only worn inside.
1.0,Way too big for an average face. Covers my whole face.
1.0,"I didn’t like them at all, they’re made super cheap and don’t even block the sun."
1.0,I returned this item to Kohl’s on 1/14/21 but have received credit.  When am I going to see the credit?
1.0,"Poor quality. I didn't open the package for a month and when I did, the side seam was not sewn and the fabric is frayed so I can't sew.<br />It's too late to return so I have this robe that has a split seam"
1.0,I would give it less if I could.  There is no padding or support in the shoe and caused my son terrible bruising on his heal after his first game.  You could easily see and feel the hard lump of the cleats from the inside at the heal.  Awful experience for him and start to the season.
1.0,"This ring is very cool. I am giving it one star because it doesn't hinge as well and is not as comfortable as the other one I have, also by this brand, is.  The finish wore off after about a week of wear. Expected more."
1.0,"Loved the packaging! Doesn’t look cheap, have one star because it doesn’t fit. Apparently my large nostrils won’t allow this dainty nose ring to fit"
1.0,Cheap plastic... Very disappointed
1.0,"I will be returning this today. There are tears in the seams, black stains down the back of the cardigan, and the only thing BIG on this cardigan are the sleeves. I normally wear a 2x and this fit more like 1x if not smaller. Very displeased but I can't be too shocked based on reviews."
1.0,Horrible.  Awful
1.0,I was very disappointed because I ordered the dress and received it very beautiful but too small. So we re ordered and returned the first dress. When I received the new dress it was the correct size but a completely different dress. We had to settle for the dress due to not having enough time to wait for a another to come in.
1.0,Ordered for a Halloween outfit in Royal Blue. It came with a label that said Royal Blue but it was beige. Would not recommend this vendor if your purchase is for a special occasion and needs to be the right color.
1.0,"NO way to take out links, no pins, so you better have a large wrist"
1.0,was not true to size. had to return
1.0,"The breast cups were a weird shape and overall, just felt low quality."
1.0,Ordered a M Poor fabric quality and runs really small not true to size at all
1.0,Los dos relojes me llegaron en mal estado!
1.0,I love these earrings in the picture even in person they were great but very very very dainty and I was scared to even wear them so I had to return them unfortunately
1.0,So upset that they run so small! I have bought all different kinds on here n same size n fit amazing! But these cut into my skin n hurt so bad! Definitely way to small!
1.0,"This sprorts bra being labeled as a high-impact bra is a joke. There is no stretch whatsoever around the chest so that part was way too big, and I couldn't even get the girls in the cups they were so small. I ordered a 36DD because that's what I wear but the chest was way too big and the cups way too small. When I finally wiggled into it, I did a couple of jumping jacks and I literally fell out of the bottom. Literally, one boob fell out of the bra. I've got my return label printed. It's going back today."
1.0,"The hats are extremely cute. Love all the colors. Would have really enjoyed the color I bought as opposed to what I received. I did not get what I ordered. Hat should have been tye dye bluish but I received yellow, big difference"
1.0,I thought this item was cheap looking and returning it is going to be a pain without much refund.  Buyer beware:)
1.0,If you mess up the first time it won’t work
1.0,It's super small and the chain broke 2 minutes after I took it out.
1.0,Ordered a much larger size and still about 2dicrs to small
1.0,The Chinese need to get their sizes closer to the US if they want to sell here. I knew they ran small so I ordered an XL. It was so small I could not even get it on. They did look well made however but ridiculously small
1.0,This dress is huge! I ordered a medium thinking it would run small but nope it's actually way too big and the only way I can wear it is as a coverup for a bathing suit.
1.0,Hat was sewed incorrectly so the hat said Vamos Pest instead of Vamonos Pest.  Tried to return it and it was forcing me to pay for postage to China !!! ridiculous
1.0,"I purchased these to use for snowboarding, and when I received them they seemed fine. However, when I finally put them on to use, without even stepping a foot outside, I already had issues. The zippers on both side pockets came off the track and did not close or open at all. This kept me from being able to hold anything in either pocket the entire day. Secondly, after only two runs on the slopes, the pants ripped in the groin area without any abrupt or unnatural movements. I was extremely disappointed and will never purchase these pants again."
1.0,These laces were way too loose to feel like they were holding my son's shoes together even though I followed the sizing guide.  I didn't go through the hassle of returning but wouldn't recommend these.
1.0,The picture shows that there is a right and a left. Both of my earrings point the same way. It would look asymmetrical if I ever wore these.
1.0,This bag is made from light-weight cotton fabric NOT heavy duty canvas as the description says.  What a waste of money.  For this price of eight-fifty-five one could purchase a much nicer and better quality shopping bag.  Heads up people - don't waste your money.
1.0,This dress would be great if I did not have any boobs. I ordered a Medium (like I do in most all clothes) and I couldn't even get it over my boobs (36DD). Pretty bummed because this dress would have been perfect.
1.0,Way too small for a medium.
1.0,"Poor quality, the specs on the add is 10 times better than the actual product."
1.0,The size 6M Big Kid is an infant/toddler size 6. Not a 6 Youth Big Kid size.
1.0,"Unlike the photo, the yellow color of this top is a dull/dirty yellow.  I usually wear a small, but bought a medium, and it’s skin tight.  It’s extremely see-through, so returning it."
1.0,LOW QUALITY
1.0,"One of the words used to describe this scarf was &#34;mantilla&#34; and that is the purpose for which I ordered it: wearing a mantilla/ veil during Mass. However, the scarf I received was only about 4&#34; from the base of the triangle to the tip, definitely not wide enough to be a mantilla.<br /><br />My parting tip: This product is neither a mantilla or a shawl but rather a long, thin, mildly-triangular scarf. The product title is misleading."
1.0,This is cute but the pineapple broke off after about a month so it's useless
1.0,I liked it a lot but the 2nd time I put him in it and went to change diaper the 2 snaps  fell off .
1.0,Purse description was way off. My wife opened it up and found a bag barely big enough to fit keys and a wallet. Immediately boxed it back up and dropped it off at UPS for a return. It measured 4x5x7 inches. See my picture.
1.0,Horrible.  Broke within 3days.
1.0,I don't think it's a bad product just wish the pictures were relative to the actual size. 10mm is super big and heavy. Ordered a 6 and 7 still waiting on them to arrive
1.0,"It was missing the pen, but they didn’t want to return it because another one had one that came with the pen."
1.0,"Not impressed, can't get it in my nose or ear. It has like no room it's way thicker than advertised. It's useless 🤷‍♀️"
1.0,sloppy looking!
1.0,Total garbage. Doesn't work. Pairing process sucks. Way to expensive doesn't solve anything
1.0,"Did not last long, it barely sticks"
1.0,"I was initially SOOO happy when I received this purse! I just started to use it (literally sat on my counter, then on my desk) and the pins popped out and it's broke! VERY disappointed!<br /><br />Shortly after, the fabric started to fray :-( To bad, such a cute purse."
1.0,Material is rough and see through.
1.0,I have a 40 inch chest and got medium. They are not substitutes for Under Armor. There is no compression.
1.0,This does not hold you up doesn’t work
1.0,Sole separated from Slipper after minimal wear.
1.0,"Very cheaply made, no clasp"
1.0,"I ordered this in Aug 2020.  I contacted the seller several times and was told the items were late due to customs relays.v I finally received my earrings late October.  I am not happy about the delay, but the earrings are even better than the online picture.  Very nice."
1.0,"Soooo UGLY!!! Check out my pics. This LOOKS NOTHING like the photo. The photo shows a pretty fringe around the border of the shirt...that fringe is NOT there. Also the material on the photo looks like some very thick, ribbed cotton or something, but its SUPER thin, flimsy, and NOT ribbed..they're just lines. Also the CUTEST part of the shirt in the PHOTO is the draw-string effect in the center of the breasts...LOOKS like you pull them to tighten the bottom upwards right? WRONG! It is JUST some random strings hanging down the center of your chest that you can tie into a bow..they are not connected in ANY way to the rest of the shirt, so pulling them doesnt draw up the bottom of the shirt..tying the string just makes a bow and leaves the bottom part of the shirt sticking out WAY underneath and it looks SOOO stupid."
1.0,I’m so disappointed. The picture of this mask made it look sparkly and shiny. When I received this it was dull and PRINTED on. There were NO diamonds and no sparkle. What a joke. DO NOT buy these. Waste of money.
1.0,Poorly built boot with poor fit and stiff material
1.0,Took 3 months to arrive and by then I couldn't even return it! Highly disappointed!! Worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon! Do not buy!!!!
1.0,"Garbage. The hat they send is NOT the one pictured! It is flimsy, made with cheap material and if you have a hat size larger than 7 1/2 this will be too tight and uncomfortable. DONT BUY THIS!!!"
1.0,turn color
1.0,"This is horrible. Can’t tell pants back or front as they fit same & terribly. The buttons are huge & ‘ ‘clicky’ like the have magnets on them. It’s an awful outfit even for a Halloween costume if it ever came to that. They put it together straight from sewing, didn’t press seams so they look pretty & flat ."
1.0,If you have tiny 2 inch nipples these are for you the bars are way to damn short and hurt after having them on 5 min ...very cute but the wings only come off on one side so no hope of putting the wings on a long bar. You get what you paid for<br />..took forever to get here.
1.0,One of the earrings was broken when I took the product out of the package.
1.0,The skirt is very tight and did not match the size explanation.  I ordered and XL and it fit like a medium.
1.0,The shirt runs too small at least order a size up
1.0,Thought I would really like this so that I had a wallet that held my phone as well.  The zipper pulls apart all the time on either side and I don't think I have that much in it.  It will do it even when I don't have my phone in it.  I wish it had been sturdier.
1.0,"not good, returned it."
1.0,Too small thou I brought 2 sizes up
1.0,"I received only one, instead pack of 2"
1.0,They came broken and the ones that weren't beoke shortly after
1.0,The fit is terrible and extremely uncomfortable.  Several brands out there are way better
1.0,CHEAP material.
1.0,"Like i already said,item not secure and don't waist your money"
1.0,"Cheaply made!!!  All of my purses were empty and light weight but after a few weeks, when one slid down the strap, three of the plastic hooks broke."
1.0,The backs didn’t fit the earrings!!
1.0,still useing.
1.0,Very cheaply made stitching and material.
1.0,Someone just threw them into a box( unpackaged) They're  Men's gloves!! And the Size tag was Cut out of the inside of them - They literally fall off of my hands!!! What's up with that -  Someone loose their gloves???
1.0,The beads were falling off the first time I wore it. I ended up taking it off.
1.0,They tarnished on first wear.
1.0,"If I had known what I'd be receiving, I wouldn't even have paid $1.00 for it. It is a tiny, flimsy pouch. It is not plastic or cloth...it is like a very thin crinkly shiny tarp material. Waste."
1.0,It was completely see through.
1.0,"One of the valves is off, it's way oversized, and it didn't come with extra firters...also poor quality. I would return it, but it doesn't seem worth the effort. What a waste."
1.0,The N on the earring came off the first day I wore them. Don’t order these they are not made well. I know these are not real and they are affordable but the craftsmanship could have been better. Not happy with this purchase at all.
1.0,Was not as expected runs small. I gave it away
1.0,Ordered a 2x as I normally wear a 1x. Recived shirt and it was very tight. Very disappointed
1.0,"We got these shoes for our snow trip. After a few hours of use, a huge hole appeared inside the shoe! See photo. Thankfully our snow vacation is only for 2 days, as now our little one has no waterproof shoes to wear."
1.0,We weren’t even able to get this on my dads legs.  The doctor<br />Did the office measurements so we order within those measurements but the socks were way too small.
1.0,"I've had this wallet less than 6 months and it is already falling apart. Cheap materials, cheaply constructed, should never have bought it!"
1.0,"This necklace broke the very first time I wore it. I had it on for less than 3 hours, did nothing strenuous at all, and the entire clasp fell off. Very poor quality"
1.0,I ordered this because I thought it was a good deal and the reviews convinced me to get it. It is terrible and way too small and see through. Money better spent elsewhere.
1.0,"very small for me,"
1.0,No me llegó el color q pedi
1.0,The description is a lie. The item is not 100% cotton.
1.0,Zero stars!!!! The shirts are huge! i wanted to eear them for mothers day and now we cant. The adult small is like ab adult large!!!!!! Dont buy
1.0,"The earring was stuck in my ear due to the poor craftsmanship.  I appreciated them sending me a new pair, no charge, but, I did not want to chance it again.  Granted, it could have just been one pair that was bad, but, my boyfriend literally had to cut it off my ear."
1.0,I can’t it’s to big
1.0,Snap to hold wallet shut broke as soon as I took it out of package and opened the wallet. It was cheap. Not worth sending back since it was only a few dollars. You get exactly what you pay for.
1.0,"Very pretty, but on arrival and inspection, I could see that the charms were not on securely. And one charm looks like a fried egg????!!! What IS that?"
1.0,These are pearl white in color. They are not silver.
1.0,Cheaply made and looks it
1.0,The mask was cheap and you get what you pay for.  It broke immediately when my son tried it on.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  Try a different company for your mask because I have purchased 3 in the last 6 months and this one is the only one not functional.
1.0,Runs small and is super thin
1.0,"This is not even close to be XL.... Nowhere close. The shirt is rather thing, but I ordered black so it wouldn't have been too noticeable, but it doesn't matter. I can't come anywhere close to wearing it."
1.0,Disapointed. The cages shown are not really telhe ones you get. There was not a dragon fly in there and several others I order for just those
1.0,The fabric was really bad. Very scratchy and see through. I barely had it out of the bag long enough to feel the scratchy material and did a test stretch with my hand and it was sheer.
1.0,Got delivery 9/30/2019 and today is 12/18/2019 and the band is broken (not usable).
1.0,After having it for 2 days it ripped
1.0,"I have bought these pants multiple times and they were perfect, but the pants I received are now listed from a different seller and ARE NOT what is pictured. They are gross material with a 1-inch elastic waist you can feel. Unfortunately return shipping costs money and this is the first time I have had a major issue with what I ordered from Amazon."
1.0,"This band is made from very cheap materials. It is so stiff, that putting it in causes damage and bending to the band. Also feels terrible on- it’s plastic and sticks to the skin. Save your money. Very disappointed in the quality."
1.0,"I had to send back.I am very small and the size small was way too tight ,also neck piece is very uncomfortable."
1.0,These shoes do not make noise- I thought they did- also the fit doesn't work- my son will not wear these shoes- he says there so loose- the straps won't strap tight no matter how much you try-- very disappointed for the money!
1.0,Two of the three of the shorts were very visibly mislabeled and not the right size. I could read the size 7/8 printed on the shorts under the transparent sticker they put over it that said the next size up. The same transparent sticker was put on the tags. One pair was the correct size and was noticeably bigger than the other two. The correctly sized ones were a tad on the thin side and a bit small compared to other clothing in the same size.<br /><br />I returned for a full refund.
1.0,"Size was too small for a large, they run small. And ridiculous they won't accept returns!"
1.0,"The size is not the one indicated in the size chart. I bought mine and it is HUGE. I cannot use it.<br />Also, the colour is awful. Sorry to say it was very disappointing."
1.0,Not for the helix. Way to small
1.0,Runs small and if you try to return it you'll pay as much as it's worth to return it. Wish I had read the reviews closer.
1.0,Same poor quality as my review of the same shirt in black. They need to print out patterns from other silhouettes in the current men's tops market.
1.0,"Dont waste ur money ,this wont even go around my kids neck let alone mine.  It's pretty but definitely not a wearable necklace. Sending mine back asap."
1.0,Had these shoes for two weeks an they already started to tear
1.0,I received my package today. It included only the bikini top but not the bottoms. How can I receive the bottom bikini?
1.0,The pants arrived COVERED in cat fur. I am a size 8-10 and ordered a large. They didn't even go over my thighs. Horrible sizing. They also didn't appear to be high waisted in person.
1.0,This outfit is made with such cheap material! Totally bummed out! Won’t be ordering from here again
1.0,Broke within two days.
1.0,This is sized in a different country. Large is about an xsmall in real life.
1.0,"I bought these glasses and they were delivered March 8, 2019. This is April 19, 2019, and two of them have already broken. I love the glasses and the way they look, but they are very cheaply made. I ordered another box of them before the others broke that was just delivered April 8th, (they were on backorder). I'm probably going to return them."
1.0,"Loved the size and colors! But after a few weeks, frames snapped and lens pop out!  Looking for new glaases.  Good review for Gorilla glue."
1.0,They do not stamp with any home stamping kit I have :( Sadly they are a little too firm.
1.0,Nothing like pictured. Large and heavy.
1.0,These are my 3rd Tom Ford replacement. Break often!
1.0,To small great fabric I had to return since didnt fit
1.0,"When I received these, they were separated at the little links in between big and small stone. It requires tools to put back together and I don't even know if they would help."
1.0,"Don't even bother getting these shorts or any of the other pairs that are spamming Amazon. I first got a small, my normal size, and it was too small. So that was disappointing but I just returned it and exchanged it for a medium which was even smaller!!<br /><br />The sizing is so inconsistent, the fabric is very cheap, and it took forever to come. Just save your money and go to Target or something."
1.0,After one wash it shrunk so I will definitely not be purchasing from them again
1.0,Looks nice but the Inserts are way to deep. Was digging to recover  credit cards and i.d.
1.0,Not as pictured. Flower is not 3 dimensional. Flower is flat with cheap paint and painted center dots. No petals are either lifted. I received black which there is no way to choose black or white on your order. Not worth it.
1.0,"Even though the earrings look great in the packaging, but they are absolutely horrible. After one wear, the gold tone tarnished and now the earrings are ruined. They are not worth the money"
1.0,Stone is grey and ugly- NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE.<br />Very disappointing.
1.0,Broke first wear
1.0,"Poor quality, very short"
1.0,"I have had several sets of travel cubes and travel for a living. These started out ok, but the zippers are not study and after a few months have had constant problems."
1.0,"these were badly made + had a jagged spike of metal along the earwire or post of one earring<br /><br /> I am glad they cut my finger would hate to think if I had actually put in my ear!!<br /><br />was not expecting anything fancy but they were worse than dollar store ""bling""<br /><br />they are in the mail on the way to be returned!"
1.0,It’s useless. I would rather do it myself. Wish I had returned last week. Sorry for the wasted money.
1.0,Turned my daughters neck green. Extremely disappointing. Will attempt return
1.0,"Super cheap material, I ordered a size large. I’m 5’9” and 175 lbs - the dress was way too small and fabric extremely flimsy and cheap."
1.0,Hardly any hole in shoulders.  Short on waist.
1.0,"Glasses came in a plastic sleeve that was too small for the glasses poked out. They were scratched, glue connecting the frame with lenses was sloppy. I returned It ASAP."
1.0,The printed part of the cap is only a very thin piece of material. It is not a real patch. It looks very cheap. Not a very good looking product. For the price there is alot better caps on the market .
1.0,Cute fit but tears so easily. Waste of money.
1.0,"Very thin, flimsy material.  It might be suitable for compressing soft fabrics, but not anything more substantial."
1.0,"The size chart is off by two sizes, so I returned the items."
1.0,Very disappointed with the quality. The belts are very flimsy and do not stay in place. Spend a few more dollars and get a better belt.
1.0,"Update: Lowered my rating<br />None of the beads are actually attached to the head piece.  So the reason why the beads are falling off is that they are sliding off the bottom of the strands.  There is nothing at the bottom to stop them.  This is junk.<br />---<br />I do photography and had planned on using this as a prop for some shoots.  Pulled this out of the bag and beads immediately started falling off of this.  As I put it on the person who would be using it, more beads fall off.  Thankfully the shot was far enough away to not have issues due to the beads falling off.  If you are wearing this for a costume party and won't be too active you may be OK.<br />---"
1.0,I purchased these for a form fitting dress that made my butt smashed and appear smaller. These were so tiny that I could use them in my bra (but I won't). I ended up tossing them.
1.0,The size of this skirt didn't even fit my nine year old that is 60 pounds. Absolutely unsatisfied and want my money back
1.0,"This was the worst piece of clothing I’ve ever purchased - and that includes garage sales and second hand stores. There were iron (red stain) marks on collar, collar was only printed on one side, it smelled of a terrible chemical smell....wow."
1.0,Very poor quality. Just opened the black one and the threads are out and the buttons are loose. Haven’t even worn them yet. Have to return these.
1.0,Bought an XL for my son. It looked like someone took a few inches off the length. It was as long as it was wide. I’m 5’4 and if I wore it and raised my arms up it would look like a belly shirt. Had to return.
1.0,When wet they are see-through. This material is not good for swimming unless you wear something under them. Thank god I tested the material in the shower before going to the public pool. No one wants to remake the movie of free will in that compacity. I shiver in horror the day a man buts and goes without reading the review. Side note it's probably just fine for Florida man. All jokes aside DO NOT BUY unless it's for home use only. Definitely not for public outings.
1.0,Doesn't work.  Gave it as a Birthday gift for my fiance and he wound it up and it didn't do ANYTHING.  Very disappointed.  I feel let down and embarrassed.  I will be sending it back.  It is a beautiful piece though.
1.0,Buen material pero no me gusto q se abrochan adelante y unos atras
1.0,Charms tarnished an fell off within a week.<br />Also a Marine is a Marine bit a soldier<br />One charm should have been I love my Marine.<br />Not I love my soldier.
1.0,Waste of money 😕
1.0,They did not keep my feet any warmer than any other sock.  Rip Off
1.0,"The print seemed good although placed a bit low. The neck opening was really big, much more than pictured. The shirt was unusually square too. Just didn't work for me... overall wonky."
1.0,"The frames came crooked, and the ""clear"" glass is actually foggy. I bought these for a Halloween costume, and it worked, but I was uncomfortable seeing through them the whole night."
1.0,The outfit was too short for my taste.
1.0,Not 4 real plus-sized persons...I returned them
1.0,"One of the worse purchases i've made on amazon.<br />These are definitely not something I would recommend to any adult.<br />The quality of the fabric is poor and they're short and painful to wear for both hands/feet, however, they're not worth returning.<br />They seem to be made for a child not an adult."
1.0,"Much too small and the seller was non-responsive. XXL is about the size of a S/M, i.e. size 8/10"
1.0,I was really excited when I found this ceramic band for my Apple watch but have been very dissappointed in the quality.  I have had the band for a month and one of the ceramic links cracked and the band is no longer usable.  I'm now out the money I paid for the band and wearing the apple silicone band again.
1.0,Fabric is very thin .
1.0,Terrible material... Not nice.. definitely not good for work or going out.  Maybe to clean the house in!!
1.0,This is very see through and cheaply made. Don't be fooled by the other reviews they are clearly incorrect. It is not lined or hemmed at the bottom.
1.0,"Holy moly WHAT is the GOD AWFUL SMELL that this marinated in before shipping?<br /><br />It's cute, but the material is rough."
1.0,The fit was off and it had a funky smell.
1.0,Terrible quality. Paws are thinly stamped on and come off very easily. Not cool.
1.0,This chager doesn't even work with my watch.
1.0,My daughter usually wears size US 6 .I ordered size 8 but still it's very tight fit
1.0,I would give these shoes five stars but they soak up water. They are not good outdoor shoes for new walkers. For indoors only they are great
1.0,My 7 year old wanted fangs to go with his werewolf costume... bought these for him and to share with friends. He said these hurt his teeth/mouth so much that he decided to not wear them and go in costume w/o fangs. Bummer.
1.0,Broken upon receipt
1.0,This necklace looks terrible.  It’s supposed to be sterling silver.  I take it off every time I take a shower.  I can return it and I would like to get my money back please.
1.0,"I read many reviews before ordering this dress and most said they liked the fit. This dress will definitely be a donation to the needy bag. Some of the reviews said the dress was empire waist, but they liked the way it looked on them so I took a chance and ordered. This dress definitely is empire waist with way too much gathered material under the empire. It would make a cute maternity dress. I selected too large for the product fit because of the gathered waist, the top fits as expected."
1.0,Very disappointing purchase - does not look or fit anything like in the pics.
1.0,"The shirt I received looked nothing like the shirt in the picture. The fabric was ugly, cheap, and uncomfortable. I returned. So disappointed."
1.0,I got a kids size
1.0,Looks very very cheap. Cheap bathing suit material lined with felt. Slit made it look worse with the thick stitching outlining it. Did a quick return. I wouldn’t dare wear that out!
1.0,Felt cheap and it’s see through
1.0,"Ordered in April. Watch is very comfortable but fell apart within 3 months. I would say I am fairly tough on watches but this watch was not abused more than regular everyday wear. Also removed before entering water. Thankfully amazons 2 year warranty covered repair. As you can see, several pieces broke apart inside the watch. Would not recommend."
1.0,This doesn’t help put on a bracelet at all. It is stiff and has a clip on the end it is not flexible and was a waste of money in my opinion.
1.0,I would like to tell you that I sent it back because it’s not like the picture and I don’t like it..
1.0,It fits more or less ok. Was too short then I thought. It doesn't look like the picture at all. Will not buy from kearia anymore.
1.0,The glasses are very fashionable but are extremely wide to say they are oversized is an understatement !!
1.0,Worst sizing!! I ordered an adult medium and it’s actually a kid small.. Highly disappointed
1.0,I returned it because it was too small
1.0,WORE IT ONCE AND IT BROKE.
1.0,They barely hold in place. One side always slips half way out but doesnt release under pressure. Poor quality. Only 1 hole on each side to feed straps through so you must stitch the strap to itself to secure to latch.
1.0,They are to loose around the legs
1.0,Definitely not a one size fits all. The ties were too short; could barely tie it.
1.0,My gotcha fell out literally the first day of wearing it. I unfortunately didn't notice until I got home so that really sucked.
1.0,It was nice and fit well prior to washing and drying (in the drier).  The wash/dry shrunk it and the material is no longer a silky cotton.  It's wrinkly and faded.
1.0,round smalll
1.0,"I absolutely loved this top, it fits great and looked great but it is on the SHEIN website for $5 vs $16.99 on here. It is the same top so that is a pretty frustrating price difference. Buy it off SHEIN. I returned mine and bought it off SHEIN and I will attach a picture of the SHEIN shirt on me (I added the black tank top underneath). I’m 5’5 and ordered an XL because I wanted it to be a little baggy so I would advise to size up."
1.0,Very thin fabric and cheap. You get what you pay for!
1.0,It was very thin and it doesn't help sweat. U did not like it
1.0,Don't waste your money on these shirts. One of them had a hole and the others had brown stains. They are also very thin and have somewhat of a smell to them. Very disappointed with these shirts!
1.0,These would not accommodate the arms of my student’s glasses.  Had to return.
1.0,This top is ok...nothing special!
1.0,pedí un body de Mickey Mouse para el cumpleaños de mi bebé y llegó fue uno de Elmo
1.0,These do not fit standard ear piercings.
1.0,"Cheap, see through, unwearable"
1.0,Beautiful dress but I ordered up 2 sizes and that didn’t work. What type of guide are they using. I wear a 16 all day everyday so I ordered a 2X.
1.0,I followed the size chart and got something smaller than expected.
1.0,Product was to small and came broken
1.0,"After only a few weeks of using this swimsuit, I need to revise my original positive review. I swim laps three times a week.  The swimsuit is coming apart: the material has stretched and has become  very saggy.  But the worst is that the fabric is simp,y disintegrating.  I wash my swimsuits after each use and yet the fabric is just dissolving. The pictures give a mild I presión of what it’s really like. Unfortunately the return window closed a week ago - a few days before the problem became so evident.  It’s a very disappointing experience."
1.0,"I'm 5'1"" and weigh 116. . .this is so BIG! It's cute but I'm sending it back."
1.0,Piece of junk seams ripped first time I put a credit card in it not happy at all.....
1.0,They look like someone used school glue to put these earrings together
1.0,"Too thin, and size feels incorrect. My hands are between large and medium so I alway buy large. The box says large but these feel closer to medium. Also tore 4 of my first 5 pairs I pulled out of the box just putting them on. Took the risk because these were cheaper than the gloves I normally buy due to covid jacking up glove prices. Won't be buying these again."
1.0,The shirts were made improperly the waist line was flared like it had been stretched out of shape. I would have returned it but I am disabled and getting out to send it back was not possible.
1.0,Looks like something you get out of a cereal box prize. Gave it to my friend's daughter
1.0,"This swimsuit is not true to fit. The top is way to small, and bottoms are to big."
1.0,"This costume is a cheap joke compared to what is shown, I am returning immediately and don’t know if my son will be able to be siren head for Halloween, very disappointed."
1.0,Fell apart immediately… no really
1.0,Not even big enough for a gag gift!
1.0,These are very cheap and don't look like the picture. Santa is just a sticker on the side of the cup.
1.0,"Very poorly made.<br /><br />I've owned this kilt for about 12 months and purchased it specifically to go to various festivals and rarely to go out and about during the day. In total I've worn this kilt maybe 10 times and it's falling apart.<br /><br />If I'd payed $15 for the kilt then I'd understand the lack of quality, but it cost almost $80 and isn't even close to worth the price. Maybe I just got a kilt that happened to have been made from a bad piece of fabric but its absolute trash."
1.0,"I purchased this shirt as a 2XX so that I could wear it as a comfy oversized sleep shirt.  Pfffffffffffft!  Silly me!  I gave it to my husband, who wears a medium t-shirt and has for years.  Fits him perfectly.  I mean PERFECTLY... so beware - apparently 2X  means medium!"
1.0,"The fabric is synthetic,and not quality"
1.0,"Brought two, one for me and one from a friend. My friends wouldn't stop coming apart and both of them tarnished almost immediately."
1.0,My undershirts are better quality than this.
1.0,"The fabric was a putrid polyester, not cotton as stated in the listing. They look nothing like the photo either. I didn't even bother trying them on. I could feel as soon as I opened the bag, they were a gross, shower curtain feeling polyester. Ew. Returned"
1.0,This was super cute and I was hoping it would help my step daughter keep track of her first pair of glasses she just got. I told her when she took them off she could put them in there and keep them in her wrist. The strap broke. Ugh.
1.0,That hat was smashed and completely out of shape.
1.0,No NoNoNo..Good ⌚️.........
1.0,May want to go up two sizes. I ordered a 2xl and it for more like an XL
1.0,"The goggles look really nice. My 3 year old really liked them. However, they are of poor quality. They broke after five uses. You can see from the attached photo. It makes me wonder how &#34;unbiased&#34; are all the reviewers who received this item for free."
1.0,The size does not correspond to the size of the fleece
1.0,This product is really crummy would not pay for if I saw it PERSON AT THE STORE false advertisement never would I ever recommend this to anyone.
1.0,Broke within 10 wears. Cheap and very flimsy. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Horrible Quality.
1.0,"The legs are short, and looks completely different than the picture."
1.0,It was orange and a weird type silky fabric not not thermal shirt fabric as described
1.0,So I never make reviews even for products that are less stellar but decided to make one for this one. The product came unthreatened which I was okay with because it didn’t want to go through the whole process of returning it. As the day went on within the first 2 hours it started to become more unthreatened even tho much wasn’t done with it. I was highly disappointed and knew I wouldn’t be able to get my money back no matter what. So I would highly advise other people to get another product that is less expensive and better quality. I’ll never buy again from this seller.
1.0,"I agree with other customers. The pic is deceiving as the item is really small for an adult...I bought it for me and fits my 3 year old son. I give 1 star because of that...if i had purchased for my son, then I would have been happy with it"
1.0,Do not buy it's very cheap
1.0,It was too big didn’t fit
1.0,"I love the look of this bag- so it makes me sad that it's in the garbage already. Within the first 2 days, the inner lining ripped, no biggie, I sewed it. Then a week later, the clasp for the long strap broke, okay, no biggie, I still have the shoulder strap. Well- 2 weeks later, one of those ripped right off."
1.0,"There must have been some kind of glitch, because when I ordered these boots, the picture and description were totally different., so I thought I was receiving a different style boot.  The desperation and picture now on the listing matches what I received, so that must have been corrected.<br />This review is for the actual boots I got  The boots I received look very cheap. They zip up the side, and the material looks low quality.  I am a size 7.5, so I ordered an 8.  Even with large socks, my feet were still swimming in the shoe, but the calf part of the boot would not even fully zip- it was so small.  So do not order these unless you have little calves for your size.<br />I did return these, and the return was easy."
1.0,The size is so wrong for these!!! The 3x fits like a medium 😳
1.0,They were broken upon receiving them.  They feel flimsy.
1.0,Poor quality material. Size is another one of those sizes that are only made for no hips or shape. Sizes are way way off and small. Not plus size for sure. Waste of money.
1.0,"Cute, but very odd fit. Tight, but long arms, the rest was very large and the sizing is stated very odd so it is hard to figure out what size to purchase.<br />1/8/18 Tried to return, but seller has not responded as of today 2/6/18<br />I would not purchase from this seller."
1.0,Wouldn't buy again only a few are even half suitable
1.0,Arrived with a bunch of stones missing
1.0,Very cheaply made and completely unwearable. Concept is cool but can not recomend this product.
1.0,"Definitely not sweat proof.  Comfortable yes. My son loves them , says his AFO's feel better with these socks. They did get holes in them after the 2nd use. The seams came apart. Expensive socks to have them only used twice and have the seam come apart :("
1.0,The earring were broken when they arrived. Seem to be flemsy.
1.0,"This item was described as a brooch, with one of the beans hanging on the outside. I bought a couple since one of my kids loves brooches and pea pods so I thought it’d be a win. Alas, not the case.<br />POS- don’t waste your money or time.."
1.0,I sent these back as they were poor quality.
1.0,The necklace broke within 2 days of my daughter wearing it.
1.0,I loved color fit well except in boob area I'm a 38 dd and it had no support
1.0,I am Waiting for a response for my refund. It’s been awhile
1.0,Runs extremely small... about 3 sizes small!
1.0,Thin and way undersized.  I ordered an XL and I am a size 12.  It fit skin tight on my arms all the way down to my wrists.  You can't even pull the sleeves up it's so tight. Seams are poorly matched up and sloppily sewn together.  This sweater is so thin it's not meant to keep you warm or cozy.  Poor misrepresentation in photos - a true lie in fact.
1.0,"I tried ordering the G camo version that looks like a black and grey camouflage and I got a woodland style green camo. Returned those and ordered another pair thinking it was just a mix up. Got the second pair and it was the same exact woodland green camouflage, I’m starting to think the pants are misrepresented on Amazon. Very disappointed because that black pattern looks good.<br /><br />I ended trying out the other black camo and in person it appears very bluish and has a dumb zipper randomly placed on the left leg that isn’t even a pocket. I rarely give negative feedback but these are not a good product and are fairly expensive for what you get. You can probably find something similar pants elsewhere for $20 or less."
1.0,Uneven hem! I followed instructions<br />Ordered a size up.This dress is a tent! It will fit .Tried to see if maybe they sent wrong size.Says medium.When it is clearly a 1 x or 2 xx.I really wanted this dress and so disappointed that I receive a defective clearly sized wrong item.
1.0,"Even though it's not expensive, save your money, it tarnished right away."
1.0,Stiff nylon with blurry print. Very cheap looking.
1.0,Too big for any teeth
1.0,"I ordered a two pack and both are mediums, but only one fit. The black pair fit fairly well. I was debating sizing up just because I think they would look slightly better. The pink pair wouldn’t even go over my hips. It wasn’t stretchy like the black pair. It also is clearly a different size. I’ll definitely be returning these."
1.0,Wasn't as nice as I'd hoped. Was gift for 13 yr old...
1.0,"Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. The band is great but the frame is too big. We put his Fitbit in and it kept popping out. Really loved the band, so I’m sad to have to return this."
1.0,Waist of money.  Sizing is not from this country.  Needed a 4x and got a size bigger for comfort.  WRONG.  5X is toddlers size.  Buyer beware
1.0,Made for people with no boobs
1.0,"This thing says a medium and it truly is! If you over a size 8, chances are it won't fit. Totally wasted my money on this product."
1.0,No where in the verbage for this watch does it say this is a WOMANS WATCH.  The description should clearly state that this will not fit a MANS wrist.
1.0,The screw backs were so tiny they're impossible to put on.
1.0,"So... these aren’t too big or too small - they’re just not properly fitting at all for me.  The waste stretches quite a bit - almost an unnecessary amount (especially since the fabric doesn’t give so ... )  The legs in comparison are small.  I’m a size 6, fit... and the waste was big when stretched and even poofy in the front (awkward) but around my thighs they were snug.  Also for the waste - it’s high wasted / not flattering for someone on the shorter side.  Not flattering or comfortable."
1.0,"Came as promised.  Looks OK; not great quality but super cute color combos.  We did not receive a tie, which is a bummer because this was for a ""dress up day"" at school."
1.0,Seams split upon receipt
1.0,"Liked it but the zippers , both, do not work !"
1.0,Don’t buy this dress.
1.0,"The stone was very pretty, but it came in a SIZE 18!! Not even close to fitting. The metal is very cheap, and I am unhappy with it, but it is to worth the hassle to return."
1.0,"Ordered it in the purple color, didn’t even try it on because as soon as I opened the package, a ton of purple glitter fell out of the bag it was in. I sent it back the next day. Was still finding purple glitter on the floor weeks later."
1.0,Will not actually hold a rubber band. Also started to yellow after 2 wears.
1.0,Tarnished very quickly!
1.0,The seam on the strap came ripped. The zipper was broke. Very cheap feeling. Was a waste of my money that’s for sure.
1.0,"It looks dull and ugly. The two green gems look they are double the size of the silver ones, looks unproportional and I ended up giving it away. Good thing it didn't cost a lot."
1.0,Overseas sizing - this runs small and is not loose as described.
1.0,It lays like a fit and flare and the sleeves are a really weird length for the rest of the dress. It hugs your stomach but flares out and is just extra fabric.
1.0,Very bad! Too small... don't buy!!
1.0,First I did not order a sleeveless dress. The flowers on the dress looks and feels like someone just glued them on which is weighing down the dress. The flowers make the dress feel heavy. And no it is not a tight fit. I which people would stop putting up photoshop pictures of clothing. Sending it back.
1.0,Ill fitting top. It just isn’t cut right.
1.0,I have bought quite a few dresses from this brand over the past six years ..<br /><br />This one looks nothing like the picture.. the sleeves don’t stand up .. the bow is droopy.. the fabric is actually heavy/clings to the body for a spring/summer collection.<br /><br />It didn’t look like the picture to the point I thought my dress was actually manufactured wrong at first ☹️
1.0,Looks dainty in the photo. It is not and if you want a refund you basically cannot open the package to look at it. It reads: Two conditions that you can't refund.<br />1. Product is used or damaged.<br />2. The package or tag of product is damaged.<br />It comes in a cellophane bag with this sticker on the back so you have to tear it to be able to take the necklace out and look for damage. The engraving looks cheap.
1.0,Hoops will not fit on my nose and they hurt my ears. Would like a refund.
1.0,"So I bought  this thinking that it was a great price for this necklace, but it's not. You pay for what you get and this is cheap. This necklace looks like something you get at the dollar store. Also, it takes a long time to ship because it's coming from china."
1.0,"Would not hold time, tiny size.  Don't buy into the hype unless you have a child's wrist."
1.0,I received this item and the material is rather cheap as soon as I tried to put it on it  Is rippe I also did a return and I haven't received a refund butBasically I was ripped off save your money to find a cheaper option this was way too expensive just to get disappointed
1.0,pin broke after one use
1.0,Poorly made ...I won't recommend to buy
1.0,I won’t buy these again I have them two chances to get it right and these pants are not like the description and come with stains and holes I’m good i will buy my pants somewhere else
1.0,The 3 is wrong and does not look like the one in the picture!
1.0,Cute dress but it is see through and not a dress that I’ll wear out. It’ll be for around the house only.
1.0,The advertise picture shows complete unicorn body (Head to Tail) with pretty rainbows.<br />The dress I received wasnt anything like the picture.<br />There was no attempted to line up unicorn design with front of dress at all!<br />The front of dress  is nothing but headless unicorns & half chopped rainbows.<br />I was planning to buy additional dresses from this supplier but will pass due to poor quality.
1.0,"ALTHOUGH THIS IS A DARLING LITTLE PETITE BRACELET, YOU NEED A MAGNIFIER TO SEE DIAMONDS.  DOUBT THAT THERE ARE ANY."
1.0,This is not the ring for the 32 degree in masonry.
1.0,They broke in half the second time I went to use them.
1.0,Very uncomfortable!!!...waist of money
1.0,Horrible fit and tight around leg opening & in crotch area.....get better craftmanship in the product.
1.0,"Loved the style of this but I couldn't even close the dress ! This was not even remotely the correct size, guess that's the price of buying online."
1.0,"I attached this to my keys and the charm glass was shattered within the week. To be fair, my family can be tough on keys; but I'm still disappointed that it didn't hold up long enough for me to even fill the window with charms!"
1.0,Broke on first wear
1.0,Made in and shipped from China.
1.0,Dont buy this I got key chain I was happy a week or 2 later broke in my packet I'm not recommending to buy this.
1.0,Far better appearance than quality.
1.0,"After waiting for 4 of these shirts, they finally came after 2 months of waiting.  I washed them and dried them and they have permanent wrinkles in the.  I washed them again hoping the wrinkles would come out, but they did not.  I wouldn't advise anyone to purchase these tops.  I doubt I would ever get a refund since it took 2 months to receive these."
1.0,My husband laughed when he saw me trying this dress. Definitely not like the pictures.
1.0,It is not what it says...... I did return it as soon as I got it.
1.0,Looks cheap. The golden color looks better
1.0,Fabric was soft but almost see through. Sizing was off I think due to being a China made product. All writing on it was in Chinese
1.0,You get what you pay for. Cheap!
1.0,I used the backpack once. Did not overstuff it or put too much weight on it. I picked it up from the handle as a normal person would in areas where I could not roll it and it started to come apart at the seams.
1.0,"I don't think the item description is very clear.  In fact, all the product details are poorly written...what little there are.  We returned these watches because it wasn't made abundantly clear that the watches require two hands to read the time!  Huge disappointment.<br />I told my wife, &#34;These are the kinds of things you shouldn't order on Amazon&#34;.  With poor descriptions and no reviews you have little idea of what you'll be getting."
1.0,"I purchased one size larger than I normally wear. and while putting them on one sock tore when halfway on so I tried another same result.  Returned them would not waste my money on them again,"
1.0,"I should have expected these wouldn't be a great quality, but after wearing each of them once or twice they started falling apart. Don't waste your money!"
1.0,The shirt is too big for me  and is a small size.☹☹
1.0,Hues were very rust brown with some red and it wasn’t cotton.
1.0,This picture makes this kitty look very pretty.  However upon receipt the cat looked as if it had been through some things.  For the price however upon I won't complain.
1.0,No fue lo que pedí
1.0,Too big not that faltering for my shape
1.0,MADE FOR A CHILD I GAVE THEM TO MY 6 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO IS SMALL AND WEIGHS NORMAL FOR HER AGE AND IT STILL GOT STUCK ON HER MIDDLE FINGER I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE HOW SMALL THEY ARE...
1.0,"The shoes were cute but they were just odd. The shoe looked enormous in comparison to my 2 year old daughter’s feet, almost Frankenstein like, but when I put them on my daughter they were tight. To size up would look absolutely ridiculous"
1.0,Gave me an ear infection and turned my ear orange.
1.0,"The breast portion of this costume is well above the armpits, which can be seen in the photo. If it would have been made with the breast portion in the correct place, this would have been fabulous. Excellently made otherwise, and great heavy fabric. Really disappointed"
1.0,Cheap looking and slips off of my hair..I love glittery things and black so I thought this would be great but nope..Skip it if you can lol
1.0,"Super cute but way short. I'm 5'10"" and this was way to short. I order a large and it was still way to short. Like inches short."
1.0,Garbage material. I wouldn’t pay 99 cents for this on wish.
1.0,"The underwire broke through the fabric almost immediately.  I didn't even get to wear it...if we are not counting trying it on.  It fit loosely so less ""true to size""."
1.0,Size 13 but the calf barrel is so small I doubt  a size 8 could gey their foot in.
1.0,"This necklace turned my neck green, and the plating rubbed off of the star after wearing for a day.  I thought it was sterling silver, but seems like it was actually just plated.  Not happy with it."
1.0,"Runs extremely small. I ordered a size up and it was still too small. The material is cheap and see-through. Once on, the patterns looks distorted and the color fades out because of the poor quality fabric. I forgot to send it back so i just threw it away. Never again."
1.0,Very disappointed. Very cheaply made
1.0,Material was inferior.
1.0,"Very cheap quality, too thin, and see through. Was very disappointed."
1.0,The nike sign peeled off after first time using
1.0,Was late getting here and when it arrived one was broken.
1.0,Cute but Way too small
1.0,The pin end is on the outside part which will cause the band to release with a simple tap.
1.0,Can with a stitching issue and without a strap.  Missed the return window due to unexpected business travel.  Would not buy again.
1.0,"If your a bigger person, this is not for you. Fits really tight around the chest. Hard to take off."
1.0,I ware for a week broken already
1.0,"WOULD NOT RECCOMMEND ... after return window closes, the necklace begins to tarnish"
1.0,No ear loop
1.0,"The belt worked well but only lasted one week. The rubber split where the button clipped in and now it is way too tight to comfortably wear. I am not a big guy at 6' with 37&#34; waist the belt was not under strain. I needed it to keep my uniform looking fresh while at the academy, looks like I need another method."
1.0,I liked the colour!
1.0,"Pure junk cheaply made, defective on arrival and not worth more than a buck.  Painted  heavy base metal with stones missing. How would they stay on your ears assuming you would put something that ugly on your body! What a waste of money.  The box was nicer than the  earrings!  I have never received such awful quality stuff from Amazon."
1.0,Mnnj
1.0,"T shirt quality was not good, not worth the price"
1.0,"The item is really nice, but once it comes defective, beware of the return, you have to return by yourself to China!"
1.0,"Cheap, cheap, cheap"
1.0,What I was sent was nothing like the picture. There was no clasp just push pin and no paint on it. Add the long shipping time. Save your $ and your time.
1.0,Fabric is like a shower curtain.  Also large is like an 1x
1.0,Not ideal for short people. I'm 5'3
1.0,Not made well AT ALL. Material is thin and just not that flattering.
1.0,In what world does the XL not fit someone who wears a size 10? Are these kids pjs?
1.0,"Something fell out when I received the package.  I found a very tiny plastic, I think it was the backing.<br />I tried to to put the backing, it kept falling out.  I could not put it on.  Such a waste of money.<br /><br />I want to return this item and get a refund!!!!!<br /><br />How can i do this?<br /><br />roserrf1@cox.net"
1.0,"I wrote a review just receiving it  and I said everything was ok but NO!<br />After wearing it ONCE the dress looks as if it I have been wearing it all year round : the bottom part has a hole, and it has several threads running out.<br />If I want to use it again I should pay to a repair shop or sew it by myself"
1.0,"So I am 5’10 and not really skinny, but I even went up an extra size (which I hardly ever have to do) and it was still way too short for me. I should have gone with my gut that it would’ve been too short based on the other’s reviews but I really just wanted to try it out."
1.0,These boots r way too small. More like infant sized not toddler. They r also way too narrow. I really cannot see any toddler fitting in these shoes. As all toddlers that I’ve come across have wide some chubby feet. I bought a size 5 for my great granddaughter which ALL her shoes r size 5 and fit fine. Very disappointed.
1.0,Does not fit there not cut the same as original.
1.0,The elastic string these beautiful lava rocks are strung on is garbage. I will have to have this re string on 100# fishing string.
1.0,"I bought this product in May 2014 and it showed up with problems. First it didn't have the key. I ignored it though because I didn't think it was necessary. It also had a defect near the glass top. The instructions were for another product, which was not helpful. The case though looked nice and the winders worked, until a month ago when those stopped working. I bought the case for the winders so it is pretty much useless at this point. I would look at another company before buying from Kendal."
1.0,I can't explain this fabric. Simply put it's awful almost plastic like? Mixed with stiff satin? However it reminded me of scrubs!  It would also hold in all your body heat. I thought it was a cool oversized sweatshirt.
1.0,"You get what you pay for with this bag.  I've had it for less than two months and the inner zipper not only broke, it was annihilated somehow through no fault of my own.  Of course, I noticed this on 5/9/18 and there was only a 30-day return window which ended 4/22/18.  It is very cheaply made with cheap materials.  The inner liner with the brand name all over it is incredibly cheap.  The zippers are fragile.  The bag itself has little flaws all over the outside material.  I bought this knowing it wouldn't be super high quality and I was correct. Do not waste $20 on this bag.  You will be sorry."
1.0,i review this product when i got it and it hasn`t changed not a good fit
1.0,Not very good Quality
1.0,The worst over fit glasses that I have ever bought. If not for being in hospital I would have returned them.
1.0,Wasn’t multiple colors as shown in picture
1.0,Fits horrible
1.0,"this Shoe Took Forever To Come, Too Small . Was Not What They Looked Like Online, I Want My Money Back."
1.0,The large was way too small. Could get me leg in.
1.0,Ordered XL and had to return for the XXL. Only jacket I own that is not an XL. Pocket and Zipper ripped within first week. Poor quality!!
1.0,Really Thin
1.0,It broke today AT WORK<br /><br />Extremely inconvenient
1.0,the little pieces that sit on your nose broke off w/in minutes of my wearing them & scratched my nose. Bought 3 pairs - they're cheaply made & not even worth their cheap price.
1.0,"I've had several swim dresses from several Sellers and while the style and cut of this one is very nice, the straps are sewn so poorly that the first time I wore it they're already coming off on the back."
1.0,I got an XXL and it barely would go over my shoulders. This was a very disappointing purchase.
1.0,Cute small for a child and very flimsy. They fell apart after a few hours of wearing them.
1.0,"Cute, but small child size.  Way too small for any adult.  Had to return it."
1.0,"This product tarnished within a few days of getting it, but I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,The black one is very scratchy and uncomfortable. Lots of loose threads that might be prone to fraying. It's a shame because the style is very cute.
1.0,These have to been a joke. I included the photo to give perspective as to the size of these earrings and the stones. For SYNTHETIC stones $100 should buy you a hell of a lot more. They are being returned immediately!
1.0,These things are horribly thin and smell off
1.0,They came like the size of doll shorts
1.0,not working item is defective
1.0,I got the small and it was way too big and stretched out. The material was horrid and loose with no elasticity in either the collar or sleeves. Horrible purchase.
1.0,They don't stick
1.0,This top is not plus size at all I think its for little girls not women I bought one and had to give it to my 11yr old
1.0,Mine broke the very first time I put it on. What a waste.
1.0,Poor quality and the red in the shirt doesn’t even come close to matching the red pants
1.0,This hat looks like recycled trash.  It is poor quality and does not resemble a witches hat.  It looks like it is trash.

1.0,Mala calidad tamaño incorrecto
1.0,Fell apart almost instantly.

1.0,It broke in the first few weeks of wearing it
1.0,So bummed. First shirt was nicer quality. Ordered a second one and it had a hole in it.
1.0,Do not buy this if you have long nails or wear press ons.  You cannot get it open with nails.
1.0,Laughable quality. Too bulky to use.
1.0,"Bad quality nothing like pictures they show<br />very , very cheap look"
1.0,First 2’ wave and the hat flew off. Lol. Doesn’t hold AT ALL. Ended up throwing it away - returning was too much of a hassle.
1.0,I like the look of the glasses. They did come with  a tiny scratch on the lens. I wore them three times untill the screw fell out of the lens.
1.0,Band was bent and will not fit Fitbit Versa.  Looks nice but doesn’t work!
1.0,Zero stars for this product.  Horrible!!!!  Save your money.
1.0,"The band was super cute and nice at first, however after barely a month of use (didn’t even wear everyday), the paint already started coming off. Paint chipped at the magnet and the rose gold band is slowly becoming silver."
1.0,"Very small, thin, & doesn't look like the picture. I wouldn't recommend."
1.0,Material was junk - heavy like a sweatshirt but the feel was terrible
1.0,"These boots are made of very thin, cheap material and they run small. I regret buying them."
1.0,La talla llego muy grade 😏
1.0,I am not sure what I got but it's not what is pictured. The front is cut so high and the butt is so long. The sleeves are so small and too short. It's awful material and feels so scratchy. Terrible shirt. Returning 3 of them since they are all awful.
1.0,I did not like the quality of this cardigan instead of it being the same look on the inside as the outside it’s a one sided fabric. Gives it a “cheep” look.
1.0,It’s flimsy and cheap. Definitely not worth the money. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift and I was too embarrassed to even give it.
1.0,One of these earring were broken
1.0,This item runs very small and sleeves also run short. Not what I expected. Will be returning.
1.0,This item is very small.  I gave it to my 5 year old and she will be able to wear it next year
1.0,Shouldnt get these if ya teeth are messed up like mine you get what you pay for though
1.0,Bad quality!! not recommended.
1.0,I ordered a large and I typically wear a medium and this skirt was still small and short. Would not reccomend. It actually fits my 9 year old daughter better than it fits me.
1.0,Did not even ware
1.0,Super cute but can see through the dress
1.0,Wore this less than a week and the birthstone charm AND the large round charm that stated &#34;June&#34; BOTH fell off. A total waste of money!!! Buy Alex and Ani their charms stay on. Very disappointed.  Do not buy.
1.0,"They are super adorable, but they rolled down my thighs when I was walking. Talk about pointless. My thighs measure 30 inches and I couldn't wear them."
1.0,To a mall a dont fit as mid-rings look more like the y were made for toddler hands
1.0,These were definitely not a size 10. I wear a size seven and they barely fit my finger. No way my husband was getting them on his.
1.0,This is 100% paper and folded.
1.0,DOES NOT FIT
1.0,I got an xl and it was too small especially over my chest area. Im a 36D The dress is also absolutely see through! Beautiful color though. If I lose 30 pounds I may wear it as sexy lingerie.
1.0,Horrible. Seams were ripping apart on my first try right out of the bag. My hands are pretty average and the fit was horrible. I know they're cheap but come on! Don't waste your time and money.
1.0,Total junk
1.0,Great item BUT lost one the first time I had it in. I thought they’d be more secure since  they’re threaders but that’s not the case 😩
1.0,No silve . Me estafaron se le fue el color
1.0,The seam on the back broke open after the first wear and gave my 3 year old blisters.
1.0,This was sooo cute but the colors bled into the yellow.
1.0,I took this bag on a cruise.  It ripped at the seam when I used it as a checked luggage bag.  It is very thin and cheap material.
1.0,"Was great at first, but got just slightly wet, and face of watch messed up.  Now it has quit working, and not sure what the problem is."
1.0,"Small. Bogus. Tried on once and needed to return. Stuck in ""returns battle"". Do not believe their return policy. Also, this shop has changed names since I bought it. FYI"
1.0,Returned these... made for extremely small wrists... and my wrists are small! Not enough give in the adjustability. Potentially for teens or younger.
1.0,was damaged
1.0,i liked it but the size is too big.<br />My baby has almost 7 months and i purchased size 6-9 and it fits a like a 1 year old baby.
1.0,Wore for not even a full two days and the toes are pealing
1.0,nothing there worst commenting...
1.0,Stop charging
1.0,"Según la descripción del articulo vienen dos llaveros pero en realidad solo mandan uno, no deberían de mentirle al cliente"
1.0,Don't buy this. The necklace is not dainty and cute as it appears. It's much bigger and looks like junk. Definitely got what I paid for here.
1.0,"If one is looking for a blue tent, you’ll be pleased. I do not care for tight clothing and love loose linen dresses in summer. This one, however, takes it to the extreme. I cannot imagine it would be flattering on anyone."
1.0,"Worse product I ever purchased . After using mermaid costume twice , it faded and has extensive wear on the tail section of the costume . Granddaughter extremely disappointed . Seller would not even respond to my email . Don't buy anything from this seller"
1.0,They were pretty but they were hard to wear. The back were hard to remove and take off.  Plus they were painful to wear.
1.0,"It lost a star cause the company hide my review.<br />It's really pretty, looks like just the picture.<br />Expect the horns falling off, ima have to glue that. And its missing a gem...of which I don't own extras.<br />Soooo....all in all it's cheap so it's not that big a deal, but I am spending money on a product and i shouldn't have to fix it or receive it broken."
1.0,loved it but the bra size was way to small
1.0,The legs and skirt ride up as you move. Terrible product!
1.0,Clearly the jeans look nothing like what I ordered ! They are huge- not true to size at all. They also look like they have a completely different fade than the ones pictured. Not flattering at all !
1.0,This is way too over-priced!
1.0,i wouldn't choose this product simply because the the gross pic advertising it
1.0,The black elastic straps aren’t long enough to tie!! Like what the heck are they for?
1.0,This watch was the goofy new larger size. I wanted the real deal from the 80s. Highly disappointed.
1.0,Wore for 4 days and the color of the large stone doesn't look aqua colored at all. Faded very quickly.
1.0,"To whom it may concern;<br />Thanks a lot for allowing me to purchase a trendy upgraded air purifier but I'm sorry, this air device is the second one I purchase. It's turning up broken within less than a month of outside usage? I was wondering if I could get another one replacement? I not too long ago purchased it? the cord plug isn't accepting the face mask and I can't use it for recharge?!"
1.0,"Watch stopped working after 6 weeks.  Even if ""just"" a dead battery, completely unacceptable.<br />I rue the day Fred Meyer stopped selling Timex watches."
1.0,I was too small...needed a 9&#34; .... it was a 8&#34;dint see it on the site
1.0,The part that goes between your toes is too long.  It makes the flip flop loose.  Esp. When climbing stairs.  Fail.
1.0,I like the dress style but the stitching is off. Part of the dress bulges out strangely. Looks like it wasn't made properly. There's a bubble-like appearance on a part of the dress. Love the color but poorly made.
1.0,The fabric is terrible.
1.0,Pattern was off around the collar. Very disappointing because it is a very cute cut and lovely dress otherwise.
1.0,"Very tight around arms, and very high on the neck. Lace is only in the front portion."
1.0,"Awful material , cheap cotton . The fit is terrible , short , boxy and the medium huge on me and I am a standard medium ."
1.0,These were so cheap I threw them right out would never wear them.
1.0,The thong piece that goes between the toes is not long enough. It was painful when trying to where these. I returned them right away.
1.0,I returned them. They were huge and the torso was so long.  The material was a good quality though
1.0,"Not good products I had to throw them in the garbage, not recommended for anyone to purchase this."
1.0,The quality of this beach dress is poor. very rough material. I want something better for my daughter.
1.0,I would not even give this a one star rating if I could.  Broke first time I put it on.  Very cheaply made.
1.0,"These legging are beautiful and fit as expected but just after one wash had pilling. Did not use grey one yet and its bow unraveled. Really disappointed. I am attaching pictures, the white one is used once for 4 hours only and washed once (see the pilling), the other two are unused. I liked the design and the bow but the quality is awful so i am returning. Not worth the price at all."
1.0,Disappointed because we order the product 5 pcs but it came 4 pcs only.
1.0,I was disappointed with the quality of material the sock is made with. The material is very thin.
1.0,It is the roughest material ever. Its like a burlap sack.
1.0,Was too large on top too tight on bottom. Material was thin and see through. I ordered black
1.0,Swimsuit was super cute but if you have a long torso it won't fit and the cups are too small.
1.0,"Not my style. It would have been nicer if the button on the elbow was a matching color or D-ring. The white button in the middle of my elbow looked terrible. But hey, that's just my opinion."
1.0,This ring is nothing like in the picture. Don’t waste your hard earned money!!!
1.0,"way off from what Buffalo used to be on every level ! returned right away ! is not even a jacket, is more of a cardigan !"
1.0,This hat fits like crap it is huge. Got a replacement and it fits the same. If you have an average size head it will not fit well. Do not buy.
1.0,the stud part of the earring is very cheap.Will not stay in my ear keeps falling off. very sad cuz the earrings are really cute!
1.0,It was too big and not what it even looked like
1.0,Too good to be true. Returned it since the neckline and armhole were uneven.bad quality. Very cheap material too. Don't buy.
1.0,"So cute! But so small. I ordered a large, but it was like a child large."
1.0,I have not received it yet! It shipped weeks ago! Sent inquiry via email and received no response! Send refund!
1.0,I bought these befoew and they fit. I bought the same thing again and they were an entirely different kind of sock. Don’t buy these they don’t stay on.
1.0,Horrible quality. Broke literally the first time we put them on our daughter.
1.0,Didnt meet my expectations. Too narrow to put on feet and slide up legs. Couldnt wear to give review on comfort working out etc
1.0,"I ordered the alien shirt and opened it right now just to be hit in the face with armpit body odor. It only stinks in the armpit area, nowhere else on the shirt. My cat is even tripping over it. Disgusting."
1.0,The top was too small
1.0,The item received was not exactly as the one in the picture.  It didn't have ruffles at the bottom.  Fabric was ok.
1.0,I ordered a small both times and received a medium. So annoying.
1.0,"These are not good. I love wood earrings. I wear them almost exclusively.  The stick that comes with these are so brittle and cheap they splintered and snapped immediately toothpicks are better quality. The earring itself is very thick, albeit light weight but where wood earrings normally have designs carved in both sides these only have it on one. It’s ridiculous. Save your money keep shopping these are unbelievably poor quality."
1.0,My shirt came completely discolored around the logo. Very disappointed as I wanted to wear it for a party & now I can’t. Not to mention. The return policy is not allowing me to print out a return label so<br />I will have to pay to sen it back. It’s a shame because the quality of the t shirt is nice.
1.0,"Cute, but broke after only a few wears right behind the turtle's shell - I felt it fly off my foot in a restaurant, and spent time on my hands and knees looking for it. I was disappointed when I found it, and realized it came off my toe because it had broken. The metal in front of and behind the turtle is just too thin to deal with the slight bending and unbending required to put it on and take it off."
1.0,"Mine were slightly upgraded from being just a tube of fabric, but still very cheaply made, don’t fit well, not knee high, and definitely wouldn’t consider them compression socks"
1.0,Did not look 😳  like the pictures cheap looking
1.0,This band is cute but hard to make it fit and it's way too stiff.
1.0,This is NOT a sweatshirt...more of a foam feel. Usually a large and I ordered an XXL - there’s zero chance it’s anything over a medium. Cheap material. Another junk order from overseas.
1.0,Purchased for my wife. First washing and it shed horribly in the washer and dryer. It shrank at least 2 sizes and is now unwearable. Never again.
1.0,these look and feel very much like shoes i’ve purchased from big chsin stores—only they were twice as expensive.<br /><br />they make my feet sweat & my toes are crunched up to the front of the shoe bc there is no arch support.<br /><br />going round and round in circles to try to return them. frustrating
1.0,I had this belt for 2 weeks and it it ripped at the Knox that I was using. Would not recommend for everyday use.
1.0,It’s cheap material not worth it
1.0,"It's not how it looks, it's huge and looks like a potatoes bag, with no form. Bought a &#34;s&#34; size and fits like L."
1.0,SUNGLASSES WERE NOT THE MIRROR TYPE AS THEY ADVERTISE.
1.0,Not as said.
1.0,Was not expecting it to be soft given all other ones have been plastic.  Not worth $25 for the material it's made of
1.0,This bra does a terrible job lifting your breasts. The adhesive is also very bad quality stopped sticking after the second time I wore it.
1.0,"Did not like the color,fabric etc. Returning"
1.0,As expected but too short too thin and cheap. Worst maxi ever and I buy this style in every brand
1.0,The most uncomfortable pair of knitted fingerless gloves I have every purchased.  My forearms were rubbed raw by the seams and material of these gloves on the first day I wore them. Material was not soft at all. I do not recommend these gloves if you have sensitive skin.
1.0,"Only had it a couple of months and it's falling apart. The zipper to the main compartment has broken and so I cannot close it, and the lining inside is unraveling. I have not over-filled it, as I like to travel light, and I haven't abused it, or used it to fend off an attack by lions, so there is no reason why it shouldn't be able to hold up to normal use. I would expect to hold up for at LEAST a year, but it couldn't even last 3 months. Very disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,An earring arrived broken and neither of them came with backings. Majorly disappointed.
1.0,"I am a 267 pound bodybuilder. The cut of the XXL is laughable. The arms are so incredibly wide, the sleeves are 4-5"" too short and the chest/abdomen area is so incredibly large. I cannot imagine a body type that this would fit on. If you weigh 325+lbs, are short in stature with very, very short arms, this is for you."
1.0,Is not like the one on the picture
1.0,Laughably small.
1.0,"My husband bought me a pair of these a couple of years ago and they're straight-up from China. Not only did the shipping take forever, but there were no returns without paying an insane amount in shipping, impossible customer service, and the worst cheap quality. The size large wouldn't fit our seven year old daughter. And cashmere, pshh! The furthest thing from it! The seams were already ripping right out of the package. BUYER BEWARE!"
1.0,Not at all like the pic. Not cute at all
1.0,I'm going to complain twice. One for each ring I purchased. The photo is deceptive. I literally couldn't find one ring when I opened the package. Both rings arrived in the same envelope. This ring is so small it's nearly invisible. I hate complaining but here I am rambling about the insignificance of my new purchase. I feel gypped.<br />I bought these rings to treat myself during the Holidays. I'm newly 56 and just found out my husband of 32 years has charged 10's of thousands of dollars on charge cards at a really skeezy strip joint..I feel awful
1.0,"I was so excited about these based off of what I had seen. When I tried them on, the waist/crotch area was way too big and the length was too short even though I ordered according to the size chart. They are also very see through, which is very disappointing. They looked so promising and I was so disappointed by them and will be returning them."
1.0,The dress quality was horrible had a very strong chemical smell and the material was that of Halloween custom also torn in seams. You may want to avoid this one.
1.0,Crop top
1.0,There too heavy.
1.0,Sizing is extremely off
1.0,Easily broken. Some straps came already broken. Very disappointing.
1.0,"This is an inexpensive top and so, I wasn't expecting high quality. I did, however, expect it to be intact on arrival and that it could survive a handful of washes.<br /><br />This top ran quite small. Worse is that, it is very poorly made with substantial openings (bad seams) on both sleeves at the shoulders. I can only imagine it will disintegrate when washed."
1.0,"I like the material, the shorts are super soft and streachy. The big issue is the size, it's way to small. When I open the package and saw the top, I tought they sent me the wrong size, but when I looked closer it was the size I ordered. The top looks like it could fit a 5 year old. The bottoms I could work with, but I didn't want to keep them just for the bottom. So think twice before burying, theirs sizes run super small."
1.0,"Very thin material. The elastic band under the breasts wasn’t tight and left a horrible fit to the dress. Wasn’t floor length, I’m 5’8 and it barely came to my ankles. Not super impressed"
1.0,Broke in one day.
1.0,The star charm was not attached on the middle. Blue flower & gem’s finish is bad.
1.0,Products lens were crooked
1.0,It seemed like I had to wait so long for this but I think it was just my anticipation. The picture does not give a clear enough image of the true appearance. Worse was the fit. The material is thick and feels like a blanket more than a sweat shirt. There is a hood on the back too which I hadn't realized either. The wrap around effect you see at the bottom starts up on the shoulder and is like a flap and crisscrossed to the base which makes it feel strange. you can't even hold the shirt out in front to get a good look because of the odd design. It did not come down to my hips as in the photo but ended at my belly button. It ran smaller than normal fitting and is a reason I do not like to buy on line! I would rather try it on before I buy it from a  store and know what I am getting. Never again
1.0,"This is a costume,  not a formal gown<br />Don't waste your money"
1.0,Didn’t fit my AA medallion.
1.0,Today is Dec 15th.  These were delivered 9 December.  We bought these for our two year old son as long Johns to wear under his pants on cold New York days.  Today is the second time he wore these and his left thigh ruptured through on the inside threads. The threads are that weak.  Just junk.  Very disappointing as we are getting a huge snow storm tomorrow.
1.0,The size was completely inaccurate. I recieved a children's small but was supposed to be a size 2x.
1.0,will not use again
1.0,I ordered 3 of these and 2 of them broke while removing them from the package.  The metal piece does not hold up...especially not for children.  We did return the product and they are processing the refund.
1.0,Started pilling after first time of wearing.
1.0,It came broken!!! Trash. Pure trash. It doesn't have a lock and won't stay open.
1.0,"this is terrible and super expensive for somehing so small, waste of $60"
1.0,Couldn’t use
1.0,The product is not worth $20.  They are very cheaply made and the lenses pop out immediately.  The look is nice but even the weight of them tells you they are not quality.
1.0,Las letras  y el material no es tan bueno
1.0,Was not accurate to photo whatsoever- was  a tee shirt dress not a skater dress
1.0,Don’t waste your buck
1.0,The breat part would not fit. When I up the size it was to big around my waist but still to small for my breast
1.0,Most uncomfortable boots ever!! No arch support the bottoms are totally flat
1.0,I ordered the white and it was completely see through. Material is very cheap.<br /><br />Returning.
1.0,"This is a product of China, even though it says they are stocked in USA.  Also, there is no nose clip to these, which is essential.  They are pretty though."
1.0,Not very comfortable or breathable. Felt like I was wearing a bathing suit...
1.0,"Terrible quality. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Soul Eater obsessed husband and when it arrived I had a sinking feeling because the package was too small for a hoodie.<br /><br />This hoodie is super thin material, so thin it’s see through. Additionally, I was sent a 3XL instead of an XL and now own a super crappy Death the Kid tent that no one will wear.<br /><br />Move along, this isn’t an actual hoodie."
1.0,Not as seen in picture
1.0,Eww. definitely not what I expected.material is super then these are see through.and the seam where ur butt goes was not sewn but glued gross.only positive thing is they arrived sooner than expected.other than that these are gross and I was excited
1.0,Why would you use White elastic on the lace/bodice area.  It’s  ‘see thru’ & looks unsightly with that White elastic showing through a Red ‘lace’ bodice.
1.0,"The earrings were painfully large to pass through my ears. The gold ones look as if they were spray painted, complete with bubbles on them."
1.0,Both stones cracked down middle. Sending back
1.0,I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear and the arms were still to tight to even put on.
1.0,"The seller or Amazon didn't say anything about the shirt running two sizes too small. If I wear this shirt, it can only be worn opened with a t underneath. That's not the look that I wanted. I decide the look that I want. Not Amazon. 8"
1.0,Not recommended because it is to small. I followed the sizing chart for someone my height 5'10&#34; and weight 180 lbs (and I'm lean and fit) but this was so small that I had to give it to my 10 year old daughter because it fit her better than me.
1.0,Bracelet was broken when I opened the sealed package. I had to send it back and request a new one.😕
1.0,"This dress is very small compared to the size. I ordered a xl & I usually wear a med or large. It still didn't fit. The stitching down the sides are both crooked, the left side curves towards the front while the right side curves towards the back, making the dress uneven. Poor work. Nice fabric though."
1.0,"Too small. I have bought size 2 XL, but in reality, it is American size L."
1.0,"They didn’t fit well on my plastic frames, grabbed at my hair and made my ears stick out."
1.0,They are beautiful but I ordered a pair of 4g... And was sent a pair of 2g. They won't fit and I have no want for bigger guaged ears.
1.0,This was sold as a new item but the item<br />was missing the shoulder strap and it was dirty and had pet hair when I received it.
1.0,Horrible...the material was not what is pictured...i will be returning this
1.0,"So i usually wear M, but neither M or L worked for me. M was too tight in a waist, L was loose.<br />Returned but return shipping for 2 jeans was the same price as the jeans."
1.0,Yo small quality is bad
1.0,Super pretty but one broke when I took it out of the package..
1.0,If i could give 0 stars i would. Its made if a thick fleece and looks super cheap. Its not at all what i thought it would be. I was very disappointed and returning
1.0,Regardless of the hand size the fingertip length doesn’t change. I had to go by completely different set of gloves.
1.0,I ordered medium size with fit me just right. after a gentle wash it became large and after one more wash it became extra large. It lost all its fitting and shine in just two wash and knitting looks totally destorted.
1.0,Looks nothing like the pic..
1.0,If I could give this less than one star I would. Everything on the item says it's a set of 4. I received the item today and it was 1.
1.0,The dress has a WHITE lining... so through the busy the lining shows through!  Why didn’t they line it in BLACK like the background color of the dress????? 😡
1.0,they fell apart after one day
1.0,"Incredible poor quality, a cloth wrapped in your body would look much better than this “dress”<br />the part of the skirt in the photo looks big and loose with a very nice style in reality it looks almost like a skirt stuck and the fabric is the cheapest fabric I've seen in my life, do not waste your money.<br />We already returned it."
1.0,ITS NOTHING LIKE IT WAS DESBRIBE IT LOOKS HORRIBLE I TOOK IT OUT OF PACKAGE AND AT FIRST GLANZE U CAN SEE GLUE ALL OVER AND IS FULLER IN SOME PARTS STLL DECIDED TO TRY ON AND DIDNT HVE IT ON FOR MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS ENDED UP IN MY KIDS TOY BOX
1.0,Can see through it. Not helpful.
1.0,Clasp broke when I put it on for the first time. Not worth the money. No return information to get  exchange/refund. Very disgusted.
1.0,"Wrong shoe for me made knees ache worse than ever, have arthritis in my knees and found out after buying these I need flat shoes. $200 on shoes I can't wear."
1.0,Dont like the material.web picture is different..
1.0,Useless and just wasted my time and money
1.0,It's so bad.
1.0,"So disappointed! Ring cheaply made, most of the black paint off."
1.0,The plastic mask is floppy and not durable. Also not detachable.
1.0,"I purchased this dress in anticipation of a wedding and was all but satisfied. The material is rough, the color was off, and the clasp wouldn't stay in place. I reached out to the vendor to request a refund and everything went downhill for there. Initially, they refused to provide a return address and label, until I threatened to escalate. Soon I was given an address to return the dress too, and long behold it was not valid. Thank God for Amazon's intervention here because this has got to be the WORSE experience I have ever had with a vendor.<br /><br />Be careful with this one y'all...."
1.0,"Not really boyfriend style, the seam is super straight. Maybe I was sent the wrong product?"
1.0,"I don't even know where to start. This dress is made for someone who is about 10 ft tall. I'm 5'5 and expected it may be a bit long but it wasn't the maxi portion that was long it was the cut on the torso. You would have to have like 3ft long abdomen to fit properly. AND, the quality is so poor. The shoulder strap clasps to adjust are that clear plastic that if you look at the wrong way breaks. Mine came broken. The material is very thin and cheap too. Not a good experience."
1.0,"Super diappointed that this was not as pictured front was great but back is not open as pictured, it has wierd stretch section in the back above the waist band. Had to return."
1.0,"This bag only last me 3 month, the material star coming apart. Very poor quality. Not even a dollar is worst it"
1.0,"The dress I ordered arrived used, stained & ripped with used tissues in the pocket. Disgusting."
1.0,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He was so excited. BUT, when he tried it on the shirt is really see-through. So much that he will not wear it. Such a disappointment."
1.0,The dress definitely does not look like the picture. It has two horrible and extremely contrasting shades of blue with black in some areas  and looks very cheap.
1.0,"The cuff links and shirt studs are very nice looking and appear sturdy. But looks aside, the studs are too small and keep popping out of the button holes and flying off (literally).  If an open formal dress shirt is what you’re going for, these studs may be for you."
1.0,Everything fits perfect but except around the waist is too tight
1.0,It was ok  came on time .
1.0,Wore this a few times. Fit was good. Washed one time and the hat fell apart!!!!!
1.0,Was not what I expected at all. I thought it would shine like the picture shows very dull not worth the money I paid at all. Very unsatisfied.
1.0,I returned these immediately. I was looking for something warm to use as a base layer under my uniform for work. These shirts are thinner than pantyhose and longer than a dress. It was ridiculous. They literally came down past my kneecaps. Absurd
1.0,One of the earrings came in broken
1.0,I got  an xl but it was still small fit my 10yr old great
1.0,Junk.  Fell apart inside after only one or two wears.
1.0,"I realize this replacement is for expensive sunglasses but as often as they wear out they should give you 4 sets when you get the glasses. Plus, they send the replacements with no directions on what kind of glue (if any) to use attach."
1.0,"The clasps started falling off almost immediately. It's a gorgeous dress but not of the greatest make. Additionally, the stones are a cheap make. The dress is too expensive for materials used. I had to do heavy alterations."
1.0,I bought these as a gift- we charged them up fully but the one sole wouldn’t turn on at all and the other barely got warm. Very disappointing given they weren’t cheap
1.0,"Stinks! Stinks soooo bad. The smell of the fabric was horrible. I washed it twice without wearing it and the clothes in my closet started smelling like it. I sprayed it with febreze and hung it on the front porch for a week. Then brought it in and washed it. Smell was still there just lighter. Adorable dress, cute fit. Smell ruins it."
1.0,"Very disappointed and will want a refund. I received only ONE despite purchasing the 3 pack.  I am so upset, I won't even go into giving a complete review.  Need a refund!!"
1.0,"I'm 5'3 and 115lbs, and ordered a small. It looked like a 3XL on me, but was extremely short and barely covered my butt."
1.0,"These pants are seriously the worst. I have now washed them four times and they continue to shed black fuzzies ALL over my house. At this point I have to throw them out. Perhaps, as the other reviewer suggested, this is just a problem with the black ones, but I'm not sure why that would be. Do not buy!"
1.0,It was much too large and loose fitting that I couldn't move comfortably. There was also this horrible smell coming from it. Needless to say I returned it.
1.0,"Not only is this shirt transparent it's so light, but the sleeves are way too short as well. Immediately requested a return after trying it on."
1.0,"En guess soy talla s, pero este modelo me quedo grande en s...  la tela es como seda"
1.0,Not for those with big breasts.
1.0,Posts are too short in length and too small in diameter.  It is impossible to screw the threaded end on.  Cheap looking also.
1.0,"I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this product. My samulet arrived broken in the package, completely missing an ear. The one ear it did have was not completely attached. I highly recommend against buying this necklace due to incredibly poor design and terrible quality standards."
1.0,They have very little support
1.0,Silver is wearing off and cooper look is showing. Not happy with this bracelet.
1.0,Don't buy these slides.
1.0,Basically a shirt! Can’t even wear as a dress!
1.0,"What hogwash! Listing says 'True to actual size""....My ARSE!!! I ordered a Large which I have fit into for 25+ years now on any type/brand t-shirt, tank top, sleeveless, etc. This thing was skin tight and that was before washing. Oh, and you must treat this as fragile as a Cardigan Sweater....don't let it even sit on top of the dryer during a cycle, much less actually put it in the dryer, even on low!!!!!!! It shrank so much my 13 yr old kid who is a size zero could hardly put it on. Initiated a quick return and ordered a 2XL. We shall see how that goes. More reviews the same on all shirts I recently ordered."
1.0,Cheap. First cover ripped in my wallet within 3 days. 2nd cover ripped in 4 days.
1.0,I’m shook. The leggings turned out so cheap and the fit was way too large (the crotch area was saggy and so was the back area). I’m normally not one to care to write a bad review unless it’s this bad. The fabric reminds me of the type of fabric on cheap jerseys.
1.0,Are these to make doll faces? What could this tiny mask 😷 be for? I’m not sure 🤔 please someone help me figure out what the hell I bought 48 baby face masks for?! Lmao 🤣 what a creepy trick guys
1.0,Its sewn on one side open on tbe other the colors on it is made where it is bleed through.<br />Thumbs down..!!!
1.0,This is pretty much a crop top. The large comes to my belly button and I am 5'5&#34; 145 lbs.
1.0,Seemed to be a little too long
1.0,"These were shorter than my 8 year old daughters ""boy"" cut underwear! Worn with a regular size shrit, she looked pant/short less. They must have used all the fabric for the high waist and left not more than a inch or two to cover the legs. Would not recommend to anyone."
1.0,These slippers are poorly made and uncomfortable.
1.0,Very ill fitting and not like the picture at all
1.0,did not like at all. size was small enough for a child instead of grown woman
1.0,"this is prima facia eveidence of false advertising...  Although never stated the picture shows THREE socks<br />there are only TWO socks<br />IN ADDITION, the socks are not very good.  Overpriced"
1.0,"Echoing Tommy B's and just-me's reviews... Bought because it was cheap. Just needed something I can take on wkenders when I commute between East and West Coasts (have homes in both locations). Like Tommy B said, ""This was an attractive inexpensive purchase, marked down,"" to $44.99. I am a frequent traveler and needed to replace my small over-nighter carry-on and didn't want my Tumi to get scuffed. I exclusively use this for carry on on Frontier and Southwest. I agree w/ the reports that this is great for a 2 night trip, and I've actually used it when travelling for pleasure on a 1 wk trip to Amsterdam - it can be done, if you pack smart! In face, I purchased this with that trip in mind (as well as my frequent weekend jaunts) so I wouldn't have to pay $50 to check a bag internationally.<br /><br />Regarding the inside, it only has two zipped compartments. Too bad there's no suit compression insert. But I guess for the price, it's not to be expected.<br /><br />The zipper and design of the casing is flimsy. The bag is essentially two pieces of plastic w/ a cloth ziper in between. In contrast to higher end bags such as Tumi, there isn't a backing to the cloth zipper part. As a result, the clamshell halves of the bag frequently flex about the cloth zipper. In addition, due to this design, the zipper frequently catches on items inside. You have to take care to pull the zipper away from the inside of the bag as you close it to avoid snags. I ruined a good pair of running shorts because a piece of the shorts got caught in the zipper. Finally managed to get it out but not w/o creating a tear in the fabric.<br /><br />Agree w/ the handle and the wheels being flimsy. They have started to wear out after 6 months. The bag likes to go it’s own direction sometimes when I'm pushing it forward in the airport on a hard floor. The issue is that the handle flexes significantly and the torque caused by the flexng causes the bag to pivot and swing outwards.<br /><br />Tommy B had asked, ""I wonder how many more trips until either the handle or wheels break."" Answer: less than 6 months. On the upside, it seems like there's a Travelpro repair facility near me, so I guess I'll take some time out of my day to get it fixed. But it's not always worth the money to park/Uber over (I live in Manhattan/LA)."
1.0,"Way too small, came from China. It would $30.00 to return it because I tried."
1.0,Terrible quality. It had glue all over it and I returned it
1.0,Broke first time I wore it.
1.0,Specifically bought these because my ears are sensitive to nickel and they state they are hypoallergenic. These caused the same reaction as cheap ones with nickel.
1.0,"I took a shower and applied the bra. Did a few things before leaving home including bending over a few times. The bra adhesive started to come off several times and after the sixth time, I gave up and took them off."
1.0,Material must be extremely cheap as it has a horrible smell of car tires. Very disappointed with quality!
1.0,"Terrible material if your not wearing a swim<br />Diaper, completely see through!"
1.0,It was too small and came apart quickly
1.0,Kids don't like.
1.0,I ordered larger than chart and it still didn't fit properly.
1.0,"It came defective,  minute hand was loose.  Coincidently i purchased another watch through a different company but same brand,  it also was defective. Too bad, it was nice looking though."
1.0,"Magnetic clasp is too weak to keep the bracelet secured. Constantly comes apart and falls off. Very cheaply made. No returns accepted. As one person said, glad it was not too much money or I would have been really angry."
1.0,This is a large at best
1.0,This shirt was at least 2 sizes smaller than it should be. Very disappointed.
1.0,Shirt is cheaply made and low quality
1.0,"The pants in the pictures (Blue 2) are actual jeans, and they're sky blue with the faded look. The ones I received are cheap cotton material and they're very thin. They're nearly see through! The blue looks more like a Heather Blue which don't go with the shoes I've purchased to match. I could of gotten a better quality jean at Wal-Mart for way less with no wait. I paid $22 for these ugly pants. The thighs are too tight while the waist is lose. The front of the pants goes just under my belly button (I wanted high waist). The back of the pants are low rise like any other pant. They're very ill fitting. Not cute at all."
1.0,"I read all the reviews and thought these would be perfect.  The fit is extremely small, I couldn’t even pull them up."
1.0,I know it wasn't expensive but broke within a day.
1.0,"I purchased this to wear under my wedding dress and I was so excited for this bra! sadly, the bra itself didn’t stick to my chest in the way it should have, it just sagged my breasts down more. It didn’t cup around my chest like the picture shows.<br />I ended up having to throw it out. Waste of money"
1.0,This product is terrible!!! Huge waste of money!!!!
1.0,"Horrible quality, horribly constructed, do not buy"
1.0,They are pretty but I wore them one time and the wire/ball part broke off in my ear.
1.0,These are very large. What's worse is that the clip is so large on the back it makes it have way too much depth instead of being low profile like higher quality tie clips. They look ridiculous.
1.0,"This arrived and it did not fit. A return label was requested which I never received, so I still have this useless item."
1.0,"The grey lenses was so scratched it was unusable. I had to throw out. The nose pieces interfere with vision, but I have gotten used to that. They are comfortable and good fit. The case is the best part and I would not purchase again."
1.0,"I normally wear a small, but since it was Asian size, I thought I'd order a M just in case. What came was a L. Way too big and unwearable. I wished the seller would respect the American sizing if they put it on Amazon as most buyers are Americans on the .com site.<br /><br />I will keep it because I read the mailing, they spent $30 HKD or $2.50 on stamps. That is a lot of their cost for this shirt. Not worth the trouble for me to argue with them. I just won't order from Asian sellers again as I really don't know how to assess their sizing.<br /><br />The material is not cotton blend, it is nylon blend. Doesn't feel good. :("
1.0,I gave it as a present and it broke the first time she wore it. I feel like she thinks I gave her a cheap present and in fact...what I paid for it was not really that cheap in price for what it is.
1.0,"An hour after I got this, the turquoise stone on the end fell off and there was barely any glue holding it on. The stone was lost, so I couldn't return it."
1.0,Very small. Waist is very tiny.
1.0,"This cardigan, looks amazing online, but sadly when I received it - it was terrible quality. The lint was all over the place, to the point where i felt like I had a hairball in my mouth. I thought maybe after washing - it would be okay, but NOPE - all my clothes were full of the lint from this sweater. Definitely do not recommend."
1.0,One hand didn't work at all and the other side the stitching came apart.  Very disappointing
1.0,Ugliest dress ever and the belt look terrible with it!! Sent it to Goodwill!
1.0,I bought this outfit just a few day ago. She wore it once and I washed it once in cold water and separately. It is now faded to the max after one freaking wear. Im flabbergasted. This was my first time buying clothes on Amazon. I actually loved these pants on her and wanted to buy more. But never again. Nothing should fade after the first wear. 🙄
1.0,"Liked the shirt material very soft. The print on the shirt was off center and is very visibly so when wearing.  Disappointedly will only be able to wear at home, cannot return as I did not check the shirt out when I received it and missed the return date."
1.0,Picture very discieving.
1.0,way too tight on ankles.
1.0,THEY NOT WATERPROOF
1.0,Unfortunately I don’t have the same body as the model and I looked like a pink marshmallow.
1.0,washed one time and ripped.
1.0,I have NOT EVER had cufflinks that I had yo have help to put on. The extra fold is very new and I don't see the purpose.<br /><br />I Love USMC products. Don't like this item
1.0,"I was so excited to receive this dress in the mail, but when I pulled it out of the bag, it was the size of a T-shirt. The bottom hem barely reached my belt line - and I’m only 5’6”. A friend of mine ordered this exact dress, and it looked great on her - so I’m hoping that what I received was a fluke ? I will be returning this item... I’m very nervous to reorder, but I don’t want to give up hope either 😫😫"
1.0,"Didn't make it through the first wash. Bad design, not worth opening the package. Do not buy."
1.0,"I love these tops. Very comfortable, not to warm. Unfortunately a hole formed the second time I wore it."
1.0,"The band looks nothing like the picture. The entire band was all green leaves and the only flower, was on the notch piece at the very tip that gets tucked in. Oh and not to mention it was 3 weeks late.... 👌🏼"
1.0,"I read the reviews and went down a size as suggested. When I got them, they were oh so cute...until I put them on.  They swallowed my foot. Every time I looked down at my foot, all I could think of is Minnie Mouse and how her feet look with the shoes on. So not cute!"
1.0,Tight through the toes. Worn once then gave them away
1.0,Very weak material used.  Strap broke before a month old.
1.0,Came damaged. Cheap material.
1.0,Horrible Came in brown and crusty I wish I could give this 0 stars
1.0,I really liked this replacement band for my Apple Watch 5 until this morning!  I put my watch on after my shower and the band split in two.  No good!  I have contacted Groove Life customer service through Amazon and am awaiting their reply. I will update this reviewer after I hear from them
1.0,Ordered a 7t and it wont fit ...wont fit my friends 3 year old either. The shirt is cute but the pants are very cheaply made!!!! Very!!!
1.0,"Just got these today and as soon as I took them out of the package and felt how thin they were, I was disappointed.  Then I compared them to a genuine Oakley lens and these flex and twist like they're half the thickness (and they kind of are).  I put them into the Oakley M frame and they fit fine.  Put the nose bridge on and right away can tell the sizing is off.  The bridge fits on there but the lens cutout for it is a bit longer.<br /><br />I'll update this and when I use them for riding within next day or so.  I don't think they will be very impact resistant at all though.  I already ordered a genuine Oakley replacement lens because this is the second generic replacement lens I tried and disappointed with."
1.0,"Seller shipped these shoes in a plastic bag, no shoebox to protect them. They arrived so thoroughly smashed they're beyond repair. If the damage were minor, I'd be fine with reshaping them but these look like someone sat on them regularly for about 5 years. Even the rubber is creased. Returning."
1.0,Purchased an XL and it fits like a SMALL. Not a large. Not even medium. Small. Singing is off. Cute but not worth it. They need to update the sizing.
1.0,the material was cheap and design didn't match on the sides
1.0,"Broke almost immediately. I love everything about this watch aesthetically, but it has never worked right. Moves too slow."
1.0,This top was too small and the fabric was very thin. Would not recommend.
1.0,No fue lo solictado....
1.0,This is not a good product as the magnet slips continuously and watch constantly comes off wrist due to slipping.
1.0,These hats were horribly made. Very cheese. Do not buy.  Try the Red fashionable one. It was what made me decide to write this review.  Horrible craftsmanship. Inferior materials but I came quick!<br />Now with my red one im an going to return this one.  It is horrible.
1.0,"Fabric felt and looked cheap, fit too small for the size."
1.0,Doesn't look anything like the picture.<br />Does not fit well. Cheap material.<br />I sent it back right away.<br />Kohl's has some really cute ones this year
1.0,These fell apart very easily.  The plastic breaks easily on the connector.
1.0,Be careful not to overload these. The zippers dont hold very well. We took one trip with these and the zipper came open on its own just by picking up the luggage by the side handle. We are currently trying to decide if we will send these back because of this.
1.0,Don’t every go for this product - this is not something which as shown - super poor product quality :(
1.0,We actually had to throw them away. They smelled like an old musty basement. We tried everything to get the smell off of them and nothing worked. Very dissappointed.
1.0,"The bin itself is cute, but feels very cheap, and made cheaply. One wash and this bib is toast."
1.0,"Very misleading picture.  The dress is not at all tailored at the waist. It is completely shapeless and is very low at the chest.  The fabric is soft and stretchy.  I am 5'7&#34; 115lb. and ordered a small.  I doubt that getting an XS would make me like this dress better because it is so baggy and shapeless, unlike the tailored form-fitting dress in the picture."
1.0,"So disappointed. I sought out this brand because I had bought them before and loved them. This new batch has zero elastic in the leg area. Pull up your jeans over your underwear and they pull up with the jeans. Pull them down, but there is no elastic to keep them in place which makes these ready for the trash."
1.0,Two buttons fell off the first time I wore it. Very upset.
1.0,"The construction is very poor. The bust seam doesn't fit under the bust - it cuts across the upper chest, it's only about 5 inches from the shoulder seams."
1.0,How sad!!! Really liked these earrings only had them 6 hours my little stone popped off very cheaply made very upsetting
1.0,I ordered a medium in this shirt which I normally get a medium or large. Way too small. Returning.
1.0,It broke when I tried taking my sock off!! Very dissent because I did not have it for a long time
1.0,This sweater has a very thin knit. You could see through the sweater.
1.0,"This is an awful body shaper. It is both too big and too small. It's actually not a shaper. Rather, it's just a body underwear. The underwire was right over my rib cage, the seam in the upper back has no stretch what-so-ever. The very loose garment was tight across my back, under my armpits and across my upper breasts. The crotch hook and eye is literally between the legs rather than further up so it is very uncomfortable to wear unless you  wear a large pad or sew the hook and eye closure forward. I am unable to return because I washed it before wearing and now am in the process of reconstructing it. I would NOT recommend this item to anyone."
1.0,"What complete trash! This necklace is flimsy and dispiriting. It did not hold up for five minutes of wear, having burst open at the gentle bonk of a 42 inch child sitting at her craft table on Christmas morning. I superglued the offending side. Within seconds of the second attempt the unglued side unhinged in the hand off sending the remaining pink gems scattering again. I cannot think of a shoddier item I have ever paid for or encountered; the life cycle of a Kinder egg prize or Happy Meal tchotchke holds geological eras of endurance on the &#34;item&#34; sold by this seller. I could not be more disappointed and were swears allowed or classy they'd be included here too. Do not make the same mistake in trusting this item or this seller. I have no other recourse than this review."
1.0,"They are NOT plum, they are bright purple. Very misleading.  Delivery was fine but. It even sure dealing with return is worth it for the cost."
1.0,"Band is good construction and material, but does not fit.  If the large original band was tight, this will definitely not fit you."
1.0,"Had to return it, because the stone was to big for my cartilage"
1.0,It's the same dress but the front chest doesn't have at all the same design and the top layer skirt is a good 10 inches longer than the inside slip skirt.<br />Horrible. Not worth buying.
1.0,If there is - grade I would give it a -1. This is a 5 cents toy for swap-meet. It is absolutely a piece of junk.
1.0,This top looks nothing like the picture and I purchased a 2x and it's extremely tight. I thought this was a loose fit top. It was more like a large. It also had a rhinestone on it which I could tell it was by accident. Will not purchase anything from this seller again. I personally would like my money back
1.0,No instructions on how to put these on so we couldn't use them.<br />I wasted my money
1.0,Prettier in picture! Looked cheap!
1.0,"I thought these would fit me based off reviews ordering a size down. I'm a 38c cup and the bras felt very tight like wearing a corset. They also looked small in appearance, at least they fit my mom. Wasn't a total waste, have to research again, a bit disappointed."
1.0,It's so small and hard to image any toddler wearing these.
1.0,"The hoodie itself was very cheap fabric, felt more like nylon than cotton... and the picture on it felt like it was a sticker ironed on. It was not printed on the hoodie. Would not recommend."
1.0,Band too small and not replaceable
1.0,Cute at first but stretched out way too fast and did not go back to shape.  Looks like a big sack.
1.0,"Extremely disappointed, as the dress picture and description is misleading. This dress is for a very petite person. I am 5'7&#34;, and the dress waist was at least 20 cm above where it had to be, and the length barely reached my knee. The sleeves do not reach the elbow, as in the picture, but are in fact SHORT sleeves. Having purchased this dress for an Orthodox wedding (longer skirt, at least 3/4 sleeves, small neck opening), I will return it as soon as I can get to the post office!<br />Lessons learned: 1) no ordering dresses on Amazon.com; 2) give myself plenty of time and money to spend on a dress purchase.<br />Thankfully, I have a couple of month to find a REAL dress.<br />I don't write Amazon reviews often, but just want to warn everyone who considers this dress."
1.0,"The ring that i got its not the ring that it shows in the picture ...it is a very cheach ring that I wouldn’t pay a 1$ for it ...very desapointed ,besides the ring it shows in pictures to purchase says, vincaro and has the #925 on the inside of the ring and this does not ...false advertising"
1.0,"these suck , soooo thin , thinner then a piece of paper , and no push putton drawtring .<br />know wonder there the cheapest on here"
1.0,Looks nothing like the pictures. Color is not as colorful in picture. Smaller than shown in picture. Quality not too good
1.0,The skirt is a great length but it runs really small and you can see through it even with nude color underneath.
1.0,"I didn't hate the dress, I just received the wrong color"
1.0,"Wrong size, wrong brand, two times in a row. Don't waste your time or money."
1.0,Too small dont fit
1.0,Received broken trash. Zero stars
1.0,"I thought this would be a soft, light weight night shirt, but the fabric feels like polyester and does not breathe."
1.0,Horrible!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,"Horrible! These are child size, not for adults...at all! Customer service is awful, totally ignored me. These are not 55% wool socks, they lie about all aspects of their product. Unfortunate!"
1.0,Both of the ear pieces came off the first time I used them!
1.0,"All items in my laundry dried in the dryer on medium heat, except for these socks. I had two pairs, and all four of them were wet. Three days later they're sitting out to dry and are still damp.<br /><br />Since I was planning on making these otherwise soft, comfortable socks my travel socks, I'll have to find an alternative. I can't afford to walk around without socks for three to five days each time I wash them."
1.0,"The fit is really awkward. It doesn’t really fit on curves, it’s loose and has no shape."
1.0,Top snap ripped out when i tried to unsnap after trying it on.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture and the zipper was broken when it arrived and the sequence where all falling off.
1.0,Wasn’t what we ordered didn’t fit at all
1.0,Just got a set that had a messed up tint job now I'm stuck with them Thanks Revant!!
1.0,Earrings came broken
1.0,"Ladies with smaller sized chest would be fine with this product- Ladies with larger (D+), don't bother! The ears don't stick enough to keep the girls lifted and give you a weird shape when they do stick for a couple minutes."
1.0,"Complete trash. Legs on front don't fit securely. I wouldn't be surprised if they fall off 1st time in the air. Back leg attachments are trash as well. Do yourself a favor and get something from another company. I cannot stress this enough, they are of the cheapest quality and should not exist.<br />UPDATE: As i thought, the front fell off immediately. Like, 3 seconds after take off, 5 ft in the air immediately. Please do not buy. They should be ashamed of themselves for selling this."
1.0,The material isn’t as strong in person and finishes appear undone.
1.0,These slippers only lasted 10 months and my son hardly wore them.
1.0,I ordered this for my husband. It worked great for about 6 months then today the rocket part broke off. Now it is of no use.  Really disappointed because the rocket is held on by prongs and they broke.
1.0,Broke very fast. JANK
1.0,"False information as I only received 1 pair of purple socks, not 4 pairs as described."
1.0,"Complete garbage, the only thing that didn't immediately fall apart was the cross itself"
1.0,This tie ring was so thin n flimsy  the rings around circling it are separating after just me trying to fit it<br />I did not want to give any stars!
1.0,"Did not fit as expected. I ordered a medium and it fit like an EXTRA small. I believe the description says it runs small, but I did not expect that.."
1.0,Too small. You cannot get your hand through the opening. Child size opening.
1.0,"I was super excited for these as I pretty much live in workout clothes these days.  I really loved the pattern on these.<br /><br />These are pretty stretchy, but they are completely see though.  They even sheered out to more of  a gray once they stretch when you put them on.  They are cute, but sadly I will never wear these."
1.0,Sizing was terrible. If the deal is too good to be true it normally is.
1.0,Very over side for the type of erring
1.0,"The length wasn't as expected,  I returned them"
1.0,Buyer be aware I finally got to put my charm on my bracelet and by day two the bee bottom fell out :-/
1.0,I have purchased many of these belts-and like many of them- this one is also poorly designed. There is too much belt between the front/start of the belt and where the ratchet begins. so you cant cut this part because you see this part. So the front of the belt that extends through the buckle is waaaaaay too long and looks terrible.  They should have closed the gap between the front and where the ratchet starts. thumbs down.
1.0,"Muy lindas pero muy malas, el primer día se le desmontaron los dos cristales son muy frágiles y estaban mal pegadas. La presentación es muy delicada."
1.0,Too short. Sheer. Don’t waste your money!!!!
1.0,Hideous coat. Horrible quality. Poorly sewn. Terrible fit. All in all I was grateful that returns are easy with Amazon.
1.0,It lost its color in a month horrible product and really expensive
1.0,"Very small sizing, cheaply made and it has a terrible strong smell.  I had to wash my hands because they burned before I re-packed it."
1.0,Cheap quality.. pearls and stones were missing.
1.0,"The design proportions of this shirt are ridiculously wrong. The top of this shirt was so huge, the cute keyhole fell to my belly button (and I am a DD!). Yet the lower part hugged every fat roll I have around the middle. A bigger size would make the top even worse and it already obscene, yet a smaller size would be even tighter around the stomach. So I am returning the shirt, and it’s too bad, because I really like the style and colors."
1.0,I wish I could put 0 star . This sleep wear have not quality at all...I have never see here in USA something like that. I am really disappointed. I can not explain to my self that amazon allow to sell this in its website.<br /><br />They sewed one strap outside the sleeper and other inside. It has been sewed by someone that star taking classes of sew.  I am going to put photos in these days
1.0,"Very LOW quality in materials and craftsmanship, mine had scrapes on it and the words are almost completely unreadably because they were painted over in areas. Sent mine back for a refund."
1.0,Eating jewel fall off right after I opened package.
1.0,"I liked the look of the sunglasses on, but when I put them back down the lens promptly fell out and would not pop back in.  I saw other reviews about the poor construction of the sunglasses, but thought I would just use them for a nice weekend by the beach.  These glasses didn't even make it out my kitchen much less on a road trip."
1.0,It was super cute on me and wanted to wear it that night.  I put it in the dryer just to freshen it up and the black faded a lot in just 5 minutes.<br />Lesson learned...
1.0,They fell apart easily  trash
1.0,Not happy with this shirt. I am returning it. It’s not what I expected it is not as flowy as I thought. It’s not shear and the inside is white so when it folds over it’s white and not Leopard print.  I had ordered 2 and one i still haven’t received since it’s coming from China.
1.0,I have several pants of this brand and love them but this style didn’t work for me. Very wide legs  which didn’t look good on me.
1.0,My necklace came in broken :/
1.0,"Poor quality,  fell apart before wearing it."
1.0,"I am a larger person...but not that big.  I wouldn't waste your money. It's ugly, uncomfortable and doesn't work."
1.0,Fell apart before the first week worn.
1.0,the compartments for credit cards were so narrow that I had to trim my cards.  when you have everything in the wallet it would not button close.  Very disappointed in quality.  Also this was not a true blue color as shown it was more of a tourq. green.  I would never suggest  this wallet to anyone.  After this I will buy locally .  Very cheaply made.
1.0,"Wont spin when the pin is pulled, but the hour and minute hand work fine"
1.0,"I'd seen Hard Tail skirts before, a friend owns them in a ton of colors, and they're all significantly thicker and sturdier than this skirt. The skirt I received was paper thin at best, and while I ordered a Large I received what would be a Small/Medium in normal sizes. This skirt was not at all what I was expecting and definitely not worth the price."
1.0,So small and returned the product
1.0,Not as described. Not fleece lined for cold weather wear just a dri fit shirt
1.0,watch failed in ten days.
1.0,First I ordered XL which is too tight so I ordered XXL and they were exactly the same size!!!!  Yes that's right the same size.<br />This has been very disappointing.  I wish there was customer service for me to contact.  XL is the normal size gym short I wear that fits loose.
1.0,Did noy stay together after one week of using it as my key holder
1.0,After only wearing them three times already starting to come apart at the seams
1.0,One strap broke first day I wore it. I was going to fix it but other strap broke in washing machine. I an really disappointed because it was very pretty
1.0,Ear pads fell off first day
1.0,Shirt was cute but came with a stain had to send it back !
1.0,Im bummed bc i was so excited to get these.<br />The black ones are barely long enough to cover my palm and sooo tight that i cant separate my fingers at all. If i bend my wrist at all theyre gonna fold up and forget typing with them on lmao<br /><br />The grey ones are a little better but i couldnt fit my pinky through the thumbhole so i had to rip it to get them on.<br /><br />I 110% thought theyd be baggy and not tight. I have a small frame and this shouldnt be a problem.<br /><br />I guess theyd be a good gift for a 7 year old. But for an adult? Nope. Just a waste of money
1.0,I thought it would be gold wire but it’s silver. It looks like fake turquoise and it looks very cheap.
1.0,"Bring back the material content from before.  They were so comfortable I would have bought these over and over.  With the change, they are see through, uncomfortable and an inch width smaller.  The change in where made is not a positive change.  I’m disappointed as these were my favorites."
1.0,broke as I was trying to replace watch band !!
1.0,Too small for average wrist.
1.0,"I liked this watch strap a lot at first.  However, the leather is not thick enough, so pretty soon (in a few month of not even daily wear) it stretched like the holes in an old belt.  Now it doesn't fit as snugly.  Another problem developed: the pin on the buckle is not long enough, so once the hole stretched just a bit, the pin was able to slide sideways and pop through the buckle, letting the watch fall off.  I like the looks but I do not wear the watch with this strap anymore."
1.0,Too large. Not slim fit as expected!!!
1.0,"Not only did it pill up almost on the first wear.  It also sheds fine, hairlike threads.  Very disappointing!"
1.0,The size option I chose was 4-5T (toddler) and the clothing is 4-5Y (youth). Was way too big for my daughter who is normally a 4t.
1.0,Poor quality print and material
1.0,Fell apart the very first day!
1.0,"Like review before, is multiple copperish colors."
1.0,"terrible sizing and quality, returned"
1.0,I did not like these slippers they are way to small  they are not a size Medium for a Man
1.0,Horrible! Completely disappointed. I ordered a large... it looks like a size small! Are the bottoms even made for a human?! Baggy in the front tight around the legs and rides tightly up the butt.
1.0,"While the item is cute for my granddaughter, black little dots appeared all over after washing. There is no way to remove these dots and thus, my granddaughter refuses to wear it"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:fcd39cac2fc4da84ca1e35530566cda1]] Quality is bad
1.0,"Quality is bad. After I washed it, it came apart and looked like it shrank. Fit as expected and was comfortable before I washed & dried it."
1.0,Turned and irritated my ear.
1.0,Cheap no fitting plastic mask not worth more than a couple of dollars if much! One of the worse purchases in amazon! Shame shame shame
1.0,Awful would not even pay 1 dollar
1.0,I ordered this a size bigger and the shirt still fit too small. I had to give it to my daughter as it would fit her better than it fit me.
1.0,These tore the first day I wore them!
1.0,Edges frayed after first washing. Cheaply made.
1.0,Order 2 sizes up!!!!!
1.0,"You advertise as:  70% Cotton 25% Polyester 5% Spandex.... it's not!  The tiny label shows 65% cotton and 35% polyester.  I don't believe that label as there is no other info on it no wash instructions. And I have to add it feels like kids tights, shiny and stretchy.  The cotton content is not even noticeable.  It feels like an old man's polyester shirt.  Terrible,  I can't wait to get my money back!"
1.0,It's thin scratchy fabric that does not breath and its see through.  The color is dull and not as bright as the.picture.
1.0,Bad product. Realized item was broken upon receiving item. Item was also rusted and looked old.
1.0,This was hideous. Doesn’t look like the picture. Too small. Fitted in all the WRONG places.
1.0,"This bra had such limited stretch and was super thickly padded. I don't know how anyone is expected to work out in this. Maybe it was too small? I weigh around 120 and I'm about a 34B so I got the medium but Jesus putting this thing on was like tying on a corset or something. Once you get it on, you realize how much padding and fabric there is. Why??? I mean, I appreciate the fact that my nipples won't be shown through this, but damn. I nearly immediately started sweating after putting this on, and I usually run pretty cold."
1.0,"Not as pictured has a thong fit to it which is not appreciated. Tag is labeled Bazollo, not FTP as pictured. Need this for an upcoming event, so cannot return. I’m seriously disappointed."
1.0,Originally bought these for the button straps but needed to use them with the clips too.<br />Second time I used these with the clips one broke...no response when trying to obtain replacement.
1.0,"(UPDATE) After wearing these socks for maybe six times they have already developed a large have hole in the heel.  Pretty much making these garbage. I am going to try to make some calf sleeves out of these since I never really cared about the foot portion anyways. The compression is the best out of anything I have tried, so I think they will serve as good sleeves.  But there is no way I can recommend these shocks now.<br /><br />These socks are awesome, I surprised by how well they fit and the quality of the construction.  These socks have a lot of compression around the leg and calf area, which I really like.  It is a tight knit weave that looks to be very durable.  This tight knit weave continues down over the top of the foot, but underneath is a softer more padded construction.  To me this makes the socks much more comfortable, as they are not compression the foot all the time.  The toe area is a thinner lighter material, I like this, it allows the toes to breathe and wiggle around.  The only thing I don’t like is that the seam that switches material here at the toes is not done very well.  I am not sure if it because of where it is at or if it is just a poor quality seem, but I can feel the shoe pressing up against it and then it pressing up against my feet.  I kind of got used to it after a while and mostly forgot about it.  Other than this small complaint these are great socks, I would highly recommend them.  I did receive these at a discount in trade for my fair and honest review.  If you found this review helpful, click the button below."
1.0,"This is a very cheap, thin, flimsy hat. I would not recommend this product."
1.0,Stopped working after two weeks
1.0,It was broken in the first use! bad quality​
1.0,Is the belt fake?
1.0,I don't like this dress - cheap material... too short but too big
1.0,Came really late almost 2-3 after I first ordered it. Stitching was poor with a lot of loose threads. Sleeve button came off the very first time I tried putting it on. Definitely would not recommend buying.
1.0,"Choker (or if you want to call it that) was extremely loose, cheap, and broke instantly"
1.0,Looks cheap don’t think I’ll ever wear it
1.0,Showed every lump and roll. Returned.
1.0,"The neck is not as wide as it appears in the model picture, and the dress overall is SHORT. I’m 5’6” with short legs, and I couldn’t wear it as a dress."
1.0,This is the worse vendor.  First of all the color and style was not right; and then to return it you have to “ask” if you can return; and if it’s approved then you get a label to print and you have to PAY to return the item.  Not worth it at all.
1.0,This is more of a float aline dress. Does not cinch in the middle as pictured. Also I’m having trouble returning.
1.0,Awful. Looks like a gum ball machine piece of jewelry
1.0,It is not cotton as you advertise and it smells even after washing.
1.0,Too thick for normal pierced ear
1.0,Typical China customer service. The vest was too big. Customer service responded in an unintelligible English and after several attempts I gave up.
1.0,Poor quality. Hard to clasp as they were bent and did not line up. Cheaply made.
1.0,"I returned this item bc the arms are way too short. Overall not the best quality, the buttons are cheap.  I bought another one from a different company and the arms were normal and they had way nicer buttons.  I would not buy this one!"
1.0,Too heavy for Oklahoma because of the thick lining.
1.0,Quality is poor! Just return
1.0,Not Cotton Super small and stretchy.  Returned
1.0,"These are not as seen on TV. I don't know who wrote those reviews but I trusted them and ordered 2 pair. I thought I could use them when I was on the boat at night.<br />The box is marked similar style seen on TV. Not as seen on TV. There is no deference with or without these glasses on at night or day, except everything is a little yellow looking. I am very disappointed in these even at 5 bucks its still a scam and they suck. Now that I read all the good reviews again it does sound like an infomercial. Lol<br />Owell my loss I got ripped. Buyers beware. I would add a picture of the box but I don't know how. The box has the same as seen on TV logo but if you read the logo says similar style seen on TV made in china. I contacted the seller they told me I could return them. I emailed them back asking if they was going to pay the shipping to return them. They said no. it cost me 20.00 for 2 pair with shipping. It will cost me 8.00 to ship them back so in the end I will get a 10.00 refund in the end I am out a total of 18.00 bucks. Another example of china ripping the American people off. O and if Amazon would have noted the seller as east cost gifts and more I would never of bought these in the first place. Owell for 18 bucks they make for good conversation."
1.0,"After the Chi pants factory died in the earthquake, Gramicci provided a palliative for gusset-conscious clothes-wearing humans.  Sales expansion followed its line expansion to reach a wider audience.  Sadly, the company has fallen to the temptation of restricting sales to the super-wealthy.  We can only hope they are forced to pay taxes."
1.0,That latch or whatever you call it that tighten the drawstring. It doesn't work at all! You I'll the cord to tighten it's grip but won't hold on to it!!
1.0,I ordered a large which should have been roomy- I am 5'4&#34; and 144 lbs. it was too snug and I hated the material. Very cheap.
1.0,"The white is almost see thru,  needs a liner or a slip.<br />I'll be returning it"
1.0,Order up like two sizes at least.
1.0,Very small. Almost kids size
1.0,Its great to use. Stitches have unravel thread and the metal adjuster clip tarnished
1.0,Junk. Very badly built. Lens was bent when i got it in box. i am highly dissapointed
1.0,"This shirt is so ill-fitting. These are for petite figures (I am an xl/2x and tried the xl). The shirt was too small, yes, but the arm seams are wildly off!"
1.0,"Not the dress I ordered, but same in color so I guess I will keep it. Slightly snug came waded up in a plastic bag, causing creases that wil have to be steamed out. The dress I received has a different style, but still vintage with lace sleeves on it."
1.0,Cute but to small and tight.  Not true to size.
1.0,Bottoms are non existent :/ and I'm not even a prude lol
1.0,I wore this necklace for two days and it broke. The design separates and cannot be fixed
1.0,"These leggings would have been PERFECT if the waistband actually held and stayed in place. It was quite frustrating to wear these and the whole thing just sinks down because there's no elastic in the waistband to hold it at your waist. (I sew so I know what I'm talking about, it's what my company does to improve the quality of leggings)."
1.0,Not as expected. Material feels rough and stiff.
1.0,"Product was not as described, wrong lens very cheap looking."
1.0,"The decals came without directions. I thought they were just peel and stick, but they weren't. So, my nail lady soaked them in water, but then they fell apart. The ones that didn't fall apart, would only stay on if we flipped them upside down like a temporary tattoo...the problem with that was then the logo was backwards. We finally gave up."
1.0,These were really shiny and cheap plastic looking and the antler pieces are not even space wise.<br />Butterflies are not 3d like floral butterflies. They're pieces of printed plastic pages attached to clips.
1.0,"Do not buy from this company. They profit from returns no matter the reason or condition. They are no different from any other business except they feel entitled to greedy policies (UNDISCLOSED to customers).  These sandals are made from leather on the cheaper end, are bulky, run small and if any of that bothers you be ready to pay $20 for the fruitless “virtual exchange”."
1.0,Had this for all of 5 days when i sneezed and the simple expansion of my throat tore the thing. very cheap materials
1.0,"BEWARE It was okay for like a month, but then I think I got use to the shock and it stopped waking me up, but then today after a few months of it continually not working to wake me up, it just fully stopped responding to me trying to turn it off through the app! It just fully stopped functioning. I hit the stop button on it multiple times within about 5 minutes and NOTHING STOPPED IT"
1.0,They did not work!  I had to cut off the end piece!
1.0,Product was missing pieces when it was received
1.0,I originally purchased the larger size as I have larger legs and they were way to big so I got the smaller sized and they are still way to big despite using the measurement guide included. Offers no compression due to not being the appropriate size.
1.0,Fits just like a bathrobe and looks like one too.
1.0,Horrible material. Not as pictured. Don’t buy
1.0,Didn’t work for the Ambit 3. Short on one end...
1.0,"I specifically wanted baby blue to go with a certain outfit. The color is nowhere near baby blue. It's more of a dark aqua. I can't use it, but not sure if I will go to the trouble of returning."
1.0,Poor quality bag... not stylish at all...doesn’t look like leather..another crap made in China...
1.0,The pants were long and big in the waist!Would order a size smaller than you usually get
1.0,It's about the size as a leg brace
1.0,I'm very dissatisfied with the quality as well as the description of the product that was posted online.Very bad quality.Waste of money.
1.0,"These are not what I'd call fashionable. The fit is odd and the pockets gape, making one’s hips look rather exaggerated. Not especially well made."
1.0,"I wore it once, to go run. The fit was very cimfortable, Size was perfect for me.I washed it that same afternoon to wear the following day. When I went to put it on the following day, it has shrunk to the point that zipper was at least 2 two inches from closing. Maybe it was a rare occurance, but this did not work for me. If it had not shrunk, it would have been perfect. I really liked it the first/only time I wore it."
1.0,I noticed the clasp wasn't very tight when we got it.  My son wore it and it fell off of him and was lost the first time it was worn.
1.0,Took almost a month to receive my masks. They are not tie dye at all. Solid colors and poorly made. Some are sewn very small would fit a child but small even for me and I’m a tiny women.
1.0,Very rude costumer service these are very large around the ankle and slides down also you only get 1 not 2
1.0,Waste of money. It didn’t fit my Micheal Kohrs smart watch

1.0,Bag had messed up zipper . I wasn’t even able to use it one time
1.0,Didn't work when dancing. Gooey... tossed them in the trash
1.0,"It looks sharp, but by the time it made it home by mail, the stones were falling off.  Cheaply made."
1.0,"No support!!  Very wimply and would not hold anything up!!  Sides caved in, too.  I was baggy and saggy.  Very disappointed!!"
1.0,Terrible product does not work a waste of money. you are better off using your own tape.
1.0,Broken the first day
1.0,Does not make a full loop.
1.0,Muy corriente la tela!
1.0,Touch capability does not work very well
1.0,Did not get the cuff links with this order.😣
1.0,not very great engraving work. looks like it was done by a child. the stone is nice but people want these for the engravings better of buying onyx or opalite plugs without engravings. for the price the quality isn't here that's for sure.
1.0,"Item was too small, way smaller then what was stated. I was going to return but never got to the post office in time."
1.0,Not original Nike
1.0,I love the dress but it was too small.
1.0,"I ordered this as soon as I got my Pixel Watch. I am not a big fan of silicone bands, and have enjoyed this style more in the past.<br /><br />So this looked like a good deal!<br /><br />I waited about a month for it to arrive.<br /><br />I easily removed the existing band, and compared the connectors to this new metal chain band. They look similar.<br /><br />I put the new band on. The connection was very loose. There was no wiggle with the stock silicone band. This metal chain band wiggled back and forth and up and down. Extremely loose at the connection - likely to wiggle its way off.<br /><br />I tried putting the watch on, it's extremely short. I have large hands, and it would not go past my knuckles at all."
1.0,"Returned this because it looked like a short slip or something. It looked like underwear not outerwear. But, it was cute!"
1.0,"Purchased shoe for a pageant, arrived with a big glob of glue on the side!"
1.0,"Toooo disappointing on all levels!!! I ordered M to be on the safe side as the chart showed my size should be S although am usually M so i stuck to M !!!! It arrived kinda tight and the zipper is just there for decoration, it doesnt zip and when it does it rips right after so i have to take the zipper down and up again to try to zip but it rips right after !!! I was soooo excited to receive it and was bummed once i did. I would return it but i dont live in the states!!!  :("
1.0,These shorts were cheaply made and were so small that they fit horribly. You have to be either a child or extremely small for these shorts to fit. Sizing chart is completely off.
1.0,"I have like a 10cm too small instep girth...these fit around my foot BUT thats not saying much if you have normal foot. Id assume these would be too tight. Oddly enough when I tried them, it didnt hold down the foot at all. Looks weird too."
1.0,Este artículo nunca me lo entregaron😥😥
1.0,"Maybe just me, but it was too thick to go through my ear hole comfortably. Returned"
1.0,Pretty disappointed I recieved today with a 1in cut at the bottom of the dress. Color and fit were fine just wish they hadn't sent a damaged product.
1.0,Broke within 1 day. Do not recommend.
1.0,"Got them today, already turned my fingers green"
1.0,"it broke within seconds of my son attempting to put on, very poor leather quality"
1.0,"Great looking shirt, but far, far too small; could barely even touch edges of fabric together when attempting to button it, it's almost like a teen size large instead of an adult size.  Also feels like awfully thin fabric.  Made in China, perhaps that is the size issue."
1.0,Fit is very tight no stretch.
1.0,The opal broke and fell off the third day I wore it and now it’s stuck in my nose. I’m going to have to go to my piercer and have him remove it.
1.0,Cheap material and the color wasn't as shown
1.0,ordered a black one and a red one.  both had pilling on out side after two washings on gentle cycle cold water.
1.0,"I order 3 of these bodysuits, all different sizes and colors. They aren’t kid sizes, they are adult. Our 6 year old couldn’t fit in the XS, much less the suggested Small size. Very disappointing."
1.0,I ordered an XL and its more like an XXS. Or maybe a kids size
1.0,Rhinestones peeled off. Broke within 4 weeks of use.
1.0,Purchased 4-5T and the shirt fits properly but the pants have got to be a size 2T.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Broke one day while getting out of bed in the morning. Avoid as it won't last.
1.0,"Terrible plastic looking synthetic fabric, would not recommend."
1.0,"This seems to be burgundy in the picture, but is actually bright red"
1.0,"Too small,I ordered a size 12 they fit like a size 11. I can see the glue in seams. Poorly made product ! Very disappointed !"
1.0,It came broke and didn’t fit. Not worth returning. Cheaply made
1.0,This set is missing 5 pairs of plugs. It came with 13 complete sets and 5 partial sets (1 plug for each style). Very disappointed and will be returning for a refund.
1.0,Junk already fell apart
1.0,"This watch was specified to have a purple dial both in the color photo and the description- the watch that was sent had a blue dial.  Additionally, the watch that was sent had a scratched watch crystal and from the packaging, it did not look like it was new.  I was VERY disappointed and sent it back."
1.0,Looks nice in the photo but don't be tempted. Very poor quality
1.0,"Literally the first time I used these, when I took the glove off the inner liner finger removed from the outter part of the glove and could not get it corrected for the life of me. Ended up buying a pair of Carhartt gloves instead and love them."
1.0,Too small for the average fresh water pearls to fit inside .
1.0,All the same colour so not at all what I needed. They are pretty much trash because I dont have a use for these
1.0,"It seems like the square cuts were made with kids scissors. Too ugly, nothing like the picture. Don't waste your money!"
1.0,Didn't want to stay on ear.
1.0,"Update!! This bracelet is definitely not worth one star but I can’t give it any less. After getting a replacement, I figured I was good. The letter started fading. Upon sitting in my car waiting on my husband today I noticed that it has completely tarnished. It is ugly now. Photo attached. Do not believe the shine you first see<br /><br />I would give it a 5 but It came Damaged. For some reason I can’t add a video or photo. There are two dings on it that I don’t like and makes the quality look cheap.<br />Other than that it is very cute."
1.0,These polyester shorts come at least 2 sizes too small. 2X size had only a 36” waist with a slim cut. Delivery took 10 days.
1.0,"This must be something other than USA sizing. I ordered an extra large and it perfectly fits my size 4 friend. It is beautiful, just extremely small."
1.0,Would not recommend for anybody with a bust bigger than a B. Runs VERY small
1.0,Cheap fabric that looks and fits nothing like the picture on Amazon. I am returning this item.
1.0,seems it was made from cheap plastic
1.0,"Men’s ex-large is more like a woman’s large or a men’s “small” sized large… very disappointed, but to much trouble to send it back , maybe it will fix my 10 year old grandson"
1.0,I give this a 1 star only because there is no 0 I recieved a moo moo night gown with pineapples on it not a sexy short and shirt I'm very disappointed
1.0,I was swimming in it. Maybe it would not have looked so much like a robe if I did not get white.
1.0,"First of all, I had no idea that with these earrings the chain had to slide through the earlobe. I wish it was somewhere in the description and I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing these, otherwise I would have never bought them. Second of all, the chain does go through both of my earlobes but the part in the middle is so thick it doesn’t even go inside my earlobe. If the middle part of the earrings isn’t there, these earrings can perfectly slide through your earlobes,"
1.0,Lost my smart watch because closure failed... Had bags of groceries and purse and did not feel it fall off.
1.0,Bracelet broke in less than a month. Was not very comfortable to wear. I wouldn't buy again
1.0,"did not fit, cracked when I TRIED TO FIT IT TO FIT BIT"
1.0,"I liked this zippered hoodie so much that I ordered two more. However I will return them because the first one which I wore about 20-30 times the zipper bottom piece which is made of plastic came undone on both sides. Making it useless and impossible to zip up. This is too bad because I really liked the style and fit, they are comfortable while working out. But if the zipper isn't going to last what's the point! Very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this item until the company addresses and uses a more robust zipper that will last more than 3 months."
1.0,This was a reorder from a while ago and these are nothing like the first ones I ordered which were much thicker and fit more firmly.
1.0,"This skirt is awful. Dumpy no style, no fit. There must be a million pins on the backside of this model. Save your money folks. If I could give it a zero I would have."
1.0,Fell apart during first and only wearing!!!
1.0,It didn't have the pumpkin jack-o-lantern face.
1.0,Horrible quality. Only worn once. The arm seam completely ripped. Just missed the return window
1.0,"The first pair I received was tarnished, so I got a replacement pair shipped. The replacements were tarnished also. The rose gold is pretty in the picture, but that's about it."
1.0,They are not rose gold
1.0,"I was very disappointed in this shirt. The photos make it look loose fitting and body skimming. In reality it runs very small and is clingy. I ordered an XL which usually fits me slightly big because I wanted a looser fit. The  shirt was very small, it fit my sister in law who is a medium well. I would have ordered two sizes up if I had known. I went to return it, but it had a short return window (I bought it for a trip so I hadn't tried it out yet). I would not recommend."
1.0,Zipper on skirt broke within 24 hrs and the top did too. The skirt was bigger than the top. Had to repair dress instead of enjoying it.
1.0,"Unfortunately, the announcement is not sincere"
1.0,"Top of the dress was falling off, I’m at 34c"
1.0,Wore the earring for less than two days and it tarnished.
1.0,The product didn't seem as protective as the pair I purchased earlier this week. I compared the two lenses and decided to return this pair.
1.0,This is the worse it's way too small in the chest area and it's not denim at all very cheap quality.
1.0,Earring broke within a month.  Only worn 3-4 times.
1.0,"They don't fit, and it's too expensive to send them back."
1.0,It’s a robe. Not a dress.
1.0,"Sooo small and super tight but looked nice, no problems returning them"
1.0,Wrong color and strange material
1.0,Very cheap and the decal was peeling off upon arrival. Extremely overpriced.
1.0,Cheap fabric cheaply made the skirt is made of lining fabric  Just awful
1.0,Very difficult to tighten.  As a result I have lost them all due to them falling off my ear.
1.0,"Value for my money..nope broke the 1st Time I wore it. Comfort..I will never know! Well now, Stretch...😂🤣 the elastic busted the first time I put it on!!! I’m a nurse and really needed a quality cap! Very disappointed!"
1.0,Find a different maker.
1.0,Lights stopped working and my son was very disappointed.
1.0,"The product I received was nothing like the picture of what I bought. The color I receive was a light brown almost orangey color and the material was awful, felt nothing like a sweatshirt should. Not only was it a waste of money, it also took over a month to get here. Do not buy unless you’re looking to be disappointed."
1.0,Has to be in a very particular position to work straight out of the box.
1.0,Zero!!!!
1.0,Taking is spelled TAKIHC!
1.0,I bought one size up but it was still too small.
1.0,Very Cute but don’t last long. The outside part ruffle ripped right away
1.0,I wear BDU's working and hunting i have a 36 waist so large is just a little snug but extra large is way too big.<br /><br />So i bought this thing to stretch out the waste about an inch.  the junky product breaks the first time i tighten it down - then the company wont even email me back.<br /><br />I ended up using a regular car jack to do the same job - i dont think it will break now i just want my money back
1.0,"Ordered this watch as a Christmas gift December 2020. Because the person got two watches for Christmas they just opened this to use. Watch is not working. We are talking about a 6 mos old watch that stopped working ( or never worked) ,so disappointed. I have bought some great inexpensive watches on Amazon, this is not one of them. The warranty shows I could send in for repairs for $ 12.95, it is not worth it. What a rip off"
1.0,Didnt close from the chest nor close from the waist it looks like they didnt messure nothing no stars
1.0,Would have given it a 5 but only 2 filters came with it. Description and photo misleading.
1.0,"Very snug, shrinks after one wash. Cheap fabric"
1.0,Absolutely a different blouse delivered to me. Looks like something my grandmother would wear.  Medium is huge. Very disappointed
1.0,Charm fell off with in 15 min. Fixed and fell off again same day. Disappointed but will probably just fix ourselves.
1.0,The stone color was not what was advertised
1.0,Children's size. That was not in the description.
1.0,Transparent and short! Not good at all. The lining is extremely short.
1.0,I purchased this belt in November 2016 it lasted until June 2017. The stitching that holds the buckle to the belt ripped apart and  cannot be repaired. The belt is now useless. My last belt lasted about four years this one lasted about seven months. I would not recommend this belt to anyone.
1.0,"I shopped around for watches a couple weeks back, loved the look of this watch. didn't like the name so much but whatever, i probably would've paid up to 100 dollars for this watch, i liked it so much. So i bought it and was excited to have it delivered! well when i got it i first took a good close look at it, i'd say the watch would get a 8/10 in accuracy when compared to the pictures you see here. I was happy with the purchase until i tried to get it to work.... i spent a good 40 minutes trying to get the watch to actually work! i felt like an idiot at times because i was so sure they wouldn't send me a faulty watch a watch that didnt work. i was so sure people tested their products before shipping them out?? This would've only been my 2nd watch so im no expert when it comes to watches. I went over a friends house who collects watches. Well at first glance he said it was a nice looking piece, but he too couldn't get it to work. it was faulty. the seconds hand works, but nothing else does. frustrated, a bit disappointed thought about getting another one... but meh, its been sitting broken on my nightstand for 3 weeks now, finally upset enough to write a review, buy tape, print out the return label, drive to my local UPS store and ship it off..... hope you guys have better luck."
1.0,"Very cheap flimsy material, I don’t love this purchase"
1.0,Very heavy and also i requeste it in white and  its light blue i did not like it
1.0,This shirt looks nothing like the photos. Extremely disappointed.
1.0,Ordered the one with the pug on it for my son. Expected better quality for the price. Very cheaply made as the fabric is very thins and the edges aren’t even hemmed. They have been cut with a scissors so they have jagged looking edges. I would not suggest this as a buy to someone else.
1.0,Sizing is so far off I ordered xl mens for father but my hand womens size med. couldn’t even get my hand init
1.0,Way smaller than in the picture. So tiny i couldn't even hook them. Very disappointed..
1.0,So tight it’s uncomfortable
1.0,I read many of the bad reviews and chose to give it a try anyway. Very disappointed. These are basically tight vests. They don't help with shaping.
1.0,The necklace clasp on the smallest necklace came broken upon arrival. The necklace is unwearable and the clasp can't be fixed. The chain on the necklace is clearly thin and cheap. Don't waste your money.
1.0,the size is so big... it looks horrible.
1.0,Extremely small. What you would expect from an online fail swimsuit
1.0,"I returned the watch, which was not bronze tone or anything close. Since I was specifically looking for a bronze bracelet watch, I was disappointed."
1.0,Broke as soon as I opened the package
1.0,"Sent the wrong size and even if they sent the right size the shirt is still horrid.  Couture is spelled couiure, thin cheap material, threads hanging out everywhere.  I should have read the recent reviews which pretty much all say the same thing...junk"
1.0,only got three pairs of socks in my 4 pack.  they are cute though.
1.0,cheep  looking
1.0,"I wish I could give this no stars. This was probably the worse item I have ever bought off Amazon the jacket looks nor fits anything like the picture. The material is cheap. If you are considering buying this blazer, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME."
1.0,"This is definitely nothing like the picture. Poor quality, loose stitching, and small even though I sized up."
1.0,The case was cheap - cute.....but that's about it.  Callers could not hear me and I could not hear them with the case on.  Had to remove it.
1.0,Did not fit in 6” duct. Wasted money!
1.0,"I don't like writing horrible reviews but this was a total disappointment.  First, it came &#34;bent&#34; or &#34;curved&#34; if that's the way it was suppose to come; doesn't look that way from the picture. Second, very light. Cheap feeling.  And finally, the Lucky Irish Celtic Knot Triangle was so small, you need a magnifying glass to see it.  Major thumbs down."
1.0,Can not get it past the ball of my foot.  The size was XLg!
1.0,Absolutely disappointed! Came in a tiny box all squished. My daughter is super upset. Returning and getting something different. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"Me llego manchado... y parece mas bien una blusa, no vestido."
1.0,"As is obvious in the image I uploaded, this belt is a piece of crap. Shop elsewhere!"
1.0,The product came in 4 sizes too big. Made way bigger than the size and chart suggests.
1.0,This is a nice shirt but ridulously small.
1.0,This bib is so flimsy i felt like throwing it out .
1.0,"They are using - it seems to me - South Asian sizes. If you normally wear a US Large, then XL will not fit well. Of course, it would be best for the country if all of us who are wearing L or larger lost weight, but that's not going to happen.<br /><br />Otherwise, they seem to be nice shirts."
1.0,Horrible!!! I definitely do not recommend. The part that touches your skin doesn’t even vibrate
1.0,Didn't fit over my glasses. Ad should have posted size limit. Sent them back.
1.0,The center turnbuckle is supposed to turn so that you can adjust the frame while the hat is placed inside...it does not.  I returned this product.
1.0,Was super darker than the picture ...i wanted a lighter jean so i ordered the plain classic because it looks light on the picture smh
1.0,I was expecting an inside out &#34;double layer&#34; umbrella but i received this &#34;classic&#34; umbrella and i was surprised to This wasn't what I wanted
1.0,Nothing like described. Not bat wings at all. Looks nothing like the picture
1.0,horrible do NOT buy it. It literally broke on the first day horrible
1.0,This is not one size fits most. It is one size fits few.
1.0,It came with a broken zipper and the material is very cheap. Has a lot of pockets though.
1.0,Was cheap for the 22$ I spent on it. Was a Hanes like sweatshirt. Very dissatisfied..wud not order again from Joe's
1.0,Fit well til I washed and dried them. Then they were two sizes smaller
1.0,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, and it doesn't glow. I bought a separate one in blue for my other daughter, and and hers glows well.<br />The necklace seems to be ok quality, I still have a disappointed 6 year old, with a necklace that doesn't work. I received the Friday before Christmas, not enough time to return!!!"
1.0,Fell apart one month after use.. disappointing..
1.0,It fits entirely too long and even when I put on my highest heels it still fits too long. If you are atleast 5'8 then this would be good for you. I am 5'2 and it drags to the floor with and without heels. I asked for a refund and they never gave it back. Only suggested for me to keep and and they would give me $3 for my trouble. 😡
1.0,It was too small and I ordered an XL the size I wear...more information should be added to this ...I never order clothes from Amazon again
1.0,"Needs a stronger magnet. Fell off twice in one day and I lost it the second time, only wore it that one day"
1.0,More details on coin in photo. Sucky copy of a copy.?
1.0,"Swim a mile or two in a lap pool, few times a week, and have a smallish head. I LOVE the old barracuda's but this ain't them. They leak constantly no matter what I try (vaseline, etc). Don't waste your money.."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:706e2d37eaea3f65e1b8bd87d867d4d9]] So we just got this and it’s already broken? Just took it out of the package and it’s not sealed correctly. 🙄 my son was disappointed. Not worth my money
1.0,The quality was poor.  The opal parts of the necklace feel off.
1.0,Had a pair that ripped and got my fingers wet definitely very upsetting And then when I try to let them know I get the runaround when all I ask for is a para gloves that aren’t ripped because this is garbage that they sold me gloves that rip the first time I used em
1.0,I only got three not four. They don’t stand up well. Not sturdy.
1.0,Complete junk. Worthless. Disappointing. Many of the toy purchases over the past couple of years have been complete wastes of money and more important disappointing to the little ones. It should be against the law to sell anything this junky.
1.0,Very disappointing...it didn’t meet my expectations
1.0,I really liked this silicon band the only problem is the band clasp broke in under 60 days.  Never used the protective case because I found it bulky and cheap looking.
1.0,Very small. Kid size. Not wearing them.  Waste of money.
1.0,It îs not leather
1.0,"My husband worn this belt daily, within 3 weeks the belt had fell apart. Item is very cheap like leather with a felt in the middle. Save your money find a better belt."
1.0,"The cut of the dress is cute, but that’s it. The material is very thin & see through."
1.0,"The product I purchased had noted only regular (US style) sizes. I selected Medium as it is my size. What I received did say Medium on it, but was too small. Now, I see the advertisement at Amazon.com notes it as ""Asian sizes"". This is very bad advertisement when you don't include the sizing standard on the original product description. I imagine this was added since many people who had bought an item complained that it was too small. BAD BAD BAD"
1.0,"Ordered a 3x I think, probably would fit a lg. Wasted money😡"
1.0,Just got this and there was no battery or charger with it
1.0,"I have been looking for the perfect tankini since I’m a new mom. I thought this was perfect. It fit my stomach fine,it’s a tighter around the stomach area which is fine! But it left a gap in the breast area. It didn’t matter how much I thighten the straps,I got a large. A medium wouldn’t have fit anything but my boobs I guess. Super annoyed and not worth $26. The underwire wasn’t even touching the skin under my boobs. Kinda hard to explain I guess."
1.0,Broken 2 days later
1.0,I didn't like them lens are not very dark like I expected them to be
1.0,I got one in silver and I liked it and it was really pretty and then I went to try it on and it broke still gave it a try but I just don't like it also because it turned my arm green fast first time wearing it! It was a bummer. Then the seller sent me another one in gold for the inconvenience of the first one but the same thing happened. So I guess it is true you get what you pay for :(
1.0,"Omg!!! I have never bought this type of wig! It’s beautiful but I have to idea how to keep it to stay! It came with a free hair net, thank you. The wigs has 2 straps on the inside that I am clueless on what to do with them."
1.0,Itchy short and small
1.0,"Teeny, tiny.  Ordered up 2 sizes, 1x, and would not have fit a small child.  Good quality but poorly sized."
1.0,Save your money and don’t buy it. The material looks nothing like the picture and to return the item you have to pay for shipping to China. Really disappointed
1.0,"If you are built like a 10 y/o child, get a large."
1.0,Doesn't look anything like the picture
1.0,La talla no corresponde
1.0,"I have bought several wigs in my life, and I understood that I couldn’t expect much from a $10 hairpiece ... but I can honestly say that this is, hands-down, unequivocally, 100%, far and away, above and beyond, one of my worst encounters; this is the ugliest damn wig I have EVER had the misfortune of seeing!! Omgosh, I had to apologise to it - for the wave of revulsion that swept through me when I pulled it out of the mesh, making me drop it on the floor while yelling some real unladylike words, and not being able to look it in the proverbial eye when I went to pack it back up. It wasn’t respectful in the slightest, and it’s not like the wig did anything to me on purpose, right?<br />(Shudder !)<br />Anyway, I apologise again, but I would NOT recommend this product. Even if you got it for free, or as a gift from your favorite grandmama, or as a shroud for your pet ferret (who’s still alive), or as a scare-tactic, or ... yeah, okay - you get the point?"
1.0,The straps of the bag broke within a week.  It broke  at the from where it joins with the bag. Very poor quality product.
1.0,"I ordered a medium given my experience with Amazon clothing and this shirt you can swim in. I need a small, for reference I’m 5’1 155"
1.0,"This necklace is advertised as being ""925"" sterling. It is NOT. When I first opened the box &  looked at it, the metal of chain & clasp appeared gray rather than silver, so I got out a magnet. Sure enough, much of it is attracted to the magnet ~ so NOT sterling. I will not be buying anything else from this seller. I'm not a pearl-person, and cannot tell whether the freshwater pearls are real or not, but I automatically wonder about them based upon my experience with the chain. Definitely not worth the price. I will go back to buying from sellers I can trust."
1.0,Got a “sweat” spot that wouldn’t come out. Disappointed!
1.0,Really cute but a little to big. Returned.
1.0,"I've worn these ONCE and turned them into dust rags. Do they even know what a human hand is shaped like?! The space between the thumb hole and opening for your fingers is cut so strange that 4 of my friends found them irritating to wear also. They cause the part that covers your fingers to hang almost to your fingertips and they want to roll forward onto the top of your hand while pulling at your thumb (if you can picture that). And there's ZERO stretch! If you have thin arms, forget it, they'll fall down. I had a 6ft tall male friend try them and they fit him ok but still fit his thumb odd. Definitely pass on these, they're cheap for a reason and still overpriced for what you get."
1.0,"I bought these shorts in White.  For the money, I expected very good quality, and from the Q&A, I expected them to have a liner so that they would not be revealing if they got wet. The fabric is thin and there is no lining. They are going back. I am disgusted with Nike."
1.0,"The 2XL is only ONE INCH wider than the Small. Its a pretty shirt with a very cute daisy but the ridiculous, substandard sizing meant both shirts were returned."
1.0,"It was ""see through,"" too  thin."
1.0,They are a childs size and have Dora the Explorer on bottom of them
1.0,very cheap material.
1.0,"Nice product if it fit as advertised....I had to return it, waiting for my credit."
1.0,cheap material very thin but you get what you pay for i would not buy again
1.0,I noticed someone wrote the shirt smelled.  It has a chemical on it that I have not been able to find out what it was.  After wearing the shirt for only an hour I went into anaphylactic shock an ended up in the hospital.  I had been told a warning would be placed on this product and I don't see it.  So am warning everyone to was this shirt several times before wearing.
1.0,"I bought this bracelet for my husband and within three hours of wearing the bracelet, he lost it!! Clasp did not hold and it fell off his wrist. Unfortunately he didn't feel it falling off, so we can't even retrieve it!! I'm very upset because my husband did not even get the chance to enjoy the bracelet; nice masculine design that looked really good too. I definitely do not recommend this bracelet to anyone!!"
1.0,not any warmer than socks of similar thickness
1.0,Underwire? In a swimsuit? You've got to be kidding...
1.0,This would have been fine if the product matched the description. It didn't come with the little box or the keychain. Just the necklace in a clear plastic bag. Very disappointing.
1.0,"Nice looking cap. But it has WHITE MATERIAL on underneath of bill. Not appealing to me and looks as if it will look dirty quickly, easily. Would not have purchased had I known. Plan on purchasing this hat as substitute. www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007XKVB1C/ref=pe_3199720_250266240_em_1p_0_im"
1.0,"Just a shirt, not a blazer. It had no form or structure.  It was essentially a blazer shape but blouse material"
1.0,"These really are pretty earrings - not quite as bright as I wanted but still cute. But unfortunately they arrived broken because there was no protection for them in a shipping envelope. I'm bummed because they were just what I was looking for. The return went smoothly, no hassle there. It just needs to be shipped in a little cardboard jewelry box."
1.0,Small and hurts the nose
1.0,"Looks just like pictures, but the sizes are off. The shoe was too tight for my daughter and the flower on one shoe fell off."
1.0,I am again reminded that you get what you pay for.  Received tarnished and didn't want to deal with return.
1.0,"Cheap Chinese crap! Color inconsistencies..Loose threads, necklace arrived broken. Don't waste your money."
1.0,I got mine and instantly I realized it was mostly plastic. The latch doesn’t close tight.The money clip is loose and you lose money. I carried a month and the latch broke.
1.0,This band feels so cheap and doesn’t contour to the wrist. Do not buy
1.0,The dress is too small and short.
1.0,You can see the white stitching throughout the shirt. Looks cheaply made for this brand. Like sweatshop
1.0,ordered a large size it's like a childs size 12!!!!! will never purchase again!
1.0,Don't buy. the lenses are blurry and the tint began to peel off after about 4 weeks.
1.0,Terribly thin typical asian made product
1.0,"The extremely thin necklace chain became easily twisted into a knot which I could not undo.<br />Consequently, I had to break it, remove from the pendant and begin searching for a replacement chain,"
1.0,I received the item with a Dead battery
1.0,"These are NOT flattering! Im on 5'3 and 110lbs and these shorts made me took 3 month pregnant. After taking 3 months to arrive, I'm trying to return and the seller is asking ME to pay return shipping cost!"
1.0,unbeleivable. too  too small. terrible desc
1.0,"The product is impractical, and can be torn quickly  :(<br />A product that is very poor and not as described"
1.0,"I’m a size 13 and after reading reviews, I expected the large to fit. It didn’t even make it past my legs! It’s much more of a small! I knew they were ripping off the real SHEIN.. but at least get your sizings right!"
1.0,The material of the dress was way too thin and complete see through. I don't even know what to wear underneath to make it any better. Disappointed because it had good reviews and I liked the design.
1.0,"My daughter wore these shoes to school for the first time yesterday, and the sole on shoe is cracked in two places."
1.0,Los broches muy malos
1.0,Color was not as shown in picture. The length was way too long than what I wanted and than what was show in the picture. Disappointing overall. I sent it back.
1.0,"Received with box cutter cuts all over the umbrella so it was pointless. Been meaning to return but fell behind and no longer able to my bad, but still should have to deal with it."
1.0,Dress is see through.
1.0,The woefully inadequate instruction manual is absurdly ridicules. Recommend manufacture hire a native English speaker to write the instruction manual so that English readers can properly learn how to use this potentially useful tool.
1.0,I was disappointed to find out that these sandals were of horrible quality. They looked so cheap and pathetic. They were very overpriced. The so called leather part you slide your feet into looks like it wouldn’t even last a day. Flimsy and very loose. They wouldn’t even stay on my feet when I did a test walk around the house. They will be returned and I will be searching some more.
1.0,Doesn't fit and won't bend to fit. Luckily I was able to turn it into a hair clip or it would've been a waste.
1.0,"You get what you pay for -- the bracelet is not stained correctly and bleeds all over your skin. Also, the saints have been falling off -- after a month I only have half them still attached."
1.0,It was plastic.
1.0,2 of the charms contained misspelled words.
1.0,Came discolored. Rather cheap looking (you get what you pay for!) will be returning.
1.0,"This product is a joke! Very cheaply made and the sizing is way off!! I ordered a large, the size I would wear according to the size chart provided. The size chart states a large is a size 12. This product is very small, definitely not a 12."
1.0,"This chain broke the same day i had it on, does Not look or reflect at all the image, i should of known better, you get what you paid for...."
1.0,"Says its US size 13-14 but more like a size 12. Not even close. Material feels comfortable thats why it has 1 stars. Sting is hanging out the back, sides and front of slipper."
1.0,"Runs really small..  not the best material, looks cheap!!!"
1.0,"Too small, not true size, poor quality!  this socks looks like i have owned them for years after only a few hours wearing, and these socks  always tend to roll down, then i have to stop and take my shoes off to pull them back up, Very disappointed, would not suggest this!!!"
1.0,Order xl and a small came
1.0,"Clearly this is not expensive jewelry, but I at least expected it to have a finished look.  The gold metal surrounding the CZ is uneven in width, lopsided, and bent in some places.  I was looking for a simple stud and I got a piece of garbage that is unwearable."
1.0,"I can't even begin to say how disappointed I am with the quality of these boots. I ordered these to replace the exact same ones. The new ones are a generic and they are nothing like the original muck boots. They aren't insulated like the ""muck"" boots which is the reason i wanted the same ones. They were ridiculously warm for cold weather. Something I need for farm chores. They just put ""muck boot co"" on the bottom of them. Dont waste your money in buying from this seller. They only got one star because you had to pick a star to continue."
1.0,"Itchy, didn't fit properly."
1.0,Flimsy. Broke as soon as it arrived
1.0,The description is inappropriate the belts were not leather. I feel as though I got ripped off. Not happy.
1.0,"Nunca se cargó completamente, en cuanto lo desconecte se apagaba."
1.0,Where do I start?<br /><br />The dress appeared to have been worn and it had dirt spots on the front left panel of the dress!<br /><br />The dress is ivory and not white which are two different colors.<br /><br />The dress also is form-fitting which is something I don't like.<br /><br />The sleeves are to long as well.
1.0,Cheap. Don't waste money
1.0,"There were 2 masks in my order, one was scratched up badly and had debris on the inside of the plastic ( looked like someone sneezed while wearing it). The second looked fine, but it is advertised an anti fog - it is not. Moisture collects on the inside plastic and begins to run. Not good. Not as advertised. Not acceptable."
1.0,This shirt is a counterfeit not real polo!! BEWARE!! i would have kept it if the price was way lower not worth $79 bucks! Maybe $15 would be fair price for this knock off
1.0,I will return all the 6 bags
1.0,"this Dress is very very very long. If your super tall this would be the dress for you. The material is stretchy and seemed like it would be comfortable, but it would also show EVERYTHING because it is clingy."
1.0,Using indigenous regalia as your costume or prop is despicable and racist.
1.0,Tarnishing after wearing for 2 weeks. Now I'm out a ring and money.  Very disappointed.
1.0,We were not able to get the product to attach to the Versa - the pin slots are too wide and do not fit.
1.0,This was my second order. First ripped after a few weeks. Second top button ripped out first day. Look good and comfortable but poorly made.
1.0,Inferior quality stuff not worth the price
1.0,Not recommended Putting in my review after several months. Velcro has worn out. I only washed this probably 3 times and ready to buy through another distributor
1.0,Doesn’t work as described. Disappointed
1.0,😪
1.0,Chest not bug enough to cover mine.
1.0,"Absolutely terrible fit! I will be returning it. Legs were beyond huge, might as well have been a poorly designed dress, terrible body shape and straps were far too long even adjusted all the way up. All around awkward design, I never have this much trouble with clothing!"
1.0,It said it fits for a large. I am a medium usually so assumed there would be plenty of room. It was too small.
1.0,Broke in 3 days. Thought it was great until then.
1.0,Made poorly....more like bathing suit material and much too small
1.0,"Ordered this for the Florida Gators volleyball game in September, because...Gators! Pretty ticked to find out the back DOES NOT have the Gator emblem, but says ""ROCK CHALK"" instead. Umm...what? What the heck is rock chalk? I'm not trying to cheer on the Kansas Jayhawks at a University of Florida vs. University of Minnesota game! Incredibly disappointed with this purchase for not only receiving the incorrect NCAA team shirt, but also for it being large enough to fit my 6'5"", 220lb husband."
1.0,"Bought the one in sand for my husband the color is not even close to the picture, its more of a cream , was very disappointed"
1.0,"Out of the box, the zipper barely worked and there were way too many loose stitches. A shame to have to return this because it looks nice."
1.0,This very nice but does not working.
1.0,material was cheap
1.0,Didn't like.
1.0,Small af
1.0,"Had to send them back.  Ordered my usual size 11, shoes too small."
1.0,Perfect hoop earring but one earring latches and the other one does not. Wish I could give it a 5 star review. I guess you get what you pay for
1.0,"It was cheaply made, very thin flimsy low quality material and not lined non-flowing - very disappointed"
1.0,While this bracelet looks really cute...if fell apart as soon as I wore it.<br />I was very disappointed with it. I even tried to fix it but every time the links broke.<br />It got to the point that I couldn't fix it anymore because there weren't any links left.
1.0,Do not like the material it's made of. It's plastic
1.0,La talla m me quedo pequeña de cintura y muy alto el shorts realmente no era lo yo esperaba
1.0,Colors are not as vibrant as the pictures.  short top
1.0,I’m 5’4 and a size 18 jean they fit well. So I’m pretty sure I was send the WRONG item. The material however was wayyy to thick for me. Think loose thick sweat pant style. I was looking for a super thin and breathable material so this doesn’t work for me. The tag is also not the brand pictured so.... awkward
1.0,I liked the glasses but they were not anti fog. 😔
1.0,Too heavy for my ears.
1.0,"I got the wrong glasses! I ordered the tortoise but got black with blue lenses. Someone with knockaround, please contact me. I bought these for a trip I’m going on, so I need glasses, but I’d like the ones I paid for."
1.0,Product is strangely fitted. Slit is too high and you lower body exposed.  Much smaller fit than measurements.  Looks cute if it would fit properly
1.0,"I waited forever for these and am disappointed.  I don't think they are going to fit on my ears.  They seem too big and the metal didn't really bend.  I need to play around with them, but I think you get what you pay for and these may be a big fail.  I can't see them staying on for any length of time and they seem somewhat painful."
1.0,Poorly made. Came in broken. However refund was quick and easy.
1.0,Very bad quality. I had dollar store glasses last longer
1.0,it broke the first time i put it on
1.0,I did not like the fact that the pink mask was fitted for a child. Too small for my face
1.0,Hat is coming apart after only one wear  :(
1.0,Entregaron algo completamente diferente
1.0,"Ordered a size 14 for my husky 11 year old. They arrived and were almost 12"" too long and 2 sizes too big in the waist. Returned immediately and hope to source pants for my son locally so he can try them on before buying."
1.0,"I was hopeful for this to be a comfortable dress, unfortunately, it wears more like a night gown."
1.0,this is defiantly NOT a 5 xl
1.0,I was misled by the description.  Either you are selling silk or polyester.  I thought I was purchasing silk and would like a refund
1.0,Very misleading to show two necklaces in all the photos. I will be returning.
1.0,"I agree, they are very soft and comfy. But these are not very flattering at all. I know some girls are lucky enough to have smooth legs & a nice butt however if you do have any lumps and bumps, I feel like these really accentuate them & so I couldn't even wear these anywhere other than home."
1.0,This was an anniversary gift. I've had the bracelet on and secure for over a week now. Today it came off and is now lost. Very disappointed.
1.0,"As the old adage goes...you get what you pay for.  It arrived untimely and scratched but isn't worth the time, money or hassle of returning it."
1.0,Do not get this my necklace came with out a clasp it’s just one solid chain and is too small to get over my head will be returning. There is no clasp I repeat no clasp at all.
1.0,It has bad smell of plastic used in mask
1.0,Was broken when received
1.0,Es mas grande de la talla M
1.0,"Pretty, but i put it on right away over my black top and when I took it off I was hairy as a sheep dog 🐶. I couldn't even get the fuzz off--don't know what I'm going to do.<br /><br />Not happy"
1.0,Junk. Tarnished and broke on second day.  The only positive is that it’s cute.
1.0,Cheap material! Feels terrible and it's see through. The quality of this jacket isn't worth $5.
1.0,Not at all what the picture shows.
1.0,Woman’s sock!
1.0,"Was disappointed that this was too Big on me and since from a 3rd party,I was unable to return or exchange...so also just trying on, many sequins fell off..so guess I'll give it to someone,waste of money"
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:910755ff0cbdf9e9d304cc073e29c7f6]] Unfortunately, this garment was a complete disappointment. The quality is way below what I was expecting. Just by looking at it in the bag, I knew the fabric was going to start pilling very fast. The orange is nowhere close to what the picture shows. I didn't even try it on my 11-year-old, slim nephew, I ordered a 12 and it looked small for him. Checking the stitchery it's poorly sewn too and the zipper is flimsy, weak, gets stuck. Back in the bag to be returned!"
1.0,After only a few hours of wear the fabric is coming loose from the headband and revealing the stuffing.
1.0,"This is a nice package for the price.  I got these to replace a similar pair I bought a couple years ago.  They are very very lightweight. The vision field is clear.  I have only tried the polarized lens.  I have not tried to break them, but they didn't break while I was changing lenses...which was pretty impressive.  I have seen glasses that are easier to change lenses, but since I am pretty set on one lens it isn't something I need to do often any way.<br /><br />Update:. Have had these for 3 weeks and the frame has already broken on the top piece above the lens for"
1.0,"Not rayon, as advertised. This is 95% polyester. This will not be cool and comfortable as advertised with natural fibers like rayon.<br />Will never purchase from a seller who LIES about what their product is made of."
1.0,"I just received this suitcase....it's most definitely NOT a new item, it's covered in pet hair! No attempt to even make it look decent, so tired of being misled. I'd add photos however that function isn't functional on this site either."
1.0,"Not exceeding expectations, but kinda falling a little short, even for low ones.  You can only expect so much quality from a ~$2 dragon ear cuff but it'd have been nice if the bendable bottom ring hadn't completely fallen off the same day I bought it.  Almost what I thought it'd be, just a little bit cheaper, which that is the surprise in and of itself.  The dragon part itself is nice and secure and of actually surprising quality, but that bendable ring at the base there is basically aluminum foil and came off the firmer cuff part about as easily as aluminum foil tears."
1.0,"This runs really small. I am usually a large, but ordered an XL, just in case. It was super small, more like a size Medium."
1.0,"This dress sucks I ordered a small and got a plus size,plus it looks nothing like the pic online..I want my money back you ripoffs"
1.0,Thought they'd be smaller. The earrings are super large and heavy. the earrings are two different sizes. Very diappointed.
1.0,"I ordered an extra large for my husband, he can’t even get them up.  Theses were supposed to be easy on easy off, I don’t think so."
1.0,Band size gets zero .....<br />Material of the cheapest plastic ...<br />Looks cheap and poor ....<br />You think $15 is a good price ? NO<br />It might be ok on the shelves of Dollar Tree..<br />Where everything is for $1 .<br />w
1.0,I am totally disappointed by the quality of the earrings. I had believed that they can be worn on a daily basis. I bought it as Christmas gift for myself and now it is February one of them is already broke. This is a horrible produce for this price!
1.0,We’re too small and had to return them.
1.0,These pants run abouy 5 sizes bigger than advertised. I ordered an xs which should have been a size 1 or so...... Nope they are about an 8. They are very thin and look like thrift store mom jeans. Also I ordered low rise and theses are up to my chest high. Worst jeans ever!!!!!
1.0,"Very small, might fit a women's size 6/7"
1.0,"Came with what I thought was a dead battery so I went ahead and bought a replacement battery (not very common CR2016 battery). Upon first installing the new battery, the watch came on. After I replaced the cover and flipped it over, the screen flickered for a few seconds and went dead again, never to come back on. Apparently a cheap device. Extracted the now useless battery that I can't use anywhere else, returning with its original battery back to Amazon. At last it had free return. Instead buying a Casio for about the same price as I'm hoping they are better made."
1.0,"This swimsuit was incredibly small with no stretch. Well, the bottom was. I didn't even recieve a top! Returned"
1.0,"WAY to small, none of them are different sizes. They also turned my daughter's finger green!! Don't waste your money unless you have super small fingers!!!"
1.0,They were too long based on the size chart. They didnt help at all.
1.0,My husband could not even get them over his toes.  Need to return.
1.0,Was too small couldn't see the the color
1.0,Watch chipped and was broken within 2 weeks. The pins broke on the band and the wood is of poor quality. Very disappointed customer.
1.0,"Too short, I am petite and barely reach my waist. Very deceiving picture, where the sweater reach  almost to her hips."
1.0,Dislike it
1.0,They don’t come in a box. They come in a bag. I got them and they’re all creased and bent. There’s no way to buff out the creases in the shiny part on the heal. When buying boots find out if they come in a box before buying. Lesson learned.
1.0,"These bonnets are rough like paper... not silky smooth like satin. But for the price, I guess you get what you pay for. Still, it's marketed as satin but they're no freakin way! #Returned"
1.0,One wash and the tee shirt looks worn and tattered
1.0,"These are awful I'm so disappointed and not worth the cost of returning. The shirt is HUGE, I ordered a medium for 8&7 year olds thinking it might shrink a little... The shirt is like an adult medium but the collar is so small it's like choking them. Very uncomfortable low quality shirt, can't use it :("
1.0,This dress did not fit as expected in any way. It was way smaller that normal mediums and I was highly disappointed!
1.0,"Should have been advertised as a purse for a child or a toddler, it is not big enough for an adult to use to carry a phone wallet or keys. It's basically a plush animal with stuffing and a zipper on top very misleading advertiser"
1.0,These socks are too bulky — but very warm...
1.0,It is to small and it is not as expected
1.0,Bracelet broke within 2 weeks of using it.  Not sure if I can get a replacement n
1.0,"*My initial review upon receiving this band:<br /><br />Watch band showed up in 1 day (super fast).  The band is nice.  Great finish, great quality, sized easily, matches the watch well.  Seems to be an excellent band.  The tool that came with it was perfect for sizing.  All in all, excellent.  Very pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />***Update<br /><br />I've had this band under two weeks now and it broke!  I've had this watch on and off (not on my wrist 100% of the time).  A pin which isn't supposed to come out just came out (see updated pictures).  This makes the band useless!!  I've never seen a band do this, but I have now."
1.0,It looked poorly tailored.
1.0,I must've gotten a defect or one that slipped past quality control. The arms are the right length but they are super wide. I think they sewed on kids sweatpants legs as the arms for this crew neck sweater.
1.0,Does not display on the neck line like the sample
1.0,I ordered a size larger than normal and they are extremely tight
1.0,"I received this bag Nov. 4, very excited to get it....12 days later, one of the pockets within the bag has ripped apart and I notice the entire inside lining of the bag starting to fray.  I literally kept hair clips and a couple bracelets in the pocket that fell apart. I generally don't keep heavy things in this bag, so I'm quite disappointed and surprised with the lack of quality."
1.0,"I love the thin feel of this fabric, and thought it was a real selling point. However by the 3rd time I wore it, I felt something cold on my elbow, only to discover it had worn completely through. Barely outside the return window (owned it 5 weeks) but would not recommend wearing regularly."
1.0,"First of all the pattern is nothing like the picture. I was thinking that the material would be more along the lines of cotton and this is more the lines of polyester spandex because it's kinda shiny and very very stretchy. If you are really going for the look in the picture this is not the dress for you. I will be returning this one. But it is true to size. I ordered 1X based on the reviews and I am 5'7"",<br />205 my chest is A42D it fit perfectly but I just did not like the material nor the pattern."
1.0,Wore it one week and it fell apart. Another waste of Time.
1.0,These were not the shoes I ordered!! Was very disappointed in the presentation of the sneakers I did receive. The shoes were also discolored and the box was tattered. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift. I ended up ordering another shoe that couldn't arrive until after Christmas. Not a happy customer!!
1.0,I'm 5'5 and 120 lbs and this fit alright towards the bottom but TERRIBLY on the arms. It literally made me look as though I had wings; will be returning tomorrow.
1.0,My dress was stained when i receive it very disappointed
1.0,This dress was awful its was made wrong too big and ugly color. Bought it for my daughter the style literally had half her chest showing
1.0,I really liked the bracelet but it didn’t even make it through the day until it broke :(
1.0,Not happy with the purchase. In the photo it looks nice an poofy but in reality it's three very flimsy layers that don't do anything to hold up the (light) weight of my dress.<br /><br />Delivery was on time... so there's that at least.
1.0,"Please beware of doing business with this merchant.  I ordered this shirt and when it arrived, the image had obviously been lifted from the internet, probably stolen.  It was low resolution, so that when it was blown up to the size needed for the shirt, square digitized pixels are clearly visible.  In addition, the text within the image was not readable.  We ordered the navy heather shirt and when it arrived, it was cheap, thin navy only material.<br /><br />On the left in the attached image is the Amazon listing; on the right is the shirt as it arrived."
1.0,This product was to smalle And it was cheap
1.0,"Item runs too small. I normally wear a Medium size, I ordered an XL based on reviews, and it seems like S petite.<br />Additionally, you will be charged if you decide to return it. $7.46 minimum, it could be more."
1.0,Shrunk in wash. Was a gift so return is to late. Very unhappy
1.0,"This really is not what I expected. The pictures look so good! Even on real customer, however when I tried it on and felt the material it just reminds me of something that's very cheap. It's almost like the design is printed on stretchy material. Looks very inky and when the dress stretches out a bit so does the design leaving a certain area looking faded or worn. Wasted 25.00, most likely will return.<br />Shipping was great came pretty quick. Wish I would have liked this item more :("
1.0,"I did not like it, it went into the dustbin"
1.0,Runs VERY small. Ordered an XL and it fit like a small. Disappointed.
1.0,They fit like chef hats they hurt your ears they won’t stay down. They itch
1.0,It’s cute I wish I had known how short the chain is before I bought it
1.0,Had for two weeks and started turning my wrist green. Never got wet but the inside fogged up and numbers began to fall off. Eventually the band broke off from the a watch face and I threw out
1.0,Shirt was too small so order 2 sizes up
1.0,One of the arms broke off . Very poor quality.
1.0,The hat is not a Peter Grimm hat. Do not purchase it.
1.0,You would have to have thin skin for it to even work..
1.0,I bought the polka dot one and it didn't cinch my waist at all. I included a picture of a black corset from a different company for comparison and as you can see this polka dot one can barely even be called a corset. It's more like a large belt.
1.0,Waste of money........
1.0,Totally different glasses than what I ordered & the lenses are tinted
1.0,I like the ring is delicate and elegant but the stone popped out in just a couple of weeks of wearing it. I would have liked to order 2 more for my sister But I can't give them something that will break down. I wish you could some how fix the over sight in production. I will appreciate a response. Thank you.
1.0,I feel conned as it said it was sterling silver which it definetely was not as innthree weeks it lost it’s silver color and turned finger green. Worst buy ever not even worth the low price.
1.0,Didn't last a week. Unfortunately they all fell out or broke within a few days of use.
1.0,We got two of them for Halloween and both would not light up.
1.0,Our OT did not recommend for our child for extended wear and the taking on/off transition also seemed to defeat the purpose and cancel out any benefits. Unfortunately we can’t return because we are 11 hours past the return window.
1.0,Poor quality. Not true to description.
1.0,Not true to size AT ALL!
1.0,The dress is made cheaply like a sheet that had arms and collar cut out of it and a cheap drawstring in the waist. I feel like I'm in hospital scrubs made intoa dress
1.0,This is not a child medium.  It was so small it could fit a small toddler.
1.0,Ver cheap quality! These will be my dog walking boots for sure!
1.0,"I order a lot from here , and I was excited for this piece ..I should have read reviews first tho, this shows as a white/cream flower, and it came in yellow ...really unpleasant yellow =\ ..you guys should really update the picture since most reviews say the same !"
1.0,I didn't get it on time and it was all scrash out 😡
1.0,This bra doesn’t have shoulder strap adjusters so your girls end up looking super saggy...Not a fan. Gonna send  it back.
1.0,Sizing was way off i ordered my normal size but it was at least 3sizes smaller
1.0,Returned - when received  not like the picture attached.
1.0,Tarnished pretty  fast beautiful necklace....
1.0,Very soft but my feet kept sliding off to the side. The foot pad was very soft but a bit too slick.
1.0,Crappy product. Lost in 3 days. Truth - you get what you pay for.
1.0,Super small and not what I expected
1.0,Purchased an XL and fits like a medium.  Looks a lot better in t he picture than it does in person.  Cost more to return it than what I paid for the shirt.  Would not recommend.
1.0,Only got to use them 1 time because they broke
1.0,Too small size is off a lot
1.0,Everyone told me I looking like a period stained outfit it was so embarrassing
1.0,It was a little bigger than expected and quickly fell apart. I was disappointed and I am still searching for another Hamsa bracelet.
1.0,Items were too small for what I needed for.
1.0,This band will not fit sense 2
1.0,I wanted to like this jumpsuit but once I pulled it out of the bag I hated it. From the cheap spandex material to the overall cheap look of the whole thing.<br />If I could’ve given it 0 stars I would’ve.
1.0,These won’t stick and don’t do anything other than cover your nips
1.0,Size runs small.....also does not have a hood😒
1.0,Product was too small and it had writing on it that did not show up in the pictures.
1.0,Too small.  Rollerblades wont fit in there
1.0,Came with about a 3-inch hole in the armpit seam.
1.0,Does not look like the picture and definitely not the same material...it has belt loops and I didnt receive a belt. Will be returning
1.0,I ordered large and received extra large. Not happy.
1.0,"Great picture of item, however the magnetic closure opens easily and you’ll be lucky to keep the bracelet on your wrist for the day. Also, beware, if you purchase and decide to return it as it takes FOREVER to get your refund!"
1.0,"SMELL AWFUL. It gave an instant headache from the extremely potent rubber/latex smell. I aired out for a week, and it still was just as strong an odor. Hazardous I would think. =\"
1.0,hate it .cheaply made .To small
1.0,"They cut off at an incredibly uncomfortable spot on my lower back, but I won't have to worry for long, as some pairs began shredding after only four or five launderings, and I didn't feel badly at all when throwing them away, even though I still consider them new.  Avoid under all circumstances."
1.0,"Awful stockings! They were NOT plus size at all, and I had to cut them to be knee highs... :( Disappointed because I was hoping it would be perfect for Halloween! They could not even go past my mid thigh... :("
1.0,I am returning it because it smells really bad.
1.0,"Horrible thin scatchy material. Bottom hem is all same length, not as shown in pictures. Runs huge in size. I normally wear a large or xlarge in dresses but had to get a small in this one and it was still very loose. Definitely not my kind of dress."
1.0,"I received the beige strap for my anniversary from my husband, and instantly loved the look and feel of the strap.  However, 3 months to the day of receiving and wearing the band, I noticed one strap separating from the metal clip.  When I attempted to remove the strap, it detached entirely from the clip... and the same happened on the other band when I tried to remove it as well!  What's important to note I did not aggressively try to remove the bands, but was trying to do so carefully as to not damage the bands further - and to do so lightly is not an easy action, considering these bands are challenging to remove with out some sort of tug/pull.  So that's important to keep in mind when removing your bands.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm so disappointed, especially being out of the exchange time frame - and wish this band would have lasted longer than 3 months."
1.0,"It’s an inexpensive dress and looks and feels like it. Fabric was awful. Looked awful. Also very short. I bought a large and medium not knowing which would be better. Medium fit fine, large a bit too large. Both were incredibly too short for a 5’10” frame."
1.0,Strap was broken when it arrived. Doesnt look like picture
1.0,"LOL these are the worst socks I've ever come across. First of all, I did not know they are toe socks... Doesn't say it in the description but I guess it's my fault because I didn't really look at the pictures either. Regardless, these socks are terrible. The fabric they use is super thin and feels like it's gonna rip. Almost like panty-hose or however you spell it. They don't really even look like the picture. I got this item at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased opinion but I honestly don't think they're worth even close to what I paid for them. Everything about these socks are terrible, they don't even fit my foot and I'm a men's 10.5. Maybe if I was like 10 years old this would fit me, but even then the toe-sock design is stupid. The toes aren't even big enough and they're in a weird position. Garbage freakin socks, I'd rather spend some money on some quality socks instead of this trash."
1.0,Didn’t realize they were for girls. More like girls under 5. It wouldn’t even fit my pinky finger.
1.0,Waste of money. Keeps coming loose the original Fitbit band never does that
1.0,Smaller than actual size should have ordered 2 size bigger
1.0,"Broke the very first time I wore it. It was super cute and I was excited about it, and then the chain snapped... unfortunate. Tried to initiate a return/exchange but they've made it impossible to contact the company and amazons default return options didn't fit what I was looking for."
1.0,I ordered an XL and they got my daughter who wears a S..... like you can’t even side up 1 size......
1.0,No way this dress could have been an extra large waste of money and time
1.0,This product does not match the picture. I ordered these boots according to the picture. I didn't read the product details which states the boots are tall boots according to the dimensions stated. They are not ankle boots. I'm afraid to reorder and have to return them again. Its unfortunate because they look like nice boots.
1.0,The design of these earrings are eye-catching but the red 'goop' they filled the center with is a detriment to the earrings themselves.  It looks cheap and shoddy.  Change that and the earrings may have a chance.
1.0,"I've had two purchasing experiences with buying the identical bag and both times the front zipper got stuck and literally came off. The first bag I used for several months, past the return period, before the zipper came off. I was forced to throw it away since I always used the front compartment. This second bag was purchased thinking the first experience was a fluke. IT WAS NOT! After just a few days upon reception, the same front zipper broke off. My prior attempt to contact this companies Customer Service went without response. Caveat Emptor."
1.0,Awkwardly stiff. Not genuine leather. Looks very cheap and fake.
1.0,This item is cute for perhaps a child. It did not come in a box as stated but a plastic bag inside a pouch. I can not stress enough how tiny this is. Approx the size of a nickel. Going back.
1.0,This items does leave dot imprints on your legs after you wear them fro just 2 hours.  Can't imagine what it would do it left on longer.
1.0,I bought this dress for my daughter for homecoming. The dress it's self was fine however when tied it bunched in the back and made her look like she had a tail. All the ties hanging in the back looked tacky as well. When decided to return the dress. The address given to return the dress is very unclear and was in small print so I was having a hard time noticing and would have missed it had I not kept looking. The header of the address was a bunch of letters which I just assumed was like a tracking. I used the kiosk at the post office put everything inside the package like was asked put in the address and was verified that it was going to portland oregon.<br />My fault was I lost the tracking and after a week I emailed and was told I need tracking number to verify that it was received. I have NEVER had this problem before returning items. I'm not out the money for the dress that my daughter returned! I will never buy from a location again that I cannot return to an amazon location!!! Dress was not worth the money I lost!
1.0,I trashed it
1.0,The item broke in half two hours of wearing...very cheap!
1.0,I was supposed to get a 4/4 sleeve but was sent a short sleeve and the 2x is too small.
1.0,Awful. Fell apart
1.0,I didn't receive shorts. The bottoms are bikini style.
1.0,"Dress came in a deplorable condition, it was already worn  as it has spots on it. I am quite disappointed as I bought a new dress not a worn dress and I would wish for a refund"
1.0,"I’ve owned several ratchet belts, this is the first one that will randomly loosen if you lean the wrong way. I’m not sure if the fault is with the buckle or the notches in the belt, neither look damaged, but it’s defective nevertheless.<br /><br />Update: I was contacted by customer service, and they sent out a new belt at no cost, which does work correctly. + 3 stars for great CS Reps<br /><br />Update 2: as grateful as I was to get a free replacement, the second belt they sent me started doing the same thing after 2-3 wears. I don’t know if the issues is with the buckle or the strap, but one or the other seems to be faulty on both belts I tried from them."
1.0,Small pockets. Faux pockets. Cheap imitation fur fringe looks tacky. Wrinkled and creased upon opening. Wrinkles and creases have not worked out after hanging for 3 months. Never worn in public.
1.0,Sizing is all wrong. Unless you have a small pup do not bother.
1.0,"These ring absolutely suck. Do NOT buy. They look a lot cuter in the picture mine were all scratched up and they are Super small and didnt fit on any of my fingers. Absolute waste of money. I'm really disappointed that I had to give it one star, I would rather give it zero."
1.0,"Complete trash.  Its a beautiful looking product but its full of flaws. First off the earring back  (the small part that holds the earing attached to the earlobe) fits loosely so it falls off with any minor friction, secondly only some type of cheep glue holds the whole piece together i was taking it off one night and it came apart. And it shouldn't be anything like this since this earrings are actually pricey compare to others that you can maybe buy at Walmart."
1.0,I never received this item and the sellers have not answered any of emails for a refund. I would definitely Not order or trust this company again
1.0,If I could give this no stars I would. Too thick and no way to get in. Its useless at this point returning it is a hassle so do urself a favor and do not buy this. Specially if you have a regular nose piercing this WILL NOT fit. Ur going to hurt yourself and end up with a headache.
1.0,"Too small. The ring is not adjustable at all and there was no sizing specification on the product site. I'm deeply disappointed, as this was supposed to complete my look for my roaring20's party."
1.0,They run small & short. They are not like the picture.
1.0,This item does not fit as expected. Runs small!
1.0,I couldn’t believe it was the same gem. It’s a lean 1.50ct. And in the middle it has a extremely noticeable clear streak?? It’s so thin. It looks not too bad even in my picture but in person it’s not one of their best gems. Sorry.
1.0,"Not long, not off the shoulder.  It's a t-shirt.  That's all."
1.0,Ordered an extra large thinking it would be large enough that it would still fit if it shrank in the wash. The extra large is skin tight and the arms are short too
1.0,"It didn’t come with any directions, and after looking at and feeling the stick glue, I am almost afraid to try what is this glue made of?"
1.0,This compression shirt has 0% compression. It is just like a regular under shirt with 3 times more expensive. I tried and return right away.<br />Extremely disappointed. There is no compression at all. I don't know how this once gets such a high review. I followed the size chart<br />and ordered. Also this tanks are little short... not too short but look short and I ordered the XL size. I would not recommend these to anyone<br />who wants to use as a compression shirt.
1.0,Tabs break off
1.0,The necklace I received looks used and tarnished. Not silver like the picture.
1.0,Soy talla S pero estos llegaron muy pequeños apesar de que dicen M recomiendo para las tallas S comprar L
1.0,Very cheaply made. Less than two weeks and the back came off (thankfully I noticed it immediately before I lost the back and Larimar!). I loved the look of the piece. Beautiful Larimar. Very very poor construction with a back plate glued on instead of soldered.
1.0,Doesn't fit nothing like the picture. My 9 year old tried it on and it fir her the way the picture is.. i was disappointed it did not fit that way.  Needs a really bigger round at the top to fit the way it should.  Never again will i buy..
1.0,Nunca llegó el producto. Ni responden mensajes. Pésimo servicio
1.0,This type of tie clip is unusable. The clip is way to tight to not damage a silk tie.
1.0,"The short legs are very wide on her but the waist part fits her perfectly. The problem is I didn’t buy these for her. I bought them for me and can’t even fit them. Why do y’all continue making plus size clothes with small waistbands???? That’s makes no fkn sense. Y’all must be getting y’all references from those models on fashion nova or something. Real plus size women don’t have that small waist like that. So y’all need to start making the fit of your clothes make sense. If the size is a 3xl, it needs to fit like a 3xl! INCLUDING THE WAISTBAND 🤷🏾‍♀️. What’s so hard about that. Why would you make a the legs of the shorts wide enough to fit our thighs through, but the waistband small enough to fit a child. That’s the dumbest crap ever. Whoever the designers are need to find something that they’re better at doing."
1.0,The band feels cheap. Not worth the price.
1.0,"Terrible, received in pieces. It was broken upon opening the box."
1.0,"The description said this was for kids. But its not. Even though you have the adjustable ear loops, the material is way to big for a kid."
1.0,These are not what they want to be. If you work in an area where steel toed boots is required you don't want to buy this shoes.
1.0,I broke fine of them on the first use. Cheap and fragile. Save your money.
1.0,"Bought 3 sizes bigger and still too small. Button. No bottom hole. Looks like someone made this on the spot and shipped it out. I could have sewed something together better than this. Beyond terrible. Super thin. You move, it will rip. Couldn’t return this fast enough."
1.0,I bought this for my child thinking it would be great. She got into the pool today and  the glitter was coming off as she is swimming. I am returning the product.
1.0,Only received 3 neck gaiters despite it saying it’s a pack of 4. The fabric on the ones I received was see through so I’m not sure how effective they would be anyways. Returning for sure.
1.0,Do not buy unless your torso is 10 ft long. Fit like a glove everywhere else... The torso was huge and bunched up around my lower half. I look ridiculous in it!
1.0,"Cheap thin material, only the grey ones have side pockets, all three are utterly uncomfortable. Impossible to work out in them. Do yourself a favor and get better quality leggins"
1.0,These shoes were torn up in 2 weeks. They are not durable at all!
1.0,Disappointed very irrational I can’t believe I didn’t read reviews cheap material color is not the same as picture very short
1.0,OKk so what ever it was made out was not what I was wanting it smelled really bad it was squishy not comfortable when put on it’s just the worst thing I have ever bought I could have paid less for the one that’s acting worth the money but no I got this garbage
1.0,"Followed the size chart, not even close."
1.0,Upper half a bit small while the lower half is too big. Don't know how the got it like that so now I have to go get it altered. Not in the US so would be too costly to return. It's also really thin and light
1.0,"This dress is short. Like waaaaay short. I'm 5'2"" and it's still about 8 inches too short. It also feels super cheap and the bottom is see through lace."
1.0,The ends are too small for my glasses. I emailed their customer service line about the issue and it's been over 24 hours with no response. I tried looking at previous reviews for instructions to modify the strap but it just refers you to contact customer service. Please post the solution to this issue. Beware if you have glasses with a wide end on frames this strap will not fit!!
1.0,This dress looks super cheap
1.0,"it dos't work, totally different from the picure."
1.0,I didn't even have this watch band two weeks & colors started to rub off the outside of the watch band.  It started turning white all around the band on both sides & even at the end of the band.  I sent it back & will not order another one of these bands from this company.  If the color is going to come off that fast when all you do is wear the watch then I might as well just order a white band.  I was very disappointed because I was getting a lot of compliments on this band too.
1.0,Too much material. Have to readjust the back constantly.
1.0,"Very disappointingly small, not what I expected."
1.0,"""you get what you pay for"" … while the ring is ""cute"" ... it's honestly a piece of cheap junk.<br />the ""metal"" band bends and warps easily ... the white ""sinestro corps"" logo is REALLY off center and it's barely visible in the bright yellow center button … AND after only 10mins of wear and the button edge catches on a desk top and the logo button pops off and the ring itself bends.<br />so for my $6.99 i got 10mins of wear and something to throw away.<br />IMO, don't waste your money on this thing. i just ordered a MUCH nicer one for around $20 w/ free shipping."
1.0,Looks very very cheap. I expect the clasp will break the first wear.
1.0,Tights were way more peach than pink. Also I wouldn’t consider these dance tights. The way they are made you can see the seam lines down below her leotard under her bottom. Disappointed!
1.0,So bummed! The straps are really small (you cannot put them over your shoulder) and the bag is more of a teal than a royal blue.
1.0,Horrible fabric. Returned immediately
1.0,I bought this to wear while doing yard work after something hit me in the face while weedwacking. It exceeded  my expectations.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:7faf177369031f323644985e9f7ba978]] Shipping took forever and when it finally arrived it had a busted zipper. Not worth the money
1.0,"This is the first “rash guard” that we have purchased our son that holds beach sand in the fabric. After washing it twice and letting it air dry, it still has tiny grains of sand stuck in the fabric. This is not a good shirt for the beach. Maybe just keep it for the pool."
1.0,Sizes run too small.
1.0,i have a few bras of the same name brand that fit beautifully. This particular style with the insert did not fit. I would not recommend them to anyone.
1.0,"I have bought several pairs of gauges from this seller (that I thoroughly enjoyed), but this set was very disappointing. The black pair was far too heavy for my lobes and dragged them down in a very unflattering way. The other pair had pieces break off before even having a chance to leave the house. Would definitely not recommend."
1.0,"This dress is paper thin! So extremely cheap. If it’s priced over $12.00, don’t buy it. Because it is junk. And extremely tight."
1.0,They stinks after they get dry - got for my 6 year old and they are ok
1.0,"This is a beautiful watch but the craftsmanship is worthless.  I read mostly good reviews and few bad, but all the bad were consistent (and right I found out).  Watch showed up with one hairline crack in wood bezel.  I wore it at my desk job 2 days.  Noticed day 2, I had 4 cracks.  Day 3 noticed 2 cracks had gone all the way through and watch was ready to break.  Returned after only 3 days.  This is junk, don't waste your money."
1.0,This is the size I wear and this was no where near my size.
1.0,It broke soon after I bought it
1.0,Came with two left hand gloves
1.0,"I had this for almost 2 months and about a week ago the strap started to come off at the watch. It was mighty difficult to get my old strap off my watch, but this band apparently will just slide right off! I was sitting in a chair and it fell off. I was concerned but thought I must have done something so I fixed it and went on with life.<br />Today I was walking and it fell off, the band detached from my watch and my watch fell, the screen shattered. I am highly upset about this band, it ruined my watch and now I have to pay for a new band as well as a new screen, if not a whole new watch."
1.0,Don’t recommend unless your a size 2
1.0,Very rd y disappointed looks nothing like picture.
1.0,I usually like large jewelery..in fact i just recieved a necklace and earrings of another typed that are huge and i love themb but this looked very cheap and phony. In fact in seeing this email u reminded me that i want to return it.
1.0,"I returned the first set, figured it was an error, the second set was wrong too.  The product shipped does not match the image, wrong colors, wrong product and lousy quality to boot.  Returning my replacement set too."
1.0,"Just received my second pair after I wore out the bottom of the first pair (didn’t really seem to last that long).  However, the first pair had good arch support, the new pair looks like a regular pair of sandals.  They’re missing the support."
1.0,"After an extremely long wait to get it, the ring arrived broken with the little turtle missing. Shipping it back wasn't worth the hassle. And the engrave message is not legeable."
1.0,"Awkward fit all around - the drop from waist to crotch is too short, and the shoulders are way too tight across the back. Will be donating after trying to wear it twice."
1.0,Broke a week after I got it
1.0,This outfit is very small and the cheap fabric had stains on it. It also doesn't come with a dupatta so it's like an incomplete outfit. Not a fan at all. Definitely only for people who are under 5'3.
1.0,Cheap nothing like pic.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:6c20f3d4ac58a0c5b476e0ea0a9ebd8f]] The bracelets were not sturdy enough. I brought them for my daughter. She came home from school and the evil eye was missing. The bracelets were not value for what I paid for them.
1.0,This ring faded in 1 month and the stone fell out a week later.  I don't know why this company is advertising a lifetime grauntee.  I wouldn't buy anything from them ever again.
1.0,WAY too small
1.0,Horrible quality literally broke several just putting on to try on or didn't last
1.0,"Took this out of the package then put it in the wash and this all came off and is on everything it washed with , terrible"
1.0,"***UPDATE***  After using this bag for several months,  the ring holding the strap is permanently broken,  and the zipper still doesn't close properly.  Horrible bag for the money.<br /><br />This is a really cute bag,  I get a lot of compliments on it,  but my only beef is that the main zipper is really hard to close,  even unobstructed.  It's annoying.  Hoping after more use it will soften and just get better,  but I've been using it for a couple of weeks now."
1.0,This shirt is beautiful but the XL fits like a med. I am not a happy customer. I have wasted my money on a shirt I can’t wear.
1.0,Very trashy
1.0,"The second time wearing them they ripped in the butt lol.. I was just putting them on. They were so cute and really flattering but poor quality. I ordered a medium, I’m 140 and 5’7"
1.0,"Defective clasp. Lost after a few wears. Came off my ankle several times and luckily i managed to retrieve it but eventually it happened outside somewhere, it was gone forever. What a total waste of money. Seller is knowingly selling a faulty product. How can this be allowed, Amazon?"
1.0,Not real
1.0,I ordered two lined shirts...and received two unlined shirts (2 weeks later). Shirts are not even the same color as what I ordered. 😕
1.0,Not black..terrible material
1.0,"This fit and was really cute. However the white, is nothing like pictured. You can see completely through it as if it were clear. Order another color."
1.0,"I am 5'8""... 38DDD... usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.  I purchased the black floral print.  First, the obvious... the sizing is WAY off.  Super too small.  If you have a chest at all - pass.  The elastic waist fits like an empire waist... the pockets are way too high (because it's too small) and oddly, the print material has a slight sheen to it... unlike the other photos I saw of the non-print.  It's heavy feeling and in weight.  The tag notes 95% Rayon 5% Spandex.  - feels like it.  There is some stretch - but the sleeves were uncomfortably snug - and way too snug across the chest.  The tag notes machine wash - but no dryer - hand dry and light iron if necessary.  Made in China.  Honestly, if you're a women of curves - as I am, I would NOT recommend this even in the 2x - it's just too small.  It's disappointing that the sizing is so off.  But having said that - I am not really a fan of the way the material feels and looks.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful, however, I am donating this dress - so there's not much more to say.  Hope this info helps you."
1.0,"Horrible, very cheap"
1.0,"Advertised as 925, it is not."
1.0,Beware this says youth size. I bought this for my son for sports day. When it arrives it was clearly a size small women’s fitted shirt. It had a wide neck and spits on the sides like a women’s shirt and the tag reads small. I couldn’t return it so I sewed up the sides and used a safety pin to pin up the neck. It does not look anything like what’s pictured.
1.0,"Great idea, but unit I received did not open upon receipt using their factory combination code. returned."
1.0,Suspenders broke after wearing them for no more then 5 minutes.
1.0,These are not what i received. They are the wrong glasses!!!! Way to dark and wrong brand completely
1.0,"The worst thing I got from Amazon,  not Cotton, not even a blend of Cotton, 100% poly, shedding like crazy, washed it with some ather clothes, was really sorry about it, had to wash those clothes twise after. But you probably can generate electricity from it, glowing in a dark from static and electrocuted me quite a lot, but not what I need from the scarf:)"
1.0,It looks nothing alike like in the photo. It’s much smaller than the ones in the photo. I’m really disappointed with what I got.
1.0,"I'm 5'8&#34;, size large! Maybe the reviews that I saw, are small people. I ordered XL, like other people recommended. And I'm not fit, because is not stretchy. It's a  good size, but for  petite people."
1.0,I did not like the dress because it made me look larger than I am. The back sway made you feel like it was a house robe. It was too big and too long. I did not like at all.
1.0,The sleeping pajamas did not fit me at all.  How do I return the items?
1.0,Too small and poorly made. Buttons came unglued and lots of loose hems
1.0,"After only two months these glasses started to have the finish on the lens rub off. Total waste of money. They were a cute shape, but way too low quality."
1.0,THE PRODUCT CAME: ONE SHOW DIFFERENT VS THE OTHER. BOTH DIFFERENT STYLE AND SIZE.
1.0,Every time I order these I never get the best mom one! And I have order this package a couple of times. I know it says random but I always get the same ones! Not very happy right now! I would like to order 20 of the best mom ones for the same price. Can we do this or even ten of the best mom
1.0,This product is a scam ! Not even close to what the picture says . This is not a blanket !
1.0,I was very confused by the other reviews because I ordered this boot but the brand of my boot was by Soda shoes not the J Adams brand that I see in others who posted picks. The shoes that I received were way cheaper looking than the ones in the review pictures. There was glue coming out of the seams and stitching loose and the fake leather was very splotchy. I think zooshoo should let you know that there are other brands of the same style of shoe so you know what you are getting. I'm returning these shoes I wish I would of got the brand the others are taking pictures of those look nice.
1.0,"Way too small... my wrist is medium-sized and this doesn't fit, it looks like it was made for children."
1.0,The description lists this in as flannel.. it’s anything but flannel!! DO NOT but expecting flannel
1.0,The back of a platinum one was broken and missing.
1.0,Super cheap knockoffs.
1.0,"Cheap, ugly not what i expected."
1.0,not good came apart already threw away split at the belt hole
1.0,Worst bra I have ever bought. Elastic digs in even though it is the right size. Super uncomfortable only wore twice and then threw it in the trash
1.0,Item was faulty and received a refund
1.0,didn't make me ninja
1.0,"This product was much smaller than advertised. I wear a size 9 1/2 wide, but I know these can be tight, so I ordered an 11. I can't get my foot in it at all. This was a complete waste of money and my time."
1.0,More like a size medium
1.0,Bow was broken when I took it out of the box.
1.0,Way small my daughter can't even wear it
1.0,This did not work for me. ..some people it does...worth a try....
1.0,I ordered a 5x and it was more like a large smh
1.0,I returned this. It smelled funny and felt like hard plastic not like imitation crocodile/leather. The attached purse/bag will hold maybe a small compact and a couple of lipsticks.
1.0,Bag was poorly made I ordered a rose red and got a purple bag... then when it was time to put it together the screw holes weren’t in the handle to screw through... then the bag was pink and the wheels n pully was bright pink... quality of lunch bag and pencil case was poor... I wouldn’t order again
1.0,Didnt work for odor
1.0,The ring is pretty but it will start turning brass in a week and by two weeks you will not want to wear it.
1.0,Returned. Cheap dri-fit material. DEFINETLY not worth the price. Doesn't fit nor look as shown on model.
1.0,38 B in this brand is exactly as a 36 B VS I would return and exchange for a 40B if they have any.
1.0,I ended up giving it to my 8 month pregnant sister in law
1.0,The sponge fell off on first day of using it.  Brushes are so small that I don't think they are of any use.  A cloth that comes with it is NOT lint free and also tiny.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"Ordered size 8: Not sure what the fit model dimensions were, but to be described as non-standard would be kind.<br /><br />The arms are compression sleeve fit, while the torso is what I would expect.<br /><br />The pants are also out of whack. The crotch goes nearly to the knees, and the legs are about 6 inches short and the cuffs are compression fit. Imagine hipster pant fit."
1.0,fits like a sheet
1.0,"I was very disappointed in this dress. I followed their size chart and customer reviews, and ordered a size up.  The dress was so small, it wouldn't even fit my arms. Extremely short, hit at my hips."
1.0,Came broken! Haven’t even gotten the chance to put them on and it fell apart as soon as I took It out of the clear bag It came in!
1.0,"The &#34;gold&#34; paint came off immediately and now looks like a horrible rusty color, like a penny.  Cheap, cheap, CHEAP! Didn't even make it through one use!"
1.0,"It turned within 2 weeks ,wont buy from this seller again."
1.0,"Incredibly small, I even ordered a larger size than normal. The top part was unraveled and got worse when I tried it on."
1.0,It was nothing like the picture! Not jagged edges at all. its straight square with splits on the side!!! NOTHING LIKE PICTURE!
1.0,Hate this skirt. The material is that cheap plastic-y synthetic stuff. The waist is sewn terribly so it puffs out under the waistband. Looks bad when you tuck anything in. Do not recommend.
1.0,Specify that it’s for a baby size please!!!!!!!
1.0,"SCAM. Definitely a scam, looks nothing like the picture. Cheaply made and not real stone. I believe it's some sort of plastic. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1.0,"This dress material was lovely,  however I ordered this dress and the hem was crooked.  I returned it and ordered a second dress.  That dresses back seams were crooked and the zipper was faulty.  I returned it and ordered a third dress. The seams in the front and back were uneven and the sleeves didn't fit. Very disappointing because the fabric was lovely,  however the quality of the tailoring of this dress is not worth the purchase."
1.0,VERY VERY CHEAP LOOKING!!!!!!!!!! None of my girls will wear it on their bracelets!
1.0,"I'm 5'9"" and 145 lbs. These were way too small and high waters. Bummed because other reviews indicated they wouldn't be."
1.0,"This drone is absolute garbage. It requires calibration every time it flies, if you can even get the remote and drone to sync. Just getting it running requires that it gets opened up, and has the battery unplugged and reattached several times before it finally starts properly. Even then, it's only a matter of minutes before the unit disconnects from the controller (I only flew it about ten feet away from me).<br /><br />There's nowhere to plug in a charger, so you have to manually open the thing and pull the battery out to charge it and also plug it in once it's charged.<br /><br />Throttle controls are over sensitive. Notch the throttle up a millimeter and it's full throttle. Down a notch and it completely turns off. Good luck getting a soft landing.<br /><br />The camera quality is so poor, it's useless. Images are grainy and extremely pixelated. Most photos come in at 192KB or so.<br /><br />The copter also likes to get about 20 feet in the air and switch right off, falling to the ground. So don't even think about flying it near people, cars, or water.<br /><br />With a fully charged battery, I got a solid three minutes of use out of this thing over the course of 8 hours.<br /><br />Don't waste your money."
1.0,"Looks VERY VERY CHEAPY and it wasn’t cheap at all! unstitched Gloves, very poor finishes, the neck fabric wasn’t stretch so my daughter head doesn’t fit!!! the wholesize is very small! I can’t be able to use this costume like this I have to modify it and sew it again!!"
1.0,"I don't know whose boobs this is supposed to fit, but I adhered to the size chart when selecting my size and I couldn't even get it on my body, much less get it hold up the girls."
1.0,"It runs EXTREMELY small. The 4x is tiny, and I mean tiny. Fits my 105 pound daughter."
1.0,Have a petite girl length is plenty long but just cannot get her foot in the hole as there is not stretch to accommodate a foot
1.0,I have ordered 3 of these tops in different colors.  This top was missing the underarm shield under the right arm.  The seller would not know this because the bags are sealed by the manufacturer. My caution is that others may have similar quality issues that are sold.  The reason I ordered this style of top was because of the way the arm openings were made.  Unfortunate that this one was not constructed correctly.
1.0,This apron is for a doll not a human. Should not be sold to adults.
1.0,Can't choose size. Link needs to be fixed.
1.0,"I am extremely disappointed in these shoes.  I have purchased many pairs of Natives for my twins over the years.  The upper shoe of this pair is cracked and peeling in multiple spots and looks awful.  The reason to buy Natives is because they wear well and last until the inevitable next growth spurt.  I would NOT recommend buying these shoes, in the sparkle options.  Those with the fabric option are terrific, as you would expect from Native.  The sparkle ones are made of a plastic type product and crack and because they are stiff the Velcro pops open frequently when my daughter starts to walk in them."
1.0,Way too small and very poor quality.
1.0,Very thin and tight. Elastic is small. Very tight on the face with very thin material
1.0,Cheap material the sides were coming off i don't recommend
1.0,"If you have boys, these are made more for girls, than boys! I would never buy these again."
1.0,This is actually the size for a very small young girl.<br /><br />I will give it to my niece to play dress up.
1.0,"They are beautiful earrings, but the right earring is a backwards E. If you turn the letter the right way it is higher up on one side. Does not look good at all."
1.0,"I bought this expecting to have the device shocking me out of my bed, I had actually tried it once before and returned it because it didn't do jack but was struggling to get to work on time and in looking for solutions I decided to give it another shot. It was even worse than before. there were like 4 apps, only one of which was compatible, and of the 5 nights I used it, it only vibrated beeped, or shocked me one night. the shock vibration and beep were all incredibly underwhelming, even when set to the maximum the ""shock"" was not even close to the kind of static shock you get when touching a doorknob. spend your money elsewhere."
1.0,"Not what I expected, cheap is an understatement. This isn’t even a metal I’m aware of more like a strange material. Made my ears swell, turn red and my ears became hot to the touch. They also turn your ears black ."
1.0,These gloves fit fine and I had high hopes for them until I woke up in the morning and noticed that the seams had already started to split in three places.  It's not that they didn't fit (I have average size women's hands) they're just shoddily made.  I got tother cotton/spandex gloves for about half the price and they're a much better quality.
1.0,All of the diamonds fell out and it turned weird colors
1.0,"Should have read the reviews before I purchased.  As someone else mentioned, the coin compartment does not stay zipped.  Coins are always coming out inside my purse and have found some on the floor of the car.  Really wanted to like this nice wallet.  I do love the size and color.  But the fact that the coin compartment won't stay zipped is a huge no for me.  For this reason I can not recommend it unless you don't want to carry any coin.  Update:  Finally threw this wallet in the trash today where it belongs.  It has ruined the magnetic strip on several of my credit cards, causing them to be declined when used.  After the second time this occurred, I decided to trash the wallet.  The coin compartment does not stay closed so had that taped with a piece of tape.  Now that it has ruined my cards, in the trash it goes.  Pretty expensive wallet to toss in the trash!  BUYER BEWARE!"
1.0,I bought these  because it said 4 Ply layers.. But this is only 3 layers. Look at the package.  This is false advertisement.  This is a shame on the person that is selling this..  If you are looking for a four layer this is not it!
1.0,Really cheaply made and feels like it. Do. Not. Buy.
1.0,"Too thin, like the color"
1.0,Item was delivered and the package was open and not sealed it appeared to be a return. I paid full price for a new item!
1.0,Gave as a gift to my neighbour. battery went dead the first week. If you purchase make sure you give the person an additional battery.
1.0,"I ordered a brown plaid shirt and received a red plaid shirt instead. Also, the patterning is NOTHING like on the website. Absolutely nothing like it!"
1.0,"Within a week the mirrored covering started to flake off...but, I guess you get what you pay for. I liked them up until that happened."
1.0,"Those should have sizes to choose from. If you have wide feet, they will not stay on at all. They are for tiny feet.<br /><br />I am disappointed."
1.0,"It broke on the second use. Trying to close it, I felt something break inside and now it won't stay open."
1.0,didn't look like picture at all when I received it. in picture bottom flares out  when I received it it was straight and quite fitted.
1.0,You would think it would be cute. But it’s extra small and is doesn’t flow like the picture looks and it is incredibly short for a bigger size. Like hey look everyone there’s my belly. ( I bought an xL ) it’s also bad when the company basically begs you to keep their shirt and they will give you your money back. Obviously it’s not worth it.
1.0,I made this a one because it’s cute. Never got to wear it because the zipper broke the first time I tried it in. I bought an xl and I wear a size 8 so it’s not Because it was to small. I bought it for on the boat to share with people. Won’t<br />Be suggesting this to anyone
1.0,It slides down
1.0,2 weeks and color is changing
1.0,Did not like the fit at all. Very large and too long. Gave it away.
1.0,"Too small, can only carry phone and a key."
1.0,I love d it and wore it too much apparently because it feel apart within 3 weeks!
1.0,Poor quality - small tear in covering & handles are falling off after one week.
1.0,Much smaller than anticipated... not worth the money for only protecting half the lense.
1.0,I'm sensitive to fabrics and this was way too itchy for me. The outside feels soft but I couldn't wear it more than five minutes due to the itchiness. Disappointing because its really cute!
1.0,"the undershorts fit ok, the overlay short seems almost 2 times smaller"
1.0,This 3X is more like a large. Very tight. I sized up and it's still small.
1.0,"I always have to laugh at these bras. I desperately want to find something like this that fits but it seems like it’s not going to happen. I am tiny, but I am a DD. Like seriously can you people not make anything for bigger breaths? Sad."
1.0,Do not buy this item!
1.0,"I ordered a size XL (3XL). When I received the coat I was stunned to see how small it was. This coat should  not be sold in the Womens department.  It is more for  children  or teens. My 19 year old daughter who is a size extra small in women's was able to fit the coat. She is very petite. I paid extra shipping for this coat. I needed the coat for the weekend. The coat is very thick, but too small. Please update your sizing."
1.0,"we recieve another one, different from the picture!!! I wait to get my money back"
1.0,The color was not the same as the picture and it did not come off the either
1.0,This dress has an awful bottom hem. It has two slits (think Xena warrior princess) that totally ruins the look of the dress. I’m paying 20 bucks to fix it which probably isn’t worth it.
1.0,I am a 14/16 I bought an XL this was wag to shirt. It went so high up in the front and I couldn’t even get it on my shoulders! Was very disappointed
1.0,There is a non-stretchy band on the empire waist that makes it super hard to get the dress on and off. Not a flattering dress. Looks like a toddler’s dress when on.
1.0,fit like a 3XL. Waist fit fine but the legs were tight. I am a powerlifter and i wear 5XL or sometimes 4XL Reebok and Addidas. I'll be going back to those. Thanks!
1.0,This shirt is very awkward and doesn't look anything like the pictures! I wanted a few nice work tops and thought this one was cute but when I put it on I could barely figure out the buttons. They come across the chest diagonally and I wasn't sure if you were supposed to button them &#34;inside out&#34; or what was going on?!! It's like this shirt needs an instruction manual - and after buttoning and rebuttoning a few times I gave up and decided to return it!
1.0,Ordered an XXL and these for like an XL.
1.0,I'm not happy with this ring  I wanted 2 names engraved on the inside and the names weren't there. I want a refund for this because you forget my Son's two names
1.0,Useless piece if crap that you cant even return!!
1.0,Fit was awkward. Fit ok in waist but slim in neckline. Looked nothing like the picture.<br />The color is nice and would be cute but was crafted poorly.
1.0,"Can't tie, too short only 38&#34;. I have 17 1/2&#34; neck. Should advertise length and neck sizes."
1.0,"Cheaply made for the money that was paid ,falling apart rubber breaking .... .☹☹☹"
1.0,This case broke at the wheels after one use?!?!  Super disappointed as it was not an inexpensive piece.  My trip was pretty much ruined..
1.0,Didnt fit at all
1.0,material was thin and the zipper is very poor quality
1.0,"Doesn't look anything like the picture at all. Just a basic green shirt sleeve t-shirt with vinyl picture that peels off easily. Love the shirts in the advertised pics but these aren't them for sure!! Do NOT recommend wasting your money, you could make these cheaper at home with a cricut."
1.0,it was broke when I got the glasses
1.0,Came broken. Completely bent.
1.0,The cotton material was very itchy. I had to return them. Purchased some at my Ace Hardware which were awesome.
1.0,Disappointed. One glove only has a single setting.
1.0,"I ordered up as I knew the dress ran small, but it runs much smaller than you'd expect!"
1.0,"Bands did not fit the Samsung Gear Fit 2, as advertised.  The clasps and removal clamp was a bit too large to &#34;click&#34; into place.  What a shame."
1.0,"It is a scam, Do not buy."
1.0,I give this 0 stars to small and very sheap. 😏😏quality
1.0,This was not as I expected at all. It was thin and not very puffy. I ordered a size large when I'm normally a medium and it was still to small.
1.0,Elegant but Tooooooooo small.....
1.0,I wear large and my sister wear small and i have to give my sister the jacket because it was useless to send back it take almost a month to reach to me. Why it back when it take a other month to pick up. Ur product and services is poor.  But nice jacket
1.0,"I bought these based on the reviews  I read saying that these don't slip off your heels.  Well, the reviews are false because they slip off your heels.  Wasted my money on this purchase!!!"
1.0,They were too big for my face looked funny on.
1.0,One of the legs twisted after one wash.
1.0,"absolutely terrible. I was so excited about this top and the pictures are so cute. but the material is SO CHEAP!! it feels absolutely terrible, not even wearable, and looks nothing at all like the pictures. Do not recommend, I returned."
1.0,"These socks are sized smaller than you would expect. Order big. Unfortunately, I order the biggest size and they still don’t fit."
1.0,"I bought this twice, one in 2015 (black) and another two (black/navy) in 2017. Unfortunately, though the material is soft it has been changed to from a regular satin to a much thinner satin and the stitching around the chest/neck area comes undone easily, both being damaged after one wash, each at separate times. Quite disappointing!"
1.0,I could barely get my wrist into this bracelet.
1.0,"They fit like children jewelry vey tiny and I have a small wrist, one broke while I was trying it on for the first time and the star broke off the other."
1.0,"It fell maybe 20 inches and snapped. Gorilla glued it and when putting it on, it snapped on the opposite  side of the first snap."
1.0,"This pack is ridiculous. The stores were sold out of XS briefs when we were school shopping....so of course, order from Amazon! Ugh! One pack of 5....3 different sizes (length AND width). And you can see how poorly the band is stitched together on two of them. The light blue pair with the darker band was from a previous pack purchased. Same brand, same size. Why?!?!?"
1.0,Bought this for my son in July but saved it for our Mexico trip in September. We just got back from Mexico and the swimsuit broke the first day. The zipper came apart. I am super bummed. I wish we could return it.
1.0,My boyfriend tried to put his on and it snapped SO quickly.
1.0,"Very cute, however one of them broke the first time I wore them."
1.0,I returned this dress immediately. Low quality of fabric and weird fitting. The pockets buldged as well.
1.0,I dislike being lied to. These masks seemed to be made of poor quality paper. I opened one of the package tried one on and had to take it off. It did not even fit right and was very uncomfortable. I would not be wearing them at all.
1.0,"I bought a 2Xl, I’m usually a 1XL for shorts/pants but like bigger sleepwear. Couldn’t even pull the pajamas past my knees they are that small. Waste of time."
1.0,"Came in late, size was too large, and you can see through the pants even before putting it on.  It did not fit or look as we would expect it to.  I have to wear black stockings or leggings under it to hide the fact you can see right through it"
1.0,This was a very small size for a man I ordered a double X It could have did a very small man Very disappointed
1.0,This dress is not like the pictures.
1.0,Not as expected.  Cheaply made
1.0,faulty buckle broke in two months.
1.0,Fake shirt and it's more like a trashy rash gaurd disappointing not even a tag on the back and it's a blurry printing
1.0,I look shorter and heavier with this style of dresses
1.0,The set is beautiful and I looked forward to wearing them. I've worn ear cuffs for years but never had a problem like this. They just don't stay on my ear. I think the wrap portion is too small to hold to the ear.
1.0,"This is not the color I received. The one I got, was light teal. Not green. I ordered a medium. I'm a 6. It was a size zero. So tiny, can't even wear it a little higher, it would be way too short. I'm so disappointed. Gave it to the 10 year old neighbor girl. Not even worth sending it back."
1.0,Returned. What was sent to me was not as pictured. The picture shows adjustable ear bands. What I got was a one piece mask with stretchy pieces to fit over the ears.
1.0,"I was disappointed in the dress, material was thin and they didn't bother to sew in belt loops."
1.0,I hate this product!  The light for viewing the display at night is insufficient.  I can only clearly see the hours digit.<br /><br />Additionally the band is too short.  I don't have an overweight wrist but have to use the 2nd or 3rd notch from the end of the band.  So the strap that holds the unused band does not work well.<br /><br />I intend to look at returning this.
1.0,"The top does not fit,it is very small and it has little to no stretch. The design and color is nice."
1.0,Don't buy if you have a smaller bust. Looked horrible on
1.0,The fit is off. It fits weird.the color is fluorescent. I would not ay $1 for this outfit at a store. poor quality and craftsmanship.
1.0,"I got the pants and while they look similar to photo, after wearing them a few times, I noticed they had a hole in them."
1.0,"Did not like the color (too bright pink, not the muted pink in the photo) or the fit. I ordered a large when I usually wear medium, hoping it would fit loner and looser. But id barely reached mid-hip, and it was very tight. The model in the picture is probably wearing an XL.  And the fabric looked a bit plastic."
1.0,"Muy pequeño para se mediano, y botón venía suelto!! De seguro es de China, pésima calidad"
1.0,Boy oh boy this thing was heavy and fell right off my wrist first day I got it. And I have pretty big wrists for someone my size. The band snapped right off when went to swing my arm and it hit a wall and the pieces went flying everywhere. No wonder it was so cheap.
1.0,"Got these for my Great Grand daughter, she is 8, when we got them they worked fine for about two days,then the left shoe works part time, most of the time not. The right shoe works fine.  would I buy them again, probably, so she will quit crying about them not working right. This would be in hopes the new ones would work right.  I can't send them back because I<br />don't  have the original box."
1.0,i was super excited about this and then it broke a week or two after getting it. I got a replacement but that one broke too
1.0,Love the style and simplicity of this but the ball broke after me putting it on only the 2 nd time. I’ve only had it 48hrs. Very disappointing. Don’t waist your money.
1.0,Not sterling silver! Cheap
1.0,TOO big to wear.
1.0,Its not a quality product.  No quality control was follow when manufactured.  Only the hat has UV protection.  The neck and face cover not.  Not worth the money paid.
1.0,Very poor quality..will not order agian!
1.0,The pattern was printed upsidedown. The mask has a metal nose piece so you cannot wear it upside down! Waste of money
1.0,Waist band rolled within minutes of putting these on. Very disappointing.
1.0,Buttom not glued
1.0,"These are terrible, 3 of the 12 pairs have ripped or had seems falling out after one wear/wash. I would return if I could but I'm past 30 days."
1.0,"The teeth that hold the belt strap into the ratchet ensemble are very sharp and long. So they literally shred the end of the belt. The ratchet and groves work fine, but it is the other side of the belt that you rarely think about that causes problems. I lost my pants twice in a volleyball game thanks to this mis-engineering."
1.0,Right fitting on chest and arms. If sized up would be too big everywhere else
1.0,"Very disappointing.  I have very small wrists, and though the band wasn't too loose, the watch was at least twice as large as I expected it to be.  For a woman's watch it's highly unattractive, as big as any man's watch I've seen."
1.0,What is up with the seam across the front. I don't see that in the picture. Sucks!
1.0,"Not only was the material low quality, but these ran very small."
1.0,Purchase for my daughter who wears an x-small and it's to small. It wasn't tight but it fit like a crop top.
1.0,Good price and pretty. After reading reviews I went way safe cause I wanted it a little big so I ordered a 4X when I normally wear a 2x..unbelievably it was to small.  You would have to order up like 3 sizes up then your normal size. Disappointed.
1.0,These protectors did not work for me. They split open too easily and made my earlobes hurt.
1.0,El diseño y el tamaño muy lindos pero me llego en mal estado estaba sucia y desgastada parecía que había sid usada
1.0,"This product did not hold up for me. I took a long distance flight and it the carry on luggage snapped at the handle. The larger luggage came off the conveyor belt with a broken zipper - my belongings were tossed all over the place. I have only used the medium sized once for a brief trip, it's okay, but I assume the quality will not be great for a longer trip.<br /><br />Purchase at your own risk and be aware of fake reviews for this product."
1.0,Nothing like the picture. I wear size 14 or 16 and the XL was still to small.
1.0,"It was way too much going on, didn't  want to wear it, because I didn't  know how to wear it."
1.0,Thia jacket is made really cheap
1.0,"Doesn't look anything like the pictures.<br />The quality is so poor and bad made.<br />Don't even waste your time or money, comes from China."
1.0,"Absolute trash. I saw a reasonable amount of good reviews so I took the risk but I wish I didn't. It did not fit my face at all and it hurt my nose for a few hours just from trying it on. Don't waste your time, even if it does fit properly I guarantee it will not be comfortable. Definitely returning it and picking a different Halloween Costume."
1.0,"Bummed!<br />Just got these today and they would have been perfect, except they don't match ....."
1.0,The clasp broke on day one. Looks good on picture. poor workmanship
1.0,"The quality of the material is inferior to the 80% cotton Russell sweatshirts I previously purchased.  I recently purchased two of these sweatshirts.  They are 50% cotton.  After wearing and washing them two times, the fabric is covered with ""pilling"" and they already look nasty.  It appears that Russell like so many other manufacturers is more interested in achieving higher profit at the expense of product quality.  I'll never purchase another Russell product."
1.0,It is not that I expected
1.0,100% Polyester. Cheap! Cheap! Material/ fabric.<br />Do not buy.
1.0,After a week the lens feel out they were on my head so by the time I figured it wasn’t sure where to look but they sure are cute
1.0,No authentic Vuarnet protective cover
1.0,"I received an empty box. It is small , square,  and burgundy in color, but there's nothing in it. I was really looking forward to the black pearls."
1.0,Gave these to my adult daughter and within a week the charms fell off. ChubbyChicoCharms is not willing to stand behind their product because I ordered in November for Christmas and their 30 day warranty was past. I don't even feel like the price is all that good. I would not recommend this product.  Additionally one end of the bracelet is open and hooks on clothes all the time.
1.0,not happy a find had to tell me to cut the fit inside of shoe.
1.0,"Very poor quality. Seam turned on one,<br />and hem came out on another."
1.0,I never received the heart pendant.
1.0,Do not fit as described. the straps don't have much support either. Very stretchy strap but the cup area isn't very stretchy.
1.0,"It was way to big and the material felt scratchy and cheap. Ordered for a surgical procedure and didn’t even end up wearing. Decided that I would forgo the ease of buttons to pull a more comfortable article of clothing over my head, stitches and all."
1.0,"Worst wallet I have ever bought. First of all it smelled absolutely terrible when I opened it up, it was embarrassing to even be at the bar with it. Second, the button to clip it shut broke after 7 days. Worst product."
1.0,It's ok than it turn color
1.0,It’s not good quality for the price. The buckle absolutely will not keep the tie around the neck kept in place. It just constantly slips out.  I am super unhappy with this purchase.
1.0,Never got ring
1.0,"It does not look like the picture at all!! The material is like a cold spandex, it’s not cotton and sweater like material at all! The knot in the front looks like a messed up sewing job! I’m very disappointed!"
1.0,I purchased these because they had more cotton content than others. They have no cotton in them at all!
1.0,"On first usage,  the handle you hold onto at the end of the umbrella broke off... great thing to have happen whilst using the umbrella in a downpour.  Buy something else"
1.0,Awful!  Completely sheer.  Even with a slip this wouldn’t look good.  The waist band makes your waist look big.  The material is cheap.  The yellow is more of a bumble bee yellow not a mustard yellow. Everything about it is wrong.
1.0,"This belt looked nice when we first got it, but, our son hasn't even worn it a mo th and the ""leather"" is peeling off and the holes are ripping. I wouldn't recommend this product."
1.0,Complete CRAP!!! I have be diagnosed by an actual optometrist and these glasses made 0 ZERO difference. They are glorified expensive sunglasses. Wore them for a hour... Thats 4x longer then they state for your eyes to adjust. Made zero difference and was a total let down... Will be returning for horrible web discription and product! DO NOT BUY!!!
1.0,these are not the same glasses that are in the description & they are NOT blue block.
1.0,"Unfortunately, yet another tremendous disappointment...Blouses,Toraway Women Casual...once again, I will provide general background: As a mature full-figured woman (5'9&#34;, 160 lbs.) U.S. dress size 10/12 depending upon the designer.  First, the fabric...textured appears to be of outdoor lawn material; the cut does NOT compensate for bustline, shoulder, or back. On the hanger, it`s attractive...but OMGreatness this blouse is horrible. Just simply horrible. Definitely isn't catered to U.S. women dressmakers standards in general. Now I'm extremely hesitant while reading reviews that have been paid for in exchanged for &#34;honest&#34; opinions. AMAZON please recruit more U.S. made manufacturers for women apparels. No more ordering from AMAZON for women's fashions/apparels. BUYER BEWARE!"
1.0,Very cute but they keep falling out of my ears.
1.0,Waaaay too big!!
1.0,"Estoy furiosa, me llego dos veces un producto que no pedi es completamente diferente a lo que ordene definitivamente no vuelbo a comprar a esta compañía !!"
1.0,Not at all as pictured.
1.0,While putting it on the heat fell off. It was a present for my 9 year old daughter. Not happy.
1.0,Not as pictured. Felt like I had on a shee.
1.0,Wore one of these for about a week before it began to be incredibly painful. Took it out to discover that the cheap metal plating was wearing off and turning green. Really disappointed because I loved the look.
1.0,Size n quality problems.  Not recommended for adults.
1.0,Super cheap. Don't waste your time.
1.0,very small chain the picture is deceiving the clasp is great but like many many times larger than the chain
1.0,"I’m 5’7 150, naturally a medium, this was way too short in the torso area, I have a long torso"
1.0,Too frumpy weird fit
1.0,"NO GOOD for starters NO instructions enclosed, video shoes for peraon already fit"
1.0,"This bra was supposed to be a new item, it had no tags, the band is slightly misshapen and the threading is coming undone, I also found a few small pieces of glitter on it."
1.0,This piece looks better in the picture than when you receive it. I returned it.
1.0,Maybe I got a bad one but mines barely lights up very disappointed!
1.0,They rip after the first day of wearing them. They are not good at all and I gave then 1 star
1.0,Was completely see through. Thickness of a cheap napkin.
1.0,I hated it was ugg I threw it away I hated it.
1.0,"I specifically purchased the red racing stripe NATO because of the stripe orientation in the photo. When I received the strap, the stripe was on the wrong side... you may think it's not a big deal, but it is when you purchased the strap because the orientation of the stripe matches that of the red stripe on your watch. This happens too often with these Amazon retailers. Seriously, why can't they manage to take pictures without inverting the image before posting them?"
1.0,3 months in and the top dimpled layer separated (shrunk) from the sole.  Flops are unrepairable and in no way can be reattached to sole. I'm kind of surprised/disappointed that UA has produced such a cheap product as all my other UA clothes are excellent.
1.0,Cedía que era lo mejor pero sólo tiré mi dinero ala basura
1.0,The large fits like a small.
1.0,"This is a knockoff of the Apple Milanese Loop, not the product pictured."
1.0,This bracelet is for a child's wrist.
1.0,"Yesterday this item was delivered and I was upset.<br />There is any tag or information about the cloth, so I suspect whether it is a new or not. I cannot find even any cleaning information one this cloth. Also, it is full of chemical smell, and nobody can wear this cloth.  I am really expected to get this, but I am totally disappointed. Even though I was waited for around one month, it was a shabby cloth. I want to return and get a refund as soon as possible. DO NOT BUY THIS!<br />Thanks."
1.0,I ordered this costume and another one for my boyfriend from this company and they both were too small and when I opened up the packages both costumes were not fully together and the material had become separated from not being sewed together well.
1.0,"Cheap material, product is not shiny like pictured"
1.0,Not embroidered and not cute at all.
1.0,Tarnished after wearing for one whole day
1.0,It was tiny and not able to cuff to my daughters liking.
1.0,"I ordered two little hoops for my baby's ears, what I got was a men's size 11 titanium ring..?!? Hopefully this return is seamless :/"
1.0,"Well, when you slide the picture over, you can notice that there is a different print other than the purple/blue/lightning Ultraviolet jacket. Instead of the Ultraviolet half zip, I recieved the Lagoon Pathon. It's frustrating that the pictures dont match and there was no specification that the cover photo is misleading and the camo pattern names are not well listed in the description."
1.0,This took 2 months to get. The material is shiny it’s awful! I wouldn’t recommend anyone to buy this!
1.0,"I wish I would have read the reviews! Like many of them say, this is not a regular shirt material…. It’s more of a basketball short material or athletics fabric and had a terrible smell. Returning immediately."
1.0,"Cheap, broken in minutes"
1.0,"I liked this belt pretty well when I first got it. I took a few days to figure it out and try it out. In use, it had the one feature I was looking for: the ability to adjust the belt tightness in small increments rather than being forced to tighten 1+ inch just because a standard eyelet belt feels a tiny bit loose.<br />I did notice one inconvenience early on: because of its latching mechanism, the ""tail"" of the belt is inside the main part, making it a bit hard to adjust until you figure out how to do it. (That is not mentioned in the description... surprise!) I managed, but it was not as easy as adjusting the standard belt. So I was Pretty happy with it for a while...<br />Then after a very few days of use/testing, the belt suddenly just popped looser a few inches- the ratchet mechanism became unreliable. I find that it holds OK until the pull reaches some level and then just suddenly loses grip and the belt expands. It happens whether wearing it or lust pulling by hand. That makes it virtually useless... I never know when it will suddenly release. Luckily my pants don't just fall down, but it is not at all convenient in the middle of exercise or whenever. Especially since it must be readjusted by pulling the loose end inside the main loop. So I have written this off as worthless.  Even though its construction seems very sturdy, it is attractive, etc., etc. none of that makes up for simply not working! reliably<br />Unfortunately, I was away from home and missed the return window. Oh well, I ordered it to see how I liked the concept, etc. I love the concept, but not this belt! I also tried another type that so far is working well."
1.0,The hooks that attach the lens to my glasses are too small to fit over the lenses.  I would like to return the two lenses for a refund.
1.0,Had to return. I didn’t like the material and it ran small in size.
1.0,This dress was super cute but definitely oversized. Buy one or two sizes down
1.0,Its like Bus conductor style not a women bag
1.0,It started out well but...  the metal part of the fastener came off.  My daughter luckily found the Fitbit but not the missing fastener.  It's trashed.
1.0,"These are by far the worst of the ""premium"" men's boxer briefs I have worn. The legs are closer to trunk length and ride up constantly, the pouch seems to be off center, and the rise is not nearly high enough. I'll never buy a Saxx product again, there are much better options."
1.0,CHEAP parts.  The pin holding one end together broke the first day.
1.0,The necklace was very pretty but after wearing it for 3 days- it broke. So not very happy with the quality of this chain.
1.0,"This purse is pretty cute, but the appeal of the product quickly diminishes when the handle constantly breaks. They are attached to the outside of the purse with a device similar to a filing folder bracket, so it is not surprising to find they are no match for the weight of a wallet, cellphone, and whatever else you carry in your purse. Come on people; if it is hardly strong enough to secure paper, it’s not going to work for this. It’s almost like they purposely make the product cheaply so you get just enough use for it to not be a total scam product, but it will break frequently enough to make you buy another one sooner than you normally would."
1.0,"Three undershirts arrived in a plain plastic bag. The bag had no labeling. The shirts are stamped &#34;Hanes&#34;, but the unlabeled bag makes me wonder. The shirts looked small when I unpacked them. I just put them in the washer and dryer. They came out even smaller; and so oddly dimensioned. Across the chest, the measurement is 9&#34;; the length is 28&#34;. Who is built like that? Not the handsome man in the photo. I cannot imagine who these would fit. I am not going to bother to return them, but they are not suited for the stated purpose."
1.0,"This is NOT Moldavite as advertised! Returning asap, waste of time, don't do it."
1.0,"0 stars. This is garbage. I know you get what you pay for but you should also get what is advertised and this was falsely advertised. The circles are way bigger, not fused closed, no clasp, metal is very dull."
1.0,Fell out of my ears before I even got out of the house
1.0,Not too happy about this item. It's gorgeous BUT it should have said &#34;I love you mom&#34; and all it says is &#34;I love you&#34;<br />Seems like a gift for a girlfriend NOT a mom!!!!!!
1.0,These are way smaller than is typical for the size I ordered. They are also super short and expose you belly button when you raise your arms up.
1.0,The hoops are really warped. The ends on all of this jewelry is sharp so it hurts putting it through. Just not something I would buy again... Look at where its from maybe that has to do with it? Ugh! Waste of money.
1.0,"Most of them were broken , or snapped very easy"
1.0,Not supportive at all. Waste of money. The shoulder straps never adhered. Did not feel comfortable wearing this to work out at all.
1.0,Received with tear.
1.0,The print is adorable however the fit is tiny. The arms are so tight and the thread is unraveling on all of the seams.
1.0,Too small for a 10 year old kid
1.0,"bought mark for Christmas gift.  bad wire. turns on randomly or not at all. Dustin, purchase."
1.0,Unfortunately it’s falling apart after a month. I have to retie each section daily.
1.0,Did not look or fit at all as expected.
1.0,"Its horrible product,  i want to return it...its like is used.<br />.its all black. Not silver anymore"
1.0,"It looks good in the picture, but when I received them they actually look kind of weird."
1.0,This is a cheap plastic piece of crap.
1.0,Pocket stitching is a failure. You will lose your belongings. Nice fit and great for running. You’ll be running backwards looking for you car keys.
1.0,They run super small and narrow I’ve worn merrells for years but theses got sent back terrible Chinese shoes bought danner instead way more comfortable
1.0,The adjustable strap broke fairly quick after purchase.
1.0,Did not like the fit or material. Looks really cheap.
1.0,"These are less socks and more like panty hose. They also are much smaller than advertised, definitely not for plus sizes. They immediately rolled down and won't stay up at all."
1.0,This product is horrible! I purchased for an event and will not have time to find anything else. I ordered a small and received a dress that was not finished. The zipper was on the inside and sewn incorrectly. There are also holes by the zipper and really awkward puckering. It still had a safety pin in it. It makes the list of most disappointing purchases on Amazon.
1.0,The stone of the ring was defect. It had scartch on the side and stain on it. I found not ok and strange that they still send such a product to customers. I sent the ring back.
1.0,I have used this bag for less than a month and the water bottle pocket is already tearing. Really? Shoddy product
1.0,No fits in hand poor staff
1.0,My grandson more these one day to school and came home and one of the speakers quit working already I return them
1.0,I've only worn this dress once or twice and gently before the threads on the sleeves started to fray. There were actually a few fly-away threads on the dress when it arrived. I wish I had returned it earlier. Overall the quality seems quite poor.
1.0,"The band looks awesome but I’am unable to use it , it will not fit on my Apple Watch 3 42mm it will not latch and secure to the watch."
1.0,"These are the “skinny jeans” of boxer briefs, way too tight."
1.0,"It did not look like the picture. It didn't even have all of the straps! It came with two straps that fit in a v-shape and then the bra shapes were more triangular than as presented in the picture. WTF. I would have returned this if I had remembered to, but instead it just sat around like a lump in my room for awhile. SAD."
1.0,Fits very long for height 5’ 2” and very shiny. Does not look exactly like pictures but still cute. But not for me!!
1.0,Gave to my kid
1.0,its say black stainless steel lava red led digital bracelet watch first off its not black its silver im not happy with this product
1.0,CRAP product. Rusted after taking a shower two times. The jewels fell out and turned green only after a few days. Don’t buy it
1.0,If you are looking for genuine stones..this isn't for you!.<br /> Very disappointed that the beads used are just glass..not sure if the seeds are even real. The necklace does still look nice but definitely loses its value to me so will not be purchasing again from this buyer.
1.0,I had to return it. It’s a sorority mask for young women and it as so big that it stretched from the top of her forehead to the bottom of her neck. Not sure where they got such a huge template.
1.0,It's too small and its not what I wanted.
1.0,"I was disapointed in these. They look cheaply made. The picture makes them look more like cotton, but they are some sort of shiny slick material."
1.0,At first thought it was comfy and gorgeous..now after owning it barely a month it's flaking and looks terrible!
1.0,"These pants were a huge disappointment.  Not only were they way too small (Chinese sizing?  Don't really know), but they were also very poor quality.  I'm returning the ones I purchased."
1.0,On the first daythe bead came off and got lost. Plus they are tiny and poor quality. Steer clear of this item.
1.0,This is made for a child!
1.0,"Conkkrian Dinosaur Mask Headgear - Velociraptor Mask & Tyrannosaurus Rex Mask Bundle, Dinosaur Toys with Opening Moving Jaw (Gray Blue Dinosaur Mask) are the others arriving soon. It says bundle I only received one of them. They better show up. If there was a rating of no stars this would be on of those."
1.0,"this is not an XL. and I agree with another commenter who said the pockets were way to high. The fabric is nice. The top was very small. its going back, and I so wanted to love it."
1.0,This product is cheaply made.
1.0,"I had high hopes for this dress. I have others of this style and love them. I knew it wouldn't be luxurious or anything at this price, but what I received is atrocious. The fabric is extremely thin and shiny, like a terrible Halloween costume. There is a strange seam on the straps that is not in the description and the seams and the straps are very narrow and short. To top it all off, there is a large stain like a oil got dripped on the dress. So incredibly disappointed."
1.0,"it shows you a mustache and it looks pretty good and wearable. I bought 2, it sucks, threre is no way to wear it because its hair on both sides, and its not even hair like, its black cotton balls coarsely shaped like a mustache. the picture is a very misleading picture."
1.0,Nice look but terrible sized!
1.0,Product is too small and it cost a lot to ship back
1.0,Waisted money
1.0,Wore one pair for two days and both broke... beads went all over the place and cannot be fixed...
1.0,"It's too small to be close to thick tights, not a jogger. Please order a larger size."
1.0,Pretty color but very shear. Not what I expected.
1.0,"I only gave these palazzo pants 1 star because the product description listed them as 95% polyester and 5% spandex, BUT when I just checked them, they are in fact 95% rayon and 5% spandex. Now that I've already worn them, if they don't wash well, I'm contacting the seller and Amazon."
1.0,"The one I ordered looks great - however, it did not come with a battery - flipping the switch had no effect. Unfortunate detraction for an otherwise great product."
1.0,The article said Engrave and when I went to engrave the seller said they don't do that!
1.0,Item was too small. I am trying to exchange for a larger size but it’s not allowing me to see any of my order details. So I guess I’m stuck with shorts that don’t fit. Very frustrating. If someone from customer service can reach out to me that would be lovely since that page won’t load on my end. Thank you.
1.0,Material is very cheap. Poorly made.
1.0,These pants wear extremely thin. You could see my son’s underwear
1.0,"I was so happy to give this to my best friend for her birthday, she put it on, and hour later,( only because the bracelet itself was stabbing her in the wrist) she noticed charms were gone. I was so embarrassed and beyond disappointed."
1.0,These are huge. I bought them to replace mine that I had given away.  If I would have started with this set I would not be telling everybody how easy and helpful packing cubes are
1.0,"Plastic, not well made, ill fitting garbage. Would say dollar store glasses but that would offend the dollar store. Would give no stars if I could. Waste of money."
1.0,"I've bought similar socks in the past so I ordered 2 of these 6 packs. I wear a 6.5-7 women's shoe and these are MUCH too small for me to wear comfortably. There is almost no stretch/give whatsoever, they pinch my toes throughout the day and the front begins to rip within a few hours (and this is at a desk job where I am barely even moving around). I literally just took off the pair I was wearing just now and threw them away because my feet were in so much pain from being pinched all day and my toes were sticking out of holes that had ripped in the socks."
1.0,"It is the cheapest material ever, basically halloween constume material, was stained and filthy . no joke :("
1.0,"this dress was sent as a joke, right? like... this was just a demo, and you sent it to me instead of the real dress, right?<br />when the dress first slid out the package, i jumped. the pattern is uglier in person, the fabric is thinner than a picnic napkin, and it didn't fit any part of my body. i don't like to return things, but i will be sending this back ASAP. i'm so mad right now, i'm offended."
1.0,look poor!
1.0,The material is Paper thin and wrinkles easily<br />Wore to the beach out on my bag and when I took it out to put back on it was a wrinkled mess
1.0,😣😭😤 I am a size 00 in womens and I purchased an XS and it could not fit. It ships from China so I just gave it to mu daughter.
1.0,LIKE WALKING ON 2X4 AS A SHOE
1.0,It arrived cracked with the paper sewn into the thread of the material around the border.  Trash!!  I sent it back.
1.0,The dress was too small and the quality was thin. Not true to size. Will not recommend.

1.0,"Terrible gloves. Way too small, way too thin, ugly white logo on side not shown in pictures. I am returning."
1.0,This was delivered broken cuz its too thin at the head of the key. Had to glue it. Disappointed.
1.0,Cheap and thin material. Returned.
1.0,"After just 1 use, the seam started to come apart. I used these for running, so I paid more for a quality pair, but I was disappointed. I bought a pair a couple of years ago that were of much better quality and had more compression."
1.0,Only one board in the middle thought it went around. Not a fan
1.0,"Item arrived with multiple stains all over the front of dress and sleeves. Appears to have been worn several times. Sash was ripped and pinned back on, sash was stained on back of dress."
1.0,Sized for a child!  Extremely small!
1.0,"The gloves came in varying sizes (many were way too small for my 5 year old!). There were also hanging threads on many of them and some were just downright falling apart already. I was very disappointed with the extremely poor quality. My kiddo keeps losing gloves, so I wasn't looking for anything fantastic, but this was ridiculous. I ended up picking up a few cheap pair at Wal-Mart (even cheaper than these) and they were much better quality. I would not recommend these at all!"
1.0,"I ordered a size 5 and recieved a 3T. Very disappointed, I ordered this for a specific reason and now have to go find something else last min and waste more money"
1.0,Chain was knotted when it arrived
1.0,Didn't expect the earrings to be super small. You can barely see the dolphin.
1.0,"I love costume jewelry for many reasons and do know one of the consequences of getting costume jewelry is that they are not going to last. Most will turn your fingers green after a few washes... etc, but these... I didn’t even have them on for 24 hours and a little bit of hand sanitizer my fingers were black. The material is also very cheap feeling and one came bent. Didn’t know that until after the packaging was in the trash. So, just don’t buy these. End of story."
1.0,Only washed once and the seam in the crotch split open. Looks like it wasn’t sewn well enough.
1.0,"Cheap,cheap, cheap,cheap, cheap, cheap cheap!  This dress is made terribly!  I knew as as I looked at it through the see through package that it was going back. No ones going to mind you in this dress if you're at a Halloween party. Anywhere where else you're just going to look like you can't afford to be there...<br />Whew chile!"
1.0,"It was hard to attach this clip-on to my glasses, and the clip mechanism is partially blocking my field of vision."
1.0,"Color of Ballet Pink was so dull. I ordered a Size 8, fit like a Size 6. Sleeve of jacket sewn different than other side. Keep falling off my shoulder. Took a month to receive shipment. I did get my money back without a hitch. Grateful for that. Awful dress."
1.0,I wish I could give this less than one star!!!! this product is horrible!!!! it does not stick &I was on a ride it's the theme park with a halter top on and the thing flew off of my body!!! in the air and I lost my bra horrible!!!!! I wish I could got my money back!
1.0,Terrible!! The chain was too thick.
1.0,"Loved it, until it broke after a couple weeks of use. Not worth the money for the quality."
1.0,Don’t hold the magnetic lash
1.0,Horribly made.  Do not buy
1.0,Battery died after 1 month.
1.0,Cheap do not buy falls apart...
1.0,Never received
1.0,They run very small.. too tight and too short
1.0,The HDCAFTER sunglasses is poor quality does not deserve the paid price at all I recommend not to pay more than 4 US dollar for it
1.0,Looks like cheap costume jewelry. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"First of all, 99% sure somebody wore this and returned it.  It was wadded up in the bag when it came and there was strands of blonde hair and other crusty stuff on there, as well as animal hair.  It also had little wrinkles up the back like it had been sat in but no d. O. Marks so who knows.  In addition to that, it's a bit snug and very staticky, will need a slip or shape wear.  I am by no means fat but it clung to my gut and outlined my who ha so that was pleasant.  Def returning"
1.0,"My daughter gave this to me for Mother's Day and after wearing it for 10 minutes, the clasp completely broke off. I am heartbroken as will she be if she finds out it broke."
1.0,Very cheaply made.<br />Thin Fabric.<br />Came in a bag with no tag or construction label.<br />No way to differentiate the front of the garment from the back.<br />Boxy shape with no attention to the female figure.<br />Not worth money.<br />Save your time.
1.0,This is meant to be worn by a very tall woman! I am 5'3&#34; and it went past my knees. Very disappointing.
1.0,Definitely not the boots in the picture...flowers look horrible...spend the money on brand name boots
1.0,"The first one I opened came in torn, the others seemed to be ok but extremely poor quality. They dont stay in place and are very thin."
1.0,"Shoes is very thin, like the ones you can purchase at the dollar store. Sold as “cloud” shoes which implies its thick sole and feels like you are walking on clouds. Misleading and bait and switch."
1.0,Band looks great very durable but the size was completely off it is way too small even after measuring to the size chart.
1.0,DO NOT buy this dress.  The fabric is cheap swimsuit fabric and the top party is bright silver GLUED ON GLITTER.  Not like the picture AT ALL.
1.0,"Not good quality, looks cheap, although the design is nice, plus they sent the wrong size. Does not look like the picture."
1.0,How in the world did this get 4 stars? That just blows my mind! I regret not reading the reviews before purchasing! The scarf looked like it was made from cheap t-shirt material and they had just chopped them off with scissors. It's not even  hemmed!!!  Smh... 
1.0,Looks good. Lasts about a day. Beware. Tears easily. Sash comes off. Pearls fall off.
1.0,Came falling apart
1.0,It's very small. returned
1.0,Way too small. Better re check your size chart!
1.0,It's look good but it's came broken so I didn't have chance to veret
1.0,Too small for what I needed it for
1.0,Its not jade. Description was false
1.0,"The straps on this purse fell apart after only one month, not well-made at all ."
1.0,Looks very cheap not detailed
1.0,Did not look at all like the pictures. Don't buy this!
1.0,It’s too big and the vendor needs to make an extra small. It’s all about the shoulder straps . They don’t hold my boobs up like I want them to. And the private area hangs. Trust and believe the reviews.🥲
1.0,this item is too big in certain places like the chest. not my favorite. also certain parts of the fabric are threading before it was even washed.
1.0,The clasps and adjustments have rust on them meaning they have the potential to ruin and stain other clothing.
1.0,"First picture is one day of use. 2nd picture not even week ,only 4days.<br /><br />I work at retail grocery store as stocker! I thought these would last longer then they did. I don't work in construction or heavy duty work in a warehouse or something.<br /><br />A grocery store, don't buy these. They are cheap won't last."
1.0,"As described by other reviewers, the magnet embedded in the case sends the phone to sleep as soon as it is unlocked (I use screen lock). The phone will not even allow an emergency call while in the case. Unless you are willing to install a &#34;Magnet Sensor Deactivating&#34; Android module which is not developed by Motorola, and is not guaranteed to fix your problem, DON'T BUY THIS CASE."
1.0,Chain was already broken when I received it.
1.0,Bad ítem quality
1.0,"Unfortunately, this was way too small. I wear a large and this was like a small one. I ended up throwing it away as I did not want to take the time to return it, too much of a hassle for me. Now they only have a size small so there is no way I can order a larger size."
1.0,WAS NOT NEW IN BOX..REQUESTED REFUND
1.0,Put the coat on once and when I bent down to grab something the zipper broke down by my knees. I really wish the zipper was better quality because I really liked the coat. I felt beautiful which is not what I usually feel like in a coat. Returned it bought a different coat.
1.0,"I really like color but the material is very thin and seems cheap. The part around the wrist has stretched out after wearing it one time. It also fit much larger than my other Adidas shirts, so I question if this really is an Adidas shirt. I regret spending this much on such a poorly made shirt."
1.0,"I bought 2 pairs of these back to back , one as a gift , as I was so happy with them received so many compliments when i first received them. Within the first week the back piece ball had broken off , then the one I gave as gift the same thing happened. They can still be worn but extremely disappointed that the back pieces broke so easily. Will not recommend this purchase for the price"
1.0,"This dress has an awkward neckline, breast seams by the top of the dress and a waste that doesn't fit anywhere near your waist. The underskirt is also 3"" shorter then the lace overlay. To day the sewer needs anatomically correct positions for patterns is an understatement."
1.0,looks like rubber inside...which makes this band insanely overpriced. I would not recommend it.
1.0,The magnet is bulky
1.0,So flimsy the color looks pink and just overall horrible quality save your money!
1.0,Horrible bad material
1.0,Broke in 2days
1.0,"This item looked cute and we'll finished but not when it arrived. It was tiny, unpolished and filed properly. A great disappointment after eagerly awaiting it for my dog lover neighbors daughter's birthday.  The price I get it was very low $5.00 I think??? But would prefer to pay more to get more. Would not recommend from this company to anyone at any price. You either make something right and ask a fair price or move on but not 3rd rate finish😔"
1.0,Received as a birthday present and doesn't work.
1.0,"This tunic top does not run true to size. It runs large. Sadly, I was forced to return it. However, I plan on rebuying this top on size Medium. My original purchase was an XL."
1.0,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED! This sweater took much longer than anticipated and doesn’t really look like the picture. The color is much darker and the fit is terrible. I was very excited for this. Too much money to return it. Ugh!!
1.0,Utter junk!  The clasp attached to the purse broke the first day I used this.  The cardholders are very small and barely fit a credit card.  Do not buy.
1.0,"The shirt I recieved was a made in China knock-off sent from a third party in China not Triumph. The color is heather not gray. The shirt is extremely thin material and the printing is blurry at the edges not sharp. The collar seems large and stretched out. Also a large sewing flaw in the seam under the right arm. This is definately not the product that is pictured that clearly has the Triumph clothing tag at the neck, mine said Hiclol. Would not recommend to anyone looking for good high quality authentic Triumph wear."
1.0,"Really bummed out. The socks are close to what I was looking for. Fit very nicely, warm on the pad of the foot (though I was hoping for all over warmth). But the reason for the 1 star is because after one use, I have a hole in not one, but two separate pairs of socks. Right on the seam. :("
1.0,The flowers are a weird vinyl not what I expected
1.0,this is just overpriced. i used to use black magic no scrub and it gives better results than this
1.0,Bottom fit perfect. Top triangles were sewn sideways.
1.0,"They don’t tell you the ENTIRE BAND is velcro, so whatever color you get, most of the band SEEN will be black velcro. If you have sensitive skin like I do, it’s very scratchy."
1.0,"Was way to small, fit around the waist but gave me a serious weggie. Also the strap popped off as soon as I tried it on, like only one stitch was holding it together. I'm 5'8 and 170 lbs and ordered the XL when I normally wear L and it still didn't fit."
1.0,Doesnt stay in the nose at all. The chain is way too big. Very cheap quality.
1.0,Not only did it take weeks to come! But arrived and dont work not even one use out of it...very disappointed 4 yr old.
1.0,Cheaply made; chemical smell that hits you as soon as you open the bag.  returned shoes.
1.0,Cheap flexible band is uncomfortable.  Won't be using
1.0,"The graphic design is fantastic, the engineering is horrible. The nose metal in fabric is not secured, so it constantly moves, repositioning it is hard. NOT OK. The ear straps broke after one use"
1.0,I haven't been this disappointed in a bathing suit in a very long time.  The stitching for the gathers is cheap causing it to be incredibly abrasive and itchy.  There is boning off under the arms that serves no purpose I can see and it digs in and is actually painful.  It looked okay but I was completely uncomfortable and could not wait to get back from the beach to take it off.  I will not be wearing it again!  Really unhappy with this suit!
1.0,This was a very low quality skirt. I returned it.
1.0,sent it back. cheap polyester
1.0,Terrible. Scratched and doesn't work. I installed two of my own batteries and they got stuck in there.
1.0,The shirt I received does not match the picture.
1.0,Broke the first day of wearing it
1.0,When we received these they stunk so bad we had to take them outside to air them out.
1.0,"Way to big, and even when adjusted it looks like a mushroom on my head. The inside headband is coated with micro fiber but it was not worth it"
1.0,Poor tolerances means it has zero tension and doesn't stay closed. It opens immediately after being closed. I'll see if they will send me another one. Maybe I got a bad one and the others work as designed.
1.0,Looks like a childrends toys glasses..
1.0,Very thin material and very short barely covered my bottom. Not worth the buy.
1.0,"Well i cannot really write a product review for this watch because, although i ordered it i recieved a watch that was not even close to being worth the twenty two dollars and ninety-nine cents i paid for it."
1.0,"Cheap, lumpy, very disappointing."
1.0,I received an open and empty envelope. Please resend earrings. Thank you.
1.0,I lost my $150 key fob. It slipped off of this. Really bad design.
1.0,"They look good, but...the rubber sole is much stiffer than expected. The rib of the back of the heel is a little uncomfortable and digs into your heel a bit. They were only 30 bucks, so I guess it’s not a complete loss."
1.0,"This turtle neck is WAY too small. Order 2-3 sizes larger if you want this, otherwise it will be a muscle shirt on you & the arms will be short"
1.0,Too small. Thin denim material. Sizing chart is off - I measured before ordering and they do not fit according to their specs provided. Barely any stretch to them and they are most definitely not high rise. Didn't even fully cover my rear. Return/Refund requested.
1.0,"Cute,but not the one I ordered!:("
1.0,Shoe left cut on my foot after a 10 minute walk. Terrible
1.0,The size chart was completely off by about 4 sizes!
1.0,"I purchased this as a gift.  I tapped it on but, I couldn’t turn it off.  Even when I returned it the light was still on.  Also, it was not the bright in a bag.  If interested, buy the smaller one which works perfectly and it’s very bright.  Kept it."
1.0,"Poor quality, terrible sewing work. I didnt even wear it once."
1.0,Damaged out of the box. Not real leather as advertised. Smelled like plastic. Returned added little more money and got real leather bag.
1.0,"This was a cute top, on screen.  It did say to order up a size.  I usually (used to) wear a XL in tees.  I ordered the largest one they had and it barely fit over my head, let alone over my shoulders or further.<br />Skip this item unless you are teeny tiny."
1.0,"Cheaply made. Bridge piece for nose not length of mask,therefore slides side to side and does not seal around nose."
1.0,They look like crap and feel even worse.
1.0,The pins were not the ones shown.  They were all of very young kids movies and my kids were very disappointed.  I contacted seller and did not get a reply.
1.0,Hat arrived bent out of shape and has not regained proper shape no matter how much it is worn. Don't waste your time/money.
1.0,"The clasp broke after the first use making the necklace completely worthless.<br /><br />I had to throw it away because I couldn't fix the clasp. Complete waste of money, do not buy."
1.0,Pretty for about a week -Broke within 3 months. Kinks and does not straighten out.
1.0,The flimsiest piece of clothing I've ever received. A piece of Kleenex would cover more. Gave it away.
1.0,More of a large baggy pink nightgown. I sent it back.
1.0,"These are SO cute and fit great. How we, they don't work. After charging them, one is stuck on green and will not turn off, change color or charge. We have had them for 12 hours."
1.0,"The top portion material was cheap and even though it was black, you could see the bra straight through. Also The length was weird."
1.0,Was very small. size not as shown
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:2d6054211d81faf66be9dcf535a60240]] i ordered these because i wanted looser jeans to help me look more masculine and cope with my mild dysphoria. what arrived were high waisted skinny jeans. they’re stretchy but not loose.<br />edited to add that there are squares of fabric glued under some of the rips. hardly any glue used and o was able to easily remove. hard residue but so much more comfortable. especially after washing. still not worth it unless you want skinny jeans.<br />(my waist is 30”, my thighs are each 23”, and hips 43” and i ordered a size 10)"
1.0,"These seemed great when I got them except for a pull in the fabric, like a knot. On the fourth wear, the zipper broke. Very disappointing."
1.0,"took forever to arrive (from China), cheap looking and going to return it"
1.0,"The quality is poor, the product color is not pretty and loose. It really didnt meet my expectations"
1.0,I was very unhappy with this too. It’s not at all like the picture shows. It shows it tucked into the model and it was definitely more like a crop top. This was a waste of money and I would suggest finding another black top. It was very cheap material as well. I ended up giving it to a friend.
1.0,Son bastantes pequeños
1.0,"As a repeat purchaser of this brand, I was shocked and extremely disappointed in the new fabric they are now using. The Seige that I received today, was the cheap “slick” fabric that is not in the description or images as advertised. They are no longer a great matte, high-quality legging. What a shame, because I bought these several times. Off to a reliable, reputable brand now, which Hawthorn no longer is."
1.0,Bought a 3XL and it's more like a medium
1.0,"The dress is really cute. But it is not white!! The cape is white,but the dress is like a off white or cream looking color."
1.0,"This came in a shrink wrapped packaged that had a very odd odor. It’s super thin, looks nothing like the photo. I’m sending it back."
1.0,Horrible quality. The tail is tiny & my daughter actually thought I accidentally bought her a rats tail. I am so disappointed in this item!!
1.0,"Sizing is off, the seller is somewhat problematic accepting returns so i just never returned. But I cant wear it, is too small despite of buying 2 sizes up."
1.0,Underwires came out pretty quickly
1.0,"These were originally described as sterling silver.. they now say something different. They tarnished almost immediately. Get what you pay for, right?"
1.0,Will be returning! The clothes had a nasty small! It’s really poor quality and way to small  nothing but cheap China clothing!
1.0,This was uncomfortable so I returned it. The ring that holds the gem hurt my belly button.
1.0,"Ordered 2, didn't realize the rods just sit on a stem. One was missing parts and the other would not even screw together. Could not even make one decent hanger out of the two."
1.0,Horrible product.  Ordered extra small and there was absolutely no support or control.
1.0,Very itchy even after wash…Waste of money
1.0,This product was made in China as a result it is about 3 sizes to small. This was to be a Christmas gift for my daughter. If I could give it a negative star rating I would.
1.0,Very disappointed in size and I order 2
1.0,I even ordered up sizes.. This is for a person who weights under 100 lbs.
1.0,"These stretch out, and do not return to the expected fit after washing. Because of the stretch they don't stay up. I should've returned these, but I never got around to it. I would not recommend. I was really looking forward to some good leg warmers, too."
1.0,So large in the shoulder area I have never warn it
1.0,"Ridiculous sizing, way too small.  They'd be great shorts otherwise.  Yes, I used the sizing chart."
1.0,These are cheap trash. Do not recommend.
1.0,"It felt as if the seamstress was sewing blind...no pattern, no measurements, just randomly choosing material to sew together.  The split was more like a gape...almost all of the bottom section dragged the floor.  The material was thinner than expected, and was not flattering, especially in the bust.<br /><br />I returned it directly after trying on the dress."
1.0,"Fabric HORRIBLE, it is slippery and very synthetic.  NO WAY THESE ARE 78% COTTON, guessing no cotton.  Picture is not at all accurate, not the color (black with white detail) or even close in pattern (No bottom dandelion and the floating parts are a fuzzy looking pic).  In fact, the picture is of a pair of socks I baught years ago and loved, and I was hoping I was repurchasing.  These are not even close.<br /><br />I am hoping for good customer response in returning them for a full refund!  I will update if they do, so if it still says this then the customer service didn't go well."
1.0,Does not fit as expected! I'm pretty short and these pants were highwaters on me. I'm very disappointed.
1.0,This was not the socks that were pictured on Amazon. They are not as thick as others. I was not satisfied with the quality.
1.0,Two holes after one wash. I really liked it the one time I got to wear it. So disappointed.
1.0,"Material is a cheap plastic feel and tends to stick together., I wouldn't recommend it."
1.0,Do not like product
1.0,These do not stay in.
1.0,Although they do fit nicely on my Pandora bracelet these clips were very cheap looking and were NOT sterling silver like the advertisement suggests. Overall I am completely dissatisfied with them.
1.0,Product is way too small. The sizing is not what we are used to in U.S. I ordered XL and it's about a size 10 American sizing. Read the fine print carefully before buying.
1.0,"I'm a 5'2 woman, 110, and this robe is almost too small for me. So it is misleading when it says men's. The sleeves are not long, they come half way down my arms and the inside of the robe is itchy. You get what u pay for. I'll probably donate it and spend a bit more on something softer and thicker."
1.0,"Too small...the buttons do not unbutton, they are merely a &#34;decoration&#34;"
1.0,"I'm 5'10'' with a high waist line and longer legs.  I can usually get away with regular length in my size.  These jogging pants were right at my ankle if not above, and all I could think of, was once I wash these they will shrink and become flood pants that will never get worn. So i'm deciding to sent them back."
1.0,Metal was bent and cheaply made. The fabric of the earrings were cute. Just not durable.
1.0,Returned Item
1.0,Way way way too big and I got a medium
1.0,Armholes vit unevenly.  Will be returning product. Color was nice
1.0,42C was WAY TOO SMALL. it fit my daughter who is a 38A. *
1.0,This was incredibly ugly in person and terrible quality (I actually threw it away instead of returning or donating)
1.0,"I USE BIG LETTERS TO SEE WHAT I AM WRITING I AM NOT SHOUTING<br /><br />I LOVE THE COLORS ON ALL 6<br />BUT I GIVE THEM A 1 BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO TAGS ON HOW TO WASH THEM<br />SO I GOT ON THE AMAZON APP GOT INTO MY ORDERS FOUND THEM THERE CLICKED ON THEM SCROLLED DOWN TO LOOK ON HOW TO WASH THEM<br />WASH IN COLD WATER,  I PUT THEM ON DELICATE, HANG DRY OR HAND WASH<br />THEY GOT STRETCHED OUT WON'T STAY ON MY NOSE THE STRAPS WON'T STAY ON MY EARS NOW<br />FOR $25.99 THEY SHOULD BE BETTER MATERIAL AND WASH INSTRUCTIONS IN THE PACKAGE"
1.0,Order up. Looks like kid sized
1.0,"Poor quality , see through pants"
1.0,the waist fit good but the length was 5 inches too long and the top part was way too big and heavy .
1.0,Didn't get the right fit in this for 2xl fits very close
1.0,"Garment not as described; runs too small.  XXL (China) = M (U.S.)  No size chart to explain the difference.  ""Memela"" aka ""huaquyuedu"" is the Seller.  I had to pay $15.23 for postage on an item that was $24.92.  I had to use Seller's authorization label which directed package to UPS, at UPS rates that are NOT REFUNDABLE.  NO RECOURSE to Amazon with regard to this.  No phone option available.  Chat/online options are closed-door.  YOU ARE STUCK with this HIGHLY UNSATISFACTORY situation.  Shame on Amazon.  I overpaid $9.24 on this.  Don't purchase from this Seller.  You are on your own."
1.0,The letter was huge . I thought it would be more of a dainty necklace . Too long and too large of a letter 😒
1.0,"Not sure if they are cheap or had a ruff road to me, but they arrived in pieces and broken. Sucks"
1.0,Poor quality . The stone was lose and it was too small for my nose piercing.
1.0,Makes my feet smell really bad due to the material
1.0,The product description currently says &#34;One Size Fits Most Girls 4 to 7 years old&#34;. This is most definitely not true. This jacket will not fit any child over 4 years old. Amazon needs to fix the product page.
1.0,Returned right away not comfy and don’t stay up well color was not as expected.
1.0,Size xxl doesn't fit a size 12. Pretty blouse but I recommend against buying.
1.0,I’m so disappointed! I think it’s a counterfeit charm. Disney Pandora charms are supposed to have a copyright symbol in front of the name Disney. This charm does not. I did not receive a receipt w/my purchase so I don’t know how I’m supposed to return it.
1.0,No good .only one day battery.<br />Can't leave at home 2day .<br />Dose not work
1.0,It came in awful conditions
1.0,"Por la categoría y por la foto, se supone que es de hombre, enviaron uno de mujer, lo regale y mejor compre uno en persona. Producto te miente en lo que compras."
1.0,"The holes are too far apart making it difficult to get a good and proper fit. I would say it’s really cheap, but since it was really cheap, that wouldn’t be fair. In hindsight, I wish I would have put about 5 more bucks toward a better belt. I don’t see myself wearing this one."
1.0,"Poor quality. Once put on, the image is so stretched you can’t tell what it is. The material is exceptionally cheap quality."
1.0,"Just received today, stone is scratched and the entire broach part had come attached from the choker.  It looked like it had been attached by hot glue or something.  I have glued it back to wear for a halloween event, but will throw it away afterward.  I would not waste my money on this, it is not worth the money."
1.0,Definitely not for bodybuilding. More like running.
1.0,"First... It was delivered and left leaning on a railroad tie halfway up my driveway, i actually noticed it by mistake several days after it was delivered. Secondly... When i opened the box it was immediately apparent that it was broken, it looked like someone had latched it closed and then pulled it apart. Seperating the connection and the wires for it to be turned on and lit up, it will not latch to be worn. I'm very disappointed. However the raven skulls are solid and made well."
1.0,Wrong color gold. Trying to match prom dress that’s it
1.0,Ripped the first day I wore it
1.0,The deer print on the front of the shirt was defective. The white is peeled up off the shirt and attached to itself.
1.0,"Just for reference I am 5'2"" weigh about 160 Lbs and wear a 36B. Going by their sizing chart I ordered a Small. Out of the package the shirt looked okay, but felt like spandex. Putting it on was a huge disappointment. It fit okay through the chest, which I was expecting it to be a bit big and it wasn't. But through the stomach it was so tight that it looked just awful. The pictures make it look like it stays one size from the top of the torso to the bottom, it DOES NOT, it actually tapers way down in size. Judging by how tight it was, I would have had to purchase the largest size in hopes that it would fit but didn't like it enough to go through the trouble so I returned for a refund."
1.0,"The shirt was defective.  It was so short in the front that my little 3 year old girl's belly hung out.  My girl is tiny, 29 lbs.  Clearly this was a manufacturing defect.  Otherwise it would have been cute.  Sent back and found something else."
1.0,Just over all horrible boobs don’t hold up and are not meant for big chested people !
1.0,When I opened the snap it immediately broke.  Cute but fastener is useless.
1.0,Terrible. Imagine the shock we had when we opened the package to see pink.
1.0,Belt was defective..I contacted the Manufacturer and they promptly answered with way to fix the problem. It didn't work and they then said it was defective and I would need to contact Amazon for a replacement as I bought it from them. Haven't had time to do so.
1.0,"These are comfortable but not true to size, I wear a medium large and the large was very tight<br />They also collect every bit or fuzz pet hair etc so you’re cleaning them all day"
1.0,Designs on socks leave imprints on legs
1.0,"The straps worked great for ensuring that the luggage stayed together...I guess. However, the snaps only lasted three trips before the cheap plastic broke apart, leaving it useless. The straps had also already begun to fray. Given that I’ve flown hundreds of times without needing one of these, I don’t think I’ll bother to purchase another one."
1.0,Fui estafada jamas me enviaron el producto o nunca llego al destino
1.0,"More of a very cheap dollar store ring, at the time I thought this was a real onyx ring."
1.0,"Nothing like the photo, nothing"
1.0,"Came as a t-shirt instead of long-sleeve. I needed it that day, so disappointed."
1.0,My ear became red and infected. Not hypoallergenic!
1.0,"Loved the concept.. but the bracelet is not stainless steal.. not sure what metal it is but after 2 weeks of wearing it, it left a green ring on my wrist wich means its not all stainless.. i do not wear fake jewelry so this was very upsetting to see ... change your description no one els gets screwed"
1.0,The boots ran a little too big even with socks. Quality is ok. The return policy was not clear.
1.0,Sizing is totally inaccurate.
1.0,Don’t bother!
