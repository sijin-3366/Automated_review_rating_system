rating,review
3.0,"material is not what I expected and too small. I take a size medium, bought large and still did not fit right. I suspect you would need to order 2 times larger to be a comfortable fit."
3.0,"I love this dress, and I usually wear a medium in Patty Boutik, but this runs uncharacteristically small. I wish I had tried it on before taking the tags off because I would have exchanged it for the large :-("
3.0,"PITA to work with. Had to file and cut to make it easier to clip on. Good idea, but too tight."
3.0,I was so excited to get them but first time wearing them just moving around caused them to turn and and weight by the magnet opens them causing them to fall off.
3.0,Dress is cute. Was missing the badge and stickers
3.0,We had to return them and couldn’t find them in a smaller size.
3.0,Liked the shoes. Have other Rockports like this in different colors. But this one the right shoe slopped on my foot. What happen? Was it previously worn? Was it the sample shoe? Was it mismarked?
3.0,Cute sweater but runs big. The sleeves are really long.
3.0,"Eh, mixed feelings.  Just walking around it was fine, within 10 mins the elastic around belly button just crumbled up, down near belt line and I was left with a pair of compression shorts.  5'9 200lbs, small beer belly, ordered large.  Perhaps I'll try medium."
3.0,The material and pattern are of good quality. However the XL was too form fitting for what I needed. I am 5'9 and 180lbs and an hourglass shape. Sizes run very small. I am returning.
3.0,Very cheaply made. Not what I expected. But I will use it until it wears out....
3.0,I wasn’t wild about these glasses. They were very loose on my head and I have an average sized head. I like that it came with a nice case and a lense cloth. I was hoping that the glasses fit a little snugger but they have the grip on the sides that helps
3.0,I bought this because it looked cute but it was a little too large a fot
3.0,Made in China. American by birth and support jobs in our country.  Just my feelings on this. God Bless America.
3.0,"I paid a good price for these and they are pretty and they hang just the right way. What I didn't like was that one of the clips was a little fragile and cheap. It hasn't broken. Yet. But now that I know what to look for, I will take extra care with it. I really do like the style. I think it could be better with sterling silver clips. And yes, I would pay more for that."
3.0,Way too small on the waist! but the upper part fit like a charm! 3 stars on appearance but I won't be buying again.
3.0,"Everything about this glasses is good, but they're just a little too small for my face. I got them as a Christas gift, I just wish they were bigger.<br /><br />The lenses are of good quality."
3.0,Don't always seal on the sides.
3.0,The pockets are up high and it is an awkward placement. One of the pockets had not been stitched correctly and had a hole in it. I liked the sleeves and the high neck. The material was not too thin.
3.0,"The fit is a little big, and the top portion of the dress did not sit right on me. With a little sewing and few alterations I was able to make it fit correctly."
3.0,They were a little flimsy compared to the ones I had previously purchased at a fabric store.
3.0,Kind of hard on my feet.
3.0,"The colors are GREAT and they seem to be well made, but they are too narrow for my 8 y/o.  He's got a very normal foot and hasn't had trouble with athletic shoes before and he plays a lot of sports.  But, he complained about how they hurt his foot within an hour of wearing them and he went back to his old pair of Nike (which was unacceptable, by the way).  I first told him that he needed to wear them and stretch them out.  After a few days and a few questions, the shoes are too narrow for him and we won't buy this brand again without trying them on at the store."
3.0,This color wave goes perfectly with some cute white vans but.... it runs super big! I had to return for a smaller size. It is cute though if you like tie dye.
3.0,"The front of the &#34;sweater&#34; was way shorter than the back, fit like a crop top. Material was super thin whereas I wouldnt categorize it was a sweater."
3.0,I've used the pants on two long rides in rain and sub 40 degree temps so far. Love the pants and protection. Think they could have used a heavier zipper in the front as it is a thin version and easily and frequently gets hung up in the fabric. Which is the reason for only 3 stars given the price.
3.0,It's ok.  Little spendy for a ball cap.
3.0,I expected a little more sag on the neckline. I ordered a size larger just in case and though the dress falls great the neck did not slouch the way the pic shows so I had to adjust the fabric. Not too happy with that.
3.0,Looks good but doesn't fit my small wrest :(
3.0,I like the purse but the part that holds the phone is snug so it’s difficult to remove the phone quickly. I also think the compartments are slim and not roomy. I wanted room for chapstick and glasses. I used scissors to remove two of the dividers and used a seam ripper to remove two of the ID window pockets. Now it’s more spacious and I can remove the phone easily. Much better!
3.0,Love the look but broke after about 4 uses
3.0,Very soft and comfortable. However the straps are very loose which makes your boobs kinda sag if you have mom boobs like me lol. But very cute!
3.0,This is not a soft robe. But is is large and provides full coverage. Seems like it will last a very long time.
3.0,"The wave is bigger than depicted in the picture. I have average size arms. This is a cute bracelet, however it does not look natural on my wrist. There is no adjustment and it is very loose on my wrist. It appears that this is exactly the same size as the necklace that I bought to match. Would be better if smaller and/or curved. Update: great customer service response on my review. They really care about their product and this I really appreciate as I don’t get that sort of response often."
3.0,The top button did not align with the top button hole leaving a gap between the buttons. Other than that it is a cute shirt that fit just a tad bit looser than I thought that it would.
3.0,Disappointed with fabric. Was expecting cotton
3.0,"Wasn't impressed, hard to screw the end in! They're ok!!"
3.0,They are smaller than expected could not fit earlobe think either kids earrings or top of ear
3.0,"One pair was comfortable in the waist/seat part, but the other pair seem shorter in that area and snugger than desired. No weight gain on my part but the stated size should have allowed for more movement in the waist/butt area than it does.  I washed them on ""cool"" and did NOT dry in dryer but on an outdoor line.  No length shortage.  I had hoped for more ""room"" with these pants.  Quite soft flannel is a plus."
3.0,"They're just as pictured, so super cute. But they do nothing in terms of shading ones eyes - so they're not super good for sunny days!"
3.0,THE QUALITY JUST WASN'T THERE
3.0,This is such a cute suit! The first time I wore it I loved it! But after the first time I wore it now all the wires and bending weird and poking out on the sides which is a very unflattering look. It also doesn't have very much support in the bust.
3.0,"It does not come with &#34;jewels&#34;. Luckily, I had some in a craft box and was able to glue some on."
3.0,I would've given this a 5 star if the little charm held it's design. The charm's paint got dirty easy and the design was removed as soon as i removed from my pocket when i first got it. It cuts well but leaves grooves on whatever you cut. But over all a good bandage scissor. I got it for a friend with another design and he liked it.
3.0,"Very cute, but very small! Definitely not worth $20 for how small and the quality of the bag. Will be returning for something bigger and sturdier."
3.0,This shirt is very nice but way too small.
3.0,arrived on time nice quality and thickness. too small. colors as pictured
3.0,Fabric material is so thin and don’t feel warm.  The bun is socks feel comfortable and warm but why not the pants? I don’t mind pay more for a truly warm pant for winter.
3.0,"It's pretty; not fond of the fabric, sizes run small."
3.0,Had to send back because product was way too large
3.0,"In ordered a large and the packaging said large however the tag inside the shirt said medium. Obviously the shirt did not fit me. Aside from that my honest product review, the material is super thin but felt soft, wasn’t hard or scratchy. The white color, in my opinion isn’t a true white. It has a creamy tone. The white is also see through. However as another reviewer mentioned if you wear a beige or tan bra is isn’t noticeable. Can’t comment as to the fit."
3.0,The colors were vibrant and item was as expected.  However it was WAY too big.  I ordered a small and it hung off of me.  It’s really a cute dress it just was way too big and no smaller size were offered.
3.0,"I purchased this bag to use for football season as opposed to the larger one I've used the last couple of years. It was made really well, and the leather trim was awesome for the price of the product. However, I had to send it back. The zipper, while really heavy and nice, would only zip to the halfway mark and no further. I worked with it over and over as well as on several different occasions, hoping that, at some point I would be able to get to zip completely closed. But it never would. Not sure why it was defective, but because it would only zip halfway, I was afraid of losing something out of the top of the bag when I wasn't looking. I really wish the zipper would have worked as it should have because this was a really cute bag for the price and seemed to be extremely durable for the size and price. Hoping it was a fluke with just this one bag....otherwise I would recommend this bag with no hesitancy."
3.0,Looked nice but way too small for me (I'm a 38d normally but a little bigger due to pregnancy).
3.0,for the price i would have to say... meh.
3.0,"I feel disengenous writing a review for this product, because it was honestly too tight all the way around for me to wear.  At the time I was about 165 lbs, and the large was just too small.  I just wanted to share that sizing tip.  Everything else seemed well built, with all stitching in place and looking strong.  I wasn't able to wear it, so I can't comment on its suitability for its purpose."
3.0,Silver wore off after a few weeks of constant wear.
3.0,The tank top fit well except it is extremely long.
3.0,Had to send back because it was to big. Better fit for a man
3.0,"Nice, but very light. The first day got them stones fell out, works nights have not had time to send them back. But you get what you pay for. There for the money not bad"
3.0,"These socks are cute and very comfy, and so far have held up well through washing (washed maybe 6 times since purchasing).  However, they're REALLY big and floppy, and the socks don't stay up well around my calves.  I wear a size 6 shoe (women's), and these socks are *extremely* roomy around the foot-portion, especially around the toe, to the extent that they're a little dangerous to walk around in, frankly.  The gripper-dots on the bottom definitely help, but I still have to be somewhat careful not to trip over all the extra fabric flopping around.  These are definitely slipper-socks, not regular socks; they don't cling to your feet at all (at least if you have small-ish feet), and I can't imagine trying to shove these in shoes."
3.0,"This is partially my fault because I should've been clued in by the term &#34;loose&#34;, but I expected this to have a more feminine cut given the lining on the collar and cuffs. I'm 5'2&#34;and extremely buxom, so I ordered a medium based on reviews to avoid that chest gap that often happens, but it was just boxy. A small might have helped, but without any darting at the waist, the 'casual' outweighs the 'fashion'. The fabric is of good quality and it would be very comfortable to wear, however I have returned it."
3.0,They have loose threading and ball up a bit.  Wash prior to wear.  They did keep my daughter's feet warm and dry.
3.0,These were too small and felt really rough and were not comfortable. Returned.
3.0,I’m 5’5 & 132lbs. I have a small frame - but curvy. I usually wear a small / medium  - ordered a small and the only reason it doesn’t fit is the fact that the top has zero give. If I put my arms slightly up the whole dress comes up - the elastic on the high waste literally comes up over my boobs. I don’t even have large boobs!! Lol. So .. I’ll be returning for a size medium. Hopefully it isn’t too big. I really wanted to love this - & I do .. just wish it fit or at least had a bit more give up top. I should have listened to the other reviews. Also - material is very thin and sheer. Hope this helps.
3.0,they slip off easily at the heel.
3.0,"Smaller the the picture appears, but still a nice piece."
3.0,"The fabric is nice, but the pants runs small in size. Had to return it unfortunately."
3.0,"The watch is beautiful, it looks even better irl. I bought two, one for my mom and one for my girl. The one my mom had stop working after a few weeks (about 5-6 weeks). She doesn’t wear it everyday only three to four times a week. However the one my girl had is still working and in good condition. She also wears it about a few days a week. So i believe it all comes down to luck. If you’re lucky you will have it for a while but it wont last forever and if youre not it will stop working in a few weeks. I would not recommond it to people unless you just want to show it off for a week or so. I would encourage you to spent a little more and go for a better quality."
3.0,Love the dress its self and material a bit snug on my daughter and that is surprising because she is very petite i just wish i would have gotten the right product I ordered the pink one and  received a white one oh and also doesn’t come with the head piece like shown just fyi…
3.0,Really beautiful bras. Not very comfortable. I think they are priced well for what they are.
3.0,Seems fine but only works on red button learn.  Important to know.  That’s on devices from about 1993 on.  Verify yours.
3.0,"too big slides down, do not stay in place"
3.0,"It's an ok costume for the price, but does look a bit cheap. I'd say it's about a size medium and won't fit anyone bigger than that (I'm 175lbs with a 36B chest and couldn't get the zipper all the way up). I ended up returning it and assembling my own Alice costume with a light blue tulle skirt (WDPL Women's Mini Tutu 5 Layer Tulle A Line Skirt, also purchased through Amazon), a matching short sleeve shirt (I got Frumos Womens Tunic Short Sleeve Top in Sky Blue through Amazon), and then got a cheap white apron and black bow headband from Etsy. Yes, that's more money than the price of this costume but it looks way better and I;m happy with my decision. :)"
3.0,The snaps are hard to fasten and unfasten with non dominant arm.  I'm having better luck with soft $5 vneck t shirts.  This could be a great shirt for some but the price tag is hard to swallow
3.0,to small need to state order a bigger size than normal wear.
3.0,It pinches me a tiny bit when I but it on
3.0,"Considering that a paid $14,99, I could expect much from this watch. It looks nice, but the case is a little bulky and the strap, too rigid, althought I think it will get softer after some use. In the end, it is a good cost benefit."
3.0,"This was a cute dress; however, it just didn’t look right on my body type. It probably would have worked better if it was a smaller size, but I may not have been able to zip it up. I have broad shoulders."
3.0,I used this for shoveling snow and am hoping to use it for kayaking and winter yard work.  My hands stayed dry and warm.  I can answer a phone call or open an app on my phone.  A little less thickness would make them more maneuverable.
3.0,Cute and my daughter loved it but the strap broke the first time she used it.
3.0,I love the look of the boots but not enough cushion. The arch of the shoe kind of pushes my big toe against the shoe which is painful after 15mins to 20 mins of wearing. I can't wear the boots long enough. Walking around in a mall is definitely not going to happen.
3.0,"This strap is pretty good.  It is quite thin, which I like as it does not add significantly to the overall thickness of the watch.  However, after about 2 weeks it is already starting to fray, the holes are punched (not melted) and somewhat difficult to find.  The hardware is also somewhat &#34;light duty&#34; and sometimes the buckle tang gets caught on the wrong side of the buckle.  Alas, this is a pretty cheap strap, and, well, you get what you pay for.  I would probably rather have a slightly nicer quality band, which I will seek out once this one wears out."
3.0,"The earrings are very pretty but the clasp is a bit strange. I found it difficult to close. The post closes on the inside of the earring but it has to go into a narrow loop, it took some getting used to."
3.0,"I purchased this jacket to color coordinate with my son’s marching band, for which I volunteer to help move equipment on and off the field. During a downpour when stuck outside on a competition day, the jacket was only water resistant—my skin was damp and the jacket stuck to my arms, since it had soaked up rainwater. It would work well as a long windbreaker or even as a fluid-resistant personal protective equipment, or “PPE,” in a clinic. Nice length, almost to the knees on a person 5’8”.  No inside pockets, but nicely sized hip pockets for keys or a cell phone."
3.0,I like this ring however it looks a little wider from the picture. I wish it were a little wider.
3.0,"The slippers came attached to their inner packaging by 2 holes made into the soles, making the packaging secure. Who needs slippers with holes in the soles? The slipper have started to come apart at  the heals, already. I won't buy this kind again."
3.0,"La impresión está bien hecha y ya ha aguantado alguna que otra lavada y no se notan cambios en la misma. Lo malo con esta camisa es que tiene el logo de Gildan, no se dignaron en al menos ocultarlo, lo cual me resultó decepcionante."
3.0,"Looks great in the photo. On the foot, the fringe looks a bit clod-hopper-ish. Like a Clydesdale horse. I plan to remove it. The heel is way high as is the platform. They're relatively comfortable. My pinky toe has a tendency to slip out of the strap on the side. Seems to run big. I returned my 7.5 for a 7 and they fit fine."
3.0,"Belt itself has held up well. Not so much the buckle. After 17 months the latch broke off. It's tough to get off after that. Also. the clip that secures the unfinished end releases from the belt, periodically. Trimming the belt and reinstalling causes it to hold on longer.  Love the concept here, but the quality of the buckle needs to be improved."
3.0,This dress isn’t very dressy looking. I wear this around home. Fits well.
3.0,"Forever to ship it, but my friend I bought it for loved it!"
3.0,"Fine for what I needed it for (as a slip under a sheer dress). Extremely form-fitting. If you're not looking for a body-con type dress, this isn't for you."
3.0,Great dress/....The item had blue ink stains on front /will reorder/ it runs big
3.0,Nice colors and material. Runs a bit small.
3.0,"I gave this to a teenage granddaughter.  It is cute - too cute for an old lady I think.  Also it hangs funny - at an angle, which my granddaughter doesn't seem to mind"
3.0,Didn't fit. Sold it to my classmate.
3.0,To small. Could hold what I need to carry. My I phone was to tight in it. I am returning it. But it was a beautiful bag. Love the soft feel of it.
3.0,"Just received this coat. While it looks beautiful, it is incredibly small. I ordered a size medium as I wear size 8 pants and 10 or medium tops. I literally could not even get it zipped. The pockets splayed open over my hips. I doubt if a large would even have fit.  The sleeves were so tight they virtually cut off my circulation. I had on a short sleeved shirt so no bulk. I would suggest you go up not one, but two sizes. It looked very pretty and I loved the purple color. So disappointed!  I am sending it back immediately.  Should have stuck with London Fog."
3.0,The fabric is nice but thicker and stretchier than the Heather grey that I bought. Also the image was not transferred in very well. A lot of spots that didn’t stick.
3.0,They fall off alot.
3.0,On the small side.  Cute but very thin fabric
3.0,Skirt is a great looking piece. Can’t say the same for the top.
3.0,"Cute style, but shapeless when put on - perhaps I got a size too large"
3.0,"What the heck do you expect when you pay nothing for a ring? Of course it's going to be cheap. You'd have to be really ignorant to believe that some stranger is going to give you actual silver and moonstone for 6 bucks. Geez... A little common sense, y'all. 🙄"
3.0,"It's comfortable, but it gives no support if you are top heavy."
3.0,Nice bag but the zipper is cheap and fragile. The zippers have trouble closing and get hung at times.
3.0,We like the designs. I have one. My wife Has two. We gave one away. Would like better material. They come off at night
3.0,"Necklace is great, cross is cardboard and broke in 2 when I opened it."
3.0,Not a great fit and not easy to adjust so we sent it back. Kinda expensive for something she didn’t love.
3.0,The bows and brush were amazing! The bat wings on the headband started falling apart after an hour
3.0,"I love the color and feel of these pajama pants! However, they don't fit quite right. I am 5'5"" and 135 lbs and there is too much material in the front and almost not enough in the back, and I'm not super curvy. Will be returning."
3.0,Wish the bigger side was the front. I just switched them around. They are cute!
3.0,To narrow.
3.0,It’s very beautiful. It is not what I expected but I can work with this.
3.0,"Great selection of colors in the 7 pack. They are a lil tight for my legs, but I imagine they will stretch out."
3.0,Was hoping for a more fitted look on thighs. The look is loose and not what I expected
3.0,"I love the color of the band awesome, only thing I have a problem I can’t remove the links. I will take it to a jewelry and see if they can remove the links and if they can’t I will send it back."
3.0,like the style but it is kind of cheep looking
3.0,I bought as a gift and returned it was too small for a 6’6 250lbs male.
3.0,It's not thick enough for a Cleveland winter
3.0,"Love the Design, but these were not for Non-Pierced ears as it was described. Had to bend the post to wear them. Little uncomfortable, but it worked for a while. I can't return them because I bent the posts. Hopefully they'll make sure it is a ""Clip"" for Non-Pierced Ears next time."
3.0,"I work a job that requires me to wear all black and have pockets, so I've tried many little black dresses. Overall this one is fine, but it feels and looks a bit frumpy, particularly how it flows from the waist over my stomach. I am a 12/14 and the Large was slightly too big for me, although I don't think my bust would fit in a Medium. I'm 5'3'' and the hem was at mid-calf. Unfortunately, being made of stretchy jersey cotton, the pockets are useless for anything much heavier than a sheet of paper. I need to have my phone on me, but it stretched the pocket very visibly down to my knee."
3.0,"Very durable and don't wrinkle,  but can easily snag which ruins the look."
3.0,"Honestly, it’s a $10 wig. Party City price lol. Tbh I appreciate the attempt of a closure because if that wasn’t a thing this would have been a hot mess. First of all, anytime I merely flipped the hair it got super knotted and frizzy which was super annoying. Shedding is to be expected because you get what you pay for. It’s very thin in the back so this is only good for pictures. And the cap is reallyyy small. I know my head is big but it was almost child like how small the cap is. It’s not straight like the picture either, it’s wavy. And finally, it sits like a hat, pretty much impossible to make it sit without seeing a gap between the wig and my head at the parting. So I tried to finesse it to make it look more natural but it was tricky. Thank god this was just for pics so I could edit it to look more natural, but it was was hard. It is long though, decently cut, it takes to products well to define the waves, and I’m not too mad at it because it served its purpose."
3.0,"Attractive, but cheaply made. They won't last long."
3.0,"I am rating these 3 stars because I absolutely love the ways these fit, and bought another pair for myself and an additional as a gift. I however, have had these less than a year and they have a hole in the crotch where the seam is."
3.0,The style is designed for a lady with either a small bust or a very high one.  The bust seam hit all wrong so am returning it.  Too bad.  It is a very cute dress
3.0,Watch is to loose
3.0,I ordered the blue blouse because I liked the purple color in it. Well the colors are way off. The colors do not look anything like the picture at all. No purple at all more like a burgundy brown color and the blues are off too. The small size runs larger more like a medium. I'm disappointed.
3.0,"Bikini looks like the picture but not the one on the model. I’m 5’6, 140 lbs, and wear a C cup and the top fit just fine. Top is cute but the cups are pretty visible through the bikini. The bottoms fit almost a little too big and are very cheeky. Gave low stars bc of the sizing being off on the bottoms and the cups being off. Not a bad suit but not great."
3.0,"Totally bummed out, I bought a xxl but what I got was maybe a large. I wanted to<br />Return it but I’m in the process of loosing weight so my husband motivated me to keep it so I can wear it... I am bummed though :( good quality though and very cute."
3.0,This shirt fits well and is a very thin athletic material. However it is not Tye-dyed at all more like faded in a few spots but mostly solid color.
3.0,nice quality beautiful but the ivory is white
3.0,Should have ordered an xxl....But it's still cute.
3.0,to big for me gave it to a freind
3.0,"These are decent quality workout shirts, but they are a little snug. I normally wear a size L, so I ordered that. I should have ordered an XL as I like my workout tops to fit a little looser."
3.0,Giving up on buying shoes online......they seldom fit and hassle to ship back!
3.0,Pretty but they do turn my ears black.
3.0,"Very cute, much better quality than expected. Too bad they are waaaay toooo small. Even after compensating for what all the previous reviewers warned about the shoes running small, I could hardly squeeze my narrow size 7's in them. I ordered a size 2 sizes larger than I usually wear and still...heartbreak. So disappointing 😔."
3.0,Not the best quality but still decent.
3.0,This cute for a child not an adult. I got a medium so I could not image what a small would look like. Poor material but you get what you pay for!
3.0,"The plum color is everything and I love it. The material is so soft and exactly what I was looking for. I got the XXL and wish they had a size bigger. It kinda tight in the camel toe area, because of that I most likely will look for a different brand. I believe it’s overpriced."
3.0,Larger than I expected and bills dept. is hard to open
3.0,"Looks cheap, and personally I do not have sensitive skin, but was causing allergic reaction to skin. sustains scent."
3.0,"The material is stretchy, color is true to the image.  There  wasn't a tag therefore no way to determine what is the front and what is the back but that doesn't seem to matter."
3.0,The product is clean and true to the picture. It is printed on a Gildan brand tshirt.  The only thing I am not happy about is the print looks to be crooked and off center.  For $18 I would expect it to be straight and even.
3.0,I loved the look of this necklace except the 2nd strand kept turning up and it would never all lay flat.
3.0,Lasted for like three months. The lace then began to unravel and develop holes. Cute for a while but not a long while
3.0,"The glasses are not too over sized and I wanted them to be, but they are nice."
3.0,"It’s not for jogging (unless you want to passers by to focus on your cleavage)<br />I can see it being ok for yoga and gym though, comfortable fit, nice size"
3.0,They’re really cute but they’re really small
3.0,Very large but it’s still cute
3.0,"I slide out of them. They are not a good fit. If you order, order a size up. Look nice, but the fit isn't great"
3.0,"There is a liner in the tutu but it is SO small, and it tore while I was wearing it. I had to wear short shorts underneath.<br />All in all, it worked for my costume..."
3.0,Too large for my face. Returned them for some other celines
3.0,Thought it would slouch a'lot more...Still a nice hat though!
3.0,"I love the fit of these - they don't roll up or slip down while working out. I also like the fabric - it's soft and smooth. However, I got the leopard print and they are completely see-through. It's fine for me because I only ever plan on wearing them to exercise at my home and I don't care if my underwear is visible. But I would probably return if I had planned to wear them to a public gym."
3.0,"I love the product, very cute, and works great for my keychain product. Unfortunately 7 of the balls were leaking stars... Which means I am seven short key chains. They were very obvious manufacturing defects that could have easily been seen if someone looked at them before boxing."
3.0,I am actually going to return the dress<br />The color was not as vibrant as the picture<br />And it didn't fit well<br />Made me look heavy<br />But that's just me
3.0,"It looks cheap and not like in the photo. Also, I was looking for something straight and this is more of an A-line silhouette."
3.0,Not in love with it
3.0,"Not as comfortable as thought, not a good material"
3.0,I found this mask to be very flimsy for a better word … not the quality I was expecting but delivery was fast .
3.0,I ordered these around 6 months ago and ive broken 2 of them. Very cute and comfy but you get what you pay for!
3.0,Cute too but runs tight in the arms!!!
3.0,Graphic could be better
3.0,"Both cows are not attached to backings. For $3, I wasn't expecting much and I'll just glue them"
3.0,Hit heavy
3.0,"The mask is great , the nose really hurts , there us only 4 masks per package but only 4 mask ventilators so you can only use 4 at a time. Over all is a great mask but not long long periods."
3.0,Nice gloves and Ii wear them regularly but the color was a dark brown not black
3.0,"This product is sold as women and men. It fits me very well, does not fit my husband, who has full facial hair around his chin (not a big beard!) Otherwise good product"
3.0,Thin. Shrunk in wash. Rather skimpy.
3.0,Cute dress just runs small.  To tight in the chest
3.0,"Just what we needed at the time, for a wedding band to wear at work/working out/swimming. There are, however, much cheaper options available that I would get next time."
3.0,This a pretty cool bracelet. It was a little hard to put on at first but other than that its ok. I gave it 3 stars because it was a little itchy after wearing it all day.
3.0,"First I would like to mention that the purse was packaged very nicely. That is the pro. The con is that it was very small, barely held my phone and a couple of credit cards. One small lipstick made it bulge. Also, there was somewhat of an odor that was unpleasant.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I returned the purse."
3.0,"This dress is well made and very cute. Just be aware that it is not American sized. I compared/measured the ""2XXL"" to an XL from Wal-Mart Mart and it's the same."
3.0,Shirts are not compression. They do fit skin tight but no compression. I'm comparing to Tommie Copper compression shirts.
3.0,"Super cute, but an arm of the red pair fell off when I first put them on. Other than that they are cute &amp; I am enjoying the black pair."
3.0,Very cute but the color.of eyes I recieved were amber and not my favorite. Would have prefered the color in the photo.
3.0,I wear a 10 but buy my boots a size bigger to wear thick socks!! They fit with thin sock!!! I love them anyway!!!!!!:)))
3.0,Nice product but sizing is all wrong. Too large.
3.0,I bought this for my 13 year old Grandville. So far she loves it!
3.0,"I’m 5’5”, 135lbs and ordered a size small after seeing reviews that this dress runs big. I should have trusted the reviews. The size small fits like an x-large. I’m going to make the best of it and belt it since I love the style and color, and since there’s no exchanging it for a smaller size."
3.0,"Very good size of necklace, just not impressed with the quality of this necklace.<br />when you move it makes a noise when the heart touches the necklace."
3.0,"I love the look of this skirt, however, the tulle underlay felt like window screening.  It was uncomfortable to wear and the top layers actually stuck to it when you move.  I cut the underlay out and the skirt worked much better."
3.0,Looks exactly like picture do not like material
3.0,Poor quailty! The tops look decent but the bottoms are laughable.
3.0,"Used rings for both tragus and nose. Color coating is nice, doesn’t irritate skin. Captive bead is not completely round, makes installation more difficult. Ring just big enough to be comfortable on tragus and install was reasonable. Nose on the other hand, ring is nearly too small for nose and it took two clamps to get captive bead in ring. Same size product in another brand was slightly bigger. All in all, decent for the price but just a hare small on the diameter."
3.0,Absolutely think these are adorable.. but it came with about 4 inconsistencies and a cracked bottle. Yikes.
3.0,"The fit is a bit tight and the finger lengths.. Too long, I was looking for gloves I can use while driving. These feel authentic, like they are made from genuine leather, however in my case I needed more flexibility and these just didnt do it for me. I really wish they had different sizes. It seems like a great bargain, but it could also be that the price is marked intentionally. Either way, ive felt these gloves in my hands and my honest opinion, they look good, they feel great, even has that leathery smell.... Only downside and the most important is that its not ideal for driving because the fit is tailored for specific hands.<br /><br />I read some of the other reviews before making my purchase and the finger length especially for the pinky finger is not exaggerated at all. I would take a picture to show, but unfortunately I returned mine.<br /><br />I wiuld love these gloves because they were inner lining was very comfortable except for the fit of course. These are also beautifully designed. I like the chic look and its so stylish. Its my loss for having been born with short pinkies lol."
3.0,"The face covering is very long and kinda thick; which isn't a bad thing to me. You just have to be aware of the fact if your surroundings is hot. The thing that really bothering me is the fact that I ordered these all the way back on April 15th and didn't receive them until July 8th. I get that there is a lot of things going on in the world right now but almost taking 4 months to shipping something is unacceptable. Hence, the 3 stars."
3.0,it is my 3rd and brakes to quick
3.0,Attracts dog hair.
3.0,Cute but way too big and sheer
3.0,"It's so light it keeps falling off the hanger.  I only paid $6.39 (There was a promotion.)--I don't think it's worth $19.99.  There is a tag inside in a foreign language (maybe Chinese), so I don't know what it's actually made of.  What's interesting is that it's a small, but the inside tag says XXL.  I haven't washed it yet so can't comment on that.  I am 5'0 and 123 pounds and got a small.  It doesn't cover my big bust but still looks OK."
3.0,"I'm 5'8, 150lbs, 34C wear size 6.. I'm keeping it cause the bottoms were so awesome! But the top is terrible! That's my 3year olds hand... I would describe it like two very small coconut halves with maybe a 1/2&#34; between them.. Women aren't made this way... Specially if the bottoms fit...  And I'm not sure the top would fit a 12 year old due to the cups.. Its well made, really soft with lining, but just know you may only be able to wear 1/2.. I ordered a Medium"
3.0,I wear a lg/xl and got the xl and it was too big. I didn’t have time to exchange so I made it work. The dress is decent for the price but the material is definitely cheap. Lots of strings hanging off my dress that I had to trim. The straps are super flimsy.
3.0,"Cute but the bottoms are high waisted, gotta fold them and I am bigger on the bottom, fit kinda weird"
3.0,ok but a bit tight on my face
3.0,Took forever to be delivered and is smaller than size indicates
3.0,"I really wanted to love these pants. They were comfortable and the material was thicker than I expected but the color was no where near what was pictured. I wanted the pants because of the green-teal pattern shown but what I got was a pair that were grey/ black pattern. Too bad, had to return."
3.0,The online photo makes the logo look three dimensional. I thought it was a real Camaro logo. It’s not... it’s a color photo copy.
3.0,I like the shirts but the sleeves are too small where they connect to the body of the shirt it’s not a plus women’s sleeve so I haven’t been able to wear them they’re too tight but everything else fits.
3.0,"It's a great product,good quality, great fit ,they wash well,  but........I must have missed the fine print on how high waisted they are. Let just say I could have used these when I was pregnant. The top of the waist reaches under my breast. So excellent yummy control.lol"
3.0,"No longer made in Canada, now made in China. Feels cheap, there are better options for equal or less money."
3.0,The earrings are way bigger than they look in the picture. You look stupid wearing them. I glued one on my belt instead of wearing them. They seem to be good enough quality and they shine well.
3.0,Very pretty earrings but I had to return them as one of the clasps was very loose.
3.0,It nicer on the internet. But I'm not mad as product is cheap
3.0,I like the look and the feel. However. a lot of air was getting thru causing me to tear up....
3.0,I really liked it except it seems to be a more of an Olive Green instead of Khaki
3.0,"This is a lovely hat, but not near as good as is made out. It is clearly costume, I didn't even get a feather plume with mine AT ALL. It is also very, very shallow on the head and you will need hat pins in order to keep it on. Good for Halloween, but not worth this price."
3.0,"This item could look really nice on the right person, and though it's typically the style I'd pick for myself, it didn't fit quite right. It was very comfortable and appropriately covered what it needed to, but the pattern wasn't very flattering that I picked, so I returned it. They very kindly refunded my money."
3.0,"I was excited to have zipper pockets, but they're too small and it's tough getting items in/out of the pockets. I end up wearing these only when I don't have another pair clean, because of the pocket issue."
3.0,"Not crazy about this one. Odd fit, will not stay on my shoulders so was constantly pulling at it"
3.0,"It fits pretty good, it's actually a little too big but I was able to hook it like the picture.  My only complaint is that the beads are not spaced evenly.  Some are close together and some are spaced just right."
3.0,Too big.  Could have been more creative in making it these.
3.0,"It works, but there is a horrible high pitch neeping noise when the light is on"
3.0,I love the material of this tennis dress and how flattering it looks in the front. I’m 5 7” and length wise it’s perfect. I didn’t like how it looked on my backside it folds at the waist but I think it’s because it needs to be tighter at the waist but it’s nice and I plan to buy another color.
3.0,Pretty color. Good for an older woman
3.0,"These are comfortable sunglasses and fit over my glasses well. But, looking through them gives me a headache because they dont block the sun well and put a rainbow halo on everything."
3.0,Cute and great value. They just don't stay on very good.
3.0,These will most likely work but are very very small! It hardly covers my kids’ wrist. We did the 1-4yr size my boys are not large for their ages at all (4yr and 2.5yrs) and they barely fit. I was nervous to go too big but probably should have sized up.
3.0,There are imperfections in the fabric which made it difficult to adjust to display.
3.0,"Like the colors , dont like the pattern in front"
3.0,"Seems to be good quality and has an interesting clasp design, but the smallest setting is still too loose for my wrist. Will keep looking for a good band. Thankful for lenient return policy."
3.0,"Great fabric weight.  Pockets are too shallow.  The legs are very short, i.e. two inches away from the top of a shoe/slipper.  They fit very comfortably.  I won't buy them again as I prefer a longer leg."
3.0,Ordered a size 10 as my size 9 moccasins are too short in toe area without socks.  Used a shoe horn to try them on and these are even shorter.  Cannot wear and will return.  The slippers themselves looked very nice.
3.0,Some of the red has fallen out on the rear side.
3.0,"It’s beautiful, but it’s not blue and silver. It’s turquoise and gold, which wouldn’t be such an issue except I needed it to match the mask for a masquerade party I’m going to, which is blue and silver. These colors aren’t even one of the options offered by this seller, so I’m pretty confused about how I ended up with this particular color combination."
3.0,"shirt says 2x, but fit somewhat small"
3.0,Its ugly
3.0,"I love the look and feel of this product. It assembled easily and fit perfectly. However, after two weeks of wearing it, the elastic started to give out. It no longer stays put on my wrist. I have to push it halfway up my arm to make it stay in place. I do have fairly small wrists, but it fit perfectly when I got it, so I'm not sure what caused it to stretch out so quickly."
3.0,Wife looks good in it but the bra is small. We ordered her size so guessing order one size bigger
3.0,I only gave it three stars just because I don't personally like the material. It is super soft but it hangs really odd and clingy in the wrong places. It is a very pretty green as well just not my taste unfortunately
3.0,It's a clingy knit sweater. The color is true. I ordered  cream. I thought it would b softer but it's more like a Ruff knit. It's not terrible but don't expect  soft. I would ordered  up 1 size. I ordered  a large.
3.0,"I love the bracelet.  Only problem, all of the charms fall off because the rings that hold the charms on,are not sealed:("
3.0,It wasn’t as cute and didn’t fit like the picture but it makes a great house or maternity dress
3.0,"These are very cute, but not very durable at all. Wore them once and they are already bent and crooked. If you get them- make sure to use extra care."
3.0,"I got these in the black and grey versions. I like them well enough, but - as at least one other reviewer has commented - they are NOT as pictured, namely in that the ""swoosh"" is horizontal and not vertical. Makes me wonder what else might be inauthentic about them..."
3.0,"Got the pants for the kid, for school. She was swimming in them, but they fit me alright, so we're keeping them anyways. Happy accident."
3.0,The locket is way too big...I thought it would be a small one that would look cute with a top.
3.0,The ball break on ring  :(
3.0,It's fun.
3.0,"I wear a medium in regular shirts so I thought with compression shirts, I should get a L as I like them close-fitting but not skin tight.  These are skin tight.  I don't know yet if that will be a deal breaker as I haven't worn them or if they will be warm under my work t-shirts.  But product fit is small."
3.0,"I’ve had the purse for a while now and I love it, super cute, kinda on the smaller side though... my only big complaint is that the straps are starting to peel some, and they’re cracking so it’s uncomfortable on skin."
3.0,I have several pairs of 90 Degrees leggings and capri pants....and wear the same size in all. For some reason these fit different then the rest and give me a distinct camel toe....so while I am not returning them since I can wear them with long tunics I would just say that these fit tighter and seem to be made with different fabric...:-(
3.0,for smaller feet only.  band at top not strong enough to keep socks up.  does not wick away moisture as claimed.
3.0,"The 3-6 month size fit my tall, chubby 5 month old loosely but adorably, with a room to grow. The colors are accurate and dapper. My only complaint is the crotch closure which popped open from time to time just because of how it was constructed (not due to incorrect sizing or over-full diaper). This seems to be a problem with lots of these types of jumpers. I tossed the whole outfit into the washer and dryer without issue so far. Neither bow tie nor cummerbund bled, thank goodness. And my son got compliments when he wore the suit jacket over a different outfit at church today. So, points for versatility. I bought this outfit in a pinch for a wedding the same week and am not sure I would have been as happy about it (because of the unpredictable crotch peek a boo) if I intended it for multiple wears. But it is a cute ensemble as long as you are aware of the flaws."
3.0,Was not a fan of the fabric....runs a bit large around the waist
3.0,They have a metal thing inside them that hurts while sitting
3.0,"Even though I measured myself before ordering, and ordered the size the measurements were supposed to fit {which was size larger than I normally wear), the dress was way too small in the waist and I couldn't even try it on.  The dress seemed well made and a nice material, but I decided to return for a refund."
3.0,"One pair had a lense pop out already. Plastic broke, very thin."
3.0,I like the set and color. Very cute however you should probably order a size up if you are 1x-3x . The threads are not strong and will come apart through the day. I have a xxl and it fit like a xl with minimal stretch.
3.0,"These earrings are very cute. However, they were bent pretty badly when I received them."
3.0,"Very nice band, I really wanted to keep it but even the smaller size was too long for my wrist and the tip of it kept on getting on the way and coming on done! Also it didn't hold up while I was swimming. Thank goodness it was in the pool, I was able to dive in and fish it out. Sadly I had to return the band😔"
3.0,"its nice looking, but kind of stiff, but i assume that it will break in, its longer then i had hoped, but whatever"
3.0,Its very pretty but its much shorter than I was picturing in my head it would be. Im also tall for a girl at 5'9 so it's always hit or miss with lengths of dresses/skirts for me. I love the color and texture of this. The band was a bit off. It kinda rolls I guess I'd say. I bought a Large. I'd probably go a little bigger if i ordered again.
3.0,Description states non slip sole but that is not the case. They are basically crib shoes.
3.0,"Like all others have said, really well made and beautiful. I'm 5' 3&#34;, big hipped and small busted. Actually fit ok enough on top, very snug on hips, but the lining was too short (even for me) and bunched up when I walked or sat. Seemed too much a problem so had to return it."
3.0,I would definitely recommend ordering this top a size or two smaller than you normally would. It's super cute but way too big on me. I'm normally a medium but the medium fits more like a large/xlarge. It's way too big in the armpit area.
3.0,Cute ..  for gitft
3.0,Good quality pant but
3.0,It is a very high quality beanie but not for everyone. I have a pretty big head and it was just too small. The way it fits on my head makes it look weird and it also feels a little tight. If you have a small head buy it! It would have been perfect if it was slightly bigger. The seller should note that it is a little on the small side.
3.0,"No está mal pero se ve mejor y de más calidad en la foto , recomiendo pedir una talla más"
3.0,it's good quality. for some reason it didn't work out for me in fitting. it is differs with people. some people might fit them ok.
3.0,It would be best tonorder the bext size up from your size.
3.0,Buttons all fell off when trying on and in first wash but the fabric is nice enough. I'll have to replace with new buttons to keep it tho asthe shiny wore off the plastic in the wash so replacing ruined buttons is a waste of time
3.0,these pants are obviously missized.  unable to get on past knee.  previous purchases of same item in other colors fit perfectly.  recommend you go up 3 sizes from your normal fit
3.0,"It's fine.  The stitching is a little suspect.  One of the hooks on the inside of the shorts pulled right off.  But when all the U.S. companies run to economically-desperate places such as Indonesia, Malaysia, India, China....  quality often suffers so that U.S. companies can offer Americans low-quality goods at HIGHER prices while making MORE profit.  The outfit will probably start  coming apart after a few more washes even though I washed it in cold/cold with delicate settings and hung it to dry."
3.0,Ok Quality.
3.0,Board is very nice but I did not get the pendulum that I picked out.
3.0,Not as soft as expected even after washing.
3.0,If going to drive yes be careful it's slippery
3.0,"Really helps with my night driving, but I find the big black nose piece distracting. . . I'd prefer this lens in  different style glasses."
3.0,"I ordered as recommended. UK size 14 They said to order a size 10 in US. I did just that And the jacket was huge, way too large to wear. Solar did promptly Accept a return. I will order again in the correct size."
3.0,Came all the way from China. Didn't feel like doing the return process. Gifted item. Can't say one way or another.
3.0,Band it little loose.
3.0,I loved the color and feel of this band. However the claps was off. The latch was in the wrong place and so I had to wear it kind of funcky to get it to stay in place. Other than that it was great
3.0,I have been waiting to write a review until I got the chance to use them a few times. Yesterday was only my third time wearing them and the bottom rubber pieces already started coming off. I know these were not the most expensive socks but I expected them to hold up a little longer than three wears. Disappointed because otherwise they are very comfortable and cute.
3.0,"Unfortunately, the coat I received is NOT the coat in the picture. Mine has the "" fur"" of a plush teddy bear. I believe the coat in the picture might be real fur. It is very soft, and a fun coat to wear, but not the coat I wanted to receive. Live and learn."
3.0,"Super cute, fits well, but low quality."
3.0,This dress is really cute and comfortable. My only issue is that it doesn't work really if you're busty. There just isn't much room up top whereas the rest fits great.
3.0,The snake itself as many reviewers have said is too big. No matter how I tried I just couldn't get it to work.
3.0,"I love that this is a bangle, the color and the message."
3.0,"Nice looking dress, but the fabric is too warm and the top too close fitting to be comfortable in hot weather."
3.0,"I like wearing these! These aren’t breathable and as I found out the hard way, they’re not squat proof. Luckily, they’re very flattering and they’re comfortable."
3.0,Very pretty bracelet with stones all the same color.  I was very disappointed that the bracelet doe snot have a sterling mark.
3.0,The waist of this skirt came too close up to my breast.
3.0,"Love the fit. I brought an 8 short, the length was a little long  being 5'0"" so had to do a little altercations."
3.0,They are very comfortable and look cute. They run small. I usually wear a Medium so I was going to size up to a Large but I wanted them to be loose so instead I ordered an XL. So happy with how comfortable they are. I don't like that they are see thru and I don't like that you can see every seam underneath. If you try putting shorts on you can tell you have shorts on. If you wear regular underwear or a thong you can tell also. If I wear them outside I put leggings underneath. Otherwise I just wear them around the house. Which is a shame because they are so cute and comfy.
3.0,"Spyder uses to make decent tee-shirts, these have the elastic stretch but the collars do not lay flat all the way around, it's strange. I hate when companies fix what was never broken."
3.0,These earrings are beautiful! I purchased them for a vacation in Mexico & received so many compliments. I only wish they stayed on more easily they kept falling off.
3.0,product was larger than expected did not fit
3.0,"It appears to be a peach color in the web picture. However, it's closer to a burnt orange. Too bad, am returning."
3.0,"Received very quickly, has a hole in the leg and I haven't even put them on yet.  Noticed the pocket also had a hole.  Received a 2nd pair in dark blue a couple days later, and both pockets have holes also."
3.0,"Zipper broke first day of camping. No instructions available. extra rod , no idea where it goes."
3.0,"Got this for Halloween, but it is very hard to breathe. I couldn’t wear it."
3.0,"The color was not as expected. I was hoping for a lighter tan color, it was almost a rust color. Quality was good."
3.0,Buy a slip if you plan to purchase this. It is EXTREMELY seethrough.
3.0,The stopper for the back of the earrings don't fit...but pretty
3.0,Daughter is in love
3.0,"My 4 yo daughter was excited about these and loved the design. Every time she tried them on she would walk funny and finally said they were ""tight"". Turns out the plastic band that wraps around the strap between the toes were uncomfortable. After I cut the plastic off, she was walking normally again. She was even running in them. Now she can put them on and take them off herself."
3.0,"I love this keychain so much, but after just three days the threads came untied so now I just have they key ring. Unfortunately it defeats the purpose because now it has nothing making my work keys stand out when I throw them in my bag, but I still use it because it’s just that awesome. I just wish it was constructed better."
3.0,"These goggles look pretty fun and steampunk, which is why I bought them, but found them to be cheaply made. These are built for style and not function. Still, I found the padding around the sides to be asymmetrical and poorly put together. Should a person be looking for purposeful goggles I would definitely avoid these as they are useless. They could do okay for a steampunk costume, but they're likely to disappoint."
3.0,"I purchased the 2x in hopes it would fit as loose as other reviewers mentioned. It turned out to fit as a perfect 2x width, but it was shorter than expected. I am 5'4, 250 lbs, pear shaped and the blouse sat right above my hips. Will I wear it anyway? Yep! Was it what I expected? Nope."
3.0,Perfect pair of inexpensive glasses.
3.0,"Very soft, but runs SMALL. I was not given the choice of what size to order (??) I’m 5’7” 138 lbs and would normally order a medium. This was WAY too small for me. Disappointed I was not able to choose a size!"
3.0,I like it but the only thing that made me mad is that the claps is hard to come open. I broke a nail trying to get it open on both the bracelet and necklace ..our choir order these and all of them was the same could not open the claps
3.0,"Nice comfortable material, however, I returned it because the material on the pants were too excessive at the flare. It was just odd looking."
3.0,"I love this print the most (red). After reading the reviews and it's somewhat big. Unfortunately, they don't have this dress the size I need :( So, I ordered another color...lets see.<br /><br />My issue. I'm 4'11 and I'm not petite. Dresses are hard to find for my height."
3.0,Doesn't look as professional as the picture. It seems to be a different fabric used.
3.0,Too fits- just wish it was underwire... Bottom should be smaller- but could not have gone smaller in the top.
3.0,"Didn't like the fit, the rubber bottom wasn't very comfortable inside. I could feel the edges of the boot digging into my ankles. I returned for something else."
3.0,This dress was definitely oversized so order a size down. The material was a little heavy for the summer but I'm sure would be nice for fall and winter.
3.0,"This is pretty, however the box it came in was dirty with finger prints on it. Made it look used. Not very nice as a Christmas gift.  I also thought it was posted as a flash Black Friday sale item. Not so when I got the charge."
3.0,The locking piece broke off within a month. Great case
3.0,"It's really nice once it is on the ear, but before that, it is a bit difficult to put on a toddler's ear.  It didn't take long till my toddler yanked it out of her ear."
3.0,A little on the cheap side..
3.0,"Demasiado pequeño,  talla 3x corre por M"
3.0,I like it but the printing is very small and the person I gave it to had a hard time reading it.
3.0,I returned it because it was uber small. The item iteself was beautiful and looked well made.
3.0,Not very very large
3.0,Super cute shirt. A little small.
3.0,Was difficult to get on watch...would be better if it was a smaller band that could stretch to a bigger wrist.
3.0,"This looks great - colors are bright/vivid and print is great. Sweatshirt is pretty thin polyester material, but not bad for the fall. But, sizing is crazy. First, it runs pretty big, but its a sweatshirt, so not a big deal. The drawstrings on the hood literally went to the bottom of the sweatshirt, really weird. And the biggest issue - the sleeve length is insane. The sleeves are probably 6 inches longer than a normal sweatshirt of the same size. They are abnormally long and make the sweatshirt look add because the sleeves are so bunched up. Will be returning."
3.0,Nice dress good price.but to big
3.0,"For the price it’s ok. One thing though, no moon phase function. The sun and moon are linked to the actual time not the moon phase."
3.0,Not only is this product small! But it’s so thin.<br />Idk why anyone would put a pocket on something that is so thin & can’t hold any weight....<br />These are suppose to be shorts???<br />They’re so thin they’re like wearing tights almost so not like shorts at all.<br />So they contacted me & gave me options so I am given them 3 stars now instead of 1.<br />If u do buy them & don’t like them just contact them & they will handle the issue.
3.0,"Being 6'6&#34; it's nearly impossible to find things long enough and these are no exception, I guess i'll just wear long socks with them."
3.0,I measured and ordered as recommended on the site but it’s too big.  I would size down to get a snug fit
3.0,My small fit like a large and I felt like I was wearing an oversized mens shirt. Not attractive at all and I did not keep it.
3.0,I like the style of this watch but the band is really small. Would work best with a kid
3.0,"Description says these come with a fly. Am I supposed to rip seems to find it? They fit a bit large but I'm a 34"" waist. My mediums were snug so I think it's expected. They're comfortable, not very supportive in the front. I'd buy another pack but I'd shop around and compare with others first."
3.0,gift  for twenty  bucks I guess  it's  ok
3.0,"I'm 5'8.5&#34; wear a 1x-2x. I ordered the 2x. I pulled it out of the packaging my first thought was, this is a night shirt. It looked like pajamas. I hits just above my knee, and I thought, wow, I'm taller than average, and it's too long for me. I'm gonna give it a shot with leggings and boots to see if it's any better, otherwise it's going in the pajama pile! The other thing is it isn't an A-line tunic as pictured. It runs about 6&#34; longer and doesn't flare out until well below hips and it is minute. The material is stretchy so it won't lose its shape. It is a thinner cooler fabric, but not see through."
3.0,"Nice, but returned because straps are not adjustable. Concerned they would stretch and be too loose.  I am very short, so probably more a problem for me that an average frame.  I also ordered a different color in this top and kept that top. The straps did become somewhat loose, but not so bad that they were trouble."
3.0,"Fit as expected. Color was as pictured, however the quality was not great. The material is paper thin and the straps sit in a really weird spot you. Luckily I just bought this for a one time costume as low-key Dorothy, because I'll never be able to wear a bra or anything under it. Hopefully I can get some use out of it in the summer time as a bathing suit cover up but other than that, in the back of the closet it goes."
3.0,"The fabric is true to the online picture.  Because it was rated as too small, I ordered the extra large.  I don't think it's meant to close, which is a good thing because it's so tight it would only close on a small child.  But the prink is fun and I like that part of it, the fabric has a nice feel and I like that part of the product.  I will wear it open over a cami; that will work.  It was not what I expected, even taking all precautions to order it two sizes bigger than my normal size.  But it's a &#34;fun&#34; top and I will wear it.  I love the pattern."
3.0,"I expected the socks to fit thigh high as described. However, they only came a few inches above the knee. Good product and quality. I am disappointed they were not as described. Ok for the price."
3.0,I liked the colors and fabric but the hate was too large for the size.  It's a S/M but more like a M/L
3.0,"Zip has a very bad quality, also, XL size fits maximum US size 8"
3.0,The shirt was fine and the material was nice but there was a decent size cut right on the shoulder so that was pretty disappointing.
3.0,"The dress is cute overall, brings out your body shape and decent material. There was a few problems tho. Those being that the dress is a bit oddly cut at the bottom, it came super wrinkly and the arms are a bit awkward it’s really big where the armpits are. Overall not that bad for the price, but I wouldn’t buy again."
3.0,"I recently had the opportunity to review the white version of this shirt. I saw several reviews that said order a size up so I did. I ordered the XL when a large may have been what I normally would have ordered. When I received it and tried it on I found that I probably should have ordered two sizes up, it felt like a medium. The shirt has no give and the arms are not all that comfortable although it's hard to tell if that's because of the construction of the fact that it's too small. I'd be willing to give this shirt another try with a bigger size or may just wait until I lose a bit more weight and try it on again."
3.0,"The material is super cute but has no stretch. Between that, and it running very small, I'm either going to have to give it away or go on a diet. And I ordered the largest size which I can usually either fit in or it is slightly too large - but not this one. I am disappointed because like I said I love the look."
3.0,"I didn’t like the material, how it fitted, it was somewhat cheesy/cheap, I returned item, don’t like to give bad reviews but just keeping it real."
3.0,"Material is nice! Fits like a maternity shirt, though"
3.0,"I'm 5'3, 125 lbs, 36C cups but my boobs are falling out of this. I ordered a size 44. There is little support/coverage in that area. Also, the suit is a little long for me. Overall it's a cute swimdress. I wish it fit properly."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:ac9707e3e9ad0b4c6d8756d00bfab8c2]] Es un excelente reloj, le doy 4 estrellas porq es más pequeño de lo que parecía en la descripción y regularmente utilizo relojes grandes, no obstante, no deja de ser una compra fabulosa."
3.0,They are a little tighter than expected but still good
3.0,Well worth the money! Super comfy and cute! Perfect for cooler weather without overheating while working out!
3.0,"Muy caro, para la mala calidad de la tela."
3.0,Ordered an XL but it is tight. No hooks to adjust it  with.
3.0,Very easily broken
3.0,"I bought four of these and two won't come apart so that I can set the time.  Be ready to break a thumb.  The spring steel wrist band only fits a relatively large wrist, so be careful.  Otherwise a striking a beautiful timepiece."
3.0,"I got the ""P"" and im not gonna lie, its not my favorite!"
3.0,"Ok for the price. Nice case. They do feel a bit cheap on, and leave more of an imprint on the bridge of my nose  than other sunglasses I have. I can’t wear them fo much longer than a couple of hours as they get uncomfortable. They do look nice though. And the case is nice too. For the price they are ok."
3.0,Looks nice but aren't long enough to wrap my head and they fall off easily. They barely pass my ears. Lengthen the sides about 2-3 cm to properly sit in place on a grown mans head N not slide off
3.0,Small to size
3.0,The camisole was a drab white not a pure white as shown on Amazon.
3.0,"I’m 5,8” 190lb and the large rides to high in my arm pit. I like them but probably need a bigger size."
3.0,Like others reviews said its pretty big...unknown flower itself not counting border it a tiny bit larger than a half dollar. That being said I didn't expect a tiny piece based on other reviews...product arrived with one of the petals chipped off.. it isn't super noticeable though...I bought this for costume work or for the pendant to glue on something crafty...it will serve its purpose..it was a dollar so yeah..kind of the same feeling u get when a vending machine eats ur dollar..ehh
3.0,"Very pretty heart charm's. I ordered two one blue one purple, for my daughter's. The chain's broke on first day😯 for the price I got what I paid for. I'm just going to buy new chain's😊"
3.0,I purchased the sweat pants and washed them in cold water and the black pair bled onto the white. So tired of Amazon letting anyone sell on Amazon.
3.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS RING!!! Lasted me about 3 months, then it broke in half. Super cute design though!"
3.0,Love the appearance but sizing runs small
3.0,Fits well but wish it was more supportive
3.0,"It felt like swim suit material and had a strange smell, not too bad i could just wash it but loose threads on the first wear and the bottom of the shirt is raw because the hem ripped."
3.0,"It shouldn't be used for heavier travelling or activity. Very anti-theft but the front strap is ripping out the side fabric, i'm so disappointed"
3.0,Pretty but very large
3.0,"Comfortable but they are pretty see through. Won’t be able to leave the house in them, so kinda disappointed."
3.0,"I'm a 32B and the top was big for my bust. Although it was cute looking suit, I had to return it."
3.0,Runs 2 sizes smaller
3.0,The outfit was cute but it was too small
3.0,It came pretty stretched out.
3.0,Smaller than expected.  I must have a big head or the model has a small one.  I was hoping for a larger bouffant that would give my hair more space.
3.0,"This shirt looks great and the material is comfortable, but the button placement is weird. It’s either buttoned way too high and feels tight around the neck or if I unbutton one button it goes down like 8” I look like Fabio with my chest hair sticking out. The button needs to be 1-1.5” lower and it would be perfect. As it is I’ll never wear the shirt again."
3.0,"Our daughter is a size 12.5 so we ordered the 13 thinking it would give her a bit of wiggle room.  The shoes came and are adorable; she really liked them.  However, they are way too big. I didn't think a half size would be that much larger.  The strap across the top of her feet was also extremely loose - as in you could put a finger in between the strap and her foot - thereby offering zero chance for her feet to stay in the shoe. Basically, she spent the day walking out of these.  We're going to keep them because her feet will grow, but I'm not sure the strap will ever be useful.  I'd recommend buyers order the size their kids are actually wearing, or maybe even down a click."
3.0,"I LOVED the print/graphic used.  Pretty accurate to the original movie poster.  What I wasn't crazy about was the shirt material itself.  Not sure what they use but I'm not a fan.  Other than that, great product."
3.0,"A cute cut, but a little bit see-through, and not quite as flattering as I had hoped. It accentuated one breast more than the other for a lopsided look."
3.0,"if this just needed to cover my mouth, it would be excellent. if you do get it over your nose, it makes a huge gap on either side so it’s kind of pointless.  I would say it’s for looks only… not for adult men. I love Rick and Morty, just giving you guys my honest opinion"
3.0,"So, tops are fine. It's cute. Bottoms as others said are way too big. The top fit my 2y. The bottom was a too tight, but almost fit my 7yo.<br />I bought for $7.99. I'm happy for the two tops alone."
3.0,"I think this is a beautiful bracelet and it gives me peace of mind about my pregnancy. After about a month of wearing I've started developing little sensitivity bumps from the metal accents. Hasn't become too bad yet and I've just switched wrists when that's happened. Also for the price you can't expect her to use white gold or anything, so just be careful to sensitivities. It would make a beautiful and thoughtful gift, although I wish the card outlining the stones and their properties was presented a little nicer in the event I would ever like to get one as a gift. As it looks now, I would make my own."
3.0,Very cute and adorable but they do not stay in my ears
3.0,My daughter wore these once after one wash they shrank A LOT. (At least 2 sizes) they were cute but shrank soooo much
3.0,"unfortunately I had to return this product...though it is genuine Dior, extremely well made, the pucture is deceiving and ut ends up the glasses are covered with glitter....seller agreed to make a full refund though..."
3.0,"This was purchased as a base layer for skiing. As other reviewers have mentioned, the coldgear runs smaller than normal. It is average quality and did the job needed"
3.0,Cute shirt and style but waaaaay too small. Order at least 2 or 3 sizes up. The XL was like a small. Ugh.
3.0,The designs are fun and trendy but they do not securely hold the chapstick so it often falls out.
3.0,"Not as shiny or bright as I'd like it to be, but for the price, they're worth it!"
3.0,The knit lacks the tight fit of most turtlenecks.  Waist and wrists are loose.
3.0,"they look pretty, they don't tangle but you will know these aren't real. i would recommend wearing them at night with a black or white top. i really like how they look. chunky jewelry is in, so i am learning to wear them without feeling like a clown, these aren't too bad."
3.0,Not what expected. Was very small and short.
3.0,PRETTY GOOD BUT A LITTLE TOO LONG BUT STILL GOOD QUALITY
3.0,Too large and the material is not very good.
3.0,"Have heard these can catch fire. What are thoughts experiences? I'm looking at a bug investment,here"
3.0,My husband bought me these last year for Christmas because I have Reynauld's syndrome.  It is very frustrating to lose the feeling in my fingers even when it is only cool out.  They worked great all last winter.  I recharged them every few days for several months with no issues.  However...this year I can't get the batteries to charge.  For the price I think they should have lasted longer than 1 season.
3.0,"Holds jewelry securely and protects it in luggage FAR better than anything I've used before. I have &#62;5M miles on one airline, and I travel for business, so I've tried everything on the market. The con is that this is very thin, so bulkier items (bangle bracelets, even medium size earrings) won't fit in it."
3.0,"Love it but one of the cords came out of the clasp after a few months, so now I'm going to have to see if I can fix it without breaking it more."
3.0,The elastic band in the middle of a dress
3.0,Super short. Mini means it doesn't even cover my booty...
3.0,Not high quality but this is reflected in the price. Basically just bought them because I accidentally bought a french cuffed shirt and liked the shirt enough to want to keep it. Gets the job done.
3.0,The larger sizes are not accurate enough for people who have big feet.
3.0,Size not true to size.
3.0,"These bras fit, sort of.  I definitely will not be wearing them for errands or to work. They are strictly sleep and/or around the house bras."
3.0,The polyester did not breathe well. Also doesn't wick moisture. Whole face mask gets soggy after a few minutes of wear. Also not a fan on the seam running all the way down the back. Look good though. But would not reorder.
3.0,"This jacket is material is like a velvet blanket, but looks decent. Fitting is a bit relaxed, not slim type. Overall it is not bad.."
3.0,Not as thick as normal Harley shirts but still nice quality
3.0,"Really so beautiful and has wonderful vibes, however the elastic string it’s made with falls apart quickly. I’ve only had it for almost 2 months and the strings are frayed all over and it already appears to be on its last leg. So sad because I really love it & looked forward to many wears."
3.0,"Being a larger girl, I know to get under clothing items a little larger, so I ordered a 2x. Not only is it too tight, but the tutu bit doesn't even cover my butt. If you get this, get at least 2, if not 3 sizes bigger than you normally wear"
3.0,This Product suffers the same issue as nearly every item of Apparel on Amazon... The sizing is not true to claim via designed for typical sizing in the Country of origin (usually China) which for most Americans are child-size.
3.0,"The coloring of the actual product is not nearly as detailed at the photo.  I didn't expect much, but while it will do it could have been better."
3.0,Bought theses to use at the range becuase they had both the 3.5mm plug and the microphone. Turns out the m32 models do not have 3.5mm plug at all. I had to buy an adapter to listen to music.
3.0,Fit everywhere but the length
3.0,Not the a split worst but definitely read the fine print. The photo shows 2 necklaces worn one ties in a knot. But you will only Get 1 necklace. I should have read the measurement better. - tricky tricky sellers
3.0,"I like that the second layer is higher so that I don't feel that my breasts will pop out. However, it is not as constrictive as I was hoping for. It is great for when I lift weights, but not great for cardio."
3.0,"Kinda snug in the mid section, beautiful dress though"
3.0,I like the fabric and color. The dress delivered to me does not have the front slit as shown in the picture featuring the dress.
3.0,Became super loose from the handle a week after I got them  there only glued I to place ig but disappointed in the durability overall
3.0,Affordable but Not stretchy. Tight at hips. Cute style idea but  does not fit the way it is pictured.
3.0,Collar seems too big for dress. Must go 1-2 sizes up so fits standard US sizes.
3.0,only has a low star value is because it took exceedingly long to get to us
3.0,"Beautiful dress and nicely portioned, but from the waist down the fabric was upside down and all the butterflies were wrong side up.  Five yards of good fabric wasted, because I could not deal with that flaw."
3.0,"It's not a soft leather feel at all.  Also, the &#34;light grey&#34; is actually more of a light khaki.  Not what I was expecting in the color.  It does hold an iphone 7 in either pocket."
3.0,The top had black lace around the neckline.
3.0,"they are not matt, they are sheer and the black come of easy. not to be worn as an everyday accessory."
3.0,Very cute but runs very small. I got these cause I wanted a cheap alternative to pregnancy  overalls. Also the become very wrinkly very fast so make sure you pull them out of the dryer right away and hang them up.
3.0,"Three stars because these are good looking hoops, but the sizing should be clearly stated as 16 GAUGE. For those of you looking for nose rings, these are on average much too large. Ended up giving them to someone else as they were not the size needed. Again...16 GAUGE."
3.0,The band is very pretty and dressy.<br />Although I am disappointed that there is no clasp to remove the watch when I take it off! I’m having to remove it from off the watch itself!!
3.0,Runs a little smaller than expected. Was hoping the opening in the front would be asymmetrical but it was symmetrical right in the middle. Also the cowl neck was not as big as shown. You can see the seem where the neck is attached to the body of the sweater. Still looks okay. Nice soft texture and quite warm. Despite these unexpected issues I get lots of compliments on it.
3.0,The measurements listed are external dimensions or just inaccurate I’d say order a size up
3.0,"I usually don't leave reviews, but if you're interested in purchasing this ring you might want to remember although it say sterling silver it may have to much nickle in it. After wearing it for only 4 days it did turn my finger green. It's a nice ring and it looks great but beware if you buy it you can't wear it everyday. I wanted this to add to my stackables, I'll still wear it but only for short periods of time."
3.0,These are really lightweight but work for what I needed them for
3.0,nice -i give it to my little brother
3.0,"They are great to wear on a sunny day to help with the sun rays against my eyes.  Night time was horrible!!! Lights from cars- still very blurry,  blinding,  street lights - still very blurry, blinding. Raining at night and cars coming the opposite way,  horrible  to see, blinding and blury. Another weird thing they seem to have mirrors on the edges on inside.  I don't actually see them.  Just when driving,  I see the cars I pass, than I see them behind me.  I felt like there was a car right next to me in my blind spot,  not a safe feeling."
3.0,They are hard to work with and need to be a bit longer like seven inches so they are pliable and can be use as hooks to hang up garden tools or any tools. They are strong. I will order the longer type the next time I order some of these.
3.0,Good looking but face too large for my wrist... covered my entire wrist. Great color that you don't find often
3.0,Cute but priced a little more than you would expect .The quality was not good .It is made for a few wears .
3.0,This is a great first birthday onesie with the Unicorn horns and ONE written in gold. The skirt however is not that great. It is just tulle with no shape or fluffy feel especially after being washed. I got a separate tutu skirt on Amazon that was more flowy and had some shape to it.
3.0,"These are very thin, not quite wide enough, and slip off my head. 3 stars is generous, but they were very inexpensive."
3.0,"Would make a great maternity dress, but wouldn’t recommend if that’s not the style you are aiming for"
3.0,"Got a small, I’m 120 pounds 5’2 so pretty small, on me this is a very baggy and knee length skirt."
3.0,Would have been cute if they hugged the body more. It was too big. Size down
3.0,Good shirt but not exactly like pictured
3.0,"The band was great for a while, over time the ends started to disconnect from the watch. The connectors seem to have worn and do not make a solid connection.  It would disconnect and just fall off.  I wear the watch every day, but not having it securely attached is a problem.  I would likely not buy again."
3.0,"If you're short like me, (5'3&#34;, don't know my inseam but very short, my torso is definitely on the long side) these will fit like full sized leggings. I knew they would be on the longer side of capris, but not that long."
3.0,I am 5'4 size 12/14 and these are really tight on me. Cute print though
3.0,"Great looking shirt, you may want to consider buying two sizes larger."
3.0,"it's a pretty dress but It doesn't look like the picture, the fabrics are shinny, but its a very good price and arrive soonner than I expect,<br />I buy this  dress for my Daughter , the idea was that she is gonna use it for parties, but after try it on, she says that this is not for parties, she think is better for the beach or for staying around the pool."
3.0,"I give it a 3 because I love the top, absolutely perfect! But the bottoms? Way too small and very sheer. Even if they fit, I wouldn’t recommend wearing them in public unless you want people to see your undies. Overall? I do not recommend the set."
3.0,"Not the best quality, but decent for the price. Looks better pictured. I'm 5'4&#34;, the length is good. Color is as pictured."
3.0,I like them..<br />But...<br />I feel like the material used wasn't exactly as I expected it almost felt brittle .<br />maybe we expected to much.<br /><br />I bought these as a gift for my daughter.<br />I like what this company stands for.<br />I'll buy a different pair for myself & review again.
3.0,"Cute, but is very large.  Order true to size and you'll still have plenty room"
3.0,"Not sure I can review this item as I just received it and my concern is the lack of a hem on both legs.  The bottoms of each leg ate presently frayed, actually I am not sure if indeed I should keep these pants although they look and fit good. Will this fray massively with one wash?  Of course It should be a delicate cycle however will the pants indeed stay as isn’t or fray much more than they are and literally fall apart.  It is a  Dilemma."
3.0,looks better on girl in pic
3.0,"Too big for me...looked more like the old folks over glasses then a stylish pair of women's sunglasses.  Seemed like they were made well, just not for me."
3.0,The fit is too small for my friend. They offered to fix it if it’s too small but my friend lives in another stay and this is too inconvenient.
3.0,"Basically it looks better on the screen here than when u get it. Its flat and looks kinda like something a kid/ young teenager would wear. A little childish in appearance. But looking at it on here, it looks full/roundish and much better than what u actually get in ur hand when it comes. Don't hate it tho.Its okay,cute enuff but not great."
3.0,"This dress seems to run large, but I did not opt for a smaller size as I did not like the feel or drape of the skirt fabric. Not bad for the price, if it fit and was flattering."
3.0,"This dress reminds me of a ghost sheet with spaghetti straps rather than a hood. It is incredibly loose-fitting at every point. I'm 5'6, 140 lbs and found that the dress was just far too lose to be comfortable. It has a cute design but does not flatter my figure in the slightest. The color is great and the material comfortable but the fit cannot be compromised. It reminds me of a nightgown that is about mid-thigh in length."
3.0,"Pretty color. A little cheaply made but ok for the price. But I bought the smallest size available and it is too big, despite what the size chart says."
3.0,"5'3"", 106lbs I got the small and while it's baggy enough, this thing is a little short for comfort. Also, the button holes were entirely too small to push the buttons through. The fabrics a little more muted than expected. I mean what can you expect for $20?!.. May wear as a swimsuit cover-up but not as a dress."
3.0,"The outside is absolutely lovely. Good quality leather.<br /><br />However. The snap button broke the first day of use. And the lining material is loud and feels cheap. Also, the strap is much longer than expected. It lays around my hip."
3.0,Returned they didnt fit over the glasses for my 10 and 12 year olds
3.0,"Love the bra, except it's to small around!"
3.0,"Bought as a gift for my friend , she likes it"
3.0,"They work great .. Too big, should come in sizes and shapes"
3.0,"I really like this watch bracelet.  However, it broke within a month.  One of the straps came loose from where it was attached."
3.0,"color too intense/""loud"", not as natural earth-toned and muted as pictured."
3.0,"Ok, not nearly as long as in the picture,  more like tshirt length....but it is cute"
3.0,"Ordered this to match my shoes for my brother's wedding. Looks exactly like the picture, matched my shoes perfectly, cute and not cheap looking. Unfortunately, the inner lining is not tacked down well, so the first time I unzipped it, the lining caught in the zipper after 3"" and wouldn't move in either direction.  Had to return. Hope the seller/manufacturer sees this and corrects, because it is quite cute if only it was functional."
3.0,"Sorry guys, this is a review for pregnant ladies.<br />Bought these to be some frumpy house pants that I can fit under my growing pregnant belly.  Comfortable but had to give them a lower star rating because the back pocket was not sewn shut, so anything I put in there will just fall down my leg."
3.0,I like the suit but it came without a hole for the button. So I had to take his pants to seamstress for her to add s hole so he could wear it.
3.0,The material was not what I expected. Arms was tight.
3.0,hola el reloj ⌚desde un punto de vista seve todo muy bien asta que me lave las manos ✋con el reloj ⌚puesto y esta fue la consecuencia y según aquí me engañaron diciendo que 🤔este 👉 reloj ⌚era a prueba de agua
3.0,"I do love this watch, however, the leather strap has already broke. I have only had this for a month and a half."
3.0,It came with a crystal missing.
3.0,"I ordered this dress is small and I really think it would fit me better in a smaller/petite size. I am 5'3 and 118 lbs so it was a bit too long for me. I would definitely have to wear it wish a heal. The material was pretty light but soft, but I also felt like the lake blue color was slightly less forgiving than a dark color might be. I think I am going to order it in a darker color and try it out."
3.0,"This dress is not flowy like the photo. I find the size to fit great, but it’s actually longer than I expected. I kinda feel like I’m wearing pajamas. The material is thicker but soft. Hits just above my knees, I’m 5’6”, 124 lbs and I ordered a size small. There also is a bust liner that I have to keep pulling down because it’s too small. I would not choose to wear this dress for anything except to wear over a bathing suit around the house or to the beach."
3.0,I was disappointed in the sparkle of the diamonds. The setting of the earrings were good quality.
3.0,It's ok. Really a dark gray than what is shown in the picture.
3.0,Didn't have my size. Fabric very thin.
3.0,"Pretty cheaply made as I should've expected for the price, my bad."
3.0,"Great fit but very low quality fabric that starts to tear and catch in the wash. Basically you have to hand wash these if you don’t want them to be unwearable. I have the tanks, the hoodies and the sleeveless and they are all the same. Great fit, great look, crappy fabric that gets nubs and tears and then becomes almost unwearable. The seams seem well made at least."
3.0,"Not the most flattering shape, the fabric is thin and rough, but it is nice enough to stay at home super casual and comfortable. Not really a quality like to go to a restaurant nor a meeting. Looks cheap, but it IS quite affordable."
3.0,Cheap fabric and the seams were crooked… wouldn’t recommend!
3.0,"Runs small, I would order a size up!"
3.0,run large
3.0,I am 5'9 and it was too small for me
3.0,went to my teen ager
3.0,"Liked the color. But whatever you do, dont dry it! It will shrink a couple of sizes."
3.0,its okay for a cheap pair of glasses.
3.0,"These sunglasses come packaged very nicely. They are definitely polarized. Beautiful to look at, but WAY too big for my face personally. The sides are not hinged so they don't fit my head either. It's really a shame, because they are really very nice"
3.0,"I searched for penguin earrings for girl.  They were much too large, even for a 10-year old."
3.0,The top fits ok and looks ok. But the fabric is a sheer mesh. Not just the part that is supposed to be sheer but the black fabric part is also a mesh like scratchy fabric. I bought twp of these shirts- one cold shoulder 1 vneck. Haven't returned yet but might because fabric is so scratchy.
3.0,It was a very pretty dress well-made however very uncomfortable to wear and the thick was not correct
3.0,"I really liked the design of this top. It was exactly what I thought it would be. It's nicer in the fabric department than I thought .. Poly crepe.. which gives it an more expensive look and drape. However, despite following the seller's sizing guide,  the garment is WAAAAAY too big. It said I should wear a Small.  (NO XS available). Unfortunately, it's so big that I look like I am wearing  2 sacks because it's so baggy. Going to return it."
3.0,I wear a medium and ordered a medium and it’s too tight 😞
3.0,"I’m torn here, the socks are good quality and unlike many of these types of socks, they actually stay up and don’t slip downward.<br /><br />Giving three stars because the seam is positioned across the tips of your toes (not on top of toes like most socks) so the seam definitely gets uncomfortable. They’re hard to wear for this reason.<br /><br />Also, the sizes run small for me, a male. I’d size up as I think it’s a unisex size."
3.0,"The print changed from black to maroon after one wash. Washed it in cold water and hung to dry, should not have happened. I will still wear the shirt, but I definitely liked it better when the print was black"
3.0,"It is a nice soft sweater.  However, it ran very small so I had to return it."
3.0,Cross is beautiful but chain broke first week of wear. It was a birthday gift so can't return it. Now I have to purchase a new chain for her. Disappointed.
3.0,"For me, these are a little too still and unflexible and the &#34;buds&#34; that are meant to massage your feet are too hard and hurt my feet so I ordered socks that have a notch in the toe area and that makes it easier to wear them.  Please note that I am a very tender footed person and you may not find them uncomfortable.  I bought them to replace the old Adidas ones I had for years but found these to be less comfortable"
3.0,"I’m 5’3 weigh 130lbs, 26.5” waist, 36” bra band and this dress was far too large everywhere. I ordered a small and have to return since they don’t make a smaller size. This ran like a medium"
3.0,Hurts my ears- massive earrings but cute for summer.
3.0,Very cheaply made glade didn't spend a lot for it
3.0,Lightweight and not tinted as dark as pictured. Very cute though!  I’m still wearing them occasionally and they have held up.
3.0,Not very comfortable shoes.
3.0,"I really don’t like my socks to be see through especially casual socks as it looks a bit cheap and not very aesthetically pleasing. These WXXM crew athletic socks are see through at the areas most stretched such as heels or top of foot. They’re made of 70% Cotton, 25% polyester & 5% spandex, with moisture-wicking materials. While they’re comfortable to wear the fabric is a bit thin allowing for feet to sweat through a bit. However it’s only a tiny bit, they are mostly functional but just not the type of socks I prefer. I do like the colors though but I probably wouldn’t purchase again."
3.0,"Super cute, soft cotton, but too tight across the shoulders for me. My twin loves it.  I will get a 3x and see if that works.  Don't expect it soon.  Ordered in June received middle of August."
3.0,The material of the shirt is nylon which is unexpected.
3.0,I loved this dress in every way except I'm just too short for it.  I am 5'4 and I think that it definitely would look beautiful on a woman who is at least 5'6.
3.0,"cute, but the big white stone on the top looks so cheap, like cheap plastic, there is no sparkle to it. comfortable to wear"
3.0,they were beautiful but they didn't stay secure.
3.0,I didn’t like the material it feels cheap not what I was expecting
3.0,"Nice quality, really pretty, just size way down and wear it with the right bottoms!"
3.0,Nice swimsuit but sized waaaay small
3.0,The fabric is nice the length is good as I am 5’ 3.  This is a very hard item to put on there is a side zipper but it does not allow for much room to get in and once you zip it the waste fits very tightly I am lucky I have a small waist at 25 inches but do not think it would fit anybody bigger than that kind of uncomfortable not sure if I’m keeping it.
3.0,"One of the backs didn’t screw on correctly, ordered a new pair"
3.0,"My 12 yr old daughter was so excited to get this with her bday money. It looks great and the actual charms are holding up nicely. I am disappointed to say that the connecting rings aren’t strong, so the charms fall off. She lost her first charm less than 24 hours after getting this. She had to get her jewelry making supplies out and swap the rings so that she wouldn’t keep losing charms."
3.0,"This was not my style and reminded me of doilies and something you'd wear to church with your grandma. So, if you need that type of dress this could work. The color was similar to what's advertised."
3.0,Not for a 5’ 2 mom! Runs big!
3.0,They did not fit as well at the top like I wanted.
3.0,"I submitted a review in 2018 after receiving this bag but it looks like it was taken down. There is no way this is a 60L pack.  At most, I would say it’s a 50L pack. I have a 55L pack similar in design and I couldn’t fit everything from the 55 into this so called 60. If it were advertised for its actual volume I would give it a better rating.<br />The hip belts are very thin and not supportive enough. I would be wary of putting more than 25lbs into this pack. The pack material feels ok but I wouldn’t trust it for anything more than a casual weekend trek over well established trails.<br />I took it out for an overnight trek and it held up, but I only had 23lbs of gear. Toward the end I could feel every pound with each step. This pack now sits in the corner of the closet as a back up emergency go bag."
3.0,Very well made but if you have small wrist it may be a bit big
3.0,"Absolutely love the dress and fit, but the colors bled terribly. The black & white is now bright pink."
3.0,A bit disappointed with these. The construction us a bit strange.<br />Instead of being one solid piece like a sock you pull on it looks like they took a scrappy shoe and added pieces to make it a booty.<br />They kind of dig in to my feet across the top.<br />I also found the fabric to be a bit cheap looking.
3.0,I'm sure it would look really nice on my galaxy watch if I had received the correct one. The picture depicts a different model than the description.
3.0,"Looks pretty but mine was broken when I got it. There was a gem missing and it wasn't even in the bag so I can't fix it, I am just planning on returning it."
3.0,"I purchased/ordered this product on January 16th and received it January 30th. There were all 5 rings as advertised and all looked exactly as they did in the advertised picture... but the silver one with the pink diamonds had 2 gems missing, which was super sad for me because it's the only one with different colored gems. The missing gems were not in the packet, which would imply that it was purposely put in the bag like that... I would have given this a 4-star review, but since it seemed that whoever shipped it PURPOSELY shipped one of the fauxs with missing gems, I have to give it only 3. :(((<br />They were a little bigger than anticipated, but not fake-looking which makes it ok for me.<br />Even with the pink one being basically unwearable, 4 faux septum rings isn't bad for $5, so overall it was an okay purchase."
3.0,"The pants seem like a good enough quality, but my daughter, 12 years old, is a size 16 in all her pants. So naturally I bought a size 16. They are way too small. Ridiculously small."
3.0,I wear this dress to work and out to dinner. It fits perfectly but the material is a little cheap. The xs is perfect for me - I’m 5’0” and 105 lbs
3.0,1 didnt open and 2 where so small my Pearl's wouldn't fit in them.
3.0,the connected part wont keep the flap from coming loose
3.0,"Not fitted for my frame, I’m a petite typically a size 0-2. This dress was slightly loose on top and not perfectly fitted towards the bottom. Was also a little too long for me, I’m 5’0 and the dress went about an inch past my knees. I was able to get it altered and it fits perfect now."
3.0,Beautiful outfit just like pictures. My daughter was only able to wear the shirt one time and it no longer fit.
3.0,"These glasses were okay, but they (nose piece) broke on the second day worn."
3.0,Busom is for a B-cup or less.  I am a C cup and I was spilling out of the top.  The rest fits as expected from the size chart.
3.0,size runs a little small but nice looking ring just order next size up
3.0,"I am 5’4 and this is way too long for me, so returning it"
3.0,"Nice, but fit very small. I would order 2 siz4s larger than ie, next time."
3.0,The nose of each shoe came off within 2 days
3.0,The fabric is not good. It started to get damage very soon.
3.0,Nice fun pantyhose just the size is bigger then listed.
3.0,Similar to fruit of the loom in sizing and quality. Definitely not their true brand.
3.0,"This dress isn’t made out of the material in the picture. It’s literally made out of pure polyester 🤷‍♀️. The dress has the same seems in the dress shown, just in a less structured fabric. I liked the dress, I wore it for my high school banquet (sounds as cringey as it is) but it served its purpose. The zipper made the dress feel super heavy, I had the dress altered and the zipper removed because it was unnecessary. The fabric is stretchy enough the I could put the dress over my head— m not too sure why the zipper was included."
3.0,Nice dress but the elastic is a tad bit too tight for me.  Need a looser fit
3.0,"stitching is already coming loose, but its super cute"
3.0,"The fit is perfect and they are very comfortable, but they are NOT warm. The wind went right through them. They may be better as a base layer."
3.0,These are really cute and great amount for the price but they’re basically disposable. At the end of the day they changed color and o tossed. Also one of them turned my skin green.
3.0,These are warm and great for a winter ride. The only thing I hate is the big seam down the middle of the forehead. It leaves a line after I pull my helmet off. Can’t wear these for more than a hour.
3.0,"This dress is gorgeous and fits perfectly, but unfortunately it came with a hole in the lace, just a poor sewing job. Luckily, I can fix it myself."
3.0,"Super narrow on my baby girl's pudgy, adorable newly two year old feet.  She usually wears a 7 but the 8.5s still make her skin bulge out due to how narrow they are.  I am hoping they will change shape a bit as she breaks them in.  Still, she likes the way they look."
3.0,Fits tight and kinda short
3.0,"Looks good, but are run a little small.  Should have ordered a size up"
3.0,I like they breath in very well. If you sweat they stick to the body and I do not like that. I wish they were a little elerstic for easy put in and out. Generally they are good
3.0,They were nice but the back kept slipping off
3.0,I thought I had purchased a MK bangle. But I apparently I didn’t. When I put in “MK jewelry” this popped up.  I sent it back. As it’s not what I expected and kinda cheap looking for $23. They did refund me promptly
3.0,Are being used as an art project for the elementary students.
3.0,I’ve only worn it a few times and it just broke. I’m not happy. It was a cute band but doesn’t last long at all.
3.0,Cute top. A lot shorter than pictured & not the best quality but fair for the price.
3.0,This was cute but just too small on me. Order a size up! I wear a medium and ordered a medium but didnt fit
3.0,"The screen protector case is perfect, but I couldn't use the band, the metal parts hurt my wrist digging into my skin"
3.0,"Adorable, for sure. The sleeves are only about 3/4 length on me which is my only issue."
3.0,"This is super soft and very comfortable, but the top is very large.  I didn't like the big button on the front (too large for sleeping). I also didn't like the fact that I ordered capri pants and they were long pants.  I wanted shorter pants for the summer.  I kept only because it's comfortable."
3.0,"Has a vintage faded kind of look not portrayed In the photo which looks bright and vibrant. Ordered an extra large and the size is slightly smaller than expected, more specifically in the sleeves. Not a terrible product just not what I anticipated upon purchasing."
3.0,Had to return. Large was very tight. I am a 34&#34; waist.
3.0,"I ordered my usual size and this product was smaller than expected.  It was an easy return, but credit to Amazon not to me directly."
3.0,I give these 3 stars the construction is a good fabric but if you have any type of hip forget about these they will roll up. They are long if thats what you needed them for but they are kinda tight  so just make you decision wisely they also dont have that much breast area as someone else pointed out. But material-wise i say they should serve there purpose
3.0,"I like the shirt so i will keep it an sew it to fit me . Its a small and still lose . i normally ware a med.<br />It is very long on me , I am 5ft and i could use it as a dress."
3.0,"if you wear a medium get an extra large, they run SMALL."
3.0,If your child on the 2-4 years old the skirt is way too big and long.
3.0,"This skirt is very cute and stylish, but if you have a &#34;thicker&#34; waist line, it is way to tight.  I would order size up.  There is not to much stretch in the skirt either so it will fit pretty true to size, but a bit snug.  I have a thicker waistline and can wear a 27/28 skirt, but I would consider even going up to 30 for a comfortable fit."
3.0,It’s a little bigger than I wanted.
3.0,"The padding in the bra was 3 or 4 times what it needed to be. I had to remove it and use padding from another bra. The fit is comfortable, but I don’t use it for more than being around the house cause I prefer my other sport bras."
3.0,The socks tend to run small and quality is average as well...
3.0,Nothing but smaller than expected.
3.0,I was disappointed that the wallet insert broke after less than 3 months of normal use.
3.0,"Material is see through and very thin, true to size. Looks exactly like the picture!"
3.0,Liked the bag but buckle isn’t great.
3.0,"The fabric is great!  Very soft.  Nice and comfy.  The description read long sleeve, but they sent me short sleeve.  Also, the pants were very long. I need a petite length.  Have to roll up the waistband numerous times."
3.0,I do not like that there is only one climber earring and I did not realize this until after I ordered. I ended up ordering two sets so that I could wear two climbers. But because it is meant for the left ear the right one is placed upside down but still looks very cute. These are very nice earrings.
3.0,Product mostly looks as described but didn't fit well.
3.0,"This shirt is cute, but mine came with tons of loose threads and snarls and unfinished bits. It's a little thinner material and shorter than I expected (less sweater and more t-shirt). Maybe the other colors are made out of another material?"
3.0,"The torso part of these is SUPER tight and barely goes up with each size increase. I wear large normally, XXL was the right size. These are not baggy in the slightest, even two sizes larger than your normal - skin tight."
3.0,"Like this too, BUT, it Does show your midsection if you lift your arms even just a little bit. That was unexpected and not desired, for me. Otherwise, it’s very cute!"
3.0,Don’t know if it works. I used on my redwings and they cleaned up well. Just seems like I would have to do daily to keep the sheen and water proofing. Idk. Usually take my boots to store and they do for free. So could be best product even or a scam. I have no clue.
3.0,Very cute gloves but not very warm.
3.0,"They are clips, not for pierced ears which I did not find and settled for these."
3.0,"We bought this for my grandmother's phone, and it muffles the microphone pretty badly. If I and my dad hadn't tried talking clearly into it, I would have blamed the user, but, alas, it's the case. As soon as we took it off, we could hear my grandmother clearly through the other end of the call."
3.0,"Ordered a small. Runs on the larger size. I need juniors size. Super cute in person. Would wear for working out or lounge. These are tapered. Bright red just as pictured.  I ended up giving mine away. I got them for a really really good deal. So for the money I spent on them, it was worth it, but I wouldn’t drop a lot of it weren’t for the deal."
3.0,these do not fit me at all
3.0,The Chain color is very shiny.....
3.0,It was a little loose and a little big but it’s cute.
3.0,"I ordered these for someone who is a 34B bra size. I ordered the 34C cup and they did not fit at all. The product runs EXTREMELY small. The C may fit someone with an A cup, but barely. However, they do feel extremely well made and are structured nicely. The bra cups are well made.<br /><br />As a side note, they do not pay for return shipping, so it cost me $27 international shipping to send them back. Not worth it at all."
3.0,Nice but way too long
3.0,Not as nice as I thought they would be but they did serve there purpose.
3.0,Me gusta pero debería tener más volumen y durar más la batería
3.0,"Hat was big for my head, I am petite, made slight adjustments & able to wear"
3.0,these are super cute. but the color chips off.
3.0,"You get what you paid for. I found a really cute sweater for a trip & wanted to order it, but they were out of stock on the black one, so I chose this as an alternative. Its cheaply made and scratchy. Needless to say, I'll take it on my trip & will conveniently, &#34;leave it behind&#34; when I return. I know I'll never wear it again. Wasted $$. I'm glad I bought the original sweater in white, its not what I wanted but oh so comfortable & lovely. Worth the extra cost."
3.0,Really cute but when I took it out of the package it already had a hole in it. Decided to add a picture of the hole just incase the seller sees the review
3.0,I like the length of these pants but they really have no give to them. I’m super fat and I wore them once to work and was afraid all day that I might squat down too fast or something. Also they come up much too high for me to wear comfortably. I will put them in a drawer for a backup pair when needed. But will not be wearing them weekly.
3.0,The band is too tight for bigger heads.
3.0,"I ordered the xL because I'm L and, sometimes, XL, but I do not like how he sees me, the fabric is very good, but the sleeves are very broad for me, but it's in good taste."
3.0,"The actual size is ok, but they are not comfortable to me.  The top hits the shin and even back side of calf in a very stiff way that is almost painful.  I like the looks, design pattern on suede and style, but wearing and walking in for any length of time I don't think would be desirable"
3.0,"I I bought 3 pairs in three different patterns. One of them look great, though it was a little bit short. The other two where long enough, but much too tight on top. And one of the three did not match the picture of it on the website."
3.0,It's a cloth mask that does nothing more than allow you into the grocery store; the message is the most valuable thing about it...
3.0,It was perfect when I wore it then I was not able to wear it anymore after the first wash even if it was on Cold. So I am reamly disappointed.
3.0,So so on the length of the bendable coil. Broke the first one and was very careful on the next.<br />Will shop around next time.
3.0,Design is great. But the odor of the material = the poly/plastic material is very strong. That's why I had to lower the rating due to the material smell. But at such a low price - that's what you get.
3.0,"This is extremely tiny, I thought it was going to be bigger by the picture."
3.0,"This top is very cute, mine came with some of the stitching already coming out so after I re-sew that and see how it holds up in the wash I will reconsider my 3 stars."
3.0,Way too shear to wear without a dress or swimsuit under.
3.0,"These pants are comfy, but I can't wear them out of the house because they are cut oddly. The seams don't meet between the legs like they are supposed to. The seams meet up in the front of the pants. Since the back is black and the front is gray, I get an unflattering black triangle of fabric on my crotch. The black crotch triangle is way to anatomically suggestive to be seen in public. If just you want something super comfy and labia highlighting for around the house, they are great."
3.0,"I like the color, but the split on the sides goes a bit too high and can sometimes just look kind of odd. It might work better on a slightly underweight woman."
3.0,Just took awhile getting here worth wait tho
3.0,"It is OK - Cannot say anything bad about St. Jude.  It is very narrow bracelet. You cannot see the ST JUDE &#34;statues or semblence of&#34;  Wished it was wider.  The cording is good, not problems."
3.0,"Not even slightly water resistant. Big, exposed zippers let water in like a sieve. Carries stuff well and it's decently comfortable, but if you need any kind of water resistance, look elsewhere."
3.0,It fits me as a sweater shirt not like a sweater dress like I anticipated. Also the color is more pink than camel. It looked good once I put it on it just wasn't what I expected. I'm 5'3 180...I just had a baby a month ago so I still need to lose my baby weight. Hopefully once I lose weight it will fit better. I wear 13/15 jeans as I have huge hips and thighs but I wear medium shirts with a 34c chest at VS it was worth the buy I just wish it was more of a dress than a top.
3.0,"This is too long, and that's coming from someone who orders everything in tall if I can."
3.0,For me (woman) these run large. They also do not appear to have sufficient protection except in the middle section. My solution is to wear this as a second mask over a KN 95.
3.0,"SO lightweight they had me looking for a stamp to prove they're real sterling silver. I never could find one... they've beautiful, but I'd not want to give these beautiful earrings as a gift because they feel fake."
3.0,"Love the band, very classy however; Seems that the snaps that go into the transmitter are not stable. Mine keep popping out and my watch falls off."
3.0,I really liked these in person.  The were just so dang hard to clasp shut.
3.0,not so much
3.0,"Good shirts, one of them ripped straight away when I put it on but the other two are fine. Good fit but try one size smaller than you normally wear."
3.0,It fitted a bit too small especially in the stomach area.
3.0,It was cute... Just didnt like it..
3.0,Decent googles for the price they charge. They aren’t very comfortable and they tend to fog.
3.0,"This is cute, but VERY small. It is difficult to attach to the fitbit, took me about 10 minutes to be able to get it attached. But then I couldn't wear it because it is so small and tight it cut off the circulation at my wrist."
3.0,"Bought this for my Mom for Christmas.  She loves the purse, the size is just perfect for her, however the inside small zippered compartment zipper came off  and now the pocket causes issues inside the purse. She uses paper clips to keep it closed so it stays closed. Also noticed the top zipper is a bit weak.  Both should have been a bit stronger made."
3.0,"buttons pop open, I am getting mine sewn together. Very soft and comfortable."
3.0,"I love this dress. Unfortunately, my zipper broke the second time I wore it."
3.0,I was not paying attention when I ordered this product. It certainly was exactly as it described but was a bit less quality then what I was looking for.
3.0,For me this dress was just alright...if it had not been for m hubby liking it I would have returned it. It is good tshirt jersey material and the large size fits me good. Considering I am 5'10 it was a little shorter than I normally like my dresses. I was disappointed to see it is really just a inside out maxi dress..
3.0,Cute but not for plus size thighs. They just roll down my legs. They sit only at my knees.
3.0,"I have several pairs of Toad&Co hemp pants and a romper, so I had high hopes for these skirts. They are soft and seem well made, but I could tell they would start to sag and lose their shape quickly when worn. Also, even with the quality, they seemed overpriced for what they were. Returned."
3.0,"Meh. The product is soft, looks like the picture, feels like a more sturdy panty hose material. Hugs every curve. Basically it's panty hose cut up in a design."
3.0,Did feel comfort and was smaller thru the bust area.
3.0,Wish the sizing was more accurate.<br />Can't wear waste of money
3.0,"This dress is pretty cheap, and just FYI, it is pretty see through. If you are hitting the club in Vegas and trying to take somebody home, this is probably a fine choice for you, but I wouldn't wear this to church on Easter. All in all, it is fine for the price and for what it is, but nothing special."
3.0,I thought a medium would fit snug enough but it actually fit like a tshirt. Gave it to my daughter who is bustier and thicker and it fit her perfect. So it turned into a gift to wear under her work uniforms.
3.0,It was not printed on the back with full color as the front making it harder to tie.  The back has a washed out look.
3.0,"When I received this, it was torn.  I'm debating whether or not to just fix it myself or return it.  It is great for the office, however it is a little see through."
3.0,"it does not fit as expected in the breast area.  If you have large beasts, better get a bigger size.  you can always take in the sides so it does not look bad.  other than that i love the color!"
3.0,"These arrived and while I liked the colors and patterns, I was HEAVILY disappointed at the quality.<br /><br />These are pretty much stretch material that is swen on one side (in a tube) and cut. The other cuts are raw, which means that they can unravel or split.<br /><br />They're ok if you are ready to throw them away after a wash or two."
3.0,"Just ok, and big as a blanket. Wished it were a little smaller."
3.0,"This is shorter than I expected, and the lace at the top comes down farther than I wanted because the adjustable straps are themselves very elastic. If your are looking for a truly tunic-length tank top for layering like I was, this isn't really it, but the fabric and quality are still fairly good."
3.0,It had ordered 2 bracelets. They were so lovely buy I only gave it 3 stars instead of 5 stars because 1 of the bracelets arrived broken.
3.0,"nice watch and model, I recommend it.  Festina is a great brand,  and its models are spectacular, Thank you a lot"
3.0,I like the overall appearance but the leather is a little flimsy and appears it could tear fairly easily.
3.0,I got these for my kids and there were a couple of issues.  The cording is not the waxed cording used in Pura Vida bracelets. Also the sizes are huge. Two of my kids are teens and they were very big on their wrist as well as my two younger boys. The charms are cheap.  One already broke and it was a week and a half. Maybe
3.0,"This bag is perfect for a Preteen or teen to take to a dance. Fits a phone, lip gloss and small wallet."
3.0,"I gave this 3 stars because it had a very bad oder when I received it. I got this to use as my nurse bag, it has a very cute design and enough room for all my things. however I had to wash, scrub and soak this bag over and over to try to get the smell out. the first few days I couldnt use it. I'm not sure why it had such a bad oder and honestly I couldnt describe it. but as soon as I opened the plastic bag it came in , the smell was over powering. I dont think I'd purchase this again hopefully this was just a one time thing. just be prepared for anything lol hopefully no one else comes across this problem."
3.0,"I purchased this ring along with another one.  This one was much better and I choose to wear this over the fake looking ring I had also ordered (and am returning).  I had this ring two weeks with no problems, until this afternoon I looked down and it was gone.  I looked all over the house and outside and gave up.  I loved this little ring and had lots of compliments on it, but it did snag quite a bit on random things and would loosen.  I guess it had snagged upon something and I had not noticed until it was too late.  I'm debating getting another one.  If it helps anyone, my finger is a size 4 and this ring went down small enough for me.  The tail practically touched the cat's nose, but it was still cute."
3.0,They are quite cheap looking. They are very small.
3.0,"This beach cover up is just 'okay.'  I like that it is nice and light, but the material is just too thin and if you snag it on something, that's the end of the cover up.  I also prefer for my coverups to be a little longer.  I wear a size 18 and although it fits, it's a little short and doesn't cover my thighs at all.  I've decided not to use it as a coverup, but I'll pair it with a black tank top and jeans for days when I feel a little bo-ho."
3.0,Stretchy basic tank.
3.0,"Too large, thin"
3.0,Material a bit cheap .. i wear 34 to 36 European sizr .. i ordered xs it came v big on me .. i ve to make smaller
3.0,"I loved how this dress fit up too. Adorable. However it was too float, too much material on the skirt part. It made me look bigger than I am which I don't need any help with."
3.0,This shirt is beautiful and well made. But the XL fits like a medium. It is tight all over. I'm afraid going up in size will make the armholes too big.
3.0,The heart came in and it was a beautiful gift from my husband.  We never received the clasp opener that was supposed to come with it.  Hopefully this will be rectified!
3.0,"They look great, but are a little bit too big for my face, so I'm constantly pushing them back up my nose. I'm also not particularly thrilled that the description of the product is not really what it is, although I should have expected that when I saw they were shipping from China."
3.0,"For the price this isn't the best. It's very rigid, much more so than similar hats I've got from Bailey, Scalia  and other less known hats. 7 1/4 is pretty standard and I expected a better fit than a target $9 medium/large hat. If it cost less and didn't come with the Stetson brand expectations it probably would be a five star hat. Will try steam to loosen it up. Put double sided tape under the band to fix the fit. Packaging was great. Five stars for packing, showed up well protected."
3.0,The fabric is scratchy and the stitching is coming loose in some parts. The style is nice.
3.0,returned due to it not being what i really wanted.
3.0,Bit of a smudge on it
3.0,"I bought this and it was a good wallet for me right up until it wasn't. Purchased July 29, 2016 and it held quite a bit of stuff.<br /><br />It was a little hard getting cards in and out of the wallet. The outer slide-pocket was nice but it stretched out a little and I found myself having to stuff more stuff in the outer pocket to keep it from sliding out.<br /><br />About six or eight weeks ago two things happened; one was that the lining gave out on one side, which made my spare car key fall out of a hole in the stitching. Then my credit card, which I'd tucked into the outer slide-pocket, slipped out and was lost (because I had cleaned out my wallet and it had gotten loose.<br /><br />I can't say I disliked the wallet...but I wished it had lasted longer. I'm not really hard on a wallet and I expect them to last more than a year but...this one didn't."
3.0,"Color is a bit different than the photo online, but that’s acceptable for me.  However the fitting isn’t great.  It’s too large in the shoulders and underarms.  Also, I noticed this dress seems to have lots of static cling."
3.0,"I like the key chain but when you drop it, the charms fall off, they are so fragile."
3.0,I'm normally a medium and ordered a large and it was still small on me<br />And the straps were odd<br />Wish it fit its super cute
3.0,"I love the print but the pant is really wide but manageable. Why 3 stars is because it’s very see threw, I can literally see the tag threw the pant"
3.0,"My wrist is 7"" in diameter. The way I read the description, this should have fit using the last or next to last hole. I found that the last hole was too tight, the next to last hole made the watch too loose on my wrist. I  also wonder whether or not the fabric could have stretched a bit during use."
3.0,They’re kind of heavy.
3.0,I like the style but it stinks. It smells like strong acrylic paint. I've had it airing out for a week now. It's getting better but if you order this don't get excited to use it right away.
3.0,"Larger than expected. Washing it shrank it a little, but it’s not true to size."
3.0,"I wanted it for my shooting glasses but I could put 2 pairs into this case.... that's how big and clunky it is.<br />I won't send it back, maybe I'll have another use for it one day. ;)"
3.0,"Two of the 6 earrings had discolored metal on them even in the package, but the other 4 with only resin are great!!"
3.0,"Ordered a 38DDD. The cups fit well, but the band is ridiculously small. I compared it to a 34, and the bands were the same size...I had to buy an adjuster to make it work. You might want to size up to be safe? Could just be the one I got was defective."
3.0,"Not really quite the mint I was looking for but that's all in personal preference. My daughter is still going to like it, I hope."
3.0,"I like the fact that they are clear, but I hate that they feel cheaply made. They are very flexible and I am always checking on the ball to make sure it's still there. Me being  paranoid ??? I doubt it. See for ur self."
3.0,Nice shirt. Just ordered too large.
3.0,"cute but a little flimsy and runs a tad small. i returned and won't be buying a replacement in a larger size. not bad, just not for me."
3.0,The fabric was nice and flows well. The sizing was a bit off. I wear a 12/14 or L/XL and this was large on the bottom and the bust area. The length was about 4 inches below my knee. I'm 5'4 and this will have to be altered..
3.0,Really small for the ages stated. Not worth the investment!
3.0,"I got this for Halloween, but the print is only on the back.. and any amount of breeze would cause the bottom of the wings to sort of fold. I couldn’t justify wearing it so I ended up wearing an entirely different costume."
3.0,I love the color but the pants don’t stay up well and you have to keep pulling up
3.0,"It is much larger than I expected. I don't have tiny ears, but it looks bulky in both my tragus and forward helix. It is very pretty though."
3.0,Got it as described but can't wear them because they are cut weird on the ends and it hurt too much to put one in! And I pierced my own nose!
3.0,Like the bracelet overall! Only bad thing is the magnet isn’t strong enough. It comes undone a bit.
3.0,needed a watch I can disinfect so this works for me
3.0,"We ordered 2...one was perfect , the other one was screwed down too tight an broke upon opening. I complained to company an got a replacement one no charge...no hassle."
3.0,The item arrived with the strap broken
3.0,Too many defauls with sewing  right the zipper and the hip I have to fix it because I like the color
3.0,"This looked great on the model in the picture, not so much on me. I wear a small, have a petite physique, and this just looked goofy on me, particularly the shorts. However, I think I'll be able to wear the top with a pair of jeans shorts once the weather gets warmer, so I didn't return it."
3.0,"I loved the fit, fabric and print, but they were NOT straight-leg. The bottom had a slight flair to them, which made them look odd as ankle pants. Sadly, I had to return them."
3.0,Pockets ripped out after one week. Otherwise looked nice.
3.0,"I really, really wish the tummy control panel started lower. It starts at about the belly button, and my lower belly is saggy from having two kids and the subsequent weight loss. The panel starts just above the loose area, and kind of pushes it down, making it even worse. Regardless, I do end up wearing these a fair amount. No pilling so far."
3.0,size up!
3.0,The purse is ok.  You get what you pay for.  One of the zippers didn't work properly upon receipt.  The bag has a weird smell - not a good smell... Other than that the bag is ok.
3.0,"I didn't listen to negative reviews! THE COLOR IS NOT AS IT APPEARS ONSCREEN! It is a VERY greenish yellow! NOT what I wanted, but I was hoping the comment by the previous buyer was just a fluke. Additionally, I should have realized that I wouldn't use 2 - 3 of the pieces, They are as described online, so that's my problem.<br /><br />I will use the three biggest pieces when I travel, just because they are bright and not easily walked off with, nor left behind, and the sizes of the largest three are functional for travel purposes."
3.0,"shipped very late almost 6 days later than projected. glasses produce brightness while driving at night, also help somewhat on rainy days, can also be used as sunglasses."
3.0,Material was not soft so was disappointed.  Fit is fine and they look nice.
3.0,"It's a cute dress, in a beautiful royal blue, with a sultry shape and cut.<br />It does run small, had no stretch and I did not think the top part was generously cut, I'm a 36G, it covered but had no drape left.<br />I did have to return it."
3.0,"You definitely get what you pay for. Not the best quality made product but for the price, it is good enough."
3.0,"Purchased for a volleyball banquet. Quality is fine, but saying is “never lose yours passion for the game” instead of “your.”"
3.0,"I really like these glasses and the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars, is because one of the things that hold the glasses on the nose isn't set correctly like the other one."
3.0,Capes are as expected but came with tissue paper over the logos which I assume was to protect them as the capes are folded up. Problem is that the paper stuck to all of the logos on the capes. Going to try a few things to hopefully remove the stuck on paper.
3.0,Very static-y. Cheap material. And extremely long on me...more of a tunic length (at least in the back) than a blouse. Also is dry clean!! Ugh. I only kept it because I like the color and the light weight and should be fairly simple to have shortened if I decided to bother with it.
3.0,"Would have liked the straps that go around the ear to be not as bulky; maybe with a more petite cinching device. Also, I just needed the face cover since I have melasma and I jog outside...so I cut the neck portion off."
3.0,It’s made well but there’s no way to put the ghost in the trap. It doesn’t open which is so sad.
3.0,Love the fit and how it looks. Came with a hole in the back so I will have to return though.
3.0,It's a little too big for me.It doesn't fit me very well
3.0,"The jacket fits perfectly, but the vest is tiny and the pants aren't even close to fitting. I ordered 38R/32 which should have been exactly what I needed, but the cut is way too small."
3.0,"It's nice, it fits but  I think if  the gum or the substance that makes it sticky can be modify in a way that it can stick on the skin and don't peel of it would be best. Because it peel off the skin. But I liked it just wish it improve."
3.0,It is cuter but some what long. I have a short torso and it was almost tunic length on me. Cute otherwise.
3.0,"I bought this to wear under a dress and give my flabby tummy some support.  I ordered a size up as some other reviewers recommended and I'm glad I did.  As with most shapewear, it takes some effort to get it on but that let's you know it's doing what it's supposed to.  It sucks the tummy in and provided the support I was looking for.  However, the cut-out crotch was way too big (and even though it is big, it's useless) and made my privates bulge in a very unflattering way.  You couldn't really tell once I put my dress on over the shapewear and I liked how it slimmed my body and sucked in my problem areas.  I decided, though, not to wear the shapewear for several reasons.  First,  the cut-out crotch would still make it tricky to use the bathroom, I would have to take off my dress and the shaper to use the toilet.  Second, the shapewear pushed my underarm fat up and over my bra highlighting back fat bulge. I decided I'd rather have a less firm tummy area and not have to strip down to use the bathroom by not wearing the shapewear."
3.0,baja calidad en el material.
3.0,"These gloves seem nice but are way to big for female, small to average size hands. They should be sold as a size men's small/medium.<br />I had to return them right away."
3.0,No me gusta como queda
3.0,Not what I was expecting. It's not lined and the wrinkles were very hard to get out after unpacking. It's a stretchy fabric and if you like that then you'll like this jacket. I will not be purchasing another one.
3.0,"It's alright. It smelled really potent at first. Maybe chemicals from the colors? Anyhow, after a few hours it got better. It is hot and felt a little scratchy to me. I had to take it off after about 20 minutes. I do live in Texas though where it's in the 80's on Halloween."
3.0,Much longer than I had anticipated.  They are uncomfortable to wear under some jeans.  They are warm which is good in cold country.  One of straps was not attached well and now needs to be repaired.  I would not buy again.
3.0,"Colors bright and cheerful and comfortable, but dress runs very large."
3.0,Good price but needed to be adjusted.  Didn't cover my chest area very well and got my shirt very dirty while cooking.  Fabric is good and soft.
3.0,Cute designs but too tight on my babies head
3.0,If you are going to get this product I'm here to tell you they run really small I'm a medium had to return then for a large but had no problem with the seller on my return
3.0,"They are ok. Cute, but they run really big and they are kind of flimsy. My daughter’s toe would poke out the side so she never wanted to wear them."
3.0,The pendants are great but the chains are the dog tag type chain and it was to short so it was not able to go over my head. I will have to buy a separate chain to put the pendant on.
3.0,The dress is beautiful. The chest area is rather small though. It's beyond &#34;deep&#34; v neck.
3.0,I don't like the fabric that was used. I thought they would be a heavier material. Otherwise I like them.
3.0,Much shorter than in the picture. I got XL (normally wear L) and I am 5'10 this was mid tigh for me. I am keeping it to wear with stockings. Great quality and color
3.0,"Love the belt, but I'm only giving it 3 stars due to the size, don't like the fact that it was too small!!! Ordered according to the sizing chart and still was too small, maybe it will be an incentive to shed a few pounds!"
3.0,"Sooo cute in the photo but a big mess at home. Super tight, short and awkward for a 5’2 size l/xl frame. Was disappointed, planned to take this on a weekend trip. Return was easy but would have loved to wear it!"
3.0,"There are no snowflakes on the arm as depicted in photo. Otherwise, it works for the holiday purpose. :)"
3.0,I ordered a x large ang let my daughter have the large but it very cute all in all
3.0,"Cheaper quality, underwire peaks through top"
3.0,"The side and the back view is ok if you're comfortable with this hugging your love handles, but the front is not ok. The pockets are either cut funny or are in the wrong place. If I put my hands all the way down into my pockets, my fingers will stretch out below the shirt. Maybe if the shirt were longer it'd be different, but even then, with my hands outside of the pockets there's a highly unattractive bell shape going on. And I promise it's not all me lol. Shoot, I have love handles, but this makes them look like tires. Maybe the look would change if I removed the pockets? It's worth a shot. I will say it's like putting on a super cozy velour blanket - it's that soft. I like the color green as well. The red contrast is a great fall/winter look."
3.0,The color and quality did not disappointed - but it was more on the small end of a size Large.  That aspect made it not worth the money to me.
3.0,They broke within a few minutes of use.  Not for daily wear but worked for the Frozone costume I put together for an event.  Just super glued the arm back on since I didn't need them to be able to fold anyway.  Good fit for an adult.
3.0,To small for my hair/head
3.0,NOT flattering at all if you're large chested.
3.0,"It's a beautiful shirt but is definitely too clingy to be cotton. I'm on the too small for a xxl side and it is tight on me.<br /><br />I'd hoped it would be long given other people's reviews, but even the xxl shirt was short on me. At 5'7 I really didn't think I was asking a lot there."
3.0,"a bit pricey for a single, and i agree the ad is misleading. i ended up getting these which are SUPER durable, all seven colors for a great price:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00TUUOCUA Play Silks 7-Color Chiffon Cloth Set]]<br /><br />the other weird/great thing i wouldn't have expected is that the chiffon DOESN'T WRINKLE like silk does--like AT ALL. it just stays flat and smooth somehow. anyway, i recommend that set more! have fun!"
3.0,The necklace was lovely but the ear ring was broken
3.0,"The sandals are nice, but the part for the toes and the wrap around material is too hard.  It is the worst material to use for a Sandal, as within 30 minutes of wearing it my son had noticeable red marks around the Achilles and in between his toe."
3.0,"Poor stitching, bottom under the criss cross was stickingout funny. Unfortunate because it was a sexy dress."
3.0,"This is a nice little hoop earring. I have been looking for a really small pair of white gold diamond hoop earrings and these were exactly what I had in mind. The problem is that the diamonds are not very good quality. The diamonds are quite cloudy, but since they are so small, you really can't tell unless you look very closely. There is still some sparkle, mostly from the white gold prongs that hold the diamonds in place. If it were not for that, I would rate them 5 stars. I did keep them because the size is so perfect and the price was right, plus free shipping. Overall, they are OK."
3.0,"Nothing special about this suit - the material is very thin, I felt like I could rip a hole in it at any moment. The pattern and style of the suit was cute but just not for me!"
3.0,The pockets make the dress stick out. It fit well. I ended up sewing the pocket shut.
3.0,"After the first washing,(gentle cycle, cold water, hang dry) the waist band started rolling.  Most uncomfortable band sightly."
3.0,was not too supportive.
3.0,"These are really inexpensive, so perfectly fine as &#34;fun&#34; pair of shades.  But they feel clunky and like $10 glasses."
3.0,"The band itself is comfortable, however the clasp doesn't have anything to hold it so it continuously pops out and catches on things. I am no longer able to wear it and have only had it a few months."
3.0,The chain is nice but very sensitive at the same time mines snapped already after my first use
3.0,"These pants have a nice feel to the material, but they run very small.  I usually wear a L, or XL but these pants are extremely tight in an XL.  They may work for women with smaller thighs, but my shape just doesn't work with these pants."
3.0,The band fit my charge 3 without any issues.  Does not appear to be silicone band.  The material appears to me plastic or vinyl and is not as flexible as my previous silicon Fitbit band.
3.0,"This romper was cute, but it wasn't for me. I got compliments on it, but I was uncomfortable with the colors. AND they weren't as vibrant as the picture....."
3.0,I love this skirt! The built-in boyshort fits perfectly. The material feels great. My only issue is that the waistband is too tight at the very top & it does start to dig in. My belly is slightly bigger than my hips. If I was even slightly pear shaped this would fit perfect.
3.0,"I purchased the blue Christmas trees.<br /><br />It came sooner than expected but that's about all I can really say is a win with these. They should have included a lining because they are so thin there's no way I can wear these out as pants without wearing another pair under them. That's not really a bad thing since they are winter themed leggins so layering isnt out of the question. The fabric is slick and it says polyester on here, but the tag says 100% cotton which it clearly is not (so that's a honest win for the listing for once). On the plus they don't have a nasty residue or smell. I ordered a small (I am a size 4 1/2 - 5 5ft 6in) and they are a lot longer than expected and not as skin tight as I had hoped. They are still snug enough to wear them as leggings and I can roll the legs. The seam lines up for the most part on the front but the back they don't.<br /><br />I gave this product three stars because although it's not perfect, they are still manageable for me at least. I included a photo show the incorrect fabric label, the front and back alignment, and one trying my best to show how see through they are."
3.0,"I did like the pants, however they were very large and stretched very thin (almost see through). They are perfect for someone who is smaller. They didn't work for me."
3.0,"The graphics are cool but the socks fit my husband's feet too tight.  He wears wide sizes so it was a gamble, and it didn't pay off. Can you make size 11 in a wide for men please?"
3.0,"A little small, not very deep. I probably won't be purchasing these again. If it were maybe a centimeter different it'd be fine. Still wearable though. I love the vintage vibe of the fabric, really fun to stitch on (I hand embroidered these)."
3.0,Cute ring but it's huge and I normally where this size or a size bigger on my thumb
3.0,Runs very small.. Disappointing
3.0,Hearts are super small
3.0,"Cute, but the fitting is weird. My daughter is a tall girl, and she's 2 now, so I got 2T-3T. The shorts are fitting well, but the top is kind of big, and the straps are too long, they keep falling / slipping on side (just like off shoulder outfits). I would recommend it if you're baby is chonk..."
3.0,Super tiny and not as good quality as i though...<br />Chain has to be replaced for sure.
3.0,"ORDER UP A TON. I got extra large, and I should have got even bigger. I wear medium, sometimes small."
3.0,It’s perfect disputable jewelry.
3.0,Very cheap earrings.  You get what you pay for.
3.0,"The dress is cute and comfortable. Unfortunately, the black has already begun fading after only 2 or 3 washes. Also, not a huge deal but just to mention, due to the stretchiness of the material, my phone is a little heavy for the pocket. The pocket pulls down a lot if anything with some weight is in it, but I had actually liked the dress a lot. Then I noticed the fading."
3.0,"I luv the color and pattern, I got this color in red.  I suggest sizing down. I got this in medium and it isn’t at all flattering because it is so big. I should have exchanged it, but I washed it in hopes that it would shrink. I wish I had gotten the small"
3.0,The chains are smaller then I thought. Its ok
3.0,It is very light and looks good. I just can't get it too cinch down tight enough and my pants feel loose.
3.0,"To be size 3 of girl is very big, it seems rather size 4.5. I do not have my daughter"
3.0,Too large and the sleeves were a very awkward length. The material was very thin and slightly see through.
3.0,"I like wolves, & I was looking for something a bit unusual in face covering. It doesn’t look as much like a wolf muzzle as I’d hoped (the nose is at bottom of my chin), but it’s useable & will work as face mask when I need to go out."
3.0,"SUPER short, ended up wearing the arm part under my arms as a strapless to give extra length."
3.0,I was expecting an emerald green.  The stone was a lot lighter than expected but they beautiful.
3.0,"Gave a mid star rating bc they are just wayyy to big, but warm and cute"
3.0,"I purchased three different pairs of these after reading reviews about their similarities to Lululemon Align leggings. While the cut is similar, the material of the leggings does feel cheap and somewhat inflexible. I ordered a small in the plain high waisted black ones and the high waisted black ones with the mesh block along the outside of the leg. I also ordered the white and gray heather high waisted ones in an extra small (why I chose to get the one pair that would potentially be see-through in the smaller size is beyond me). I am 5'3.5"" and 122 pounds. The white ones are a little bit snug and definitely not squat-proof, though they aren't see-through to my underwear (just noticeable color differences from my skin showing through). The black ones are both a little too big, to the point where they do not stay up well while running, especially if I put my phone in the waist pocket. Overall disappointed as I had hoped to find a more reasonably-priced legging that could replace my Aligns. I have worn them while not exercising and do not have as severe of issues with them sagging, though I do have to pull them up every once in a while."
3.0,They aren't new pants. Can tell they're recycled
3.0,"This is an awesome necklace though I just got it in the mail and it's not a choker necklace. I read in the title it was a choker but it definitely wasn't. Still happy with the purchase though, just wanted to warn others!"
3.0,Pins were too small - came with spare pins that are the exact same size. Comes with a little tool to remove the pins which is a plus. Also a plus the band is fully adjustable by just prying the clip apart - no need to visit a jeweler.
3.0,"Easy to attach (and a little too easy to detach if the tab in the back gets pushed -- I've found my watch on the ground). But I'm a small woman, and of course the company can't afford to make different sizes. So I have a big hunk of leather sticking out . Still better than the artificial band that comes with the watch."
3.0,Scratchy material. A little odd shaped at the bottom. It's not horrible... But I definitely tucked this away for another try or for a friend lol
3.0,"This was really cute. Doesn't wash well. We used it once for Easter and then tossed it. That wasn't my intension, but when I washed it, it started to fall apart. It was bigger then I thought and I had to roll up the cuffs. Still glad I purchased it."
3.0,"I got the yellow and really like the color. It is a nice fit and nice material, However.... it is very sheer. I'll need to wear a slip to hide the bottom and tank or cardigan to hide the top."
3.0,it was too thin
3.0,I just fell in love with it. So very beautiful! My only problem was it came out of the silver holder and brokei n half on my floor. Otherwise it was an amazing piece of jewelry.
3.0,The cut in the croch is small and several pairs ripped after 2 use. Nice color and you get what you pay for
3.0,Its good but a little cheap looking
3.0,It was cute but a little too casual for what I was looking for. It looked more like pajamas or something I'd wear to walk around the house.
3.0,Gave as a gift---well received.
3.0,RIGHT PRICE TO ADD AS STOCKING STUFFER
3.0,"I didn't like the large flower on the top, which prevents one from putting pins there. You can put lots of pins on the bottom, but then how do you put it down on a table? Sides are okay, but harder to grip the thing with ends of pins sticking out.<br /><br />I did like the strawberry emery which is good for needles, and allegedly keeps them sharp."
3.0,"I love Aeropostale’s clothing, from shirts to yoga/ jogger pants.. that said, the only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is that this shirt is more of a “ burnout” tee. ( see through) you HAVE to wear a tank underneath. The description photo did not show that about this particular tee. Otherwise , not a deal breaker, it fits great and is cute with any type bottoms.Just wish I could wear without the aggravation of an undershirt."
3.0,This shirt was awkward and boxy. Certainly does not match the item's description on Amazon. Such a let down.
3.0,"Son was looking for a cute necklace for GF.  He liked this one, but didn't expect it to be the size of a $1 coin. GF liked it so I guess that's all that matters."
3.0,"Fits perfectly and super cute on! I am 5' 5&#34; and 135 lbs. I ordered a size 42 based off the provided size chart. The material is way better than I was expecting for the price. The only cons, so far, are the pads in the top are circle shaped so don't really fit well. I replaced them with some triangular shaped ones from an old suit in my closet. There was also a small hole in the side where some of the stitching came apart but that was easily fixed with a needle and thread. Overall I'm very happy with this suit purchase! Now to see how it holds up in a water environment...<br /><br />OK I just put it on again and noticed a huge hole in the bottom that the skirt hid from me the first time I tried it on. It may have just been a fluke sewing error but I will be returning it. It's a shame because it is cute and fits great."
3.0,"breaks easily, tarnishes quickly. cute for 2-3 uses.."
3.0,"Cute, but a a little stiff and ran a little small. She loves her other shoes, but these may seem stiff because they aren’t broken in yet."
3.0,has worn well
3.0,it's a tall hoodie not for bigger men with wide shoulders the quality's not that bad really but not for winter. over all you get what you pay for.
3.0,"I'm so bummed because this top doesn't look ANYTHING like the picture on the website!  It doesn't have all those gathered pleats like it shows.  And it feels more like a chiffon, rather that the cotton look on the pic. I sized ""way up"" according to the reviews and the XL is ginormous!! Even the L is pretty big.  I got the white one and a black one, and the white is quite sheer.  I'm returning them all.  Bummer!  BTW, if this comes thru under my husbands name, please know this is his wife doing this review! HA!"
3.0,"I bought this for my not yet 11 year old daughter to wear under her costume for the play she was recently in. It was very tight on her. Considering she wears size 12 jeans cinched in almost as tight as can be and they fit her perfectly in length, I expected this to fit her better."
3.0,looked cool just ended up falling off my wrist and snapping
3.0,This bag is a lot smaller than I was hoping for.  I bought one just like it and same size and I could fit folders in it perfectly for work.  This one was way too small and could not zip it with my files in it.  :( but it works perfect for a snack backpack for my sons wrestling tournaments.
3.0,"So beautiful but doesn't stay on even if u adjust the metals in the back. When u wear it, u can clearly see metals that hold it in place"
3.0,"I purchased a size I would normally wear and it was too snug in the bust area, I am a large chested lady and the dress made them look larger than normal. Other than that the dress was darling!"
3.0,"Meh. Runs small. XXL is more like a L. It's cute and I really love the straps, but not really the size I'd hoped for. Not sure if I'll wear it as it's tight and makes me feel self conscious."
3.0,This is a good replacement for the broken belt. It does it's job.
3.0,My daughter loved this gift! Quick shipping right on time for the holidays thanks!
3.0,"Super cute design and the material is nice and stretchy but it’s way more body fitted than I wanted for a long sleeve shirt, order up!!"
3.0,I bought “one size fits all” coverups before and they were humongous! I got this one because it had a small size. I can wear it but it is still really big.
3.0,Received 2 different sizes! Had to return the incorrect size. The correct one (sz- 8- 9) fit as expected with additional room.
3.0,I wanted to have this not only for my channel but also when I want to tease my husband. I love that this comes so many in one packaging but most of them I can’t use coz of the eyes placement. Maybe I don’t have a bigger eyes or something but this is not for me.
3.0,"Although I love, love, love this fabric pattern and style, and it would have fit, I returned it because the zipper kept jamming at the same place. It seemed the seam was stitched a bit too close at that place. Else I would have been happy with it."
3.0,"Fit rather small, ended up returning"
3.0,Buzz... buzz..  oh yea daddy like that...<br /><br />Works good.  Little heavy on tongue but ladies will love it.  I'd u need an uplift in your southern fun...  give it a try
3.0,NICE BUT SNUG. I REALLY LIKE THEM THOUGH
3.0,I think the pressure is just right. The color is exactly as pictured. I love being able to include my foot but leave my toes open. The only thing is they are really long. They bunch up at the ankle unless I pull them up over my knees.
3.0,I love wearing these leggings in the morning when it's freezing. They keep me warm and fit pretty well. I'm 5'5 so they bunch a little around the ankles for me. The only reason they didn't get more stars is because the gray pair came with a huge series of holes in the side. The other two pairs have been great though.
3.0,Shirt fits well but had a stain when it arrived. Still keeping as it will work for Halloween
3.0,"Rather thin material and cheap stitching. I did order a size larger so it wouldn't be too tight, but it was absolutely shapeless in the larger size.  I will definitely have to tie the back which defeats the whole purpose I was going for in buying a size bigger.  I probably won't wear it now. The material is thin, it will be tied tight and who wants that at the gym? I don't. Especially when it gets cold."
3.0,Dress is cute and fits well. It is very wrinkled but once I hit it with a steamer it’ll be perfect. Stretches to the point that I didn’t have to lower the zipper in the back. Slit is cute but the liner will show when you walk. Also has a little sash that you can tie around the waist. Definitely wearing it to work! May buy another color!
3.0,It's ok still looking for a better solution
3.0,"Just wasn't right. wanted to love them, but couldn't. The &#34;Blue&#34; is very blue (not like blue jean blue, but just blue, which may be perfect for you; wasn't for me). They remind me of old MC Hammer songs, so the baggy, wide-thighed fit wasn't quite to my liking. If you like very baggy jeans with a high rise/fitted waist, they are perfect."
3.0,If only it had a zipper?!
3.0,I’m a large and ordered xl because I wanted a loose fit. The XL is form fitting!  Yikes!
3.0,Dresses up the wristband.  Really like  the finish.  It does bend easily so be genle when attaching.
3.0,I loved the fit but the dress had multiple holes in the waist seams and under arm seams.
3.0,"After reading the reviews, I did expect it to run a little big, but the neck hole was big enough that it could fit two people's heads through there at once. Because of that, the torso of the shirt did not fit properly and looked ill fitting. Ended up returning and not bringing to my Disneyland trip. Was slightly itchy when I tried it on too, so I wouldn't have been comfortable in it for a whole day.<br /><br />May work if you shrink it a bit and use fabric softener. Wasn't worth it for me."
3.0,kinda cheap .wasnt high quality. u get what u pay for
3.0,Great purse but the chain to pit it over your shoulder was broken within hours of the event.
3.0,I honestly love the look of it but have not worn it yet.
3.0,Cute and trendy. Took forever to arrive which was annoying.
3.0,"just like photos, but a little too long"
3.0,The pockets. Dresses not true to size
3.0,"I'm 5 foot 115lbs I ordered a medium, it fits. I didn't care for the white shorts , they are see through so I just use my old ones from another suit,"
3.0,"Not good for me, Felt like in a fishbowl."
3.0,I returned this product as it was too much work to put them on my kids feet. I was spoiled by old navy ones that used Velcro so my kids could get them on and off on their own.
3.0,"This is a pretty little necklace & my daughter loves it, but the magnet that holds it shut doesn't really work anymore. This started only a few months after we got it. The hinge is tiny & I'm afraid it's going to break because of it staying open all the time."
3.0,The dress itself was nice and had a very flattering fit to it. I did not like the wine color was brighter than i thought. I purchased this for work and i just thought it was too bold. I exchanged it for a darker color.
3.0,My son started football practice and wanted some compression shirts. He is a chunky kid. I purchased this shirt but it runs small.  Maybe go up a size.  I will be reordering this again in a larger size.
3.0,an extremely tight fit could barely  close it at first recommend ordering a size up
3.0,expensive and not perfect fit
3.0,The buckle doesn’t lay flat.
3.0,Material feels a little cheap and I ordered a large and it looks like an XXL.
3.0,So I think this would work for most people but I thought it was a down jacket that collapsed down like a down jacket would- it’s thick and holds it’s shape I can’t really attest to it’s warmth in cold weather but I know it won’t pack down like I expected so for camping and adventuring it’s not ideal to take with me for most people who want this as a city jacket? You’ll be fine it’s big on me but that’s because they didn’t have my size and I went up in size so don’t judge how I say it fits .
3.0,Cute but I'd size up unless you like a really tight fit.
3.0,Fabric is not soft and it’s too big. I’ve washed it several times hoping it would soften up.
3.0,"This is a nice roomy handbag with a shoulder strap alternative. One thing I found awkward was the zipper portion at the bottom of the exterior bag, the lining was sewn upside down and you can use it if you don't mind loosing things when you open the zipper.  I don't understand why manufacturers are putting zipper sections on the bottom of a purse and if done right, it affords little space; Kinda defeats the purpose.  The other thing I'm not fond of is that no matter what computer you use, the color of the bag is medium blue.  When you get it, it's dark blue.  I can live with the two small idiosyncrasies and the bag fits all my other criteria; spacious with a soft fabric sewn in zippered separator pouch in the center so that items can be separated. The handle drop is sufficient enough to hug under your arms and the shoulder strap is detachable.  All in all, it a good bag."
3.0,"Reeeally cheap, fall apart easy"
3.0,Pretty...some of the pearls fell off
3.0,Very cute but way too small
3.0,print is blurry... but arrived early
3.0,I ordered a 2x and it was still on the tighter side.  It can be stretched by the iron but I that's irritating to do all the time.  The color is what I was looking for and the lightweight was great.  I would give it a 2 1/2 but the rating are in whole numbers.
3.0,"Love the light lavender color of this watch style band for the Gear Fit2.  I had an issue with the clasp, which was not screwed on all the way.  I was able to get out the eyeglass screwdriver and remove and replace the screw and the clasp seems much more secure.  The on-off clips are much easier to work than the band that came with the Gear Fit2.  Plus I love the added security of the watch buckle and strap loop, my single button original Gear Fit2 band kept popping off at the worst times!"
3.0,[[VIDEOID:efb20d643ce1da81765768044824e8bf]] These stretch over your wrist to get on and off. I’m used to my Velcro one that I like much better. I wouldn’t want to slide this on and off everyday as it wasn’t easy to get on. I have small wrists and need it sized small but then it’s hard to get over my hand. The colors look nice and they give variety but I can’t recommend for daily use.
3.0,Sorry to say that the leather used to make this strap is not so good.  I feel like the strap is made from beef jerky.  Smells like beef jerky?  I like the design but not the smell.
3.0,It is not lightweight and does not easily close.
3.0,It's a nice dress but did not look like the picture. I was going for a deep green dress and this is more of a teal color. The ribbon is forest green.<br />The tulle is very long (longer than the dress) and again not very dark in color.
3.0,to stiff but i still like
3.0,"Very cheap material, very short. Cute pattern, but that's about it."
3.0,This dress is adorable. I ordered a size small but was sent size XL so it looks horrible on me. I am sending back for a refund now
3.0,"I like it,  however it looks more like an 18 K bright yellow,  not a 14k"
3.0,Not as white as I would hope it to be.
3.0,Was a worn out looking hat …<br />If that’s what you want
3.0,Whoever at amazon placed a product sticker on the under tint is a jerk. I removed the sticker and it peeled and bubbled the tint. Now there is bubble and peeling in the middle of visor. Practically unusable.
3.0,I bought these for golf for my granddaughter as they listed them as adult/youth size. Ordered the medium since they didn’t have small. They were so big they fit me and I usually order a large. They should have never have listed it as a youth.
3.0,"It has this very vintage style, but unfortunately my laptop 15'' doesn't fit in its place. I need to put it where the rest of space is to close the zipper."
3.0,Back fell off after a month
3.0,"I got these to wear under a tutu, work great and very soft, but see-through!"
3.0,"For $10 it's decent, definitely shorter than it looks in the picture and for me I thought the small was bigger than I expected."
3.0,Could of bought the samething in the store but one thing I can say is &#34;my feet were never cold.&#34;
3.0,"I like the shirt, but it is too small to wear. Sizing said &#34;large&#34;. I'm 5'7&#34;, not large. And returning is too time consuming for me right now..."
3.0,"Being a busty woman, I wished they were more transparent about it being a faux wrap dress. The front is cut too deep for my comfort level. If it was a real wrap dress,it would’ve been easier to manipulate to chest area."
3.0,This set is itty-bitty so if your not tone or in shape it's not ideal.. I am 5'7 160lbs and in good shape and it was really cute I love the tie but the material is very thin and not durable...
3.0,Not the best cut. Was expecting it to be more fitted but it is definitely not. More square than fitted.
3.0,Very heavy. The backs don't do a good job of keeping this earring on my ear.
3.0,I should have listened to everyone's review on this for them being too big! They are huge. I would say at least 2 sizes bigger then needed if not more...Otherwise they are ok..shiny...I am returning them.
3.0,I would have kept the dress if it did not have the pockets. The pockets made me look larger than normal in the hip area.
3.0,"I used for a while, but eventually the band broken from the ""roller"" or metal ""rod"" (whatever is called)."
3.0,"I am trying to find a watch band that is flexible and doesn’t slide around on my arm and wrist. I thought if I spent more money on this one, I would get what I want. Unfortunately it is pretty stiff and slides around. Nice color."
3.0,"The price was unbelievable, It looked like a really cute top. The fabric was nice. I followed the sizing chart, and it fit very well. I didn't like how it looked on me though. So I ended up donating."
3.0,The head hole was too small and all of the bows were safety pinned onto the costume. The material is very stretchy and it is beautiful bright colors. My 10 year old was over the moon with this costume and loves it still.
3.0,clean hat didn't get messed up in the process of sending but its a strap back not a snap back legit hat with LK on the side just dissappinted it hey lied and put SnapBack when it's a Strapback
3.0,"The length is not what I would call &#34;tunic length&#34;. It's more like a dress on me. I'll have to cut and hem it, when I can find the time. The color is nice."
3.0,Quality could be better.
3.0,The book looks nice on the outside. But the pages are not consistent with the way you put the bills in and also several of the pages are coming out from the seam or not even attached at all. Overall quality could be better.
3.0,Beautiful and comfortable but be careful it snags a lot and last time it did with me it made my nipples bleed.
3.0,The mask are good quality. They came rather quickly after being ordered. As stated in a previous review one mask has misspelled words. Son is 8on and rest is reat kinda hard to overlook. Hopefully the mistake will be corrected before more are sent out. Overall worth it for a supernatural fans just disappointed in the one messed up since  it’s actually why I ordered them at all. 😞
3.0,This is the second one I had - the first one was given to me as a gift and first the wing feel off and then I lost the big charm.  Not made well.
3.0,I really like everything about it. The size I chose didnt fit the finger it was supposed to but dits my ring finger.
3.0,after a couple washes by hand and a couple of bike accidents where I used the gloves to brace my fall these things fell apart at the seams.  poor quality workmanship.
3.0,"Since I'm a boring working mom who doesn't sew and doesn't have a crafty bone in her body, I bought this scrub/coat set for my 6 year old for Halloween this year so he could be a doctor (I bought a stethoscope separately).  He's autistic and Halloween can be very tricky because he is very sensitive about things he wears (masks are completely out of the question).  He's very average in terms of height, weighs 50 lbs and has a lean, muscular build.  I ordered the M 6x-8 size.  In terms of length, I'd say everything is about right for that size.  I expected that I would have to roll up the pant legs and possibly the coat arms, but the waist band size is almost too small for a 6 y/o and would be crazy tight on an 8 year old.  They really missed the mark on the elastic waist which is why I docked a couple stars.  I don't think it will be too uncomfortable on my son to wear for parties and trick or treating, but it's definitely snug.  For sure size up if you're in doubt, even if you have to hem or roll up arms and legs!  Also, I was a little disappointed that the coat doesn't have any buttons or snaps, but otherwise it's not bad for the price.  Though I wish it fit better, I'm glad I found this and can check off another Halloween costume!  Hopefully we can use it for a career day at some point as well haha!"
3.0,Cute shirt but weird material on sleeves. Looked more like a pajama shirt. Which is probably what I’ll wear it for.
3.0,"Loved the watch, looks great, kept the time. Unfortunately the glass on the underside of the watch broke and cut my wrist pretty bad. Only lasted 2 and a half months."
3.0,They are thicker than expected.  Top tends to be tight.
3.0,Was not very flattering and ran a little tight.  The color is very nice and nice quality of material.
3.0,My 2yr old daughter loves her sunglasses (she's become Elsa obsessed). No complaints with the sunglasses but don't expect anything out of the case. The case came damaged where it doesn't close completely and the outsides of the case have scratches and deep marks all over it. This was my 3rd time purchasing these glasses in hopes I would get a decent case but alas I think it's just these cases that suck. Oh well...my daughter at least loves her sunglasses.
3.0,"I just purchased so do not have long term experience with this yet.  My first impressions are very good however.  The band is very comfortable and the magnet provides a solid grip.  I purchased the black band with the frame.  They also provided two extra pins.  The metal seems good quality and it's not too heavy and not too light.  I definitely recommend considering the cost is very reasonable.<br /><br />*Updated Review* 12/4/16<br />Am reducing the rating to 3 stars because I also purchased the silver band. The magnet on the silver band is not nearly as strong as on the black band.  I find myself constantly adjust it so that it doesn't slip down on my wrist. The black band is still holding tight so it could be I just received a dud silver, but am reducing rating either way due to quality control issues."
3.0,"I love Charter Club pajamas and they are very comfortable.  However, I was very disappointed in this pajama top that I bought in December.  This is the third time they’ve been washed and they now look ratty.  Very discouraging."
3.0,It has the buttons on both side of the shoes and really hard to put on and off
3.0,"I bought this dress for a wedding, while it was super cheap and convenient, it was also very grabby material so I could sometimes feel it showing the tummy section more than I like. It's not bad at all, but be away of the shaping :)"
3.0,After three washing they have shrunk just a tiny bit. They had fit perfectly but now I have to stop a couple of times in a day to 're-pull them from the ankle up. Still a nice sock but now I no longer go thru the day not thinking about them being on
3.0,"It was an alright shirt, the sewing/threading was pretty cheap and the front is too short."
3.0,"These socks are made for runners.  I am a runner.  They are thin, which.  is good, and they are taller in the ankle area, which is also good.  They also fit snug, especially where the arch is.  I assume this is so that the socks won't shift around-I get it.  Unfortunately, the fabric is rough and the snug fit is too snug for me.  My toes kept getting bunched up in the sock.  I just did not enjoy these socks.  They make work for others but didn't work for me."
3.0,The beanie was really starchy. It didn’t really want to fall like the picture shows. I tried washing and air drying it which also didn’t help the starchiness at all.
3.0,"Poor quality, questionable value even ata discounted price."
3.0,as a 3 pack for the price and for working out I'm not super upset.  With that said the quality of the product is lacking.  The pocket on one of the shirts was cut wrong and sown on cockeyed.  Its for the gym so who cares in my opinion.
3.0,"It's pretty and would be perfect if i felt it was actually going to protect my phone. If you need something to protect your phone from drops, can't say i would recommend these cases."
3.0,Product is way smaller than expected. However it is pretty.
3.0,"Great look, but I will say the very tips of the ear pieces catch on my hair almost every time I put them on. Kind of annoying."
3.0,Bought a few months ago. It's slightly warped and tarnished but I like the weathered look as I can be a bit rough on jewelry anyway. All dangles are still on. Just don't wear in water.
3.0,The feather on the end came all broken and messed up. I pulled it off and like the look without the feather now.
3.0,Nice..but my son broke the bow tie within an hour of wearing it..not very sturdy..but nice
3.0,I thought these looked good but my wife returned as they were too long for her legs. She is about 5'3&#34;
3.0,"For a one size fits all, it definitely does not. I gave it to my friend, who has no chest and it looks great on her. Great quality though!"
3.0,Said they were wide but they aren't wide and a little tight in my face!?
3.0,"Great fabric, thick and deep color, well sewn, but very short in the torso. I had to return it because the fit was way off. I expected the criss cross to be shapely and taper to the,waist, but it was awkward, and even stretching it and adjusting it to where I thought it should lay did not help.  I normally wear 10/12 and L was not right."
3.0,Very small. Would only reccomend for people 5'5 & under and only size 8 or below. Arm sleeves are very thin too.
3.0,"I liked the colors...liked the the top was higher so I wasn't &#34;hanging out&#34;...the XXL was still to small for me. I was sad it didnt fit! (I'm 5'6&#34; and wear 18/20) Seemed like it would've been a great suit and quality seemed good, too.<br />Gave it a 3 just due to sizing"
3.0,Nice bag well made lots of storage compartments
3.0,I absolutely loved this dress I got so many compliments. It is the perfect thickness so not see through but also doesn’t make you hot. I washed it 1 time and it went from a medium loose fitting dress to a crop top shirt. Shrunk so bad I don’t think I could even attempt to wear it again. Very very very disappointed seeing as how I ordered 2 more and I sent them back cause I won’t be able to wear more than once.
3.0,"The case is ok, but the glasses I bought it for don't fit. Seems to be built well enough, I'm sure I can find a use for it with other pairs of glasses."
3.0,"The color is beautiful however, it doesn't glow in the dark even after 30 minutes under bright desk lamp or after being outside in the daytime for hours."
3.0,"I wanted to like these so badly as I loved the wide waist-band and the material and the length of the inseam. I'm usually a M/L in running shorts but these seem to be a slimmer cut. I ordered the L first and they were way too tight in my thighs. I ordered the XL and still just not cut with enough room in the thigh. I have muscular thighs and these shorts are just not cut for them. The waistband was totally fine, just not enough room in the thighs. Sadly, I'm returning."
3.0,"These shorts run super super small so get like four sizes too big for you and they might fit, nice shorts would of kept them"
3.0,The seam is in the front of the shirt over the knot as well as on the sides. It doesn't look as good as similar ones I own. The mossy green color is nice though.
3.0,I liked that this mermaids hair color matches mine. But she had some holes on the back of her tail that I just couldn't get past. Her body was also flat so when she was at an angle her face looked strange and you couldn't really tell that it was supposed to be face shaped. Unfortunately I had to return it.
3.0,I got a large and it fits more like a medium. The material is heavy. I wish it was softer. It’s just ok.
3.0,a lot thinner than I thought
3.0,They’re pretty but the post type hurts my earlobes. They’re too sharp.
3.0,"Looked cuter online then in person , got for my daughter but to big for her"
3.0,Bottoms are too big
3.0,"I thought this would be more peachy / pink but it's light pink, which I'm not really into and it's not as soft as I had hoped...but I wanted to try it..."
3.0,I bought these harem pants since they're made of a material that is great for cooler weather and I like the color (that is actually blue and not black). They do not fit as regular harem pants do. The crotch is too far down making leg movement limited. I will only wear them with the leg cuffs just below my knees since that helps (no I won't be returning them). I will not buy harem pants like these again since they aren't as comfortable as the ones I've worn before. I learned from this purchase and now have a better idea of what I prefer in harem pants.
3.0,"Cute 👗, not made for my body the. I'm curvy, so not a good fit. Someone without a lot of curve it would look awesome on."
3.0,"delivered timely, received as described"
3.0,Really cute gauges. Extremely difficult to put in...
3.0,"The earrings are cute,  but they could be half off for the price I paid, especially since they kept falling out of my all day. Eventually, I just took them off and put them in my purse.  You have to buy your own backs, or they will not remain in your ears."
3.0,Soooo adorable but fits small can’t get it to stay on my head
3.0,Very well made but falls flat of desired use. Too stiff needs more give to be comfortable wear
3.0,The bracelet needs to be larger
3.0,"These look good, fit well, and work well, but this was my second pair: they both broke in the same spot.  My second pair lasted 5 days."
3.0,"The quality of the boot was less than I had hoped, for the price I don’t think they’ll hold up as a work boot..."
3.0,"VERY WARM. Not for Summer. But excellent quality, beautiful print and very comfy. I'm excited to wear it this Fall/Winter 2020."
3.0,"My little Princess Ariel loved it.  However, the fish tales and middle shell were loose in the package.  We glued the pieces back."
3.0,This fit well but it’s very see threw on the top and the material isn’t great.
3.0,Only reason I gave 3 stars was because of the design both durags started fraying my 3rd time wearing them.
3.0,"What surprised me is that its not two of the same style tights, they are different styles and what was disappointing is that the white pair of tights had several dirty streaks on it??? That is just strange and annoying, I paid for a new product not to receive a dirty pair of white tights!"
3.0,I'm not in love with these shorts. The style is cute and they appear to be well made but the material is polyester I'm guessing. I don't like how they feel. And the front gets droopy even if you tie them. Not the most flattering. I also like the blue color I purchased but don't think I'll be wearing these anywhere other than around the house.
3.0,"Fits well in the waist, but makes my legs look small compared to how gym shorts should make your legs look."
3.0,"Fits nicely, just weird in the seams."
3.0,slips off
3.0,It's cute. It tarnished after wearing it for a few hours.
3.0,"I love this, but my only issue is that the fabric is not stretchy at all, it has no give."
3.0,These are great water shoes for kids. The only issue is the plastic cap at the end of the laces fell off one shoe when we tried them on for the first time and the on the other shoe it fell off at the pool the first time he wore them.
3.0,Nice belt but runs small
3.0,"Very pretty when you first wear it, but dirt accumulates on it quickly.  Also, the material of the band is kind of irritating to the skin.  I like to sleep with my Fitbit on to track my sleep pattern, but because this band made my skin kind of itchy and sweaty, I could not keep it on for a long period of time."
3.0,"Really love this bathing suit, but lost its elastic in the bottom very quickly."
3.0,Cute size but too small<br /><br />Cute design but only made for one side<br /><br />No small compartment within purse - even for a credit card to slide in<br /><br />Good zipper<br /><br />Overpriced
3.0,Colors not as vivid as photo suggests.
3.0,"This was so cute, but it does run a bit short through the torso, and the pom-pom tail fell off after one wear.  If our kid had been fiddling with it he could have pulled it off and choked on it!  Yikes!"
3.0,I was so happy with these and I would still recommend them but it should be in Bold Caps DO NOT USE ANY SANITIZING WIPES OR SPRAYS ON THEM. With everything that’s going on I’m in the habit of constantly washing my hands using Lysol wipes and sprays on my keys purse and personal items.  But you can’t with these! Certain soaps can’t be used to clean them so my only option was to order new ones that I will rinse with water and use my UV sanitizing light . They were very comfortable and I could see very clearly and received so many compliments. But was only able to wear once.
3.0,"My sister convinced me to try this dress. It fits the way it's supposed to, it just wasn't my style. I purchased a x-large and am typically a size 10-12 (5'8, 190 lbs) in women's dresses. Quality is decent, but again it just wasn't for me. Runs a size too small."
3.0,"Although the quality of the fabric was great for the price there were a few issues for me that resulted in a return....1) way to short, I am long on the torso so might be slightly shorter on me than others but even so, SHORT 2) the area under the arms is only covered by the sheer see through material, I thought the dress covering would be attached as to hide this when lifting your arms, it’s not 3) the fabric bunched strangely at the bust area, I ordered a medium and am a 34B I filled out the top but there was strange bunching of the material."
3.0,It's beautiful although it's a little long and so it wraps more than I would have liked. It also is either a little loose over very tight. Don't think I'd buy again.
3.0,Quality is a little poor for the price. It's ok is the best I can say.
3.0,Liked the product unfortunately did not fit my samsung gear watch.
3.0,its a bit short at the sides (longer in front and back) so not the best if your tall
3.0,"I like it, just I needed to fix a little bit on tje sides of hip.....fits good but material a little cheap."
3.0,The watch is beautiful and works well. However the rose gold starts fading with time and it remains more of a gold color. There are some paint details on the watch as well.
3.0,"Very soft fabric, larger than I thought . Washes well and didn’t shrink. Scoop neck shows bra straps though."
3.0,"Could fit tighter. Not really high compression. The claim of up to 5” waist reduction is ridiculous. I may half squeezed out 1/2” reduction at most,  with these."
3.0,The glue was all over the place and poorly made
3.0,Fur not soft after one wash and the top runs small but bottoms perfect fit
3.0,"For some reason received burgundy color vest, had to returned."
3.0,"Slippers were VERY comfortable and cute! However, as other reviews have stated, they are too small. I normally wear a 9 1/2, so I ordered a 9-10. Too small. Order a complete size up. Annoying that they can't size things right!"
3.0,"I received my order and it looked very pretty with grey crocheting and silk- like lining. The only problem is I do not know how to put it on! I tried every way I could think of, but no success. Maybe others like them, but regretfully I can’t recommend it. I didn’t send it back because I had no transportation to Kohl’s or UPS."
3.0,You get what you pay for.  I was satisfied.
3.0,These gloves are just ok. The run small and would not be warm enough for a day on the slopes
3.0,"I'm only giving three stars because of promptness and overall good product quality. However the gloves I received had no compass, no square, no 'G'."
3.0,"Super Cute blousy dress. With that said, be prepared as there’s a lot of fabric here! Lined with a thicker lining. For me, I felt like it made what could be a super cute dress cumbersome and heavy."
3.0,This is a pretty dress and fit true to size.  (I ordered a large and am a size 10/12)  I only gave it 3 stars because the neckline is a little odd.  It's crossed over kind of high and looks a little awkward on me.  But it's very comfortable and forgiving.  Flowy and feminine.  I think perhaps the neckline would suit someone with a larger bust a bit better.  I'm sending it back only because I found a very similar dress with a better neckline that suits the necklace I plan to wear.....or I would have kept this one.
3.0,"So i had gotten this necklace & it was so pretty, a little smaller than expect but unfortunately i lost til so i reordered & this is the one that was sent to me. Sad that it is t the same"
3.0,The pendant looks great but the loop for the chain isn't in the right place so it hangs at a strange angle and the center part ends up on top of the crescent part.
3.0,I am using this as a gift for my female cousins 70th birthday. the advertised picture lead me to believe the Pearl's were larger.  When opening the packaging it reminded me of recycled paper and box.  It looked like a child's gift instead of someone who is the matriarch of my family.
3.0,"Lovely watch...but it's really too small.  Wrists are not actually CIRCULAR, like this band, but rather, OVAL.  I'm keeping it, but it annoys me when I wear it.  I will probably gift to a friend who has smaller wrists than mine."
3.0,Kind of cheap plastic but still cute.
3.0,These shoes were a gift.  My son seems to like them.
3.0,Wire not functional
3.0,"The glitter is not made into the band. It is sprayed on and patchy. It also comes off on things like clothes, sheets, etc."
3.0,"So I have mixed reviews for this.  I first purchased the black cardigan.  It arrived,  fit perfectly,  3 buttons,  exactly as listed.  I loooove it!! I have worn it several times.  Sooooo,  I decided to purchase another in another color.  I ordered the Fiesta,  which appears Red and also 3 buttons.  What arrived was a peachy colored cardigan with like 6 buttons. Not what I'd ordered at all.  I obviously returned that one.  Still waiting on the refund.  If you get the correct cardigan it'll be great.  Just be weary and make sure you get what you've paid for.  Someone isn't paying attention."
3.0,These bras preform well and are a great bargain but I was sent a mix of sizes. Large and XL when I only ordered XL. I wear a 38DD and the larges are too small. The XLs fit great.<br /> I contacted the seller and still no response.
3.0,Didn't wear it just didn't have the look I wanted when I tried it on.
3.0,I bought a medium. I am 5 feet tall exactly and roughly 137 pounds. I have a fairly short torso. I felt really exposed in the back and the length was wicked long. Afraid to buy a small because all the reviews are of smalls are from women who weigh 10-15 pounds less than me so I’m not positive of how it would fit.
3.0,Nice but wish I had sized up
3.0,"Too elastic, wished it was more cotton and better pocket lining."
3.0,Looks as expected but more of a shirt than a dress.
3.0,I’ve gotten these socks before and have had fine service from them. So I was surprised and disappointed that I wore a hole in the heel of one of them in less than two months of normal wear.  I am rather hard on socks due in part to unusual pressure when walking but other socks have worn better than these. They are very comfortable and the elastic at the top remains tight for a considerable time.  The only reason I gave these a three instead of higher rating was due to this one pair that has not lived up to expectations. Others that are very similar to these and that were purchased here have done well.  I would and will get these again. They are warm and comfortable and reasonably priced.  That’s about all I really expect.  I’ll give an A+ rating even though I wore a hole in one.
3.0,The torso was extra short so it looked like I had saggy boobs and the white underlining kept exposing itself. If you are shorter than 5'7 it should fit well.
3.0,Mayerial is thinner than expected.  I need to either line it or fine a long slip to wear underneath. But nicely made.
3.0,"See pics. Fake stones. Thin silver. Will bend and stones are fake will unglue or chip. See. This one came chipped but even if it hadn't, I wouldn't want the thing. Glued-on earring stones. Resin fake coral finish chipped on necklace.<br /><br />Buyer beware: Chuvora is costume jewelry made to mimic the real deal. Probably real sterling but uber thin. Not real stones I repeat not real stones."
3.0,"This is an acceptable bead, but the number and distribution of bubbles is nothing like the photo. Much simpler and less pretty in person."
3.0,Great quality fits a preteen
3.0,A little too bulky
3.0,"Definitely three sizes too small so I was disappointed but I was able to give it to my mother and she loves the quality, cut and feel. She is a true Medium and I am a XL...I ordered an XXL"
3.0,Cute but not true to size. Easy return
3.0,"Not as soft or stretchy as I had hoped. It’s comfy stiff cotton. I like that it’s a longer tee though. I’m going to be careful with drying, if it shrinks at all it will be too tight."
3.0,Didn't fit like a medium or large. A little tight
3.0,These have held on to their polish but one has bent slightly. Still looks fine when wearing but not perfect.<br /><br />I am indifferent on trying these again.
3.0,Great look but too shallow for my work bag .great price limited inside pockets.
3.0,The cheap polyester material. It did not suit my taste or expectations to wear to my goddaughter's wedding. I bought another dress. Maybe I will wear it on a date or to a dance. Cute but not elegant enough for a 6pm wedding.
3.0,Bought for running. Too slippery to wear in shoes.
3.0,"I am really not thrilled with this product. The sterling silver could be of better quality, and it is VERY, VERY small - so much so - it's hard to read the words on it. Not worth the price!"
3.0,Looks good. waterproof Quality is iffy when it comes to the buttons
3.0,A little smaller than expected. I wanted to be able to use it with a couple of layers for hiking. That will not happen. I like the quality construction of the jacket.
3.0,"Great looking sweater, however it snags and unravels easily."
3.0,That fabric is not the most comfortable. These pants would sell better with a different fabric.
3.0,"The hat looks great. And well stitched.<br /><br />I got a large for my big ol head. And circumstance wise, it's great. Depth/height ratio is too big. The hat keeps getting pushed up by the neck of my coat, smooshing the brim over my eyes, blocking my peripheral sightlines.<br /><br />After a few hours of wear, the hat was irritating my forehead so bad I had to switch. Should have used a smooth fabric to line inner brim."
3.0,My daughter likes this bra but it isnt at all as described.  It isnt a racer back but instead has a criss cross back.  It is nice but if you wanted something else you might be disappointed. Fit is perfect and ask expected.  Support seems to be as expected and decent.
3.0,"Runs small. I wear a size 8 and had to get an XL. super cute, be very thin and see through Had to return it."
3.0,"this bra was supportive but not as much as I thought, I did end up taking the padding out because it just looked weird. I don't really like the cris-cross in the back because during the day it ends up choking me. It was comfortable to wear for a whole day."
3.0,"Got these because I thought it would be nice to have a darker colored pair of sunnies. But they  look kind of funny on and look like they are made pretty cheap. I definitely won't wear these unless I have some cute makeup and a cute outfit on, you can easily start to look like a crazy lady in these.<br /><br />***update***<br />Sender did issue a full refund because I was not happy with the item. Really appreciate that, and I bumped up my review one star. Even tho I don't like this particular product, I own many other pairs from this company and they have been amazing"
3.0,I wear a size 10 so being able to get a large size is great. I wouldn't call these quality but they are a pretty good economy version. The socks are thin and dont seem like they will last very long.
3.0,"I was so excited to get this but I received the wrong pattern, not the one I chose. It was longer than I expected as I thought it would be more like a tunic length (mid thighs) and it was to my knees (I’m 5’8). The fit was good and the quality of the fabric was way nicer than I thought it would be. I sent it back and didn’t reorder."
3.0,"This umbrella is amazing.  I get stopped everytime I pass by the security desk at my office.<br /><br />In SoCal, it don't rain much so the umbrella is mainly down and looks like a katana.<br />The few times I did use it, I noticed how delicate the parts were.  The black waterproof part is super thin and sometimes leaks where it the thread is held to the spines.<br />The spines are thin and bend easily.  The main shaft bent when I leaned on it like a cane.  Trying to straighten it out, t bent it even worse the other way.<br /><br />Now it just sits there as decoration.<br /><br />I may buy another one for kicks."
3.0,"Bracelet is huge!  Could almost be an anklet (if ya had skinny ankles). Can't really find any way to make it smaller - it is very pretty, but almost entirely unwearable."
3.0,"These pants are lovely - the fabric is lovely and they are well made.  However they are straight legged,  not boot cut as described by another reviewer.  If these same pants were offered in boot cut my search for well made washable dress pants for work would be over.  Please make these in boot cut!"
3.0,Nice enough shirt but definitely too big. was hoping it would shrink in the laundry and did not and now that I have laundered it I doubt I can send it back.
3.0,"I’m 5’2” and 100lbs. I opened the dress, held it up to my frame, and it fell way below my knees. Nice fabric, tho."
3.0,"Soft and breathable. I love the color and the material is spot on. However, I'm 5'5 150 and I wear smalls or mediums. This medium was huge... I had to send it back. I may need an XS. But I so love the material. Will try again depending on color and size options."
3.0,Pretty and comfortable material but feels real loose. Constantly pulling back up. Hope it tightens up after being washed/dried.
3.0,"They aren’t terrible, they are very thing, but they are comfortable. I would size up one size if don’t want them super fitted."
3.0,"Really like these, but they are crazy thick! In some cases I can even wear my normal shoes because these are so thick. Obviously that also makes them very hot. But they are cute!"
3.0,"Part of the clasp broke after a couple of uses so I bought some stuff to fix it myself. It can also be very hard to put on by yourself, so I only gave it three stars, but I do like the bracelet and what's on it."
3.0,The print was very nice but these are definitely Asian sizes. You need to buy two sizes up. I returned mine. Plus it is very expensive for a hoodie.
3.0,The fit is fine but the colour isn't quite what i expected. I thought the fabric colours would be deeper/richer based on the photos.
3.0,Cute shirt though son wore it little
3.0,Returning. Not high quality. Nice pic tho
3.0,"Very nice fabric, but the color is not red at all.  It is more of a watermelon.  Will keep because it was a good price, however not happy with the color."
3.0,Haven't had time to use them yet but they fit very comfortably
3.0,"looks okay, would be better if it came in a box"
3.0,"i usually use  6 - 6.5in shoes but with this winter boot i bought in a 7. I love it, they are very confortable but unfortunally i have to returned because they fit very tight. i recommend 2 size up."
3.0,"The pants fit as expected but the color was not the brown mustard shown, they were very yellow. I sent them back."
3.0,"Size chart off, too small"
3.0,Just make sure to have a strapless bra!
3.0,"When the hat arrived, I put it on for fit and there was an arch in the middle of the brim. I tried everything to straighten it out, with no success. The embroidery was nice, the flamingo's were very colorful, and I liked the bow in the back of the hat. Not sure if I will wear it on my cruise."
3.0,The sweater is beautiful but the fabric is not soft it is really itchy.
3.0,these laces look great but they are to tight for adult shoes
3.0,The length was good and loved the material. The slit in the sides goes up to mid thigh though and there is no way to alter it so I can have it hit at the knee.
3.0,"The heater part works alright, but the UV part broke almost immediately."
3.0,The top is way smaller than it is supposed to be! I felt like I was wearing a size large bottom but a size medium or small top. I kept readjusting and I couldn't swim without feeling like I was flashing the hotel pool.
3.0,Small then the regular size would be .
3.0,"This is a cute dress that looks really well made, but unfortunately there were small brown stains on mine and I had to return it."
3.0,"The fold over waistband was too short for what I was searching for, it was more of what you'd find nowadays compared to a couple years ago."
3.0,"It arrived quickly in a meatal box , Looks impressive  bought it as a girt for a friend"
3.0,"Okay, so I would rate this higher. I would love to. However, I ordered the 00g. The quality is really good. The problem is that with the smaller sizes you no longer see the faces stand out on the sun and moon."
3.0,It doesn't stay in tact.
3.0,The shades definitely have some weight which I appreciate but the section between the gold frame and hold detail trim has a tacky hard clear plastic which is just unecessary. But it's a good started pair for a 13yr old.
3.0,Hi. This is a $200 watch.  NOT MORE.
3.0,"It fits well. Not too but not too small. I’m 5’5”, 170. It would be perfect except it doesn’t fall off the shoulder which is what I wanted. Just a loose fitting shirt which is cute."
3.0,I returned because the lace on the sleeve was so tight. I couldn’t get it up on my shoulders completely to even zip. Should probably size up to prevent that. Looked to be decent quality. Sad it didn’t work out for me.
3.0,Bought for a Klaus (Umbrella Academy) costume and it worked great for that. Wasn't so good as an umbrella and died pretty quick with a stiff wind. The metal piping is just extremely fragile and bends with very little pressure.<br />So just depends on if you want to use it as an umbrella in any wind or if you want for fun.
3.0,Good socks but not for winter! Not warm
3.0,"Quality is normal for inexpensive pair, but they are very small. My head isn't very big, and they are tight on me."
3.0,Love the color but they're to low on the waist and they're softer on the outside then on the inside. I'd rather they be softer on the inside on the part that is actually on my skin. They also should be higher on the waist.
3.0,Beautiful ring but there are fracture lines in the stone which appear under the light.
3.0,"This wallet is ok, aesthetics were a mild disappointment but I am keeping it.<br /><br />PRO:<br />- It's pretty thin (previously I used a wallet insert that held as much but was thinner)<br />- The single outer card slot with push cutout is handy even though it is so tight it holds just the one card<br />- It is rugged<br />- The money clip is fine for retaining bills, not weak. Really.<br /><br />CON:<br />- The color of the wallet is not consistent with the image that was associated with the item when I bought it nor was it similar to the brown in the customer pictures (posted entirely, it seems, by compensated reviewers, something that I am sadly not). &#34;Vintage Brown&#34; was the only available shade of brown at that time. I had asked a question about the color on Amazon and believed the wallet to be a sort of dark brown as depicted in the customer images but it turned out to be a slightly reddish light brown/tan. The pictures on Amazon have been updated and are now quite an accurate representation of &#34;Vintage Brown.&#34; Had Amazon offered &#34;Brown&#34; as they do now I'd have ordered that but the &#34;Vintage Brown&#34; is not so bad that I would go through the effort of returning.<br />- The texture of the wallet is smooth and extremely even which gives it a vinyl look and a leatherette feel<br />- The pull strap for the rear card area flaps out awkwardly and adds thickness to the overall design (tucking it in makes it very hard to retrieve)<br />- The window pocket has a hem that makes ID retrieval difficult as the ID card catches on the sewn-flat fold<br />- My product arrived pre-scuffed. A patch of leather had a shiny and slightly darker area as if friction had been applied to the spot<br />- It really is hard to get more cards into the wallet than it has slots. The back can take two (three if they're thin) and the window slot can barely take two. The others really resist exceeding a single card and then hold on to them like a vice if you persist on cramming the second one in<br /><br />Overall, it is durable and functional and doesn't spring open when you set it on a table - good enough."
3.0,It's a nice close but it does something strange in the back. The front is nice an smooth and the back bunches up..hard to describe it..
3.0,I always wear Men's shoe size 10.5 (USA).  Ordered 10.5 and they were way too big.  Returned for size 10.  Too big.  Returned for size 9.5!  I kept them but it was questionable.  I think I should've gotten a size 9!!!  I have NEVER worn a men's size 9 ever!
3.0,Very thin material. Runs small
3.0,"It's too short - I'm wearing it anyway, but it's way shorter then the picture"
3.0,"Really nice belt fits well looks good. But unfortunately the buckle does not hold when you bend over or squat  down it slips, so you have to adjust it constantly."
3.0,good for men's jewelry
3.0,"I collect fun brooches, and naturally a pineapple one caught my attention. This one is a lot lighter, flimsier, and plastic-feeling than other brooches I’ve bought here on Amazon. Personally don’t think it’s worth the price but eh, it’s cute."
3.0,SO so
3.0,"It is very supportive around my chest but I was thinking I was buying something that would help with my posture. Will I still use the bra? Yes, but not for what I bought it for."
3.0,"Didn't read the description and assumed because of the pictures that two anklets were included. A single purchase only includes one so if you want two, up the quantity. Other than that, the quality is what you'd expect for something thats under $10."
3.0,Cute but thin material
3.0,"I ordered this item in 2015 and loved the length, but I reordered it in 2018 and the bar is much longer. I clicked reorder on Amazon. No returns, good thing it was cheap. Great item just sad about the length."
3.0,Way to small.  You could literally buy a couple sizes larger to them to fit properly.  Other than that...the material is nice.
3.0,very thin but still get the job done would buy again if the right price
3.0,It's a tight fitting hat. Even on my 6 year old.
3.0,This is a wristlet not a belt for the waist. Very nice quality just wish it was belt size. Definitely returning not paying 30 for a wrist cuff. Quality is 5 star but size is 1 star
3.0,"I followed sizing suggestions, and description,  but definitely not accurate.<br />Definitely size up,  and if you are looking for more just above knee, don't get this one. More like mid thigh.  I ordered two, both going back.  Also, very,  very thin material.  Maybe as a swim cover up,  but definitely not as a dress."
3.0,"I love Henley's. Not so much this one. The overall fit for me is ok, if I had arms like a monkey. I'm 6' tall, weight 190. Medium build. My sleeve length is normally 34/35. This, as you will see from the picture, comes down almost to the knuckles on my hands. The material itself has a rough feeling to it on the outside.  The way polyester did back in the 70's, before new extrusion methods were learned. And it's also shiny like the polyester of old. So it's a blend of cotton, spandex and polyester, which makes it doubtful the sleeves will shrink enough for me to be able to ever wear it.  I will say this though, aside from the sleeves being too long, the shirt does fit well. It has the right length in the body, it is slim in design. That part they did get right. If you rolled up the sleeves, or have really long arms, this would make a good shirt for working around the home or outside in, as it seems very durable, almost like rip stop. . This would be good for that. Oh, and the inside of the shirt is softer than that of the outside too.<br /><br /> I did receive this product at a discounted price, for an unbiased and honest review. And I hope I helped someone. If I did a Yes vote would be very much appreciated. Thank you."
3.0,Good price but doesn't block the sun as well as the description states.
3.0,Runs very small. Had to return for one 2 sizes bigger. Looks a lot like just costume jewelry.
3.0,It's ok.  The sizing runs very small and the material is very poly.  Worked for Halloween!
3.0,Definitely size up from normal size
3.0,"The strap was too thick for the hole so it started to edge, so now the strap looks like it dry rot...."
3.0,"I loved the shirt, But had to send back because too large. =("
3.0,I ordered the footprint to late to used on our camping trip. I will give a review at a later date.
3.0,"Mask broken upon arrival, not worth the money paid"
3.0,The dress is so pretty but unfortunately it was ripped when I received it .
3.0,It was way too big and didn’t really like the design but I loved the shirt
3.0,"The dress is fine, but thin, and the seams are visible."
3.0,"i liked them a lot super cute, sometimes they'd be hard to get on & off but about after 3 months they were pretty tarnished & ended up just breaking"
3.0,Nice costume looking necklace .. It pretty with causal wear..
3.0,"I've bought the fig and honey flavor of this same product and thought it was very good. I received this bar partially melted (even though it was only 40 something degrees out today) so I put it in the fridge to harden it up. After then struggling to break/cut a piece off, found the marshmallow part to be hard to chew, probably because I had to put it in the fridge.  The flavor was still good, but the texture made it less appealing. Guess I expected more from $40/lb chocolate."
3.0,The price was inexpensive and boy is it a cheap buckle. Bareley weighs anything and came apart on the first time I tried to use it. Not worth sending back to me. Trashed it.
3.0,The print is only on the outside so it isn’t woven it’s a really bad fabric like cheezy polyester that makes you hot
3.0,"OK for the money, very thin and flimsy. You do not want to wear these without underwear!"
3.0,Fragile but good look!
3.0,Not sure what all the other reviews were so ecstatic about. The cloth seems to work well but it isn't causing me to fly over the moon like some others.
3.0,Cheap thin fabric. Too tight for the people I bought them for. Id imagine theyre good for kids or young teens. Cool patterns though.
3.0,"This was bought as a Christmas gift.  It is beautiful, but be advised, it is also teeny tiny!  I just thought it would be about the size of a pandora charm."
3.0,"Love this product, a little on the heavy side"
3.0,Missing part
3.0,The necklace is very pretty but the chain is too short. I had to buy extenders to make it fit properly. I don't know if it was just designed for children as that would make the chain a better fit. I am using these as a friendship gift to several friends.
3.0,The gown was lovely but the top part of the gown was just too large for me
3.0,"Top was super long. Basically more like a tunic/dress but if I had sized down, the neckline wouldn’t have fit right. Also, the fabric is a little see through. Ended up returning it."
3.0,"Not a bad style, but so huge that I've put aside to use for crafts."
3.0,"Cute shoes that were a little smaller in size then I thought. My granddaughter wears a size 10 kids size, so I bought a size 11 that fit her like a size 10. I should have ordered a size 12."
3.0,Super cute print and decent dress for the money. Unfortunately the top was too small for the girls so I had to return. It fit everywhere else.
3.0,"Shape isnt completely circular, it's wonky but not with the work of returning."
3.0,My daughter said it is a little snug in the waist.
3.0,"Love these bags and have the blue one. Wanted a brown one and ordered it, but it's more of a burnt orange to me than a neutral brown.  Disappointed. Will return."
3.0,I love all compression since this is a soft fit compression one should order it smaller.  i been wearing different compression the past month smaller if better for our workout and still get the same benefits.
3.0,"While this dress is really cute, if you have a large chest but a small waist it doesn't fit right. I had to return it."
3.0,"The button holes are horizontal, rather than vertical.  It makes it odd to put on, and I expect the holes to rip eventually."
3.0,"I do enjoy these shorts for more of a lounge wear, they get a little  saggy after a few hours. I do put them in the dryer as well hoping they would shrink some and that didn’t really happen. But great for running errands or hangout out but not for the gym."
3.0,"Even though this was for a child, the material is see-through and light. I wouldn't have my daughter wear this out."
3.0,TOO SMALL WAS NOT THE BIG POM POM THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS
3.0,The holder strap was too large. I couldn’t get it tight enough to hold my sunglasses on but part of the problem was the length of the earpieces. I have long hair so the slider didn’t work without balling up my hair in the back so I’m returning these.
3.0,They looked great but they were way too small. The return process did not go well.
3.0,The shorts are nice. You gotta order like 2 sizes bigger. I originally got a large pair and couldn't even fit a leg into them.
3.0,I wish the torso was a bit longer. Hits me right at my belly button.
3.0,Cool idea. But a little too bulky for me.
3.0,I am 5’6 and my dresses were a little short on me. Wish they would have been longer.
3.0,"Looks nothing like the picture runs small, and way too long I’m a Sz 10 Ht. 5’6.5” Wt 150 I got a large. I’m on a diet will try on again after I lose 10lbs"
3.0,The shirt is fine for the price. I understand that I bought a cheap product but there are a few things that other buyers should know. The material is very cheap and prone to rip and that causes major issues with the buttons. The button holes were improperly made and stitched causing one to be totally closed and the others to catch buttons and pull the stitching free. As I said I know I bought a cheap product so I am not surprised by the fact the shirt is sub par.
3.0,It's cute it's well made..mbut the waistband is tight and the skirt is too long on the larger size
3.0,Too small. Smaller than advertised
3.0,One of the Eagles was broke when I received it. The pieces that are intact are nice. One is difficult to determine what it is behind the eagle.
3.0,"The design is so cute, but the cloth looked so cheap.  I ordered different colors, hoping that the darker color might not be too visible but I was disappointed.  I love the design, and I wouldn't mind paying more if it was a good-quality cloth."
3.0,We ordered the item as pictured. It was supposed to be 3T in the Owl pattern. We received a floral fruit pattern in size 12-18 months. They sent a completely wrong item. I gave 3 stars because the jacket itself is super cute and made well. Seems like it would have been warm. I just wish they sent us the coat we ordered.
3.0,"They are a little tight on my head, I am hoping that they stretch out a little bit"
3.0,Love the product just one problem the screw that keeps the lenses connected to the earpiece keeps popping out.
3.0,"Very cute and looks exactly like pictured, but this is not meant for anyone with any kind of boobs. Constantly was riding up in the front and wouldn't stay over one shoulder."
3.0,"Ok, but the picture is rubber and that is also against skin on the inside. It sticks with body warmth..kinda uncomfortable"
3.0,"the belt is worth $15, you are not getting a belt that would be worth $30 or $50. the leather looks nice but is a little thin. i do not know if this was a mistake by Amazon, but the belt i received was not a SIZE 36 belt. i received a belt that was 36 inches long, which should have been a size 32 or 34. not worth returning will probably give it away. if you can get the right size the width and distressing on this belt are very nice."
3.0,"too heavy for me, but beautiful"
3.0,Beautiful but the print fades away
3.0,"Listing stated it came with tempered glass protector, however its only plastic."
3.0,Pretty but hard to put in.
3.0,My daughter absolutely loved it but the brass ring that holds the charm to the necklace kept coming open and the charm would fall off.
3.0,"The belt immediately lost a jewel as I took it out of the bag, the leotard was very tight and rode up even at my correct size according to the chart. Cape is cheap as well.<br />At least I look like raven with it on. Only reason I gave a 3."
3.0,"Dress was ok,but the top was too big.."
3.0,"I agree with the other reviewer about the clasp. I also got the &#34;stick&#34; clasp, not the lobster clasp. It's way too large for my wrist, so I can't make it smaller because of the stick. The picture makes it look like some of the charms are dark, but they're not. They're all a light metallic color. I tried wearing this bracelet anyway. After about an hour, it lightly snagged on something and fell apart. So there's $5 in the garbage."
3.0,"I LOVE the shape of these frames, but the lenses are really cheap and not as clear as one would like (held against the light they even have tiny tiny specks throughout the lens). This may be due to the cheap cost, though I would have hoped for better. I will probably get the lenses replaced since I do love the frame a lot. Seller was great and delivered them as promised."
3.0,"These were awesome at first. I used them for winter running. They were very form fitting, but maybe I bought them too small, and a rip developed in the taint area. This resulted in chafing, and it was really painful. I've since tried EMS wind boxer briefs, and the stitching on those is so rough that it gives me even more chafing."
3.0,Way too low cut
3.0,"They are made for someone with a bigger wrist, and there is only one piece of Velcro. It isn’t enough to keep the watch from spinning on my wrist and leaves a big piece of the band loose at the end. I added another piece of Velcro myself, but not ideal."
3.0,I gave three stars because I ordered the one with ear holes but got the one without. It is like the description says it is.
3.0,Wasn't what it looked like in the picture....Texas star isn't as bold as the picture.....wasn't worth that much money....will wear it to the Rodeo
3.0,They look good but the piece off the stone is far too long before the bend.
3.0,It fit nice and I like the fabric. It doesn’t have pockets and IT CAME WITHOUT THE BELT!
3.0,The watch looks nice but feels cheep. Witch is fine given the price I paid for it. But I would not spend the $124 it says it sales for retail.
3.0,It slips a lot. So half the time I'm walking around work with these bunched around my toes
3.0,"Fit and comfort are excellent. But if you swim every day, expect to replace this every two months. Of course at this price it’s not an undue hardship"
3.0,"I did not purchase this item from Amazon.  I was THRILLED with the way this boot fit; I wear a 6 to 6.5 and got a 7 which was far more comfortable trying them on. This is one pair of footwear that also does not aggrivate my plantar fasciitis.  I work at an elementary school in a climate that gets LOTS of rain so these were fantastic for what I needed.  I only gave them 3 stars simply because I don't wear them for anything other than outside recess supervision during the winter/wet season so therefore they do not get much wear.  I recently noted that the side of the upper boot has split in several places (around the &#34;quilted&#34; pattern) and no longer keeps water from getting into the boot.  I will not be able to wear them for the purpose they were purchased.  I will take them home for a &#34;working in the yard&#34; boot.  Saddened and looking for something similar but without the &#34;pattern&#34;,"
3.0,"I usually have to be careful when I order clothes because a medium top will be either too small or fit just right.  This top was too big for my taste.  It actually fell on the wide side.  The description says its a Medium, but the label on the inside of the shirt says it's Medium (10-12).  I will return this and get a smaller size. Otherwise, the color is very pretty and appears exactly as pictured."
3.0,"There are some great things about this dress... nice length for leggings, pockets are a plus, and it has nice movement. I bought the size I typically wear, and in the body I could have probably gone down a size, but because of the style it works out just fine. The issue I had was that the sleeves are really tight. I don't have unusually large arms for someone my size, so it seems like maybe a little more room in the upper arm area would be welcome for many. I'll probably wear it from time to time, but I won't be ordering any others."
3.0,Pretty but clasp made with lock sticking out so ver few pedants or charms fit over it
3.0,"Heavier material than I expected and didn’t have a flattering fit for my Size 12 teapot shape. Also, seemed like a material that would “grow” as the day went on. Otherwise, was a soft fabric and seemed like it would be comfortable."
3.0,These leggings are a nice quality but they are not made for a thicker girl. I wear a size 11 in pants and I could not get these pants over my thighs and butt properly.  If u are smaller than a size 11 or perhaps have a flatter butt u should be fine. I should have known better when I saw one size fits all.
3.0,"I bought the dress for a wedding.  It fit OK, but it was little shapeless.  I returned it because I found something I liked better."
3.0,I bought two of these hoodies. They are decently thick and long however they do pill up rather easily which makes them look older than they are. Both hoodies have pulled up after a couple of washes.
3.0,Way to big. Fell right off my shoulders.
3.0,Cute but cheaply made. Also a little too big on the ears.
3.0,"Nice with generous size, but heavy fabric"
3.0,The picture makes it look like it can fully cover you and wraps around you naturally but in reality it barely goes over your shoulders and if you don’t hold it closed it stays open.
3.0,I got the XL so I could wear longer through my pregnancy. I’m typically a large...this def fit like a large maybe even closer to a medium. Very small I would suggest ordering a size up or even too for a looser fit.
3.0,Masks are nice but run large - a bit overwhelming for petite/slimmer faces.
3.0,Not quite enough room to get a full breath. Needs more support
3.0,The clothes were great quality. The only disappointment was that I order the Chimmy one and got the one that said BTS army.
3.0,This did not look anything like the picture.  It was way too small and didn't lay right at all so I had to return it.
3.0,"For what I paid I expected better quality, given as gift,  both pockets seams were pulling apart, had to sow them before they were pulled off the sweatshirt, very thin material, more of a show item versus a wearable functional sweatshirt. Otherwise good gift, but little effort into material"
3.0,"I wear a women 11, a menus 8.5. These  are barely big enough and tend to slide down because of it. Otherwise as expected."
3.0,"Nice necklace, love the owl...just to big for a women...."
3.0,"About half of them work, unfortunate that it's expected at this price point."
3.0,This is not a formal dress... its cheap t shirt material<br />very disspointed!
3.0,"Wife bought it. Says it is t-shirt like material. Likes color. Doesn't like fit. Was supposed to be part of a costume but not the material she was hoping for. Also, not as wide as she wanted (narrower in the skirt part than she hoped/ seemed in photo). A little heavier and hot than she hoped."
3.0,Very pretty pattern but color of the bow in the back is not the same color of the dress
3.0,I ordered the size I normally wear and these are larger than that. I was able to alter them to fit.
3.0,I usually like all the dearlover dresses because of their modesty but I did not like the white dress! It was see through and the white didn't look like a white white it looked like an ugly white. I wore it once to an all white party because that was the only white dress I had and it was to late to look for something else. Never wearing it again. I do like the other colors though. You need to work on your white fabric please!
3.0,"I ordered up a size so it would fit like the pic and it still fits slim. Not at all like the pic.. Cute just for a maxi dress, but not if you want the look in the picture. In a size 12/14 and I ordered an XL. It fits like a large, so I suggest ordered 2 sizes up and you MAY get the look of the pic."
3.0,"I haven't bought one, but from the looks of the necklace designs I can tell that most of the constellations are not connected they way they would usually be recognized as..."
3.0,I'm not sure what going on if this dress is supposed to look like this??<br />Has weird fuzzy look on black fabric.<br />Wondering if sewn on wrong side??
3.0,"Its very pretty, but too heavy & it slides and pinches the skin."
3.0,These were somewhat small and I still could wear them. I did give them away.
3.0,"Some broken pieces in the first bag, the second bag was fine. Going to possibly look into a replacement for the broken ones. Nonetheless the color and shape is absolutely beautiful"
3.0,"It's decent, not what I was expecting, has a pungent wood aroma but not very expensive so guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,The band is stylish and durable but NOT easy to put on the fitbit
3.0,"Nice fabric, runs a big. Little compression<br />I would not buy for the compression."
3.0,"Not sure why I kept this, and have not worn it yet. I wanted something ""casual"" to pop on going to movies. I ironed it, and know it will wrinkle all the time, that is what will make it ""casual"" ??"
3.0,"I love the design on this hat and it comes just as it looks online.  However, it is abnormally large and the hat definitely does not fit my head or my boyfriend's head.  We use it as a decoration piece instead.  I wish I could wear it!"
3.0,"Super cute skirt. I really wish it was longer. I would wear it all the time. But it's really really short. Just too short for comfort. I may try adding a layer underneath to lengthen it, cause it really is super adorable."
3.0,Super thin material but pretty print. Already has a hole in It and only wore them once!
3.0,"Bit small, probably because the size up I wanted to order was out of stock. But the buttons off-center is weird. Not that they do anything, but still."
3.0,Felt large and then it began to stretch over time
3.0,"Beware, this skirt is incredibly see through. I had to wear shorts under this skirt because you could even see my slip. Otherwise it did the job I needed it to do."
3.0,"The outfit itself is beautiful. However, the material is thick and seemed more polyester than spandex in comparison to another vendor I ordered from. I didn't like the overall feel of this material."
3.0,only problem I had with these boots is the dang zipper is on the outside so if you have wide feet like myself pass on these and find ones with the zipper on the inside.
3.0,"The charm is great, super cute! The chain is very flimsy - it is a thin chain which tangles easily and broke. Before it broke it felt like the chain was a bit too short for this style of charm.<br />I switched the charm over to a new chain and love wearing it now!<br />I do wish the loop on the top of the charm was a little larger so it was easier to get into the new chain, but I made it work!"
3.0,I liked the style of the ring it is very nice.  I did not like that the ring changed colors and the silver started to peel off.
3.0,Fun but small for size
3.0,"It's a nice idea for a gift. It's for my daughter's 55th birthday in December. Rather on the tight side for a cuff bracelet. I'll still give it to her, but along with something else. Sorry, it's not as impressive in person."
3.0,The elastic digs in very tight. I recommend sizing up at least one size. I have wider hips and thighs so trying to put the one pants on was a little difficult. The pattern is cute and I liked the pockets on the back. I think the length fit well and hit right above the ankle.
3.0,I purchased it to wear when walking or riding if it rained.  Its a nice jacket but its not designed for that as it doesn't breathe so you tend to sweat more.  It will keep you dry if you are wearing it and have no intention of exerting yourself.
3.0,They slide odd like all the others I have purchased
3.0,"I though I'd give these boots a try as they are somewhat stylish for a steel toed boot.  Upon receiving, I was a bit surprised by how lightweight they were. For my taste, this was a good thing. I'm not in an industry where steel toes are necessary but having that added protection in any case when working does give peace of mind.  The two biggest things to keep in mind is that, #1, they run small...at least 1/2 size.  Order accordingly.  The second issue I have is the overall construction. It's an odd build that does not have a typical tongue.  This unfortunately makes putting the boots, surprisingly, rather difficult.  I'm not sure if that is because they are a bit small or if it is in the build structure.  However, due to the 2 reasons I mention, I'd suggest you avoid these boots and keep looking."
3.0,"I dislike the magnet. I was really hoping for a Skagen type clasp that would be secure. This slides out of place every few days and that annoys me. I will stick with it until it changes color because I do like the rose gold mesh and the rich look of it.  If you have trouble with putting clasps on and off you will like this. For me, It's just okay for now."
3.0,"I ordered a size XL so they would be baggy, around the house pants.  I am a 5’8” female, 145 pounds.  These men’s size XL are extremely fitted on me.  They are comfortable, and I do like wearing them.  But buyer beware....very, very small fit."
3.0,Looks great when you receive it at first. She wears is every day then take it off when she gets home from work. Now month later it is already bend out of shape. I guess for that price it is what you get.
3.0,Lightweight frame and the lenses seem very fragile
3.0,Super cheap material - definitely not worth the price it’s listed at. Maybe $8.99. I only know this because I used to make jewelry. It’s bottom line.
3.0,"Subpar cheap sunglasses for riding. I bought several pairs since I was going a long road biking trip and was certain I was going to break or lose any expensive pair I bought. However, the rubber on the ends of the glasses slid off easily and dug into my temple. Only buy if you are going to wear them for a short period of time."
3.0,Good light wt jacket don't pay full price wait for a sale. Company makes quality goods but are a bit overpriced
3.0,Runs a little small but fits!
3.0,These masks are a little bit large on me but I am a bit small. Also they’re made of a material that’s more nylon polyester so they get really hot and sweaty so maybe they’re better for winter. I also found that they were less breathable than other masks I have. I purchased them for a dinner meeting that was more dressed up. They look nice and did the job vs the casual super cotton pattern ones.
3.0,"I have recently gotten into coin collecting (more like coin investing) and wanted to have something that magnifies what I'm viewing more than the 4X magnifying glass that I currently own.  I figured that for less than five dollars for two of them, I'd take a chance on the Jeweler's Loupe.<br /><br />This is a well made and good looking item even though it's made in China.  It has a metal body with chrome plating and a padded plastic box and makes a good looking piece of equipment.<br /><br />However, it's not that good for coin collecting because when you focus it on something, the actual field of undistorted vision is very small and difficult to see.  It might be a good tool for looking at a diamond, but not very good for looking at coins."
3.0,"Disappointed in the fabric and fit.  Can wear, the top portion of the dress is fine, but it is smaller than expected through the hips.  Will keep, but will not purchase from this maker again."
3.0,"I purchased a large, but should've purchased a medium.  It's a cute top, but it runs bigger than expected.  The material is very thin.  I'm using it as a swimsuit cover up.  I definitely couldn't wear it without wearing something underneath."
3.0,Much smaller than size indicated. Still a great way yo carry things when traveling. Just need much larger size. 1X-2X
3.0,Posts were bent and then one fell off. Great size and very cute.
3.0,"So I bought this in the pink and white stripe with black piping and loved it so much I ordered it again in the purple with white hearts. I ordered small both times. The pink fit great, exactly as I expected having read reviews that they ran a little big. The purple one came and it is definitely a small.  Much different fit than the pink. Both are really nice and silky, but there was no sizing consistency between the designs. Even the tags are different."
3.0,"It was a beautiful dress and great price. I used it as a bridesmaid dress. The neckline was not all that great since it gapped all day and night, even with double sided tape. My bra was constantly exposed and I resorted to pulling on my dress all night. Otherwise, the rest of the dress was perfect."
3.0,"This is a nice jacket and the sizing is about right. With all the pockets on this I would think there would have been an inside pocket. You don't realize how convenient an inside pocket is until you don't have one. The sleeves are a good length. The side pockets have zippers to close them and are very deep. The zipper makes it difficult to get your hand in/out of the pocket. The pen holder on the left sleeve is not in a good spot. As you move your arm, any pen in there works it's way out of the slot. I could do without the velcro on the shoulder and move the pen slots to the outside of the pocket on the upper arm. I wore this jacket for a week until I could not deal with the lack of an inside pocket for my glasses and phone. It's beyond the return window so I guess it will get donated to charity. The quality is good. I would not buy this jacket again."
3.0,Seemed a little cheap as far as quality but looked good.
3.0,"its good for the price, but right away you can tell the leather wont last long?"
3.0,These are pretty and the design is unique but the earrings are really heavy.
3.0,Love the look of these shoes. Have other UGGs that are true to size. I highly recommend ordering a 1/2 size larger.
3.0,was thin and runs small I had to return.
3.0,"Baby yoda is really cute in this mask, but the writing is off. You can see in the pics I’ve attached. I purchased 3 masks for other people & they don’t like that the writing is cut off because of the stitching."
3.0,"It's not high quality but it is cute.  The chain appears to be thick enough to not break easily.  I think I would have preferred to have it without the cut glass.  I suggest to the manufacturer a plain silver infinity symbol future  edition of this.  But for a few dollars spent, I can't say I have any real complaints.  This will be nice at the beach this summer over a swimsuit.  Alternatively it could be worn over a shirt for a different look."
3.0,I like and it will work for my purpose HOWEVER the head band is tight and doesn't sit quite right. I will have to get some heavy duty bobby pins to hold it on and I have to figure out a way to hide the head band part. Kind of wish it was just a clip.
3.0,"Very cute, very thin tho be careful."
3.0,"I have bought several costs from this supplier. I love love the others, but this one didn’t fit well and is not as nice as pictures.  Don’t be afraid to buy from they they are awesome, easy to work with on returns. But I would not order this coat."
3.0,This like great but I had 5 of them fall off and two the backing broke off.  I don't wear shoe that often for this to happen.  Hopefully no more problems
3.0,"i got this bag for my mom and she loved it a lot. when we got it in the mail, she began to use it but the other day, the clip on the strap broke so we had to but more clips to fix it. beside the four star, its a good buy."
3.0,"I love the look of this, however the inside fabric is scratchy, not comfy as I had hoped. If the maker changed to a soft cotton or poly fabric inside, it would be perfect! The color is beautiful!"
3.0,Ok socks. On the thinner side and edging on the smaller size. Cute pattern.
3.0,"These socks are very good quality, but I was confused when I received them. They were folded and looked brand new, but upon inspection I found that there was white animal hair all over them. There were absolutely no tags or packaging for the socks whatsoever, which was odd, so I would take caution when ordering. Good quality socks, looks nice, but I had to take a lint roller to them to remove the pet hair before I could present them as a gift. Not happy."
3.0,The ones I got in the past seemed to fit much better.
3.0,I got a sage pair and a black pair. The sage pair are great. They are super soft and seem like nice quality material. The black pair is a completely different story. The material is scratchy and feels cheap. Idk why they would be different coming from the same place and same order? I’d give the sage 5 stars the black 2.
3.0,It was a little more form fitting than I thought.
3.0,Material this year very flimsy.  Will be returning.  Loved the many I purchased last year!
3.0,Cute but color fades after every wash
3.0,I like the blouse but it runs larger than I had expected.
3.0,"Hard to see the names. My grandson's name is 8 characters long, they only allow 7. Not sure why, is so small anyway. Had to abbreviate my grandson's name."
3.0,"Came from China, runs small."
3.0,"Too small and way too short.  Material, style and fit adorable if you are a tiny gal."
3.0,Says the soles hurt his feet.  Little bumps.
3.0,Cute but didn't know it would be completly see-through! Fits ok a little snug
3.0,Its okay but its just an elastic band.. not worth the buy.
3.0,I wanted to love these but they were really really small. They were very cute but were way too little.
3.0,You need thin thin thighs to wear these any higher than your knees (not really thigh-high).
3.0,"Fit is smaller than expected. Cute style, the bottoms are a bit too small. I ordered a 12-14 and I’m a 12."
3.0,"The necklace was very nice, but disappointed in the color.  Thought it was green for her May birthday, but the stone was just a clear see though stone."
3.0,I like the look but don't like the fact that the watch stops running after taking it off for the night. It less than 9 hours and it stops.
3.0,Little smaller
3.0,"5'3, 180 lbs, 38DD, purchased an XL Black 3/4 sleeve. Bought this for first date night with my husband since baby has been born, fit well in the bust and length was what I had expected due to my height. Material quality is lacking (semi-see thru on the bust where it stretched) but it's to be expected for the price. I would purchase again from this seller, just know that the quality is reflected in the price"
3.0,"Won't order a purse with 2 straps again, won't stay on shoulder, love my other Montana West bags with one strap."
3.0,"Be aware, I've bent 2 of the earrings just trying to attach the backs."
3.0,"I got my normal size and it fits me, but it's on the long side and comes down well past my waist. It also reeks of disgusting chemicals. It is cute though."
3.0,Nice enough shirt but didn't see that it's not actual minecraft.
3.0,Style is nice. It looks like the pictures. It’s on the smaller end so size up if you don’t want it to be too tight. It’s pretty thin but will probably work with enough layering. Cheap quality - I can see some string hanging out. But you get what you pay for! Overall good not great
3.0,I ordered a medium and the jacket was bigger than I expected. The zipper also does not work anymore. It will zip but the zipper will not stay zipped
3.0,Liked the design but shoe was very loose across the top of the foot.
3.0,"Bought the plus size pair. They fit in terms of I could put them on comfortably but they end up being too short, stopping right in the middle of my knee. They roll down as well. I bought them for a costume, so I'll have to find something else but I can use these for my boots"
3.0,The large was a small medium fit
3.0,"Fit small, but otherwise are comfy. Waistband is thick but comfortable. Fabric is soft. Got a large and would have preferred a roomier fit."
3.0,the top is super cute but when ordering based off the sizing chart and other peoples reviews it's a little large i can still make it work.
3.0,They are very cute but they are very difficult to breath through.
3.0,Slide off heel too easy. Had target brand pair several years ago that stayed on much better. Wanted to love them but disappointed in the end.
3.0,It's almost see-through!
3.0,Fabric is polyester...not my face.
3.0,"Vendor was right on time! But the watchband was HUGE...wish it had been compared to other watches to see the difference. I'm giving it to a friend, however. She'll love it!"
3.0,"These earrings are very cute, but they are larger than I expected."
3.0,"I would say the fit on this was true to size.  I'm a 34B and the top was just a bit too large (I purchased a medium).  The bottoms were true to size, as well, but I'm a little heavier on the hips/bottom and I didn't love where the high waisted bottoms hit on my waist or how small the leg openings were.  I ended up sending the suit back, but it wasn't a terrible fit, just not right for me."
3.0,Its not wide enough for the watch I wanted to put it on.
3.0,Wonderful gown except the arms are tight.
3.0,"The advertised photo looked more like a shimmery black. This outfit is clearly silver with a black lining and silver dot overlay.  It fits well.  I'm 5'7, 220. I got a xxl. It's a little too loud for my taste.."
3.0,It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be and come apart very easily.
3.0,"The upside is that it is pretty.<br />I find the lace a bit irritating against my skin. I tried it on over a thin shirt and where the bra hit my arms it irritated. I cannot wear it. In the few minutes I had it on it also rides up. Underneath a shirt the seams on the cups are visible, I don't like that. If I could tolerate the sensation, I would keep it because it is very pretty."
3.0,"If they weren't so big, I'd buy them for my wife."
3.0,"The good news first. The items did come, and that alone is becoming an issue with Amazon. Too many of the items ordered from Amazon are not even being delivered. I think the product will more or less do the job intended.<br />The not good news. The visors on both hats are blurry. Trying to clean the visors does not help. One visor has a scratch about 2 inches long. At least it is not in front of the eye area.<br />Also , one of the hats has a definite odor that is unpleasant.<br />OVERALL POOR QUALITY MERCHANDISE."
3.0,"Looks a lot like the Apple Watch link bracelet --- same link style, butterfly clasp, and color. It's heavier than the authentic band. The lugs fit relatively tightly. This may run a bit small; I have a 170mm wrist and wear apple's s/m sport band on the last or second to last hole, and I only removed two links to get a good fit on this band.  (Speaking of link removal, you can't do it with your fingers but it's relatively easy. The links are connected with spring bars and a tool to release the spring is included. No need for a watch hammer or anything.<br /><br />Only three stars because there are gaps visible between the links. In newer iterations of this band available from other sellers, there are no such gaps."
3.0,"Cute, but wished no zipper on side. A Velcro should be better. The laces needed to be double knotted (too loose) over all good"
3.0,"Pretty necklace, but I wish it was shinier like in the photo. I'm going to use some silver cleaner and hopefully polish it up."
3.0,"I was hoping that this would be similar to the Shock Absorber Women's Multi Sports Max Support Sports Bra Top that I had previously bought and loved.  Another review said it was the same...but not quite.  Even when I have it on the tightest setting it doesn't provide as much support as that bra.  I do use it for low impact days and do find it comfy for that.  I'd recommend trying a size down maybe if you wanted to use it for high impact, but even then, not sure if it would be enough."
3.0,"Arrived quickly, comfy, but not very durable. The pants ripped in the waistband after the first wear."
3.0,totally my fault for not seeing the zero return policy.  The masks are great but I purchased hoping to match a dress and thought I could return if they didn't match.  Of course they do not match and I cannot return.
3.0,It is shining and come as a combination of two rings. That shining matte makes it looks cheap.
3.0,I bought it in black. It looked cheap and fit weird. Sending it back.
3.0,"I like the looks and fit of the watch; however, after only a couple of months, the face of the watch is badly scratched from just everyday wear and tear."
3.0,I’ve had these for two months. They pill like crazy & are no longer comfortable. Runs true to size.
3.0,"A beautiful piece! Perfect for formal occasions. However, it was a bit heavy, but nothing too heavy to fret about."
3.0,"Its more like a choker on me which I dont like, for the price its okay"
3.0,it can be easily broken by getting tangled in hair but it is nice. just learn how to fix it if you have long hair.
3.0,"I used these once for skiing, and I felt a burning sensation on the top of my foot during skiing.  When I took the socks off after a short time skiing, I noticed very small blisters on the top of my foot by my big toe on both feet.  While they kept my feet pretty warm, I would not recommend these for skiing.  May be they will work for hiking or other uses."
3.0,Very thin and clingy material. The V neck is VERY wide and low.
3.0,Nice overall puzzle.  I did find that some pieces were sized so close to another that it was hard to decide if it was a correct fit.  Finished it with one space and one piece that didn't fit.  I had to do some close looking to find the correct spot and corrected it.  It has a great look when finished!
3.0,Purchased for my son who said they didn’t make much of a difference. We ended up returning them.
3.0,Probably won't buy again.<br />Don't see any day in my skin w this product.
3.0,Quality of the fabric was not the spected
3.0,The picture is much more dazzling than the product. The snowflake arrived bent and the chain was knotted up.
3.0,It does what it says u can see distance and up close however…. When you turn your head everything distorts and slants if that makes any sense I feel like someone drugged me. But I guess if u hold your head still it’s ok? 😵‍💫 they are light and flexible my grand daughter got a hole of them and no damage.
3.0,Disappointed..<br />stretchy but not as cute as picture. Don’t feel like returning them.
3.0,Size up  I wear a medium ordered a medium too tight at the top. No stretch at all. Dress looked nice
3.0,"Fits great, comfy cozy, but synthetic materials that, I'm sure, won't last long."
3.0,"This dress feels very $$$ and looks very nice. Seems like it should cost way more money. The reason why I returned it was because the chest part was sewn so high. I guess if you have really big boobs then it should be ok. I am not big chested but the xs dress fit the bust part perfect, except the cups did not sit at the boobs. It felt like it was almost at my neck kinda high. No matter how I pull and tugged... it look like I had really really high boobs. Couldn't do it."
3.0,Nice modern work dress. Just too small.
3.0,"My daughter loved it, but wished that the chain was a better quality and longer."
3.0,"It's a cardigan, not at all a coat or even a sweater type to keep warm.  Sized at LEAST 2 sizes smaller than US sizes... It was cute, but I gave mine away....."
3.0,Bought item in my size but is much larger than anticipated. Feel really self conscious because the bust area keeps falling down and the tie is difficult to get tight. In the water the whole thing appears as if you are wearing a giant balloon.
3.0,It falls out constantly after like a week
3.0,ordered in November received in January never again
3.0,It has a little scratch that I can't fix.
3.0,"The fabric feels like a tech material - similar to what nylon bags are made of. Pattern is fun, but size down for a bit less of a balloon look."
3.0,"My granddaughter was excited about it, however...I was not happy with the quality. There was a few seems that were snagged and bunched. There were a lot of loose threads as well."
3.0,"It was simply ok.  The turtleneck was just a mock turtleneck and loose on my neck so it hung awkwardly on me.  Just wasn't anything to get excited about.  The lace wasn't for me either - maybe a younger person (which several of the customer images show and it looks cute on all of them!)<br />I thought it was slightly shorter than expected. I had plans to wear with tights as a short dress but I think I would've felt this was too short for that.  More a tunic on me. I'm 5'8&#34; and pretty narrow.  I ordered a small and it otherwise fit me fine, except neck.  Maybe an extra small would have been better on my neck but probably even shorter."
3.0,Size was smaller than ordered so had to give it to my daughter
3.0,"This does not come with black string lace. Some cheap brown stretch cord. Cute,  but not exactly like pic."
3.0,Nice bagbut shoulder strap rings ripped off after using it a couple times.
3.0,Great price fits great
3.0,"I would have loved to love these. They’re a great style and the fabric is nice, but the fit is awful! They run very small, and nip in way too much at the waist. They also have a cheap plastic zipper. Sending them both back."
3.0,"Bought medium size, it fits well and fabric is comfortable. Color is lighter than the one seller displays. It has no tag. Will keep it though"
3.0,Good fit but I expected capri cut and these are not.
3.0,The red is more orange and I was hoping I could add more beads onto this bracelet but it's not possible.
3.0,It’s very cute and I like the calendar part but the sticky notes section on the left is awful none of them stick to anything
3.0,Overpriced compared to the market and no belt was included as advertised.
3.0,Looks great but one of the hip straps broke after the pool. The quality isn't the greatest but the price is perfect!
3.0,Had a small hole in the seam when I got it. Luckily I was able to sew it since I didn't have time to exchange it before the bachelorette party I wanted it for.
3.0,My husband is 5'9'' and weighs about 150 lbs and this was WAY too big on him. I had to sew up the back (bc we were short on time finding a replacement). You can make it work but it is very big.
3.0,I absolutely had to have this when I saw it! Love this movie! Unfortunately after a month of being on my bag the graphic faded and was barely visible anymore. :( Which I found somewhat odd as I have 5 other similar metal pins on the same bag that did not have this problem. It’s an awesome pin just would not recommend putting it on anything that will experience any sort of friction at all.
3.0,"These are cute earrings,Good for everyday wear,Not too big or too small.Pretty Purple color.I like them.I would recommend them to anyone who likes pretty earrings that arnt to big but yet very stylish,for everyday wear.They are cute!!"
3.0,The shirt was cute and good quality.  But the arm holes were huge and it looked odd when wearing it and showed part of my bra.  It would be ok for layering
3.0,Like it alot but keep getting clasp that does not open!
3.0,This shirt arrived really fast! It just fits weird. The body fits perfect. The sleeves are huge. Idk if I'm not wearing it right or what but I can't get them to look like the pic. They fall down and are just really baggy. But if I had ordered a size smaller the waist part would have been too small.
3.0,"I bought this tie about 9 months ago, and I loved it! It looks good, is made of good material, and it was a good price. However, after wearing it about 15 times in the past 9 months, the stitching started coming off. It's still wearable, but it's pretty damn disappointing to have a tie falling apart after less than a year of light use."
3.0,"The material is soft and pattern super cute, it's just hot! It is not itchy or stuck to skin, but the breathability of the fabric is equal to wearing a plastic bag. Would be great if it were cotton or part cotton."
3.0,Worked well for a while. Could use to close zippers. A nice add on. But frozen after several uses. Glad I didn’t have them zipped together when it happened. Worth it for the long trip.
3.0,This is a review of the Harry Potter socks I use them twice and by the THIRD day they had a whole I'm disappointed but overall decent quality.
3.0,These fit great; but I was hoping the fabric would be softer.
3.0,"Was really pretty but way too big. I usually wear an 8 or 10 and it says to get a L. Big all over, especially in the boob area. Stretchy material. I would've returned it for a smaller size if I had time"
3.0,"I bought this for my 7 year old to wear with his costume for Halloween. When we got it, it was in fantastic shape, we loved the look of it and the glowing lights were perfect. The problem is the fit. It's so heavy and the weight is not distributed evenly, so it falls forward and presses down on the wearer's nose. We made it through an hour of trick-or-treating but when we got home, he had a red indentation that was sore for the next day and now he refuses to wear it for dress up. This happens to both adults and children who wear it, so it's not just because he's small. It's had to become a decoration since it's painful for anyone to actually wear for too long. It's awesome as a decor item, but not really worth the money as a costume piece. Oh, another issue - the adjustable headpiece attachment keeps falling off and won't stay securely in place. I think it would have been a better design if those straps had not been removable, as they move around and I think the give contributes to the problem of it pushing down in front."
3.0,Love the look of these earrings but the post hurt & make my ears infected. They are NOT hypoallergenic!!!
3.0,It stays closed for the most part but has an uncomfortable gap between the hinged piece and the rest of the metal. It keeps scraping my nose 😩
3.0,it is ok...
3.0,"This ""2 Piece Sport Tracksuits"", is very thin fabric, and not what I expected.  It would been better if it was made with 100% cotton.  It almost feel and look like pajamas."
3.0,I'm 5'7 and 170 lbs and this is a size L color &#34;black 1&#34;. It fit fine and the pockets were well placed. The fabric reminds me of a swimsuit and in person the print was more like highlighter pink. Overall the fit is ok and so is the quality of construction but for me the fabric makes it look and feel cheap.
3.0,"Glasses are great. Fit my son well, and he seems to like them. One disappointing factor is that the paint on the black glasses has become white and flakey. Some of it to the point of falling off the glasses. That's disappointing, but the price was low, so I'm not too worried about it."
3.0,Typing is very small Making it difficult to read
3.0,"I purchased these at what should have been a steal bargain, and in 3 colors (which is why you will see identical reviews for all three). The colors are nice. However, they are cut small. I ordered a 2-XL, even though I can generally get away with an XL in tee-shirts. Not with this cut. The shirts fit snugly so go a size up if you can."
3.0,"I was not too happy with it, i had to give it to my room mate, it was too small for me :("
3.0,"I ordered my grandsons correct size, they were not as ordered, not true to size. Cute, but not sized correctly."
3.0,"Looks good but bottom jewel is loose. I don't think it will fall out, but it is very shakey and rattles."
3.0,smaller than ordered
3.0,"nice shirt, but as not much give to it, and for sure runs on the small side, sad to send back because it is a very nice shirt"
3.0,Cute but a little on the small size.
3.0,You large
3.0,es bello material super delgado ....fresco pero llego roto a un lado !!!
3.0,I thought it was a bit small.
3.0,"Ordered a small, the bathing suit design was really cute. A little confusing at first but the top was too big and the light white lining material would not stay tucked in boob cup area. Had to return it."
3.0,"It seemed fine, it just was too small. Amazon seriously has a sizing issue."
3.0,The two straps cont be connected no buckle
3.0,"Not my favorite material. Wrap dresses almost never work for me so the fact that I got this one on and to tie was good, but it’s definitely tight."
3.0,"These are scratchy but if you want a cheap choker with plenty of options, worth the money I guess"
3.0,A little too big for my kids faces
3.0,what you pay for
3.0,"I'm not a regular loupe user, but thought this would be useful to have to look at coins, jewelry, etc.<br />This loupe seems well made and the magnification is acceptable and the case it comes in is a nice touch.<br />I am a little concerned that it is apparently made of something that could cause cancer.<br />There was a little note in there that said that there part of this product that is made of a substance that the state of California has shown to cause cancer or reproductive issues. (not the exact wording)<br />I don't plan on using it too often but I will wash my hands after use and be careful of how close I hold it to my face."
3.0,"Love the shirt, but smaller than actual size, more like a S/M."
3.0,"This item is a true ""you get what you pay for"". It is cheaper and it shows but it does the job. My child wore it for her 3rd bday party and went trick or treating 3 times this year. Its a little itchy so you should wear a tshirt under. I would buy again due to price."
3.0,Too many seams and insets. Not as expected
3.0,"Arrived broken ( I fixed it) and the pink beads were chipped to reveal white underneath. For the price, not worth it to return it. It'll be a cheap option until I can replace it with something of better quality."
3.0,Love this dress. Had to do a little adjustment because the under dress was a bit too short. Other than that it's a great buy.
3.0,Good quality but can not see when lights are on.
3.0,Don’t care for the clasp on the watch. It’s was to small. Always thought it might fall off so I quit wearing it.
3.0,"I got what I paid for, cheap gloves which as expected made of cheap material. After one wear the item was not usable for another event. But at the price I paid I can't complain."
3.0,"Beautiful, but I returned it because it was too big."
3.0,"Feels more like a Demi cup but the band is a little big. This is probably very good for A and B cup gals but not so much for those of us that don't fit into those cup sizes. It is cute and if I was smaller chested and did not spill out of this, I would love it."
3.0,"The hat fits just a tad big on me, the flower was falling off so i'll have to use a glue gun and reattach. It also came smushed and I have yet to get the creases out of the brim."
3.0,"Didn't really like this skirt. I ordered a small but it was kind of big and ballooned out too much. I returned it. Decent material, just not my style."
3.0,should be wide not long
3.0,This outfit is adorable but man it is soooo thin! I guess you get what you pay for it was also so cheap. Perfect for summer I guess.
3.0,Ordered it thinking it was a dark purple but the color is more like a &#34;Barney&#34; purple. Not very dark at all. Its cute. Wish it was darker!
3.0,"First impression trying it on, it's cute enough, looks and fits like the picture... then I washed it.  The strip of plaid fabric at the bottom shrunk about 2&#34;, changing it from a cute work-appropriate dress to a casual tunic I will wear with bike shorts or leggings.  I like the look, but I wasn't expecting too much of Romwe quality, since I have purchased from this seller before.  The top is very soft, very light, comfortable material, but the plaid at the bottom is so cheap... don't buy this if you don't own an iron to put the pleats back into it!"
3.0,"Strap buckle package is very easy to fall off, himself a replacement."
3.0,"I don't dislike it but some of the reviews I read are on point. It's paper thin and extremely short. I'll be returning this ""dress"". On a positive note, it's really pretty"
3.0,"I'm giving 3 stars because I just got it. I read so many bad reviews but it was after I made the purchase. I read some that were good before I bought it, though while waiting I decided to read more. I heard it tears easily and wires poke out quickly. So far I only notice it is tight Though comfy enough to do MODERATE activity (I did pre-measure before choosing my size. Got a small). I think if you are doing heavy impact workouts while trying to achieve a smaller waist, you should get a heavy duty higher quality waist trainer.."
3.0,Standard size chap stick fits but material is to big and allows for the chapstick to fall out.  If you’re planning on using it and putting it on your keys don’t bother it’s a waste of money
3.0,"These shoes are lovely to behold but I don't feel 100% stable in them! and I'm a lifelong platform thong user. Volatiles are my usual summer go-to. I'll use these for going out to dinner, but not running around town. Too much rollover risk!"
3.0,"I liked how it looked on me. The design was flattering. But the material i did not like. Felt and looked like costume material, and reminded me of a fishnet. Low quality for the price. Was expecting better material."
3.0,They should all be a little longer.  If that happened the elastic could be lowered and could be a little wider which would not cause as much discomfort.
3.0,"It's Real 925 Sterling Silver But,... It Gets Tarnished Quickly & It's Smaller Then I Was Expecting!"
3.0,"It was described as brown, but it had a green hue . I just didn't care for the color so I returned it."
3.0,Color is amazing but was to big. Go a size down which measurements
3.0,I liked this piece because it was unique however it arrived with the chain in a giant knot that when trying to untangle just broke in lieu of returning it I am just going to put it on another chain.  Smaller than I wanted but still nice just wish it was bigger.
3.0,I guess I didn’t expect this to be so “clingy”. This is super tight and super see through. I’m a chunky though so I probably should have ordered wayyy larger of a size. I’m 5’7” and 210lbs for reference. The shirt is cute though. I just wish it fit!
3.0,"Padding was coming out of eyes, and feet were very large for foot size."
3.0,looks better in pictures
3.0,"The dress was beautiful, but unfortunately it didn't fit through the shoulders.  When I requested to return the dress I was offered $2 for the return or simply told ""to give it as a present to someone else""...I would be very cautious of buying from Arnold Austin unless you are 100% certain the product is a perfect fit.<br />Really disappointed."
3.0,"It started to lose grommets very quickly. Otherwise, a decent web belt."
3.0,"It’s fine- but it’s an extremely tiny phone pocket…. So for a sports bra, fine. For a sports bra with a phone pocket- no go."
3.0,It's cute but don't pay $16 dollars for it.
3.0,The legs were just a little bit too short so I gave them to a friend
3.0,"Its a nice dress but it runs about 3 sizes large.  I wear normally a medium, so I ordered a small, a size down as the reviews mentioned  The dress is was like a 2XL.  Gave it 3 stars I was able to pass it to a friend who loves it.  She does wear a 2XL."
3.0,"Kinda underestimated how tight why were, and how paunchy I was. Sad face"
3.0,The necklace is beautiful!  It the wear is uncomfortable. The chain does not lay well and causes pinching on my skin.
3.0,"The fleece is soft, but it sheds everywhere, and gets in your mouth if you pull it over your mouth. For this price, it should be higher quality fleece, would not purchase again."
3.0,"Hat squished with visible squish lines. I was able to pop it into usable shape but it is still noticibly squished. Rest of set absolutely adorable. Nice suspenders, cute pocket watch and the bowtie was much nicer than I expected."
3.0,"Fits me perfectly. I'm 5'4, 36-28-40. It's almost maxi length on me. Stops just before my ankles. Has an attached belt that you tie behind you, which makes this more figure flattering. The ruffle on the bottom is lovely. The print is super pretty. There's a built-in underslip, just a tad shorter than the sheer outer layer, but the slip part is backless, which I'm not comfortable with. I don't care to show everyone my bra, nor do I want to go braless. So this is most likely going to be a nightgown for me."
3.0,I ordered a blue color sweater. I expected it to be blue as posted on Amazon.<br />The sweater I got looks purple.<br />The quality and material is nice. But I don’t like this color. I’m returning this.
3.0,"Very cheaply made.  Tears extremely easily, but it is just like it's pictured and very sexy. Great for a one time use I suppose."
3.0,The bag itself is nice but I ordered a blue one and received a grey colored one.
3.0,"I am usually a medium occasionally Large (depending on style) so I ordered a small. It is a tighter fit than other shirts but fits just fine. The fabric is silkier. It is really cute on the model but not one of my favorite shirts, maybe because of the fabric."
3.0,"Fabric is very nice, so comfortable.  The shape or form of the romper is a puzzle. It seems like The shorts are supposed to be diagonal shaped-  the inside thigh is significantly shorter than the outside thigh edge. Also, my romper arrived with a missing button to close up the blouse part.<br />I am 5'1, 125 lbs, and 34dd chest, and the medium just did not sit right on me. But super soft fabric and pretty pattern."
3.0,"It's pretty sheer in the white areas. Other than that, it's a good dress for the price."
3.0,Two of these shirts were sized as expected (ran slightly small but we ordered a size up to compensate) but the 3rd shirt was a full 4 inches shorter than the other 2. Really odd.<br /><br />Not a lot of compression but works well as a wicking underlayer.
3.0,Leather on front had many dark spots .
3.0,"Fits tight across the bust, but okay if you're just bumping around the house. Wouldn't wear in public. Wouldn't order again."
3.0,"I bought this watch for my Son and he loved it, wore it everyday and it was a big hit with his friends. However after he had it three weeks he laid it on his dresser as he did every night, when he got up in the morning the clock face had shifted and it no longer works."
3.0,Pictures didn't clearly convey the tshirt style cuffs.  Had them altered and the dress looks better.
3.0,The mirror tinted glasses look pretty cool but the black frame glasses weren't what I was expecting.<br /><br />Will look at a different pack of glasses next time to make sure all of them have the mirrored lenses.
3.0,"Lovely cut slightly smaller fit, but the material is so very thin, it's about see-thru, so I'm waiting for Autumn so I can wear 2 at a time"
3.0,It gets 3 stars because it smells. Been airing it since I received this item. Will febreeze. Size and the color is suitable for the required performance in a few days. Glad it was in stock in silver.
3.0,Fabric is not as flows as to be expected or quite as nice as pictured
3.0,El vestido es muy ajustado y la tela se transparenta bastante...
3.0,Cute but pretty dang tiny. I bought another brand of the same style in the same size and they were much more true to size.
3.0,Nice but thin... transparent thin
3.0,"it's good , but not the same size as the picture shown."
3.0,Para un babyshower
3.0,"Be aware, sharp plastic, it hurts"
3.0,"I bought this collar to try and change the neckline of a dress. It looks cute but I’m a little busty and short waisted. You could see where the collar ended just across my bust thru the shirt which of course defeats the purpose of the illusion this piece is supposed to create. Maybe if it was longer or shorter it would lay differently or if the seams lay flatter it would be better I’m not sure. Also it was tight at the neck after I buttoned it. (It’s in the back)I’m going to try and make it work. Because it’s really cute and it made some of my lower neckline clothes look nice. I also liked it under my cardigans. The fabric itself was thin and breathable. The collar was still as it should have been. I loved the detail, too bad it didn’t lay right on me."
3.0,"The fabric wasn’t as cottony as I expected but was still comfortable. If you’re a sweaty person, it may not be for you as it doesn’t breathe very well but that doesn’t bother me. After looking at photos and reviews, I thought it would help hide my “spare tire” around my waist. I was wrong. I even went a size up and it just wasn’t flattering to my belly or waistline. I do have a larger bust and thighs and it fit there nicely. Had to return. :-("
3.0,"The sweatshirt was great.  Graphics all look great, except for the title of ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"".  It reads ""Joseph and the OK Technicolor Dreamcoat"".  ?????"
3.0,Really great design but poor quality wallet -_-
3.0,"the pattern is so cute, but the white part is pretty see through."
3.0,its a mask
3.0,These socks are good my son loved them.  They do stretch out to white very easily though.
3.0,"Nice dress to schlep around in and wearing over a swim suit.  After a few washings, the  fabric begins to fray.  Not top drawer quality, but not too bad for the price."
3.0,Placed order and when received the bathing suit had some unfinished edges. I contacted the seller and they worked promptly to fix the issue and resent another suit that looks better. Do read the sizing charts when ordering this item. I ordered a 5xl and it does fit me a little big but not to the point where it's falling off. In normal clothing I wear a size 18-20 in jeans and a 2-3x in tops. Nice bathing suit to add to collection. You get what you pay for being that this bathing suit was under $20. Happy shopping!!
3.0,"Cute and different, not UV protected."
3.0,"After several washes, you see pills in the fabric.  Perhaps this item should be washed inside out?"
3.0,The item looks good but quality wise it looks very cheap not as shiny as it shows in picture bends wayyy too easy
3.0,Not very soft. Would need to layer for sure or be itchy. Pretty see through as shown in pics. It fits well comakderimg most sleeves are long on me and these werent. The aleeves are weird and completely plain almost and I just didn't like how it looked. Between the feel and the see through its going back. A darker color may have looked a lot better.
3.0,"Cute, and it will be used, but the child size is an adult size, definitely not a kid's."
3.0,It's nice though
3.0,The watch band catches on clothing because some of the edges are not finished well. Item was returned.
3.0,Material was &#34;costumey&#34; too silky and too shiny so I returned it.
3.0,"I normally have this brand's mid size. After put the white one on, the shoulder have wrinkles and bumps due to seam. It does not look right. It looks made for wide shoulder folks. It is not up to the bar of this brands' other cloth."
3.0,"Very pretty dress. However, the pleated area on the bottom was really a concern for me- because of the way its packaged and shipped theres a combination of wrinkles and pleating and I was unsure of what the best method to remedy this would be. Also, the dress arrived with a hanging string right on the chest area which I was afraid that removing would undo something."
3.0,"Shirt is cotton and looks nice but I would not call it flannel, I'm looking for a heavier weight flannel.  For the price, I will be returning and continue my pursuit of a great flannel."
3.0,"I purchased these as apart of my costume for Ren Faire. Unfortunately I had to take them off 10 minutes into walking around because they kept sliding down my calf. I attempted to retie them tighter, but considering the material...you’ll be apprehensive to tug too much in fear of unraveling/breaking them. If you don’t plan to do much walking, they work."
3.0,It was too small.  I had to return it.
3.0,the bracelet doesn't adjust at all
3.0,Let’s just say you can see it all when wearing these pants. They were maybe a tiny bit too small but not enough to where you should have been able to see as much as you did with these - and trust me I own the tik tok leggings.
3.0,Broke the 2nd week :( Super cute alternative to my crappy work lanyard til it broke on me.
3.0,Nice glasses but were to big for me
3.0,Not at all like the photo
3.0,Nice fabric content. Runs small on size.
3.0,Just a little disappointed the robe did not have pockets
3.0,"I purchased this to use as a bathing suit cover-up, but it is really too short!  It needs to be at least 3"" longer In order to cover the bottom area!!"
3.0,Overall this is a nice set. The lace top is very flimsy and I feel won’t last long.
3.0,"Fit is quite tight, color is waaay. I ordered light blue and received very pail mud-like dark blue. Another made in China dissatisfaction"
3.0,"Comfy and a little supportive.  I do not recommend washing with the removable pads inside, as they will shift during the wash cycle - one went all the way to the back of the bra.  It's much easier to remove the pads, wash, and reinsert them than to try to shift them back into place.<br /><br />As a 36D, these are a little small for my girls (I think I sacrifice some support for this reason) but they're comfortable enough that it's not worth the hassle to send them back.<br /><br />Would NOT recommend using as a sports bra, but maybe for yoga or something they wouldn't be too bad.  They do not provide any compression."
3.0,"runs a little large, for the price I will keep and will try to reduce size by washing. Hope it works or pass on to someone with larger head."
3.0,Gave it to my cousin as a bday gift she love it she is a size small to medium.  I ordered a large I wear a size 7-9
3.0,Average quality but for the price not a bad deal
3.0,The colar is too wide down and the waist is a bit tight. I wish they are longer under the waist.
3.0,"Not as clear a view as I had hoped for golf course use.  They don't adequarely cover whole eye.  That said, polarization and shading exceeded expectations."
3.0,"If I tried this on at the store, I may have put it back. It's just okay."
3.0,Top was nice enough....fit more like a large instead of X-large. Will keep and give to my daughter.
3.0,"Probably will return and may have purchased the wrong size, but they are really tight feeling and bending over causes an unnatural pull in the crotch area that would get really annoying if not painful over time.<br /><br />Anyone that writes a page long review of boxers is fake, im sorry."
3.0,Too small and ordered my normal glove size
3.0,Was long but didn't stay up
3.0,"Now - these aren't the kind of shoes you would hand down through 3 kids... or maybe... but if you want pretty glitter shoes to pass down these aren't the ones.  The glitter does wear off in those creases on the toe within a few wears.  They still look good.  The glitter does stay on through one wash at least! haha!  There are two soles --- the one pictured has the soft, more pliable sole.  Some colors and sizes have a cheaper more rigid sole. If you look at the picture and the sole color matches its the more rigid one.  The white ones are the softer ones."
3.0,I bought this specifically for the length. The band feels cheap but so far nothing has broke. Keeping the velcro stuck on for larger wrists is difficult. Would not have bought it if I knew this. Gave 3 stars since it’s lightweight and less noticeable but lost 2 stars because it’s not good for larger wrists.
3.0,"I love this dress and got so many compliments. I am tall and curvy, but the dress is long enough even when sitting, and the top is stretchy to fit and compliment your bust. Amazing dress!<br /><br />Nearly a year later:<br />Knocking down two stars because not even a year later I had to pitch this dress. It pilled under the arms, ripped in the pit, and also a few rips along the side seam."
3.0,It didn’t come with a head band and no clear size<br />Definitely not a newborn size
3.0,"larger than expected, but pretty"
3.0,I LOVE the style and look of this necklace. BUT this turned my skin and clothes dark gray from wearing it!!!!!!!! bummed. hopefully its only temporary but im not happy.
3.0,"Cute bracelet I bought for my girlfriend’s birthday, but she can’t wear it because the chain is child size. So just beware, cute charms, extremely tiny chain (quarter for scale)"
3.0,"Worth the price I payed, However the blue did run unto the white when I got the shirt cleaned the first time. Luckily the stains came out."
3.0,"I purchased the Blue3 size small. These are not the same shorts as pictured on the model. They are very thin and dark blue, however they do fit me... I'm 5'2, 126lbs but because their so thin, they make camal toe. They are cheap in price at $5 but you get what you pay for.  They are comfy to wear though."
3.0,"The overall quality is good but the button to change the time reacts instantly. So the time is rarely accurate, and the wristband is not adjustable. On the other hand it looks as cool in reality as it does in the picture. It's worth it if you’re no expecting anything more than a conversation piece. It's fun but that's about all. Don't pay too much for it."
3.0,"This is a nice looking watch band, but unfortunalely, I have found it snags quite a bit on different materials.  Sometimes, I have even had to cut the snag loose from the band."
3.0,Shirt fits great and length is perfect!
3.0,The patterns are off and they are way too short.
3.0,Never ended up wearing this product. It didn't meet my expectations. Still in the package in the back of my closet. I never got around to returning it.
3.0,"Love the products but sizing is not consistent<br />This is my second suit, I bought a larger size (I let the first one and love it) this one doesn't fit. Same style just different color."
3.0,If you weigh btw 200Lbs to 210Lbs. Muscular legs and 6ft. Just buy the XL. Don't waste your time with Large. Not going to fit you..
3.0,I don't know what all the hype is about with this watch. It doesn't look bad. It has all the basic features I need in a watch. The layout is nice and simple. It definitely looks retro (probably because it is). My only gripe is the ridiculously small stock band. Its tiny. Barely goes around my wrist (which isn't big). Too slim. This would fit my five year old. The built in light sucks BUT its better than my G Shock. Would I recommend? Sure. For ten bucks it is what it is. Will I buy a different band for it? Probably not. For a couple bucks I can try another Casio watch. Maybe the Illuminator?
3.0,Cute. A little flimsy
3.0,Product was too small for me. I could not wear the pants.
3.0,To heavy of material and very high rise
3.0,"Nice dress but very sheer, see through going to need to wear something under"
3.0,"I ordered 2xl for a looser fit. I would definitely recommend sizing up. Even though the dress is dark, the fabric is thin and very see-through. The button holes are poorly stitched and frayed. I do like the pattern and will wear leggings and a tank top underneath."
3.0,"I got a small (5'5, 135 lbs) and it was huge! Definitely order a size smaller if you want it to have any shape."
3.0,Too loose with small bills.
3.0,Very pretty and great pattern/colors but it was HUGE on me! I ordered a large and I'm 5'8 150lbs and I could have easily done a small.
3.0,Beautiful top.<br />One size fits all...but if you are petite and weigh 120lbs it will swallow you whole.
3.0,"Great was okay, comfortable but big should of got a smaller size, colors looked different then in photo not as bright"
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter. She is tall, but thin. I ordered the size based on her height and it was enormous. I don’t care for the fabric- it’s very spandexy."
3.0,Gave it to my granddaughter.  She loves it?
3.0,"They're cute. Not bad for the price. I wish you couldn't see my eyes while wearing them, but I still like them."
3.0,"These are very hard to get in! Once I get them in they look good, but it normally takes a while and hurts quite a bit."
3.0,"I got the navy blue - looks of high quality, installed easily, loved the look/stretch and seemed durable.<br />However, i do have pretty small wrists (125# female) and it was just a tad too big such that it slid around and didn't get a good reading. I ordered size small, so XS might work for folks like me. Wanted to share- looked great though!"
3.0,"I don't know why I expected magic from this technology, but it didn't happen. In the end it's an OK t-shirt, nothing too custom tailored or extra flattering about it."
3.0,"They're pretty good for $8 pants. They're gym pants so it's not necessary for them to be top notch, for me at least. They seem durable and decent material. If in the US order a size or two bigger, they fit fine around the waste at your normal size but wherever these pants are from, they obviously don't squat in that country haha."
3.0,"The item fit fine around my width but didn’t seem long enough to cover my entire torso, so I would up with a line around my upper waist/torso and it was obvious through my dress."
3.0,Not as well made as most of the jewelry
3.0,It's tight. Like very tight. The elastic doesn't stretch unless you're pulling on it so it digs into my skin and leaves marks.
3.0,The quality of the material was not what I expected.
3.0,Entirely adequate. It reduces the hat size.
3.0,"Good batch . Some buckles did not close properly , other than that good quality"
3.0,"Beautiful sports bra, but not made for bigger boobs. There's no adjustability. I wear a 32dd and I'm 130 lbs and 5'6. The medium wouldn't cover enough and I couldn't adjust it. If I went to a large it would be too loose."
3.0,Cheap really only good for a few uses
3.0,"I like the dress but the back of the dress I received is different than the picture. My dress is all slanted lines, the back of it doesn’t have the horizontal lines. Other than that it’s a nice casual dress."
3.0,Not very durable. A hole in the toe of both shoes after 3 weeks.
3.0,"Nice size, a bit hard to get cards in and out. Would love to have more then 1 picture slot. Also had trouble with zipper, went to far back and had a hard time to get it back around the corner."
3.0,"It works, but not as effective as a previous one I owned. It doesn't give it a complete shine, and it seems like the rags emits dust particles every time you use it."
3.0,"This is my second mask for my 6 yr old, but this mask is alot bigger than the first mask."
3.0,The shirt was very wide and large
3.0,Gold bar on front of earrings are placed off center as if in a great hurry on the production.
3.0,Wrong color came twice
3.0,"Dislike - the zipper was a little stuck and I ended up braking it so I have to place a new zipper . It does stretch around your waist well , but not too much"
3.0,Cute charms with good quality on the image itself but they constantly fell of the ring
3.0,"Isn't really sundress material, more like rayon. I'm a sz 10 and got an XL and fits a bit loose but, the material will definitely shrink. Pretty but doesn't match the description. Little bit deceptive in description."
3.0,"It was a little different then what it showed on the photo, but she liked it so I was happy"
3.0,"I’m 5’6, 145 lb, 34DD, and got a size Large.<br />I was looking for a cool/effortless type look, this one is very unflattering and frumpy on me. Will be returning. Material was high quality"
3.0,"The style of the bracelet is really nice, but the bracelet itself wears really odd."
3.0,"These are small with very stiff leather.  I’m going to have them stretched.  Then I think they might be ok.  I have been wearing them around the house as best I can to try to break them in.  That is helping.  I was able to zip them with my jeans tucked in finally today.  Once I get them stretched and broken in I think I will love them. The color is a dark chocolate brown and is very beautiful.  They will look great with skirts, leggings and tight jeans.  Be prepared to work to break them in, however, unless you have very skinny legs.  My legs are pretty thin.  But somebody told me Frye boots ran small so I ordered the wide calf  pair. I would recommend that you do that."
3.0,"The hat came all folded up ,tried to put in bathroom to steam out , nothing happened all the fold creases remain"
3.0,"I mean.. it’s beautiful but I’m disappointed that the artwork isn’t going in the same direction on both ends. Thankfully, my wrist won’t be in people’s noses all day so I can pull it off when wearing it, just a little disappointing."
3.0,It’s a nice cover-up but it’s too small. Doesn’t close enough in front.
3.0,It almost doesn't fit. Very tight when I tie the scarf.
3.0,For size reference I'm 5 ft 110 pds 34a boobs. I got the small. While it fits well its SUPER cheap looking. It also doesnt look 100% like the pic. Not worth returning. You get what you pay for.
3.0,Me gusto la calidad
3.0,Top small bottoms big wish you could order seperate. No support for chest.
3.0,"This sweatshirt is meh.  It fits, sort of.  I've washed it once, dried flat, and now it just doesn't fit right.  Weird.  Not sure if it's worth returning if I have to take it to a UPS center - too far away."
3.0,"Doesn't always cover important places, I returned it but is nice."
3.0,This is a great mask but why did they make it gray instead of black? I will be researching ways to paint it black and then it will be perfect.
3.0,"The shoes looked as they do in the pictures, but were at least a size too small. We ended up returning them. I suggest ordering a size larger than you need."
3.0,"The necklace itself was super cute. But, I was disappointed that the insert that it is displayed with that has the wording about friends being like stars...not always there but always with you- was not included. Instead, it was a piece of paper that said fashion jewelry. Not a huge deal but I loved the saying on the card as it is for a friend who moved away recently so it had some meaning to it."
3.0,I was excited to find a calla lily pendant but the quality just wasn't very good and it was hard to tell what the pendant was supposed to represent. So I returned it which went smoothly.
3.0,This piece is beautiful. but the Rope fell apart after 2 weeks. I would recommend having a backup for when it goes
3.0,"These look cute, but the blue one was missing almost all of the rhinestones in the heart.  I just removed it all together so that I can still use it pictures."
3.0,I did not think the item was as nice as pictured. Hem uneven.
3.0,"They are cute, but both pair came with small holes in them and my kids wore them for exactly 2 days before I tossed them.  I like the bottom being slip resistant, and I could have just gotten two bad pair."
3.0,This is a very comfortable beanie.  Down side you can not wear at night it bleeds.  It ruined my pillow case.
3.0,"The body fits nice, but the sleeves are way too large width-wise (the length is good, though). I wouldn't mind the large arms if the body was a looser fit, but the inconsistency bothers me so I don't wear it out. However, it's super comfy and I love wearing it when I'm lounging around at home."
3.0,"While the jewelry was nice and I was so happy to find bearded dragon jewelry, it was so small you could barely read it or tell it was a bearded dragon."
3.0,Good product but took too long to get it. Tracking kept saying it may be lost.
3.0,A mi talla y gusto muy grande parece que es large en lugar de médium (
3.0,"Love the dress, however, I was hoping that the bottom half would flow out more. I have wide hips and a large backside and the end of this dress hugs my hips"
3.0,"The sweater itself is cute. The material, however, is scratchy and not soft. My daughter wanted to keep it because she liked the cold shoulder look, so she just wears a tank top underneath."
3.0,"I chose these because of the vibrant colors, however, On the top pair of glasses, the color is not as pictured. They are more black then brown so the blue doesn't show up as vibrant as the picture. If you have the exact glasses as pictured , on the top, I would certainly like those, as pictured, not the dark colored ones I was sent. The second pair, on bottom, seem to be as described. Not happy with the one pair. Please advise. Thank you."
3.0,"The hat itself is a pretty standard baseball cap. I have another one that is almost exactly like it that is my favorite cap. But, if you are looking at this, like me, you probably care most about the logo, so here's my take on that:  I'm not terribly disappointed, but neither am I at all impressed. The logo seems to be some sort of heat-affixed decal. It's NOT embroidered. That wouldn't be so bad, except at all angles but looking directly head-on, it catches the light in such a way that it tends to look gray, rather than a pure, dark black. A gray logo on a gray cap looks bad and rather defeats the purpose. In addition, because the logo is a decal, I am concerned it will peel at some point. All-in-all, my impression is its a rather cheap-looking cap that I'm not sure I would purchase again. Would have been much nicer, had it been properly embroidered. Seems like just another cheap product out of China."
3.0,"Disappointed. This jacket was a lot thinner than I thought. I bought it for my boyfriend to wear to work, but it’s not even as good as a hoodie. Might be nice for the spring. I guess it’s true to size although the does fit him a little short. It’s okay for only being $23."
3.0,"Seemed faded black, expected dark black. Poor quality zipper, failed on third zip up."
3.0,Zipper is quite ruff going up and down. tight in the hips and loose in the waist. my daughter doesn't have curves either so I wouldn't expect this fit on her.
3.0,"The sleeves were pretty, but I was not a fan of the material of the body of the dress, so I sent it back."
3.0,"The hats are nice, but it says baby on the name of the item so I got fooled. If you read more carefully it mentions that they are for toddlers! Hence, three stars."
3.0,I love these they fit very well. And just super cute.. My only problem is it took over a month to get these. Almost 2 months.
3.0,Looks decent.  The bottom &#34;Giants&#34; part I had to add adhesive because the adhesive that was on it was peeling off but other than that. Nice
3.0,They are very fun! Kids love them
3.0,"This watch is low in price, and that is reflected by its appearance in person. If you are looking for a reasonably priced watch for a pre-teen boy or something, this would be a good pick. I also don't believe that the band is genuine leather.  The stitching on the band does look nice, though as you can see in my posted picture. The back of the watch seems to be a different type of wood. It came packaged in a nice box. Overall, I prefer a more quality watch for an adult, but those usually cost quite a bit more, so for this I guess you just have to weigh your priorities.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,"Don't really like this material at all. Very handy, not flattering at all."
3.0,works well for casual use but not extreme use (mud runs).
3.0,"Cute workout shirts, they are good material for working out but I ordered a X-small but it was still very long, and a little loose."
3.0,"I got this for my daughter, who loves Sailor Moon.  The chain broke within an hour of her getting it.  The pendant is fine.  Nothing special, but I got it for a young child, so that's fine."
3.0,"Cute, soft, silky material but somewhat see through on the parts that stretch more (@$$)<br />Just be prepared to wear long shirts or under a short dress to hide that part if it's too think on you there...."
3.0,Looks better in picture than actual product.
3.0,Like the product other than size runs a little small
3.0,These look like very nice bands. I liked the material and the look but they were so incredibly small I couldn’t even kinda get them around my wrist. I think they must be designed for young children (that is the only sized wrist these bands would fit). Real bummer because other than the size I really liked these.
3.0,This dress was too small. Sometimes you find that you need to go up or down a size but this dress could have been 2 or 3 sizes larger. I do not think that the it fits true to size. The material is of average quality.
3.0,"The material is nice and the collar lays well but it is way too long in the back for me. I tied it in front and buried the back tail. If you are looking to completely cover your fanny, this is the shirt for you! ;)"
3.0,"I bought this for an 80's party in black.  The photo makes it look nicer than it actually is.  Where the crinoline is tiered it is sewn badly so that it looks lumpy and bunched up in a couple of places and doesn't hang nice and crisp and straight like the photo.  Also, it looks knee length in the photo and it really isn't.  I'm 5'5"" and it came several inches above my knee.  And I had to wear a slip under it because it was too sheer.  It worked fine for the party but it was priced a little high for a very cheaply made product."
3.0,"piece that goes between toes put a sore on my foot, and they are heavy."
3.0,Muy lindos y económicos
3.0,$150 scarf and comes smashed in a plastic bag all wrinkled. Plus made in China. Guess they don't make these in America
3.0,"They fit and they are comfortable but they are kinda see through. I'm 5'5 135 pounds and I ordered a medium. I wouldn't order them again but the ones I have are ok I guess. I ordered the light green and black ones. The light green is very dull, and not what I expected, and not what is shown."
3.0,These leg warmers are just ok - skimpy and lightweight.  Good enough for my needs so I didn't return.  But there are lots of legwarmers that are better quality.
3.0,The fit of the pants is fine but unfortunately they are see through. I have the same ones in black and they’re great but these show everything.
3.0,The slash guard was  not true to size they sent me another one still to small and had no tags. Not sure if they sent me the same size as previously.
3.0,"you get what you pay for, its cheap and it doesnt hold together well.  its cute, my daughter loves it but it fell apart within a week.  all the connectors come lose.  its easy to tighten them back up if you can catch it before they disappear."
3.0,"Comfy, but the color is more pink than red."
3.0,Didn’t too much like the fact that it doesn’t close to the size of my wrist.  Too big for me hopefully it fits my sister.  But it looks nice and great for a Christmas gift if it fits..
3.0,"the seller promised a credit for the next product, too bad this is too small, I really like it"
3.0,"I love the print!!!  The band detached from the silver insert the 2nd or 3rd day I wore it. I wear my watch tight enough that I noticed it, but I don't feel comfortable using this band anymore because I may not notice next time it falls off and I don't want to lose my watch"
3.0,The dress is a little large in the chest area so I’ve had to use a safety pin to keep it closed a little higher up. After washing it twice some of the stitching has come loose. I do love the length because it’s not too long.
3.0,Seems a decent enough quality for the price but the size was off.  I ordered 2XLT and it was labeled that but the length was standard size.  Most big and tall sizes would have been about an inch longer in the length.
3.0,VERY SMALL IN SIZE
3.0,The top tore half way off with first use. I own several varieties of these. Not so impressed with the insulated version.
3.0,One side of the top had no lace so the beige showing through was very distracting.
3.0,"Sellers were great. Fast shipping and product as described. Product however did nothing for me. Was supposed to stick and lift, I had minimal stick and no lift. Would not buy this product again."
3.0,My husband loved the color but they run a bit small .
3.0,I purchased these for my grand daughter the 5th time wearing them the purple band came loose. The next time the other band came off.
3.0,This is a third pair of sandals that I am trying to purchase through amazon and I guess they ship from China and the sizes are so off! I asked for 12.5 little kid and I receive 3 Big kid...Disappointing. The material seems of a good quality though.
3.0,I guess these gloves would work if you were a giant. They are enormous and very hard to use since the claws don't stay on your fingertips.
3.0,It is ok to wear  with leggings. cannot be worn as a dress outside!
3.0,Ordered this for my 5yo and she swims in it. Be aware it runs big.
3.0,Not as stretchy as I would have hoped. Too small. Too short. I sent it back. It is cute though.
3.0,I really liked these at first. They were so comfy and fit me great (got a size large and I'm normally a size 8). But I got them Oct 31st and they've already got holes in them. The holes are around the butt pockets. Thankfully I wear black undies (and long tops) so it wasn't a huge deal when I noticed the holes lol. Just be cautious if you wear leggings a lot. These didn't last 4 months of my pregnancy.
3.0,These earrings came in good packaging and condition. They are bigger than I thought they would be. Kind of clunky and a bit gaudy for my taste.
3.0,"While better than no sunglasses, and possibly better than a lot of sunglasses, they did not eliminate glare as they indicated they would. Nor did they make things clearer as in the commercial"
3.0,"The price on the Capri leggings was good, but the size was smaller than expected and too thin to wear like my regular leggings."
3.0,Great fit. Not as thermal or as cold weather protecting as I thought they'd be. Super thin
3.0,"I bought this for my son for his swimming class. The outside quality is good, but the towel lining is very cheap. I expected something soft and warm that can let my son wear in the winter. This jacket is not warm enough."
3.0,"It’s not an ugly piece.<br />However— it is Not accurately pictured nor presented. Please read prior to purchase-<br />The setting is much much more narrow than it appears and how it is pictured.<br />In the picture, the setting appears as if it would lay from one end to the other- across the majority of the top on the finger.  **This is NOT the case.<br />I wouldn’t even consider it “wide” period.<br />Maybe for a very small handed woman’s PINKY. But still even on a pinky.. it sits high with a very short spread.  Comparable to maybe 2/3rds of a single dime-<br />I’m very disappointed, I have been looking forward to this purchase for a while.<br /><br />I am so sorry company/owners.<br />I absolutely adore vintage jewelry but this broke my ♥️"
3.0,"Pretty dress, but too small and too short for me."
3.0,I received a lot of repeats.  now my wife has some to trade with others....
3.0,my boy loved these but then the screw fell out and they are in the trash now
3.0,"Like the black enamel version, nice cufflinks if you want a low-key look.  Not flashy but prettier than buttons, and well worth the inexpensive price."
3.0,Hooks are too small for many masks.
3.0,"Don't spend the extra money for this brand.  The much less expensive, Arabella, did a better job and fit was more comfortable."
3.0,"This sweater is just okay. It isn't fitted the way it looks in the pictures. It is a square. The pattern looks a little cheap up close, but I don't think other people would notice.  I had to take the sweater in at the waist quite a bit, as again, it's a square sweater. I think the models have it pinned in the back so it looks more fitted.  It's a good price though,  and it's very warm. I don't think ordering a smaller size would make it look better, as it would stretch out the pattern."
3.0,"This was the first strapless bra ever tried. I only tried it because I’m tired of messing with straps. It was ok on being comfortable, but it was hot...not sure why on that. The fabric was soft, it was tight ( i figured this was a requirement), and looked fine ( I was wearing a baggy T-shirt dress). I have yet to decide if this will be a constant wear. My hope was to find a way to get rid of straps, but I’m not sure about that."
3.0,"The La Raffine silver titanium steel hedgehog hoop earrings, made in an undisclosed location, measures about 3/4"" externally and 5/16” internally.  Each smokey steel colored earring has 6 spikes and weighs .05 oz/2g which isn’t much but feels heavier than a typical stud.<br /><br />The earring hinges at the base using the post to lock the earring into place.  Opening the earring can take some effort, which may be frustrating for removing.  However, this earring stays securely in place.<br /><br />The current price of this earring set is excessive.  This is one of those items that have one manufacturer but is sold by many brands.  A quick search on Amazon will reveal several options.  This option is the most expensive I found.  For instance, [[ASIN:B07313CPS6 this brand]] is currently just over half the price.  [[ASIN:B07CWR4PR6 This set]] comprises of four earring sets with this design included, plus [[ASIN:B07CWRL4VR another set]] including this design in three separate colors, both currently sold at a lower price.<br /><br />The La Raffine titanium steel silver hedgehog hoop earrings come in a nice gift box at a higher price than other identical options.  If you are interested in buying these earrings, shop for the best price.  I like this design but would not be willing to pay the current price.<br /><br />► PROS:<br />Stays securely in place<br /><br />► CONS:<br />Difficult to open<br />Excessive price"
3.0,The pajamas are really cute and the material is good but didn’t fit to my 9 moth :(
3.0,would be better with a different clasp
3.0,"These are pretty thin, and shrunk in the wash. or I just have the feet of a Sasquatch."
3.0,"Cute dress, fabric wrinkles very easily."
3.0,"Such a cute comfortable dress. I bought 2 different colors.  Washed one--DID NOT PUT IT IN THE DRYER.  It shrunk in the length by 5"".  So disappointed."
3.0,I like the look of the glasses. They are comfortable however the glasses are useless if they won't last a few months. I decided to keep them because I am the only one that knows they are seperating. Maybe just a bad pair sent to me. I hate to think that they are really disposable after a few times of sporting them. I wouldn't decline another pair being sent to me.
3.0,"After a few months the double layer of the swimsuit blows up, somehow. Can't explain why. Padding in the chest area superfluous."
3.0,"I gave it three stars as one of the pockets was not stitched up.  Also, the dress smelled of the dye.  I washed it in cold water with other dark colours and after the wash all my clothes smelled of the dye.  I had to rewash all the clothes."
3.0,It broke within a week of wearing it and is not fixable
3.0,"I was baggy around awkward parts of the body. Perhaps it’s a better fit for a taller woman. On a 5’1 figure it swallows you up and looks a bit frumpy. The fabric is thick and chunky polyester. It doesn’t look expensive, even around the edges and hems it looks like something you’d buy at a Rainbow fashion store. The sash is a joke. But it’s very modest and could be dressed up. I’d probably pass up the pink and go with a dark instead if you want this dress and still look expensive."
3.0,It looks better in the picture than when you see it .
3.0,es mas oscuro y la tela me parecio rigida
3.0,"This dress fits a bit small on top. The floral print is not as pictured, either. It’s cute, just not as described. Go up at least one size!"
3.0,"In the photos the studs look substantial.  The smaller plain white studs and minuscule, barely as big as 10pt diamonds.  There others are like 1/4 carats, and the blue are what I would normally wear as an everyday stud, but still small.  in the photos they looked about twice the size they are in person."
3.0,It is as advertised. Understand this is a very inexpensive tie. I purchased it for a costume only. Be careful when adjusting the length. The strap material is VERY thin and gets easily twisted in the buckles. It is NOT easy to get it back straight again.<br />My hunch is that this will not last very long but should be perfect for a costume. I prefer self-tie bowties but...$10 bucks will get you this very serviceable item.
3.0,A little smaller than other brand with the same size
3.0,The material is very thin. I’m concerned that it’s going to shrink after I wash it. Fruit of the Loom tee shirts are usually nice and sturdy.
3.0,Cute but I received the wrong color.
3.0,To tight 1
3.0,"I thought it was cotton, reading helps. Nice for polyester"
3.0,Everythings too small
3.0,"It's a bit larger than I was expecting. Wish it was just a bit smaller. My fault though, should've read the specs more closely"
3.0,"This bag is greatly overpriced for what it is. I used it once so far and it does fit 2 suits with shirts plus some other things  but at the same time is pretty bulky. This bag is not meant to be checked in like someone else said in another review... It does not have enough structure for that and tossing it around will wrinkle/ destroy your clothes...<br /><br />My biggest problem with this bag are zippers. After a few uses some of them get stuck and are harder to move around. I am worried that they will start breaking soon - especially the smaller ones inside.<br /><br />The shoulder strap is also of low quality and at this price it should have some cushion for your shoulder - the only thing that it has is some rubber part that does not help  if the bag is packed with clothes.<br /><br />The bag would be great in 30 - 40 dollar range but at the current price you are better off with WallyBag. It is better quality, has very good zippers and better shoulder strap."
3.0,The strings that tighten it up keep getting loose.
3.0,"It was a pretty top, just too small."
3.0,Very nice quality but the smallest size they have is a Medium which runs Large. Had to return. Too big for my usually sized medium husband. Also there is a fee to return so you better love it and hope it fits properly. Sad 'cause I love all their shirts. Why no size small?
3.0,"Super comfy, iron on , isn’t as long as I expected."
3.0,The fit was awkward in the busy for me but it’s nice for the price
3.0,First set broke fast  second much better
3.0,Box came broken lol._.Thanks alot for being late 2 months later...
3.0,"The bra is made well, it fits small.<br />I'm a 34 b , they sent me a 34 C and it was to small"
3.0,They were too big for my face
3.0,My only complaint is that they fade really quickly.
3.0,"Product was good. Received it well in advance, however, there was a small tear, hence the three stars. It is comfortable to wear and looks almost the same as in the picture except that it is not so shiny."
3.0,"One has broken, not the best quality but a good deal for what you're paying."
3.0,The charm is movable and can &#34;wiggle&#34; from the waist down. Cute :)
3.0,"its a Cheesey clasp, pearls are ok, scratchy wire ends. Not enough detail attn. It was inexpensive. Probably be ok for bridesmaids"
3.0,I wish it was actually white and not an antique white color.
3.0,"More sheer than expected. The material is very stretchy and shiny. I was looking for a dress I could wear to work and this was definitely not it. Three stars because it looked well made, but the material looks cheap. Back it went."
3.0,Cute but Order a size bigger
3.0,They feel great but order a size up
3.0,Looks great - but coating started to peel off the first few times the lenses hit salt water for my triathlon
3.0,It’s  Not 8 pieces not 10
3.0,I would order a size smaller. I ordered a large and it looks closer to an XL.
3.0,Nice but short and doesn’t stay closed
3.0,Beautiful hat however it runs small. Small on my 3 1/2 year old.
3.0,"Very light, but not the best material. I wore these for a few months and holes started to develop wear my toes dug into them."
3.0,"I absolutely loved this shirt from the moment it came. The colors are vibrant, the material seems of higher quality & true to size. Im 165, 5'5 & Medium gave a perfect loose fit, but not too baggy. Perfect fit, but the 1st wash pretty much destroyed it & suggested it wont last long. I even washed in cold, gentle cycle alone & hung dried it and still developed little fuzz balls all over it. Not too noticable quite yet from a distance so I have a few more washes left before it'll go to the ""old clothes"" pile for camping & walks. I'm so bummed though bc other than that, its perfect & I loved it!!😞"
3.0,Gave me a wedgie
3.0,nice hat...don't like velcro back.
3.0,Feels nice but needed a larger size.
3.0,Very cute but they are pretty heavy.
3.0,It is a light weight hoodie. Not a regular colder weather hoodie. To front still runs super short. I wear a Large normally I got a 2XL and it was smaller in the front. Almost like a womens style tshirt in my opinion.
3.0,"I ordered 6 of these for my bridesmaids and while they are pretty, they’re a little too small for my liking.  Also I ordered 6 and received 5 matching and he 6th pair was completely wrong.  Not certain if they ran out of the style but I should’ve been notified as such… returning everything and ordering from SHEIN."
3.0,These did not do justice to overalls.  They are very big fitting and thin flimsy material.  The color is very washed out.  Not happy with this it was returned same day I received it.  The price for these were high but the quality of the product was low.
3.0,Got exactly what I expected for the price.  Not excellent quality but not terrible either.
3.0,cute but not made for little brothers who destroy things<br />Worked great for AG doll fun!
3.0,"First off, yes, this is meant as an athletic fit shirt, ideally under plating/ a bulletproof vest.  It's worth noting that I usually fit in an XL shirt, borderline 2XL depending on material.  I read the sizing chart and measured my torso accordingly.  I scratched my head at the fact that I came in at a 3XL in this shirt, but I took a shot anyway.<br /><br />I expected a moderately tight fit, but this fits on me like a YOUTH 3XL, or a men's  Large.  It's a little too tight to recommend to an adult, in my opinion, even for athletic fit."
3.0,Very cute but runs a bit small
3.0,some transparent but still cool design
3.0,"When hubby's belt started to crack, we knew we needed to replace it before it reached its final destination - the circular file. We got an opportunity to purchase this one from Boston Leather at a discounted price, in exchange for a detailed evaluation and honest review. I'm glad we ordered it but wish it were a little higher quality.<br /><br />The sizing is right on target. Hubby wears size 34 waist trousers, and the recommended 36-inch belt is a perfect fit. The leather is nicely finished and the understated buckle is what my husband wanted. A lot of the wild buckles look cool online, but most of the men I know want basic. This one's basic. There's a metal roll tube at the outer edge of the buckle, which I guess serves some purpose but honestly looks kind of tacky. It doesn't really serve much purpose, unless it's to reinforce what lies inside. I've seen belts like that before and thought the idea went out in the 90's..<br /><br />I can't give it more stars because it's good enough, but nothing spectacular. As other people noted, the leather is soft. For a lot of things, softer is better. For a belt you want a bit more rigidity. I don't know how long this one will last, and assume it won't be very long. I foresee a new belt in the near future."
3.0,"They look nice, but some socks were smaller and some were larger."
3.0,"White bikini is much better than the black. Black bottoms are too small, and the material isn't as soft as the white bikini"
3.0,"Needed to shorten hem and add a vent at the hem, to be able to walk in this. It will be good as lounge wear at home or on vacation. I'm 5ft 9&#34; and 140 pds, fit very large in a medium, but that's what I wanted."
3.0,This slip one fit great.  They grip the floor nicely.  Biggest complaint is that they do not drain.  There are two holes in the soles for drainage but the water pools and stays.
3.0,"When I opened the package,  I was initially excited because the quality was pretty darn good. I’m a solid size 2x. And the corset was easily 3 sizes too small. I wish it went larger. Get it if you are maybe a large. The quality is there . The sewing was very sound too!"
3.0,I am 5'2 119lbs. Size small still too big. Baggy in butt area. Very basic style. Little support. Modesty breast coverage only. NOT for support.
3.0,definitely too small. Thinner than I thought but worth the money. Gave mine to a friend.
3.0,"Cute ….BUT !<br />The picture makes the item look so bright and money sign on the band looks great ..,,,<br />But…… in actual sight the band looks dingy and the color is  light green, not at all like the picture."
3.0,"These are not red but a sparkly bright orange, which is fine because they go well with my orange shirt. I cut the chains off at the second link and put them on lever backs since posts irritate my ears."
3.0,"Look good and light, but the size is not right"
3.0,"had to cut the toes out, but it's better than not having ANY socks to wear AT ALL in shoes with separated toes. comfortable and well made, but runs small."
3.0,"I ordered two different sizes in this, trying to make it work but the inseam is just too short.  And I don't have an abnormally long torso, my length is all in my legs.  Just beware unless you are short in the torso this is probably going to pull in a very uncomfortable way..."
3.0,"Not what I was expecting. From the pics, thought it would be more light weight and flowy. This is thicker and more heavy weight, like a Hanes tee with a bit of stretch. I'm normally an XL but ordered a 3X (wanted a slouchy look) fits like a 2X. The rolled sleeves are seamed across the shoulders not down to armpits so more like a dolman sleeve seam. Due to the cut, seams, material weight and sizing up the sleeves stick up at the ends. This is a good shirt for those who like thicker and more modest shirts. Not for me and definitely does not look like the model picture."
3.0,Made in China usual quality
3.0,"By and large these are great but after a couple of washings the waistband has rolled into a mess.  I did continue to buy them and maybe they fixed the issue. Time will tell.  They are soft, comfortable and breath well.  Bottom line is I really love them except for the waistband issue."
3.0,Great material...just didn't fit my body...
3.0,"I like the way the ring feels/fits, and it has a little less of a tacky feel than some other silicone rings I've tried. The 2-layer construction leads to it being hard to keep clean, as does the infinity logo.  The biggest issue however is the color, which was pretty close to the listing picture originally, but after just a couple weeks it has changed to more of an army green, or at best a patinad copper (see pic)."
3.0,Took this dress on vacation from the beach right to happy hour and dinner.5
3.0,"I’m 5’2, 128 and I purchased a small. They fit okay but not snug like I like them. The pant legs are not too long but not perfect either. I thought I had purchased a gray pair but I received a black one which may have been my own fault.  The best park about them are the pockets. There are two in the front and two in the back.<br /><br />They feel more like regular pants than yoga pants, but they ran a bit big.<br /><br />I think they may be perfect for someone taller than me and slimmer than me as well. Overall they are fine, just not my favorite go to pair."
3.0,It's stiff and doesn't fold up small.  It does zip up nicely.
3.0,I have purchased from this seller before so I expected this to be a bit on the small side as far as the bra goes. But this time the panties were very small as well. China sizes only!
3.0,"When you read in the description about product it says if you want a heart symbol to write &quot;heart&quot; . So on my engraving they literally engraved &quot;heart&quot; instead of the heart symbol. As for my saying they engraved , they messaged  me back asking if the could change it to<br />Forever your<br />Black bird<br />❤<br />And i agreed because thats how i wanted it originally but it came as Forever your Black bird<br />&quot;Heart&quot;  ..... and the engraving pretty small compared to the pictures of other people who posted reviews . But other than that it came out okay... and my boyfriend still loved it  ..."
3.0,As described. Works well inside a leather hat.
3.0,"I wanted to try this wedding ring because the original ring i bought for my boyfriend was in his actual size but during the super hot days his cuts into his finger.  This is a good option for someone that  works alot with their hands  you cant scratch it or dent it & its not going to cut into your finger.  If you want something  light weight comfortable and simple this would be a good idea for you.<br />DISCLAIMER –  I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE OR HEAVILY DISCOUNTED FOR MY UNBIASED REVIEW.

3.0,I normally wear a size 10-12 but ordered size XL in these as people said they run small.  Even the XL was too tight in the waist.  I liked the styling and material so have ordered an XXL (never worn that size before!).
3.0,Are they cute. Yes<br />Right size.  Yyyaaasss<br />But (Lord have mercy)<br />The first days i wore each.of em they fell out. The hook (or whatever they call it) is so loose so right now i have 1 earring of each...im so upset coz I really like them
3.0,"I ordered this dress in burgundy to wear to a special event. The color and design were beautiful, especially the ruffles and flared sleeves, and I received many compliments! However, the dress ran small (I'm 5'2, 120 lbs and ordered a M) and shrunk even further in the wash despite air-drying! I wish I had ordered a size L - I'm not sure I can wear this dress again."
3.0,Shirts fit well and are comfortable. Arms aren’t too big or loose. Ordered before Covid and quality seemed better then.
3.0,"Very thin chain very thin pendant. The pendant looks stamped. Not 3D. Very cute, but felt very cheap."
3.0,"My long hair gets caught on the cuffs sometimes, which pulls the earring out of place. Super cute, especially if you don't have many piercing holes, it will look like you are wearing a lot more jewelry. I like them overall!"
3.0,Cute but too big won’t stay in my nose
3.0,Realmente no son las que esperaba. Pero estaban muy bien
3.0,The description said white and it wasn't
3.0,Dress broke the day I needed it. It fit fine basically just be careful for the zipper.
3.0,"Very cute, but ran small in the chest area even though I fell within their measurements given...fit perfect everywhere else.  Sadly, had to return."
3.0,The material in fine. The shirt size is ridiculous. My 11 yr old can probably wear it . Another Amazon purchase disappointment
3.0,great for hot weather
3.0,I bought these for the beads.
3.0,o.k. there cut style.
3.0,These were much too narrow.
3.0,Definitely need a weight for the base to make this useable at all without bolting it to the floor.  Windy days are iffy and can make the umbrella rotate even if locked down by bolt screws that are part of the base.
3.0,"So I just couldn't help myself but order this shirt when it was on sale one time, because.... well, obvious.....  look at it!  And the color didn't disappoint either.  It fit VERY TIGHT and when my large bust stretched the material a little bit, the bright and vibrant colors (that would probably match any given pair of britches that I could possibly buy!) seemed to fade and start to appear a little bit see-through.  I thought that this added greatly to the &#34;sex appeal&#34; of the garment, but then my wife started laughing at me.  Then my sister-in-law started laughing at me.  Then my Mother-in-Law and Daughter started laughing at me.  Then I didn't feel like it was very sexy.  Unfortunately, I had to send this one back.  If you are very fit, and not too fat, and fairly &#34;trendy&#34; with your look, then you can probably pull this off.  Me....  not so much.  If you order this, then you might want to order it a size up!"
3.0,"very light weight, but nice anyway the bow is a little big, fit very nice, i'm a size 8, and stand 5ft 6&#34; and it hanges just below my waist"
3.0,Thinner than I expected.
3.0,Super sad this sweater didn't fit my boyfriend. I searched for a TALL and this came up it was just regular length so too short
3.0,This is a gorgeous set but after a very short while the decorative part of the band separated from the watch band. I only wore it a few times.
3.0,feels like regular knee high socks
3.0,Loved it except fits small and is shorter than expected.
3.0,"These are not soft, but a crepey cloth that is not expected."
3.0,"I love Lucky brand jeans, but this fabric is kind of the worst.  Since it's black, it only makes matters worse as it serves as the perfect back drop to all the fibers and hairs you have ever encountered in your life.  They fit well and all, but the fabric is a real bummer.  I have this same style in a different color and fabric, and they're great!  Maybe these are knock off?  Regardless, I'll still wear them and begrudgingly invest in more lint rollers"
3.0,Very fragile.
3.0,"I ordered two different sets. One set was great and fit perfectly. The other set said that they were polarized, but when I received the package it said that they were not polarized. The website description was inaccurate and I sent them back."
3.0,product was too small for age advertised.pretty print
3.0,Still a cool shirt but the print isn't as white as pictures. It looks to be made cheaper
3.0,Well I guess the size designation of &#34;free size&#34; didn't take in to account of size 12.  Very small and didn't fit.  I wish they offered a larger size.  They are cute.
3.0,"The hat, neck warmer, and gloves are great, but the ear muffs are an absolute joke. I literally laughed out loud by myself they’re so stupid looking, thin, and flimsy. You can get better earmuffs at a gas station! The rest of it is nice I guess, but honestly you can get a better deal that includes ear muffs elsewhere."
3.0,Really pretty earrings but up close you can tell where the rings are supposed to connect. Not a deal breaker just not the best quality.
3.0,"Not sure how long the material will last. There is no compression in these tights. They fit correctly, but will not offer any significant compression or support. The material is cheap and loose enough that if you are doing any grappling, the material will tug and start to deform."
3.0,Very cute but kinda small. If you have a bigger wrist it might not fit. You also get an extra gift with purchase
3.0,"I love that the mask was breathable , however this mask made my face extremely oily and tore up the middle within 2 days of owning it."
3.0,The glasses are fine. We waited over 3 weeks to get them.
3.0,"Boyfriend liked them, but I think they are too big for my face."
3.0,Order a size 6&#34; smaller than you would a leather belt.
3.0,"Pretty, and well-made, but the top part is really small/tight.  I'm petite, and I thought it was too tight on me...no idea how someone with a larger chest could fit into this."
3.0,"Loved the watch, but it fit too tight.  Length say's, &#34;Women's Std&#34;.  What is a womens std?.  I have a 7 3/4 wrist and it could hardly close it was so tight.  Have to return, bummer!!!!"
3.0,too huge figures. on the photo they looks smaller and better.
3.0,it is light and good looking. but it is a little expensive.
3.0,"This runs small. Make sure to measure yourself and then order a size up. The fabric looks & feels like linen, which is not to my liking. Wrinkles easily."
3.0,"Delivered quickly so that was great. Unfortunately the watch I ordered should’ve had a blue face and not a black. I ordered the blue, so that’s why am giving it three stars. I really loved the blue dial.... Oh well.  With that said I’m not gonna return it, for the price I think it’s fine and I’ll just have to go look for another watch with the blue dial."
3.0,Got these for my 10 year old as an option for when school starts. They are very snug on her (to the point she doesn’t feel comfortable talking) and VERY thin. The only reason I gave 3 stars is because they’ll make ok headbands.
3.0,Run/Hole on the first day. :(
3.0,"Good looking product from Poland. Plugged the US adapter into the 2-prong Euro style plug for the charger, then the charger to an outlet. Charger went &#34;pop&#34;and never functioned. Will try to mail to Poland for a new one, but not sure if that will work. No online support, just a mailing address.<br /><br />So I used a charger from another product. Batteries seemed to charge OK. But very difficult to cram two batteries and wires into pocket on each glove. Had to remove a wrapper in order to fit. Even then, wires are dangerously bent, and probably will break after several charging/repacking cycles.<br /><br />Gloves did work as advertised and it was really great to have pain free fingers at 8600 feet in snow and 20degrees F. Hope I get more than this one use from them."
3.0,"It is a lot warmer than I thought it would be but it was for a costume and I doubt I'll wear it very often. It was a little on the snug side but not like a full size up needed, I just need to loose some more weight. The appearance was just like the picture and it didn't fade in the washer, yet."
3.0,I like the style of it. But it's rather hard to Iron. The label says 100% cotton but it doesn't look or feel like It. It's stays wrinkled.
3.0,"They fit good ,but they are not long enough how i like my pants to be."
3.0,"Its what you expect, cheap material. Mine ripped in the first two days. Overall it's not bad and wasn't expecting too much. I still wear it."
3.0,"Love this dress, but it is very sheer. The one I received is oddly sewn. The seams appear to be slightly off. It is still cute on, but I find my self adjusting it trying to get it to line up properly."
3.0,Material much thinner than the picture depicts. Also the hat is not as full as the picture depicts. It’s more like a runners hat than a cowboys ball cap
3.0,"If you need a belt for appearance or color coordination this is fine, otherwise don't expect it to hold your pants up."
3.0,Great dress only  problem  I had was the stitching  can loose...195 pounds order a medium
3.0,"I was under the impression they were a little smaller, they are pretty but a little too large for me"
3.0,"The body of the “dress” fit like a women’s XL. However, I’m 5’9. It was a shirt, not a dress. Didn’t cover my rear. I was hoping to use this as a swim cover up for our upcoming trip, but even as a cover up, I wasn’t comfortable to walk around a resort.<br />It is soft. I like the charcoal color, but it’s being returned."
3.0,Nice coin but the ink fade over time. Secondly only one of the coin is on Amazon so here's what the other side looks like.
3.0,"I like this purse alot, but manufacturers defect in that magnetic pocket doesn't close on one corner. Cheap velcro holster had to be replaced. All the top credit card pockets too deep to be useful. All (nylon) zippers stick."
3.0,doesn't  shut  right  .
3.0,"These are great gloves, but a little snug. Runs small, in my opinion."
3.0,"Even using a Lansky three stone sharpener, this thing is tough to get a proper edge on.  I would not recommend it for any type of serious usage.  The sheath is ok if you plan to carry it on a belt, otherwise, you will probably be disappointed.<br /><br />I would not trust this knife for it's intended purpose, but it's a fun toy, I guess."
3.0,The top is pretty loose. I had to pin it closed for it to fit better. The cape part was too long in the back. I pulled it to the front so it didnt drag on the ground. I love all the accessories that come with it. It was pretty cute
3.0,Chain turned dark rather quickly but unicorn stayed bright so I just switched it to a different chain.
3.0,"I guess I'm too tall, this is supposed to be a tunic.<br />Maybe my chest is too large.<br />I'm 5' 8&#34; and it's just at my waist."
3.0,"I love this shape and the colors. I will say that if it is too tight around the bust, the material shows the stretch so be sure to order the appropriate size."
3.0,"This jacket is cute and faux leather is soft. However the sizing is very wrong. I ordered size Medium, as I usually wear Med 6-8 in US sizes. But this jacket in Med was more like XS very small and short. The jacket is made in China and the sizes are for little tiny short flat skinny people. I would probably need and XL to fit me to be like US Medium. I am 5.6&#34; 130 lbs, 36D chest. I sent the jacket back."
3.0,"Pretty, but necklace became undone after just two wears."
3.0,Super cute and love the tulle but the actual skirt part is SUPER short.
3.0,"Bought these because I wanted black gloves instead of the bright pink ones purchased earlier, but these are not as responsive compared to others I have used. I have to really push hard to get the touchscreen to respond."
3.0,It's a nice dress but I didn't like how it exaggerated my hips (maybe the pockets were behind this) (or my insecurities :P). If I was a thinner person I would've liked it more.
3.0,Very cute. Just a lil thin and color fades after a few washes.
3.0,They were only one dollar so they are Ok for that cost but they were just not what I expected in quality.
3.0,"cute, but cheap looking"
3.0,"this was a gift, my grand son loved it"
3.0,"Tight in the bust, and isnt  very flattering for my body type. Handmaids Tale vibes. It isn’t very stretchy at all, if there’s supposed to be stretch."
3.0,"They are good masks but, are too small for my  10 and 11 year olds. It is good for smaller faces."
3.0,"Recieved 2 pieces, one has damaged threads and stays loose, and the other has machine cuts on the center bar, and cannot be used."
3.0,It is a little proportional but it is a nice design.
3.0,"They're ok quality, hard to put in(used in ears) but it's an affordable simple hoop ring."
3.0,I didn't realize it was such a large bag.  It is well made and I  will probably use it for traveling.  Not what I can use every day which was what I was buying for.
3.0,Do not attach to glasses
3.0,"This might be ideal for others but it's super huge for me. It does look like the picture so I can't complain about that. I'm about 115 lbs. It doesn't stay on my waist even at the smallest setting. Also the pouch part itself is so huge that it sticks out to my hips. it just looks gigantic on me. The material it is also makes it really stiff so it's not that comfortable for me. I own a ton of fanny packs so I might be kind of bias! If you are a little bigger or want a huge looking fanny pack, then this may be good for you. It just wasn't for me."
3.0,Great bag. Lots of room. The wheels could be more stable though.
3.0,"Nice pants but when you wash them multiple times, you realize they aren't good quality."
3.0,"Actually 4 1/2 stars.  Received these in black.  Looks exactly as pictured.  Feels like sweater sleeves.  Lace is pretty.  I have 16 1/2"" muscular calves and hoped these would fit snug so they would not fall down on bare legs.  These slide over my calves just fine, but slouch and slip down when you walk.  Frustrating.  Hoping for a snug fit.  I'll keep looking."
3.0,"I ordered this to wear unbuttoned since I'm pregnant.  It is very cute. Going off other reviewers and the size chart I ordered a medium.  I am 5'6 and currently about 145lbs at 7 months pregnant.  This fit great. Obviously,  it can't be buttoned.  I knocked off 2 stars, because it smells awful. I just washed it and it smells strongly like formaldehyde. I have not tried wearing it yet, but if I am unable to get this smell out, then my rating will go down to 1 star. Not only do I not want to smell like formaldehyde,  but I definitely don't want it touching my skin."
3.0,a little snugged on son but good material
3.0,"Seems sturdy on the outside, but not too sure how sturdy the lining is. The lining is not tied down to the denim of the purse. Has a zippered section inside the lining, one pocket in the lining on the opposite side, and zips shut on top. Not huge, but ample enough. It's not all that attractive--looks like dingy faded jeans."
3.0,"I bought this as a last minute Christmas gift for my brother in law. There were better hoodies I wanted to get for him but they were all out of stock and or wouldn’t arrive until well past Christmas. I went with this one as a last resort, my nephew helped me pick it out. It’s okay. I mean it looks cool. The fabric you can tell is very cheap though. Which, I half expected. Still."
3.0,This is a very attractive bra but may want to go a size up
3.0,This product didn't stay in place while working out. They moved down my legs...don't use it anymore...money wasted.
3.0,I ordered a purple for my friend and it did not look purple at all. It was more like a black.
3.0,Would be nice if it wasn't so small and I ordered the largest size.
3.0,"The watch itself is fine.  Does what it says and looks good.  It is smaller than most watches you see these days but that is okay for me.  My problem is that the wristband is equally small - as though this watch was intended for a child or a woman.  If you have the wrist of an average and above size man this wristband is barely usable.  It is very short.  I have to work very carefully to be able to get the band to reach around and fit through the opposing band buckle and I can just get it to fit using the last available hole in the band to hold it closed. This is a lot of effort for what should be a very simple and quick task.  The description on the Amazon page for this watch should include this detail - ""Not suited for larger wrists"".  Or better yet - supply a larger, longer wristband."
3.0,The stone is nice but set in a weird way. The band's have more metal than vs. Don't like much for my style.
3.0,"Mommy loves it , it works well for her"
3.0,"Well it’s very pretty and it fits well. I’m 5’5” and 135 lbs and 36D and the small is great. However, the top is completely sheer. I was looking for a summer dress that I can wear without a bra and this ain’t it. You can see EVERYTHING. Wearing a bra would look bad because of straps and I’m worried a bandeau would show a lot too and be uncomfortable. The description mentioned that the seller had upgraded the product to have the top double lined so it wouldn’t be see through, so I must I’ve gotten one from an old batch. Pretty disappointed. 3 stars because it’s pretty. I just don’t understand why the bottom would be lined and not the bodice."
3.0,"Seemed like a nice blouse, just big"
3.0,Not to bad looks good in person
3.0,"I like this dress a lot; the reason I didn't give more stars was because the company screwed up the order, and I had to wait 19 days for the correct one to arrive. This is a good buy, if you're not in any particular hurry to get the product."
3.0,"I gave 3 stars because the charm is gorgeous. HOWEVER, the way it is put together, the solitaire part, does not play flat, it lays sideways. I tried putting the chain differently on the bale, still twists. I tried a longer chain, still twists. I own a lot of Merthus jewelry, I am rarely disappointed. Maybe it was just the one I received. I am sad, the charm is just gorgeous."
3.0,Thinner than the original lenses. Snaps in fine but they are thinner.  You'll see a ledge around the lens when it sits in the frames
3.0,it was plastic instead of rope
3.0,Not bad for $20.  They feel a little flimsy but have held up so far. If they break after a year I would buy them again.
3.0,"The red color is great, the top is a little big and doesn’t have much support at all and the straps come undone a LOT. bottoms are a little small, but overall I like It. I just Wish it was a little more....sturdy."
3.0,It's more of a beach dress than anything. Still cute
3.0,could not get comfortable on nose too narrow for me and because of weight of lenses
3.0,"For those squicked out by descriptions of male anatomy, you can stop here.  In my never-ending quest to find comfortable boxer briefs that provide a good degree of separation, I found these to be the male equivalent of the push-up bra.  The side stitching around the crotch push your equipment out loud and proud, but house them in a very thin pouch which allows for a lot of jiggle...not an unpleasant sensation when walking around in loose fitting jeans; you def feel like you're hanging out there.  So this brief is def more for display than support.  My priority isn't support though, so the jiggle and friction are ok; I do want separation and the degree of separation with the push-out stitching is nice...your balls don't stick to your leg or taint, and it works pretty well when walking or standing.  But for my specific configuration (high and tight), when I sit down, one ball can pop out of the pouch and move behind the push-up stitching, which can be uncomfortable, esp when in a work meeting.  Probably for the dude with low hangers, they might stay in the pouch better, or conversely maybe even more prone to go free range.  I bought the long leg version, which is great for not riding up the leg and bunching up in the crotch, not sure about the shorter leg version, but the material is very thin (and soft) so am thinking it would all wad up in your crotch.  The display pouch is ok, but it just doesn't fit my configuration when sitting, so will continue on the search for a non-bunching, high degree of separation boxer brief."
3.0,I have a short torso and it still sits to high up on thighs.
3.0,Item wasn't true to size
3.0,Nice casual shirt for the price.
3.0,The shorts ran a little tighter than expected for a large. Front pockets are too forward and not deep. Good fabric and definitely dries fast though.
3.0,just too tight in arms was not as cute as picture.
3.0,Some what small but I like it
3.0,I thought it would be better quality but since they are only gifts I would say for the price they are OK.
3.0,Not good as I expect. And my butt will look bigger.So have to return it.
3.0,I bought these for my teenage daughter who lives in leggings. unfortunately the second time wearing a pair they got a run in them. I assumed they would be a little better quality seeing as they were not 'cheap' even though they were not the highest priced ones. I am sure they would be great for occasional wear in a less active environment.
3.0,I orderedsize12 for myself and got kids size 12.
3.0,It isn’t as I expected. My butt looks better without these on haha. It smashes my butt in on the top because my butt isn’t flat near the tailbone. I would say this is comfy for working out but isn’t as flattering as people are making it sound. And the fabric is a bit itchy also.
3.0,Very cute. Well made. Shirt was see through. But shorts were skin tight.
3.0,"Nice, but very thin."
3.0,I ordered different colors because I like the design but the sizing/measurement<br /> is not consistent.
3.0,"The word ""Luminous"" is in the description hoping you will think it is a ""Luminox"" but it is a knock-off of a Navy Seal watch when it is really a shoddy replica.<br /><br />Looks beautiful but, the day of week is in Chinese and watch stem has to be manipulated like a security safe. The seller has a complicated set of procedures to set day and time which are very difficult to understand. You will be very unhappy with this product so, do yourself a favor and don't purchase this fake ""Luminox"". It's a full headache and they will not allow you to return it. Repeat, they will not allow you to return the watch ]. Caveat Emptor.<br /><br />Buyer Update: After decompressing about not allowing returns, the seller was kind enough to refund the purchase price and  asked me to keep the watch. Still not fond of the watch and not wearing it but, I must compliment the seller on making things right. Some may love this watch and the seller is extremely fair and trustworthy to make the customer happy.  Impressive.......<br /><br />..."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. It looks nice enough, but the nylon is cheap and flimsy and the buckle isn't well constructed. The watch keeps falling off."
3.0,Fits too tight in certain areas and the neckline is too high.
3.0,"It is very thin and see through, you have to where white underneath, however it is still so thin you could see everything"
3.0,They were a little different than the picture.  I expected them to look a little more dainty  like the picture . But still nice gloves.  Works well with my phone.
3.0,"The quality of the shirt was nice and soft, but the style was not the same pictured. It also had a strong chemical odor.<br /><br /> If you prefer the raw edge collar, I suggest going with BTFMB. The shirt on the left is from BTFBM compared with Leani on the right."
3.0,A little uncomfortable at first.
3.0,"This glasses feel a little bit on the cheap side, I tough the little legs would feel a little bit more riggid bit they were too loose. The lenses are fine, they're kinda dark. But for the price you get a nice looking frame. You get what you pay for, don't have high hopes. It is fine if you just need a couple of glasses last minute and dont want to spend too much on glasses."
3.0,"I ended up getting green, blue, purple, pink, black and yellow - the picture even though it says there are 6 tongue rings, is misleading. Other reviews say they received the clear one and I was hoping for that one most of all, but never received it.<br />As that was a selling point, I can't say I was completely satisfied with this order."
3.0,"Just received this case for several days.  It feels secure and is not too bulky.  However, the silicon sleeve is too loose which drags on the hard shell case whenever you need to use the phone.  It is difficult to slide the phone out to answer a call or to type a text message.  Otherwise, it seems to provide good protection to the phone."
3.0,"This bag a perfect for visiting nurses, with one (major) exception: it will come apart. I have bought this bag 3 times in the past 4 years because I cannot find a bag that can compare. But every time, either a zipper breaks, or the stitching comes undone. It seems very durable, and I am not excessively hard on my equipment. In fact, I thought that it was an isolated incident when it started to fall apart the first time. But it has happened with the two subsequent purchases as well. I have been looking for another bag, but I will probably end up buying this one again, and accept that it will only last for about a year."
3.0,"I asked for a large size because I'm 10 and I'm not sure they sent me the right size because the packaging doesn't show it, but it certainly fits very small and pop out constantly."
3.0,It is just okay.  Bobs around a bit so will need some bobby pins to hold in place.  But for $10 it is just fine.  I will work with it.  Yo ho!
3.0,Batteries would not run for more than two days.  Looked great when working.
3.0,"Not as pictured, much darker. But good quality. Stretchy fabric like boardshorts."
3.0,Somewhat flimsy and took a very long time to ship/receive
3.0,These run too large. I order XL in all yoga pants. These do not stay up.  Walked around all day pulling them up.
3.0,Tried to return cost to much. Will keep afterall. As of now I donated them to homeless persons
3.0,"Somewhat see through. the Front is much longer than the back which is kind of a weird style,  but it's a cute pattern and I like the pom pom edge!"
3.0,"The belt was too small for me and leans more toward orange then brown.  But that's just my personal opinion.  It wasn't exactly what I wanted, but maybe something someone else would!"
3.0,"The Rheos bahias small sunglasses are supposed to fit smaller faces.  I usually wear small to regular sized sunglasses, and these are just too large to be called small.  They are also on the cheaper side.  I expected them to be better than the $20.00 sunglasses one can get at a discount store, but not so."
3.0,"no the greatest quality, maybe like something you would find at Forever21 and the print was pretty poor"
3.0,The shipping on this product was messed up by UPS. I will update this review once I actually get them. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
3.0,"It's a little cheap looking but will be fine with jeans.It's light weight, not as nice looking as the photo."
3.0,Material seems good. The pin on one side comes out of the roller of the buckle. I guess I have to use super glue to keep it together.
3.0,Have to use the last chain part of the extender
3.0,The PJ's were great but I feel they run somewhat on the small size.
3.0,These were ok. I thought they would be close to something you’d buy at Claire’s in the mall but it was more like something you’d buy from like big lots or some little weird outlet store. But nonetheless they are cute to wear every once in awhile and plus they were inexpensive but still too expensive for the quality. The length was just right not to long or to short either.
3.0,"These glasses are okay, not very sturdy."
3.0,"passt ganz gut, Preis Leistung stimmt."
3.0,Cute but no fleece inner layer. No good when windy.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:ecffbb612c7ac389d628c7313effca44]] No me agrado que se rompió el bolsillo es hermoso a my esposa le encantó pero se rompió
3.0,It is way too large! Good looking hat but it is not what it say!
3.0,No value for prime membership
3.0,I love the purse and love the idea.  It does not fit the iphone 6 plus and nowhere was this disclosed.
3.0,I like the ring it's about the size I thought it would be. I gave it a three star because it took a long time to get here but it is hand made and shipped from overseas.. I wear it every day.
3.0,I'm barely a 32b and size small was way too tight. I recommend sizing up 1 or even 2 sizes. The white bra is super opaque and not see through which is impressive. Material is seamless and feels like most gym clothes so probably moisture wicking. But will most likely pill easily.
3.0,"Pockets in a weird spot, and hood is very big,but i did order a size up. other then that i like it, very warm and soft on inside."
3.0,This wasn't flannel material -- feels more like a dress shirt.
3.0,Felt too tight. I’ve bought other kinds with the same size and never had issues.
3.0,"I was surprised when they turned out being slightly longer (past my ankles) and they did not fit slim. They have a lot of stretch around the waist and didn't stay on. They feel soft and nice, although I think they're very thin and might not hold up if I got a size that was too small instead. They look great otherwise, though! I always order the smaller size so, maybe order a size lower than usual."
3.0,"Fits way too small, order a 2xx even though i am a 1x. Still does not fit"
3.0,My older hippie Aunt would like this. I thought I would like it but it was just not Free People enough
3.0,Interesting novelty watch .  Doesnt have night light/backlight and its really cheap plastic .<br />But as I said interesting to hear a voice read out the time .
3.0,Disappointed because i was really looking for a olive green sandal. These sandals are not dark olive they are more of a dark taupe color. Comfortable but a little narrow at the toe but looks like the leather will mold to the foot and stretch over time.
3.0,This looks mostly like shown.  The size was disappointing but the cover up is nice.
3.0,"Even though these shorts appear to have a drawstring, it is actually just a shoelace sewn onto the front for decoration and does nothing to adjust the waist band. The fit is weird and unflattering they puff around the hips but are right around the tops of my thighs."
3.0,Looks a little cheap but still okay and functional
3.0,Turned my finger green. Very sad
3.0,"I give this piece a three star only because it had a very small piece missing, not stones.  It also is emerald green, nit teal as shown.  But, that being said, it is very lovely."
3.0,"Beautiful dress, unfortunately I had to return it because the shoulder was a little bigger for me."
3.0,Doesn’t have a second loop to hold down the extra band. That was disappointing and made it uncomfortable to wear. The strap keeps coming loose & hanging which catches on everything.
3.0,"My breasts are separated and look ridiculous. I can wear it with a bra, or when no one is home. Theres something in the seam that continually pokes and itches me.  I cant find it, and It drives me crazy. Its like a tiny splinter in your sock."
3.0,"It's cute, but not true to picture. It looks mostly like this, but with a much smaller flower on it, it's actually about the size of the red drop pendant. Also the chain on the back broke off as soon as it was out of the package. Which I easily replaced, so it's still wearable and I'll still be using it, just not great quality."
3.0,"While the dress is beautiful, a small was way too big for me. I'm 5'7&#34; 115lbs and a B cup, it would fit better with an overall larger torso, specifically in the bust. Beware of returns, you have to pay for shipping."
3.0,to large need to return
3.0,these are to big i will return to get a smaller size other than that they are good
3.0,"They work well with sneaker, less well with loafers."
3.0,Charm fell off in 2 days :(
3.0,"Too big, and I thought it was separate pieces, not one large piece. Also It appears aqua, but arrived light blue."
3.0,I really wanted to love this dress but it’s way too big.
3.0,I ordered the green and the actual color is much different than the picture. I'm a bit disappointed in the color bc the pictures green was so beautiful. The green I got was darker and much more of a grass green color. I wish there was a little more room or hang in the chest area as well.
3.0,I bought this bracelet for my goddaughter and she loved it. The quality seems to be fine and it looks great.
3.0,I got an XL and I'm 214. It was a little bit snug.
3.0,I had this just a little over a year before it really started falling apart- inside seam ripping & zipper broken..see pics.  I don't know if that's a good life span for a wallet & I didn't pay a fortune for it but I typically like mine to last a little longer.  It does have a &#34;crinkly&#34; paper sound that sounds cheap and the zipper for the coin purse (back when it was working)always opened a little on its own and would drop coins.  On the plus side it did hold my check book and most of all my cards.
3.0,"A little tough putting it around the head, no adjustment string. It didn’t fit my 3yr old . I love the the opening for the filter."
3.0,The clips hurt.
3.0,"It arrived promptly, its attractive, sturdy, and easy enough to put on.  This was for a color-themed event.  I've stored it away until next year's annual event, so I won't be testing it it for endurance."
3.0,"First of all I ordered GDTK Women's Large Capacity Luxury Wax Genuine Leather Purse Clutch Wallet in Coffee Rfid Blocking, reading some of  the reviews, some received their wallet with card that have RFID blocking written on it and some don't. I have problem with this specially when I received mine without it. contacted them and asked what's the difference between the two. sent pictures of the wallet and just told me it's the right one. it's the right product alright but I have no idea if it's RFID! I would have given this 5 stars if my question was answered though. It is nice, color is beautiful even a little stiff but seems like starting to soften as you use. plenty of rooms for cards 21 including for the ID. have a strong smell at first but the lavender packet included helped a lot to remove it."
3.0,the small was very large for a petite woman ! nice colors but have to return
3.0,This jacket is super cute - the 8 fits my 8 year old a little big but she is slender and I thought it would probably fit a bit large and bought it this way hoping she  could wear it for awhile.  It was perfect for her Sandy costume.
3.0,Loose strings and looks/feels cheaper out of the box.
3.0,Very low cut in front on me.
3.0,Run slightly big. Thick material. Longer than expected.
3.0,These are much smaller than they appear in the photos. For pierced ears only.
3.0,nunca entendi las intrucciones y nunca loo pude programar para mi nino
3.0,"Very cute shirt. Measurements were accurate until I washed it the first time and now the torso is very short. I can still wear it tucked into high waisted pants and skirts, but it’s a bit disappointing."
3.0,Little cheap looking but still cute
3.0,"Upon opening the package, the first thing I noticed was that I was missing two pairs of gauges. Particularly important pieces because I need those pieces to upgrade sizes. Oddly enough, I also received 8 pairs of gauges that I didn't order. Butt ugly lookin things at that."
3.0,Necklace is about 16 inches.  It has a nice color and sheen.  Great for a pendant or charm worn infrequently.
3.0,This was a nice idea but it was too bulky for my needs.
3.0,The earing rod needs to be behind the flower not the pearl.
3.0,"They are hollow.  I knew that from the price.  They dent easily, and the keepers are nearly impossible for a man's fingers to manipulate."
3.0,"I have c cup boobs and I ordered the biggest size. Still too small but, I can kinda pull it off"
3.0,"I ordered 2 different sizes because I read the previous reviews about the sizing being weird. I’m a solid 00g and have been for the past 6 years. So 00g is 10mm and I also got a size up of 12mm as well. The 10mm is too small and falls out easily and the 12mm won’t fit in my ear at all even after wetting and using Vaseline. Makes me sad because they are really beautiful plugs and were a great price for 18 of them.<br /><br />I attached pics to show the sizing difference of the 2 I ordered from here, and then the second picture with the snowflake obsidian in the middle is the one I normally wear.<br /><br />I’m going to order the 00g 10mm again and hope that they just put the wrong size in the container<br />¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
3.0,Super cute. Extremely thin.
3.0,My daughter broke it the first hour she had it on. Mine is fine.
3.0,"Great watch for teaching kids about time, and he loved the dinosaur theme, but mine loses about a minute every couple weeks."
3.0,They are warm when dry but with even a little rain they soak it  right up and your hands are like instant ice.
3.0,Too little looks like a purse for a young girl
3.0,Looks nice<br />It's not going to put up with any harsh treatment it's clearly very light and cheap when you're holding it but it looks nice on and it doesn't cost much
3.0,These look great and the packaging was fancy but they are cheaply made the lenses keep coming out every time I clean them and it takes a while to stick them back in.
3.0,"I thought the dress had all lace in front, don't like the way the front fits"
3.0,These don’t fit correctly.
3.0,Too small in the buttocks area for me. I have a curvy body so this did not work
3.0,"Unremarkable purse. The bottom of it was as big as the whole purse (the purse is essentially a cube), so it was awkward as a shoulder bag. Nice bag, but it got sent back. Lots of others to choose from at that price."
3.0,"Design was nice, material was hard to breathe with when on. I also bought them for my son and daughter (xs) and it was too big for them and fit my adult face. It’s weird because I also bought a different design by the same seller at an xs as well and that was smaller then these masks. So it’s luck of the drawl."
3.0,"Been wanting this style of earrings for some time. I like hoop style earrings and this style eliminates the need for a clasp, an idea that appealed to me.<br /><br />Think they might be shown off to best advantage with a solid color top or dress. Just my preference. As their detail is involved/busy.<br />I am enjoying wearing both colors.<br />Didn't realize they came 2 to an order. Wear either depending on your mood or preference, silver vs gold.<br />Not too heavy and easy to put on."
3.0,"The color is darker, goes on the small size, not true size. The fabric is kind of knitted so it can get stuck with rings or objects."
3.0,"Pretty pattern, but the top was waaay too small, had to return it."
3.0,"These were super cute looking but not very functional. It didn't have any give on my 15 month olds feet. They were very stiff and I watched him walk around the house with them, is walking was a little off. The strap indented the ankle and his foot had marks on them for just the 30 minutes he wore them. Granted he does have chubby wide feet. I ended up returned them and got some crocs"
3.0,The bands are a bit stiffer than the original one and they are longer than the small ones.
3.0,"I only received it today. It seems very sturdy and comfy. Also I’m sure it’s a true Fjallraven brand.<br />The only reason I put 3 stars is because I ordered Royal Blue color and I think I have received Blue Ridge even though it says on the label correct description. The color should be dark blue, but on my photo you can see lighter blue. I’m still going to keep it.<br />The product itself is great!"
3.0,it was to short
3.0,"more like a baggy shirt then as a flowy shirt/dress, still decently cute tho"
3.0,I loved this ring and that it went above a size 9. However stones began to fall out so I had to return it.
3.0,Pants fit but are pretty tight and a bit see through. The jacket is pretty perfect though and roomy enough while still cute.
3.0,"I love the way the dress fit.  The only problem I had with it, was that the dress was to long from the bottom."
3.0,Wish the hole in back wasn't so big
3.0,"I am a 9 1/2 so I am sure I ordered a size 10 or 10 1/2. I am sure I would never order an 11 1/2, two sizes larger, which is what I got.  If I wear socks the fit ok. They are a help for my feet."
3.0,The boots I love them . but they  run small I need a half size I ordered a pair nine
3.0,I got a lot of compliments on this until it broke! I tried to put it back together but now it's starting to fade!
3.0,"Overall quality of the shoes is fair. I would not purchase these shoes at this cost again considering the overall quality of the shoes. My daughter likes the design/color of the shoes, but not worth the price."
3.0,I chose this rating because the quality of the fabric was good. The sizing chart to pick the size you want was not specific enough to pick the right size and length.
3.0,I had been looking at an expensive version of this but decided to try the cheap version. The ring is great and easy to clean. I love how I can wear it on my wrist with my work keys. It’s easy to find in my purse. I don’t always like to wear a purse so this is a good alternative. The only negative is that the gold ring that holds the keys broke pretty quickly.
3.0,Way to small.  It fits my 9 year old daughter but not my face.
3.0,This is not the sweatpants I received. Very light weight no pockets no black trim no drawstring and even though they do have elastic at the ankles they are not joggers. After having said all that they do fit well and I will keep them. Not sure they are worth the money I paid. The waist  and is not very stretchy and may wear out soon.
3.0,Cute inexpensive dress.
3.0,"Wanted RED as in the color RED.  Not so much. But very attractive, just not RED."
3.0,Keeps feet warm. They move down if you don't fold the top.
3.0,"This dress / shirt does seem to be made in good quality and it is soft and really warm. That is the only thing I really like about it though. It definitely fits more like an extra small up in the shoulders and arm areas. Even though I bought a small. The shoulder is not possible to hang off the side like it shows in the photo which was the main reason I bought it. It also has loose hanging armpits that I dont like and was not aware of. I also bought what seemed to be a dark red from the photos but it is a bright red. Overall disappointed in this purchase choice, for what I had expected."
3.0,"I ordered this shirt in a US 18, typically I am a US 16 or anywhere from an XL to XXL, so I was not expecting this shirt to come labeled 8XL and to be too small. I was only able to wear it unbuttoned with a white shirt underneath it and it was far too tight on my arms. I am probably not going to be able to wear it again, unfortunately."
3.0,"Watch way too big for woman, sent it back."
3.0,"These gloves have a nice design, which is why I bought them. But when I received them, I noticed that there were a few loose threads on the gloves. I didn't want to take the risk of them unraveling so I returned all of them."
3.0,"The glasses don't have as much blue as the picture.  I found the fit a bit weird. I have a smaller face and head.  The glasses width seems a bit narrow on my face but the stems were really long.  After some bending and adjustments I got the stems just right.  They look pretty cool on, but they are heavy.  So the slip down my nose easily and can only be worn for short time periods like driving and running errands.  I wouldn't wear them exercising, playing golf, or at the beach."
3.0,It was a highlight. Looked great and my daughter absolutely loved it until the strap broke only 4 months into using it lightly. She was so disappointed...
3.0,"Good quality but too big: and I really wish the belt had belt loops! If there was less fabric and a touch more shape, it could be super cute. Don’t lose the belt!"
3.0,Very cute and soft but whoever made them put the tags on the outside of the clothing.
3.0,This is a very beautiful watch but the 24 hour subdial is severely inaccurate!
3.0,Good quality but too small. Normally wear a size 12 this ring set says fit for 12-12.5 but it was too tight.
3.0,"Very flattering and for larger bust size, otherwise too much draping in bust. I had to return."
3.0,"Beautiful neclace. However it is not blue at all, unless you hold up to the light for several minutes, then shut all lights off for the glow-in-the-dark effect. I thought the chain was cheap looking, so I switched it. For the price, it is still a good buy. Just don't expect a brilliant blue colour, it's the color of vaseline......like a lip balm."
3.0,Cute but the rabbit and carrot size are smaller than expected. That said it's a cute ring.  Bends very easily.
3.0,"Comfortable and cute, so I'm very sad that after only a few months, an opal fell out. I'm bummed and won't buy a replacement from them because I'm definitely worried it will happen again."
3.0,"This is a beautiful hat, however it arrived in a plastic bag all Scrunched up And out of shape. I am disappointed in the shipping details."
3.0,"I liked this dress.  For the price the fabric was soft and it has a lot if stretch.  It does run on the small size so order up, that way the cut in the front will not show off your ""cookie!""  I wore it to Disney and it was comfortable all day even in the heat of Florida."
3.0,The lighter grey is see-through in sunlight.
3.0,The material is rather thin and it isn’t very absorbent . I think the price should be lower.
3.0,I got this in Jan and they worked pretty good for a few months. but now they just pop off alot. ill have one clip pop off 3 times a day. and they also seem to tear the top of my socks.  i wear  3pc suits for work. im on call for 10 days straight in 24hr shifts and need to look sharp all the time. might buy another set or look for a different brand to compare. but on a positive note. they are comfortable and i forget i even have them on.
3.0,"This robe - I got it in the dark blue cherry blossom - is a lovely color, but the fabric is not what I expected; I was anticipating the type of silk that's a touch less shiny and while smooth has a bit of drag as you run a finger across it. This is a standard satin weave, so it is very slippery and no matter how tightly I tie the belt it slides open after perhaps five minutes of actual wearing. I have a long torso and a high waist, so the belt also wants to slide upwards over my tummy until it's over my ribcage and just under my chest; since I have a bit of a tummy, this is rather unflattering, unfortunately. It's lightweight, cool, and comfortable, but without being able to keep it closed I can't justify keeping it, especially at this price."
3.0,The elastic is not as good as the ones I have had before from the dept. store.<br />The material is thinner in thread count and I don't expect them to wear as long
3.0,"So odd - reviews were kind of all over the place, most RACED and some hated it; yet all were consistent that it ran small.  I got Amazon Answers from multiple women who were verified purchasers, and we shared measurements.  By the guide, I was a perfect medium (size 6, 34C/D).  Smaller girls said their medium was too tight.  I ordered a large no problem!  The large is HUGE. In every way.  Big, boxy, loose, down to my knees (I'm 5,6&#34;), sleeves were REALLY long.  The print and colors were so cute, and it seems like strong material and good quality construction, but it is king of like a mans night shirt.  And a little scratchy.  Maybe more than a little.  Since it's so big, I can't really tell if I like the shape.  I'm not sure why I got such a big one, I even checked to see if it was men's in error!  Def has to go back."
3.0,I like the belt and buckle but question if it is really leather. Looks like cheaper &#34;bonded&#34; leather. Was expecting more of a real leather look.
3.0,Ordered for my mother. She said it wasn't as spectacular as she thought from pics
3.0,X_cxcxxxx.  X
3.0,"I expected a different fabric. I was a little disappointed that it wasn't cotton. The fit overall was great, just reminded me of pajamas rather than work attire."
3.0,It fits like a regular hat. I was under the assumption that it would be for big n tall men.
3.0,"It's not 5.00 carats that's for sure, but it is a lovely piece of quartz so Ill keep it. I like how it layers with my other necklaces and if it were bigger I wouldn't like it as much."
3.0,"I liked the color, feel, and simplicity of the vest. No extraneous  hardware and simple snaps.  BUT XL size was closer to a large or even a medium.  I am returning."
3.0,These are cute and really comfy. The fabric strap is really nice between the toes but is a bit too loose which makes it a bit difficult to walk in. I use these to take things out to the trash or check the mail but can’t walk around the block without feeling like they’re going to fall off. I do not have extra thin feet and was surprised that it was so loose.<br /><br />Hope you find this review and pictures helpful!
3.0,"They run really really big. Cute though, will put away til next year (lol). still gotta buy smaller size"
3.0,The other Fox River Ragg gloves on Amazon looks similar and are similarly priced.  Make sure you want a one layer glove if you pick this one.  It is a nice glove but not good against cold wind.  Not suitable for this year's NY winter.  Went and also purchased the other Fox River glove that was 3 layers after I realize when I received this pair that it was only 1 layer.  Used it for a week before deciding to get the other pair too.  Very nice quality for a one layer glove.  A little scratchy on the skin but it softens over time.
3.0,"They're not exaggerating, they are HUGE. The lens popped out of them as soon as I got them."
3.0,The quality of this skirt is not durable at all. I wouldn't buy it again.
3.0,Love the shirt....especially when people dont know what it is
3.0,It was gorgeous and the bottoms fit perfect but the top was loose so I was afraid swimming would be out of the question.
3.0,"I got the pink ... it was not the same pink as shown in the picture.  It was almost hot pink ... way to vibrant.  I also didn't like the material.  It has a weird rubbery feel to it.  It appears to be well made and probably won't shrink ... does rubber shrink?  The sleeves were also not as long as shown in the picture.  Too bad, I was kind of looking forward to this shirt, but I will be sending it back."
3.0,"These are fairly tight.  Probably work well for actual dance, etc., but not comfy for just sitting around.  I bought them to protect bottoms of my feet while moisturizing but they are too tight to wear for long."
3.0,"The fit and quality of the skirt were phenomenal. I really liked the jacquard print. I'm 5' 7&#34; and 130lbs and a medium fit absolutely perfect on my natural waistline. The one thing that I was seriously disappointed about was that the product description didn't comment more on the color than just &#34;white&#34;. I was shopping for a pure white color, but the product ended up as off-white. I ended up having to return it because it didn't match with the top I had intended to wear it with. Attached is a photo comparing the off-white skirt color (right) with a piece of pure white clothing (left). Also, note that the material has a bit of a shine rather than a matte appearance on the product images.<br /><br />Otherwise, if you aren't discriminating based on color this was a lovely skirt with a great shape and print."
3.0,"Top is very tight, so sized a little on the small side.  Otherwise ok, will make it work!"
3.0,It is not as I espected
3.0,"(2.5-3)<br />I really want to rate this higher. The fact is that it didn't fit right, they run small all of them, and it was a set I really wanted, so to me. When  ring companies sell the  wrong  size, to me it's not excused."
3.0,"Well-made, but small for an XL. I'm 5'10"", 200lbs, and generally wear an XL shirt because I like a little extra room.  This fits tight - more like a large, especially in the shoulders. Took it down a star for that.<br />Maybe a little thinner material than I like too, but that's personal preference."
3.0,"It is hard to tell how low this necklace will hang based on the photos.  It landed higher than I expected.  I also didn't recognize that the loops are all individual not one cohesive piece.  On me, this makes for a noisy necklace which I'm not a fan of."
3.0,"Meh! These aren't my favorite. They just look weird with my face and they are huge! They are also flat...I wore them once and then somehow while they were sitting in the car, one of the lenses popped off!🤷‍♀️ I just personally don't care for them."
3.0,"They aren't what I expected. The sole doesn't have enough traction. Needs more slip resistance for a very active, boy. Very light."
3.0,To tight on the waist
3.0,"These socks are cute and colorful, and even though they are heavier than some, they are not hot.  The thickness also allows me to wear them around the house without shoes and I don't have to worry about damaging the bottoms. However, if you need 20-30 compression for medical reasons, they do not provide that level of compression.  They are more like a 10-15.  Makes them easy to get on and off, but not what I needed."
3.0,"If the straps aren't thick enough, they will be loose."
3.0,I really liked the style of the dress but didnt really like the material or how the dress looked on my particular body
3.0,A lil smaller than the size and the color look more fiusha than red. Hope that after some use it will be better
3.0,FRAME TOO LARGE
3.0,I really liked these but my ears are too sensative. If you can wear fake jewelry without your ears becoming infected then these are perfect for you. I wish I could wear mine! They are very cute.
3.0,"I like the pattern, it is exactly as pictured. The fit is about as I expected, a little loose on me, but that's okay. It did take me over a month to get it, in the mail. I also got no response from the seller whatsoever through the process. So, there is that."
3.0,"My brother loves the gloves, however he thinks the quality of them has changed. He said they are starting to peel and come loose at the seams after about a week."
3.0,"It’s beautiful however, it requires dry cleaning so you’ll spend more money for this sweater."
3.0,Very light for the summer unfortunately to small.
3.0,Fits well and color is exact bit the material is a very cheap material
3.0,"I liked this belt at first, I don’t regularly wear this belt everyday, and it started peeling after a few times wearing it. I have another belt that I regularly wear for work almost everyday since 2006, and the quality of my old belt is way better than the quality of this belt. I like the concept of this belt (ratchet) , but the quality is not so good."
3.0,"Smaller than I expected.  Light didn’t work, even putting brown new batteries"
3.0,Asian sizes and american sizes different need 3x in american it it beautiful. But cannot. Wear it
3.0,"I bought the set of 4 gaiters to use for my family and me when going in public during the Covid era. I had read reviews that these were too tight for many people. I am male, 6'2"" / 180 pounds and found these all to be too loose to stay on my face. My wife and children found them to be too loose as well. For these to be effective, I have to find something like a rubber band or rolling them to make the end tight enough to hold up on my nose. The overall quality is fine, and the fabric and seams both are sufficient quality. The fit on my face is obviously subjective, but I have not found these to fit on me like I have seen other people wearing gaiters. I could definitely not wear these for running or highly active environments."
3.0,"Not really compression tanks as advertised but nice material, I bought small and it is a fitted look!"
3.0,"I go through leather gloves at an incredible pace when it's raining and/or snowing. I usually get Wal-Mart gloves and replace them every other week. These lasted about 3 weeks. They are better, but not by a lot. Seams started coming apart on them. Wal-Mart gloves usually wear through the leather on my fingers. I'm going back to my Wal-Mart specials."
3.0,The shape is not great. It's got a strong bend in the middle. Can't say I love these. I would return but we used 2 of them due to necessity.
3.0,"WORE THEM 1ST TIME ON COLD RAINY FALL DAY, NOT POURING, JUST WET. MY HANDS, HUST OUT FOR A WALK, HOLDING THE LEASH WERE WET. NOT HAPPY. WE'LL SEE HOW THEY DO ON DAY COLD DAYS, WHEN THERE IS NO SNOW TO DAMPEN THEM!"
3.0,There were strings coming from it (still attached) when I opened them but they’re cute and comfy. I got a size 10 which is too small so I had to return them.
3.0,"For the price, quality is fine.  Used it to go walking or to palettes class."
3.0,"I got this at a Christmas gift for my husband. The watch is nice, but not what I expected so we returned it. What could have been better is the watch strap. It is a silicone material and it picks up lint. For example the box it came in has a white lining and it rubbed on to the watch strap. Since the strap is a blue color it was very noticeable. Hard 2 get off. Also, the plastic piece that is supposed  to be attached to the face of the watch had fallen off inside the box which makes me wonder if this was a Watch that someone else had already returned before."
3.0,Hat is too big and has no way to adjust. Would not buy again.
3.0,"This is a great product for younger people, but with arthritis and carpal tunnel it is tiresome rubbing the whole time."
3.0,Es bonita lo único es el olor muy desagradable
3.0,Very cute but way to small! The arms are the smallest part.
3.0,"Nice lanyard, but I was hoping to get some of the magenta in mine...I only got black, grey, and white. 😔"
3.0,These scarves were lol. A little on the thinner side. I returned them because the white is not white. I wanted bright white.
3.0,The frabric is transparent
3.0,they are too tight
3.0,"Nice shoes, good quality.  However, the toe box is too tight for me."
3.0,Dress was to large and long!
3.0,"I'm 5'3 and 150 lbs and I ordered a medium. It fits great and is comfortable,  but the material faded after the first wash. I was very disappointed since I loved everything else about it."
3.0,Not exactly What I wanted!!
3.0,"I was a little disappointed in this purchase.  The quality is great and and the color is nice.  But the sizing is strange and the style is not what I pictured.<br /><br />The size was impossible.  I ordered two sizes and the smaller size was too small - so small that I couldn't get it on.  And the larger size was too large - so large that I was swimming in it.  I guess I need a half-size!<br /><br />But the biggest disappointment is that the waist is NOT HIGH RESE and legs are not tapered as advertised.  These are simple, straight-leg pants.  No tapering.  And the waist does not reach the belly button.  I don't like the heaviness of extra fabric around my legs and that is why I ordered a tapered leg.  Either I do not understand what a tapered leg is, OR the style is not as advertised.  I also do not like mid-rise pants.  That is not the correct fit for my body which is why I ordered a high rise pant.<br /><br />Anyway, The quality if very nice and I briefly considered keeping and having them altered.  But in the end, it was simply too radically different than what was advertised that I returned them."
3.0,"The top was delivered but she shorts were not. I ordered it for my friend and shipped it internationally to her, but the bottoms did not come. With taxes and everything, it was too expensive to not have the shorts with it. It ended up being double to the price to ship to her and I would atleast expect everything to ship."
3.0,I really like the Jed North brand. Keep in mind that the Brad does run a bit small. The problem I had with this was that it tapers in a lot at the waist. So if you have any love handles it will hug them tightly almost like a compression shirt and the material doesn't really stretch. If it didn't taper in I would have given it 5 stars but i ended up returning it due to that fact.
3.0,The shirt is nice. Kind of bulky and not soft. I was hoping for soft fabric.  Color is more of a butter than a beige.
3.0,Yes they weren’t damaged but they were super small and one was bigger then the other not at all true to size.
3.0,Very cute but delicate. Not real pearls and to me doesn’t look like real gold and the charm felt off.<br />The metal send very moldeable which after a couple of use it may loose its shape in someway.<br />But very lovely piece
3.0,Xsmall!
3.0,"I typically wear a m/l and ordered an xl. So size up one or two... this was not the color pictured, it’s more of a steal blue (not light grey). Its not sweatshirt material. There wasn’t a tag to confirm what kind of fabric this was, if describe it as a super thick athletic material. Not stretchy. Not see through. Warm. And Prob more comfy the more you wash... not sure if I’m keeping it. Just wanted to submit pics so people are aware you’re ordering a diff product than pictured. Still cute, still comfy (not as comfy as a sweatshirt) but not as expected."
3.0,"The shirt is indeed nice & good quality materials, but unfortnately too small, & not to SPECS of a XXL t-shirt... Unfortunely I can wear it, & had to give the t-shirt to my younger Nephew...!!  Michael Cosenza"
3.0,Was expecting the lettering to be more prominent and dark. Bracelet is very shiny. Hoping it will darken
3.0,Socks twist and slide off my heel several times daily
3.0,Doesn't keep good time. Mine gains about 5mins. every 2wks.
3.0,Cute dress but too much material and loose
3.0,"Good construction and fabric, but note this runs a little large."
3.0,Cheap glasses you get what you pay for they come in nicely packaged and when you break them they're cheap so you're not out-of-pocket too much
3.0,"Works well keeping the sun off you, but just a little to floppy."
3.0,"This dress is soooo cute...seriously. And I ordered the light blue which is gorgeous in person. unfortunately, I have to return this dress because it runs small...especially in the bust area. I would advise sizing up if you are a busty girl."
3.0,"I didn't care for the feel of the fabric--it was kind of rough and thin.  The fit and construction seemed okay, but I returned the item."
3.0,"Runs very small. My son is 8, but tiny and normally wears a 6. I purchased an 8 thinking we would have next winter to wear the coat. All size 8's in the store are quite large on him. This coat fits very snug with no room for growth. Also the zipper on the coat is super cheap."
3.0,Fits the bill fit don’t cheap basic lounging shorts. Typical cheap Amazon clothing
3.0,The fabric is thin sleeves are too long and length is short.
3.0,A lil smaller than the chart refers but it's still sexy and even open it does it's job. Everyone loved it on the beach.
3.0,on own a bunch CASIO’s  this one does the job looks great just a little too cheap.
3.0,"i love the color of this blazer/cardigan. the material does not stretch and will wrinkle really easily. when you iron it, it would not look totally crease-free, the material just looks like crepe. i can't explain it. but it's not too bad.<br /><br />the style is really cute from the front. it has very tiny padding on the shoulders, i wish the padding does more to create a more structured shoulders because this one really doesn't do much. paddings are really soft and small, they just get smashed with the weight for the fabric.<br /><br />the front lapel style is really heavy that the jacket's shoulders want to fall forward, you can see the shoulder lines wanting to hang forward because of the heavy weight in the front while the back gets shorter.<br /><br />the front is cute, but the back is a different story, it looks like a very baggy blouse from the back, very think and very wrinkly too. it is not cute from the back -- take my word for it. i wore this to a dinner and caught a glimpse of my back side from the bathroom mirror and i knew then i wouldn't wear this again.<br /><br />the zipper pockets are also fake, which drives me nuts!<br /><br />i am 5'2"", 36B, 160 lbs. i usually wear a medium but i ordered an XXL because i didn't want a tight cardigan. i would say i like how this fits me except for the back not looking cute at all because it looks really big and boxy from the back. also, the sleeves would be very short for you if you are a tall lady.<br /><br />it's cute but at the same time it's not.<br /><br />hope this helps you."
3.0,"It is ok, not complain."
3.0,There is no name or manufacturer information. Probably produced for pennies in a chinese sweatshop. You can get name brand items for this price
3.0,Pretty cute . I'm 5&#34;5 and 132 pounds and ordered a large hoping it'll be more lose which it is but it's super short . The holes look like a kid cut them but still cute .
3.0,it is missing the wire for around the nose to keep it snug
3.0,This hat is very cute but it is child's size. Disappointed because it was bought for an adult and it won't fit.
3.0,It’s a decent hat but it only has one wire at the end & it bends awkwardly & it’s really hard to shape. I get one side right & the other side pops out.
3.0,Uncomfortable on ears. Unremarkable size.
3.0,"The picture makes it look like this shirt is more fitted. It actually has a loose, casual, boxy fit.<br />I ordered it in red which was supposed to be a dark red... instead the shirt is a very bright red.<br />It runs big too. I usually wear a size SM and while this shirt works okay, if there was an XS I probably would have sent it back for that size instead.<br />The pros are that this shirt is actually very comfortable and still is cute for the price so I am going to keep it... just not what I was expecting. I took the top button off though because it looks much better with 5 instead of 6.<br />I would have given a higher rating if the picture was accurate of what I received."
3.0,"Cute enough, but one of the antlers pulled off with only a few hours of use."
3.0,The material is a big rough but overall not bad for the price. Good go lounge around in.
3.0,Had to return because skirt was way too long but it was beautiful!
3.0,Did not do the job I needed for the glaire on the side of my glasses - to heavy  and uncomfortable to wear
3.0,These are cute shorts but not chiffon as advertised.
3.0,"Necklace is awesome, earrings not so much. They Constantly flip and u have to readjust them"
3.0,"Item is not like the one pictured it's more of a golden color vs yellow, and much shorter in length and sleeves than the picture leads"
3.0,I'm 5.3 and this dress is right at my ankles. I DON'T NEED TO HEM THIS ONE!!😀😀😀😀😃
3.0,"They are nice, but too large for my wallet"
3.0,"This is very cute, and well made. However, it runs really big! I'm 5'6 137 lbs and wear a medium. The shorts were loose."
3.0,short waisted and the top is too small even though the bottom half fits good.
3.0,These fit EXTREMELY tight. I would suggest ordering two sizes above what you usually wear
3.0,The sock quality is nice.  But the design stretches out so much that the skunks are not recognizable as such.  A shame as I was really looking forward to them.
3.0,"Top is small, skirt is long and no tulle to make it fluffy."
3.0,This outfit will show all of you underwear so you have to wear with long John's in order for it to be appropriate to wear outside.
3.0,Took a long time to get this. I had gotten it for a gift. Person really liked it.
3.0,Material was thinner than expected but very comfortable fit
3.0,"The setting of the pearl in this ring arrived DIFFERENT than shown here. It sits up a bit higher than I’d like. Overall, I’m disappointed with this purchase."
3.0,Not much to say about this one.
3.0,Disappointed they were the correct width but too deep (long) on my face.  My daughter has a longer face she loves them.  Let me know if you have  a pair not as deep.
3.0,"The one i received is completely sheer... not the worst possible scenario, but it means I feel a greater need to wear shorts under it and not just the swimsuit... kind of a bummer."
3.0,These rings were really cheap but I could only wear them out twice before my fingers turned green
3.0,small.
3.0,Cute but they are a bit tight on me. I wear a size 8 and I've never purchased a size 9 in sandals.
3.0,"I think the picture has been altered to make the pattern stand out better than it does. The one I got isn't really recognizable as a fake ""stillsuit"" mask. I'm not angry or looking for a refund, I just wouldn't pay this price for this mask, again.<br />It's actually pretty good mask, with 2 layers of cloth. It's comfortable and very adjustable."
3.0,It’s was cute but the top fit weird and there was no support. Sent it back.
3.0,It's pretty but looks cheap.... I like the charm but not the necklace!
3.0,Cute top and nice light weight fabric and I love the colors for the south. Would have liked to have seen a little more cotton in the top but I understand that the polyester holds color better trough multiple wash ad dry and hopefully will not fade and will last longer. I think I was lying to myself when I ordered the L and probably would order an XL next time.😂 Would love to see the length a little longer and the sleeveless cut on the shoulders a little wider so you can wear just a bra. But I love swinging tunics so keep up.the good work. Thank you.
3.0,Sleeves are a bit long and shirt a bit short. But too cute to send back.
3.0,"Let's be honest here, I used these for a Luigi cosplay.<br />The gloves were pretty thin, but they looked good for the pictures and held up the entire weekend at the convention center.<br />I am happy with what I got for the price, and they got here at a reasonable speed.<br />I would not recommend these for any sort of outside work."
3.0,"Size was too big, I should've returned it. Otherwise, nice quality n fast shipping."
3.0,"they’re super pretty! but unfortunately they are poor quality, and don’t stay in place for long without constant adjustment."
3.0,Really liked the jacket but sleeves were very tight so layering of clothes wasn't an option. Ordered a larger size and it is to arrive soon and hopefully iwill work as the jacket design with a hood and zipper is exactly what I was looking for.
3.0,"Sigh... I purchased this in an attempt to replace a wonderful wool fisherman's cap that I finally lost after many years. It was the greatest rain hat ever for me. Unfortunately, even though this was the closest I could find, this just doesn't fill the bill for me. The crown is too small for what I was looking for and it's just &#34;too styled&#34; to do what I'd really prefer.<br />Having said that, this is a well constructed cap that, even though I think it fits a bit small, is probably only because I wanted one without an actual hat band and more of a crushing cap construction. It looks pretty good and is stylish, but just really isn't what I was looking for. I still miss my really wonderful cap that I lost, but it's not likely that I'll find a good replacement."
3.0,"way too small on the armpit.  the body of the dress is one size small, and  only the length was long enough."
3.0,I just got these in the mail for my son. I'm disappointed that I didn't notice in the description it said faux suede! They don't even look like suede! I'm keeping them because I like the grey and I can't find another pair for a reasonable price.
3.0,Kept feet dry<br />Way too small
3.0,"Pretty, but  A little too tight in the sleeves"
3.0,"Bottom does not flare out like the picture , also it’s more of. Juniors size"
3.0,I love this band!  However the reason for 3 stars is that it leaves a black oily residue on my wrist every day I wear it. It was easy to adjust and comfortable to wear.
3.0,"My daughter hasn’t use the bag yet so I can’t say much about quality yet, but zipper was a little funny when I first opened it.  Mostly this review is because the bag came with the name “Fenrici” on the empty black spot above the pocket on the front.  I had planned to have the spot monogrammed for my daughter. Instead I had to order an iron on label that could go on top of it and hope that works.  I would return the bag except that my daughter really likes the design."
3.0,"This is not a comfortable soft cotton. This shirt is not as soft or breathable as cotton. Also, the buttons at the neck... they do nothing for the shirt. Glad I only bought one before buying the other patterns I liked."
3.0,The only problem I have is that the tails are not long enough
3.0,"Great slipper, and super comfortable.  Supports as needed.  Keeps coming off, as rear of slipper at heel simply too short."
3.0,Nice small purse
3.0,Runs small. Size 4 is quite snug on boy who usually has room in a 4t. Material is thinner than expected.
3.0,It is a nice product and its price is a good choice
3.0,"Ordered this, and received a purple and black one. Not the same bottle as pictured"
3.0,To small and narrow.
3.0,"Cute shirt but made of pretty thin material. Not so thin its see through, tho. And it's almost too small for my daughter. I would have ordered a bigger size if I had known it would be that small."
3.0,The right size was shipped.<br />The pants fit perfectly but the shirt was a little too small for a 2X. The shirt actually fit too close. I was going to send it back but I was not going to get a replacement in a timely manner.
3.0,"The hat is nicely made, thin material and a bit snug.  According to Philadelphia hat maker standards it's crap.  Compared to retail it's better than what you might find at the mall from a size perspective.  The stitching is good.  By thin material, I mean it's great for the summer, but it's not something that covers the head for any other purpose than style, and for that it does the job.  Anyone with a larger head should probably not buy it if you really can't deal with a snug fit.  I need a hat with a little more depth and little larger brim and higher quality materials and I would be satisfied."
3.0,"I liked the product but had to keep adjusting around the nose and eyes.  Not really comfortable with wearing mask on my face, restricted my sight a little."
3.0,Didn't meet expectation
3.0,"Cute, but runs extremely small.  My daughter wears a 4t which is what I ordered.  It’s as fitted on her as her spandex dance leotard."
3.0,"Got this dress today and am slightly disappointed at how flimsy the material is.  Also, the tag is stitched  onto the back of the dress from inside, but you can see the stitch lines.  It detracts from the look of the dress."
3.0,They were beautiful. One Broke the first night of wearing it but overall the earrings did their job.
3.0,"The item arrived smelling of some one else’s personal products and with the tag cut out.<br />But that’s Amazon these days.  You have to assume you’re buying used items.<br />It appeared in good repair and fit fine.  I washed it before adding it to my wardrobe.  It’s on the short side, but not cropped.<br />I’m 5’6” tall, 150 pounds with a 36D bra size.  The large fit well."
3.0,"pretty cheap quality, the pictures made it seem like the image was imbedded in the glass,  its just a painted on image behind the glass."
3.0,"I am honestly really disappointed in this. I was so excited when I ordered it, but there are several issues. First off, it is definitely not sweat suit material, it is more polyester. Second, the top is cropped so It is a bit of an awkward length. Third, there is absolutely no stretch in the bottoms and I could barely get them on, and even with them on the pockets are wayyyy too stretched. The pattern is super cute though, so I am pretty bummed that the quality and size are such an issue. Luckily I have a friend who is much smaller and so she will be getting this."
3.0,"Too long for me, will need to get it hemmed or return it."
3.0,It is not look like the picture. Look cheap!
3.0,"Ok the suit is cute, fabric on top & bottom are good,  bottom has a built in lining. Fits small on the top & bottom. The SMALL cups are free floating no shelf so there is no support period. I purchased about 10 plus suits  this week with the hopes that I would have luck with at least three for an upcoming vacation. Unsure if I will exchange and up the size or return. So disappointed in not being able to find a cute suit with support. If you are looking for support so far the only one for me was made by Jome Design which has sewn in large cups for support. This suit I purchased was a large.<br />(My size is 8-10, tops s-m, 36C, all depends on the brand)"
3.0,Great top and perfect for summer. Was a little shorter than I expected and doesn’t really support the girls. Straps are okay for adjusting but aren’t the best.
3.0,"Fits good, came to me as tan, not brown, light tan."
3.0,Love the fit - but faded a little in the washer. :(
3.0,"Cute but sizing was off. Too small, I wear it as a pinky ring from time to time."
3.0,"Cotton is poor quality, scratchy, but my pops still likes it."
3.0,"I like the style. Love the cuts. BUT, You must must order a size up."
3.0,Good for the price/
3.0,kind of small<br />great color choices
3.0,Too heavy for my wrist
3.0,"Wasn't made too great, don't even wear it"
3.0,The wings are beautiful but the band around the neck is hideous. Once I replace it with should straps they’ll be perfect!
3.0,Thought it was actual size but it was smaller
3.0,I got a Small. It's a little tight I am a 34A/B and the band is a little tight but I still kept it I figure it will break in.
3.0,"good it is a good gift for your little sister, mother , grand mother or friend or your girlfriend  and it' very cheep :p"
3.0,"The durags are really comfortable, but the stitching is really weak, a cheaper WAV Enforver durag is more durable than this. Disappointed in the quality love the designs and comfort though."
3.0,Beautyyyyyyyy...!!!! Thanks Very much..!!!
3.0,They fit great. The knees are tighter than anticipated but tolerable. The one leg has a slight twist which is bothersome thus the lower rating.
3.0,"These are cute, and I love the super skinny lenses for working on crafts whilst watching tv. However, the stems just barely reach my ears, and they seem to be rather cheaply made. They do work for what I bought them for- I just don't think I'd wear them in public.  Sigh. Maybe I'll try the ones from the other seller and see if they are any better."
3.0,Good dress for the price. I am big in the chest and this was roomy enough for me. Would be really lose on others. Zipper was super hard to use at first. Blue color was great. Good for a wedding or semifinal event. Slightly cheaply made.
3.0,I understood differently how it is
3.0,"One of the sets of the earrings, the lavender colored dangle earrings, was missing one earring, rendering that ""pair"" useless. The overall quality of these earrings was not really worth the $15 paid.  The metal looked dull or of not good quality in most of them. The stones are just glued in. I guess you get what you pay for, $15 for 5 sets of earrings...."
3.0,"Too big, no inner tie"
3.0,I ordered 2 of these and was pleased enough to order 2 more in different colors. When the pink and purple arrived they were both noticeably different in size from my first ordered. ( no tags inside shirts at all) These two are much smaller! The other cons of these shirts are the thin material. Seems nice and cool for warmer temps but might be a bit see through. Especially the lighter colors. The necklaces are oh so cheap! Gave them to my grand daughter to play with...I hope these fit well due to the fact I really like the style!
3.0,"Did not expect this to b clingy.  Based on the review I think i ordered the appropriate size, but the fabric is thin and clingy so it showed all my bumps and lines.  Sent it back."
3.0,I don't use these they are not comfortable the underwires are to tight and they have stays in the sides I just don't care  for them for that. The stays make them even more uncomfortable. On the plus side they are really pretty and I love the look they are made well.
3.0,You get what you pay for. A bit see through.
3.0,"I gave this a 3 star because the one earing has the stone setting higher on the pearl than the other.  I know in your ears this won't be noticeable, but you can see the difference when you open the box and they are side by side.  They are so pretty otherwise, it's the exact size and style I was looking for."
3.0,"Really comfortable and cute, but the blue dye stained my toes and heels."
3.0,"These are very hard to get on.  My 5 year old loves them, but needs help putting them on.  Very tight trying to get them on over her head."
3.0,The material is great for indoor/outdoor use. If left in the sun for long periods it starts to shrink.
3.0,Didn't look like te pic and the band wasn't elastic.
3.0,Material is vaguely see through in some parts.
3.0,"While these glasses are well made, they just didn't work with my type of color blindness."
3.0,Too big a nd not adjustable
3.0,Nice top but a little too tight
3.0,No support for us older women who need it...but very pretty.
3.0,"Was expecting something a little bigger, but it's not bad overall. Gift box was scratched and dented to hell though.They used VERY sticky tape to hold the two box pieces together and it only made it rip even more of the already tattered box up. Almost looks used."
3.0,"This band is great quality and works just as well as the band that came with my Fitbit. The pink color is pretty, although a little duller than in the product photo. However, within a few days, my band was noticeably dirty. It seems to pick up color off my clothes. I feel like this is an unavoidable issue with light-color silicone bands, so I can’t really blame this brand. Perhaps light colors just aren’t wise for a silicone band I wear 24 hours a day."
3.0,"The leggings were too baggy even though I ordered the smallest size, I usually wear a medium."
3.0,"The are greatest sock for me, I wear them all time. easy to use ."
3.0,"Bought a small. I'm 5'2"", 145lbs, 34C, 31"" waist right above the belly button and 39"" hips. I prefer dresses to not be tight because I want to feel comfortable and was a bit worried that it would be too tight after reading reviews,  however the dress was too big.  Definitely was not expecting that.  CUTE and comfy dress for sure, just too big."
3.0,"Fit as expected...true to size. The brown patterned accents at the color and pocket add character and the ""folded over"" appearance of the sleeves is an attribute that doesn't go unnoticed. The collar has some structure to it, which is also a plus.  The problem I have with this shirt is that, despite the tag, this looks, feels, and behaves like a cotton blend shirt. It holds on to wrinkles and doesn't have a fluid drape at all, giving the wearer a sloppy appearance.  The latter goes away if the shirt is tucked in; but that should not be a restriction.  The ""washed red"" (aka ""pink"") is not as vibrant as I had hoped either. It is rather muted, and that may be in-part to the fabric content.  If it were more Polyester, it would probably have some sheen to it, and thus reflect light better....giving the illusion of a brighter shirt (think flat vs eggshell vs semi-gloss paint). I really wanted to love this shirt; but sadly, it fell short. Not necessarily because of the color, but because of the fabric content."
3.0,"fits as expected, fabric is cheap, but cute."
3.0,"I was so excited to try it out since when i got the iGloves it was snowing, so i open the box and come to find out alot of the stiching was fraying from the finger tips where you would use for the touch screen so that didnt impress me at all!! I cut the parts of they were fraying so it looks ok now but im still worried here soon enuff for how much i text it will fall apart then ill be buying a different brand if that is to happen!  I hope not though and i do hope they last like it says on the iGlove box its made to last!!!!  We will find out since Maine Winters are bad and we are in the start of them!!!  [It does work that is true, so that is why i gave it the rating i did cause the product working]<br />===================================================================================================================<br />EDIT:<br />---------------------------<br /><br />another thing i just noticed just now when i was showing my son is [and which this makes no sense to me]<br />i had him try on my gloves to use it with the iPod Touch 4G and it worked fine of course then i told him to get a pair of his gloves, so he got his Diego Gloves that were 3$ and come to my suprise is that his gloves worked fine with the iPod Touch, and this is all of the fingers not just 3 like with the iGloves!"
3.0,I really really really wanted this. It looked so amazing. But it was too small to fit the distance between my ear edge and piercing. Upper cartilage piercing.<br /><br />Would have been killer!
3.0,"Shirt doesn’t look like the pics online at all. In the pics it looked like a 100% cotton shirt that would wrinkle and fit like cotton. It’s not that I wanted wrinkles, lol, but this shirt isn’t like the one pictured and not as comfortable as the pic online looks either. I was hoping for a cotton comfy tank. It’s cute — just not what I expected."
3.0,This watch is super cute but the ticking is loud.
3.0,"The jacket looks nice but was a bit too tight for my nearly 7 years old boy. I would recommend for a bit skinny boy's. The material seemed to have more polyester in than described (20 o/o), if you don't mind that than its nice jacket."
3.0,"I read your size chart and by what I was reading I ordered my daughter a size 6. She’s about to start wearing 6s so I thought she could wear them in a few months. They actually fit her so perfect, I wouldn’t say they are true to the size. All shoes are made different but every other size 6 shoe I have that I put on her, is huge, and these fit her like they’re 5s. They light up and that’s really cool because we didn’t know that and my daughter is excited about it. But be aware they’re definitely cheaply made. The material is stiff and cheap feeling. It’s a cute shoe though for fun."
3.0,I liked the band and it worked well.  But after a few months a tiny screw came loose and was lost.  Can't find a replacement screw and can't use the band anymore.
3.0,They don't compress as much as I'd like or need. More of a sturdy sock but still comfy. They also came different from the picture. I ordered multi color and the ones I got were just one color.
3.0,I would give more stars but the bottom hemlines were not finished.... I bought a small. I am 5’3 and 115lbs. The fit is just right.
3.0,"Mostly comfortable. Definitely gives lift and cleavage where there was none. But a little tight. It does come with an extension, but then the band lays funny on my sides. Just wears a bit weird."
3.0,"The material is very stiff and tends to take hold of my facial hair at times.  Im not sure on the old army issue material, but its much better.  however, this is still a good product and does its job.  If you are going to be out in the cold for awhile, put this on BEFORE your shirt or jacket as it fits a lot better."
3.0,"I like the style of the dress but it large than usual, so one should go for one or two size lower than usual."
3.0,"Bought these to take to Vegas, as I wanted some cheaper sunglasses to take incase they got lost/damaged. Here you get what you pay for. All but one pair came in tact - one of the nose pieces was missing when it arrived. The blue and gold ones are very cute however. Sad they all didn't come in tact."
3.0,"Son lindas, pero la tela no es la mejor, se estira un poco el cuello y se arruga fácilmente."
3.0,I bought these for backups for my daughter’s dance classes. They are not lined at all so heads up about that. I wished I had looked through the reviews more thoroughly and noticed that.
3.0,A few of them came already broken and not fixable in the packages. Love them otherwise.
3.0,These charms would have gotten 5 stars from me but they came all together and not wrapped. They should have been wrapped individually and with some type of cushion. Stones had come out of the charms due to them not being wrapped properly. I had to sit here and glue these tiny stones back in. There were like 5 of them that the stones were out. Luckily the stones were still in the bag to clue back in. These charms were nice but trying to do all that gluing and fitting the stones in properly was aggravating.
3.0,I usually wear medium but I ordered large based on the reviews and it still fits weird in the chest area
3.0,"It is cute, but it looks inexpensive. Th leather/material is not soft to touch,. I have paid similar price to other purses & they look and feel very fancy."
3.0,Button was off the 2nd time I wore it...
3.0,"The jewel isn't even red more of an orange-ish hue. I was disappointed, Because I had bought the cheap earrings that I thought had matched."
3.0,"Very, very thin...smh."
3.0,"I’m 5’1 110lb, 32 D. I ordered the x-small. It fits as expected, the material is very thin, cheap thin, easily wrinkled, and the wrap part of the dress around the breast keeps falling down allowing for some wardrobe malfunctions."
3.0,"Overall, nice glasses with the readers on bottom. These tend to lift off / bounce on my nose bridge. Just does not fit my face. Need to try another type or return unused pair."
3.0,Very cheaply made but for the price ok.
3.0,not great quality.  OK for a cheap suspender.
3.0,Bought for a bday gift I may need to return for a new one
3.0,The stretchy bra part fits nice but the cup pads inside are a super weird shape.
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, truly, I did. But the color was blah and even after 3 times being streamed, the wrinkled fabric refused to smooth out. It has several snags in the shiny satin like fabric as well straight out of the package so we didn’t want to get more aggressive with steaming and further damage the fabric. The fit was also rather wonky, even with the lace up back sitting in cinching the baggier areas. The bust has odd boning making it look like cone breasts. We took it out and tried to shoot in it for a few minutes, hoping that from a distance, the wrinkles and flaws wouldn’t be as noticeable but no amount of distance or photoshop afterward could make it look close to camera ready, let alone presentable in person.<br />It does have beautiful lines, so maybe a darker color, having it dry cleaned and double steamed might be the key? Unfortunately for us, it was not going to work for my daughter’s spring formal so we had to return it. Really a bummer because the full skirt, low back, leg slit and train were beautiful in theory."
3.0,"Cute bands, a little smaller than we would have liked. Held up well for Halloween trick or treating."
3.0,"I wanted to wear these shorts under my dance dresses and chose these ones because of specific colours I've needed.<br />But they are not comfortable, too thick and tight. I don't know how they are supposed to be put on alone for workouts as they look ugly. But I still use green ones (bc it's difficult to find this colour) so 3 stars instead of 1."
3.0,I got this for my boyfriend and when we used it for the 1st time the leash broke! The collar itself is good but the leash is very cheaply made and brakes easily. I wasnt even pulling on it that hard when it broke
3.0,Pretty sure the fit is for a child. Which still wouldn’t make sense because I can fit into XL girls clothes. The fabric and pattern is nice though.
3.0,It has such tiny writing it's unreadable..returned it
3.0,I like the style of the shoe but the size was too small.
3.0,"Gotten as a gift for my mom, first box didn’t fit at all. I exchanged for another box because the reviews all said they have no problems. The second box worked but still seems tricky to get in."
3.0,It’s cute but not as nice that’s shown in the photos. In person it doesn’t look as good quality.<br />It’s still cute to have.
3.0,The shirt was fine but the pants were 4 inches short and uncomfortable for my daughter
3.0,"Tight fit, but ok."
3.0,"It's not a bad shirt, just not as comfortable as I wanted and is slightly see through."
3.0,The lettering was printed poorly and was faded... but I love the message.
3.0,"Some of the bracelets had sharp edges, came broken. I only ended up bringing a little over half to my vacation all faded with a day of all day wear. So a quick use this is good definitely but not for everyday."
3.0,She likes them. Tight around the calf’s which is the only con so far.
3.0,It’s alright
3.0,"I ordered my true size, small, but it was too small for me. So I ordered a medium, which had a white inner lining in the front while the small size didn't. The small was see through and you need a bra while with the medium you don't. I did not appreciate the inconsistency in make."
3.0,Fits small. Order at least a size larger.
3.0,No cooment
3.0,Great item but smaller than expected.
3.0,"Per reviews I was expecting it to be very loose. It still looks and feels okay, just not what I thought it would be."
3.0,Minimal compression socks...would not re-order as they do not have enough support for me.
3.0,I'm giving this one 3 stars because the color is way off from the picture. The picture shows the bag to be dark in color but the one I received is light gray and the camo is lite in color. I don not know if it's a sturdy bag or not due to returning it as soon as I looked at the color. It's really a shame because the bag was the exact size I was looking for.
3.0,The hat was great!! Just need bigger size options
3.0,Wasn't what I really expected and it runs too big
3.0,good quality runs small
3.0,Love the color but it look biger in the pic and its not ...
3.0,"In general the lenses are fine, I have only noticed that when there is no sun and I am driving the brake lights of the vehicles are reflected as double, something very rare that had never experienced with the original lenses. When there is sun there is no problem. Overall I give them four stars."
3.0,"It feels like but it's super long. It's just not fitting or flattering at all. It's fine as a pajama shirt, but not for everyday use."
3.0,"This dress comes up too high on the chest area, it does not look like it does on the model. It fit well otherwise just too high on the chest."
3.0,"The bag itself is absolutely wonderful. I love the navy blue color, the size, and the lightweight feel of the bag. It fits all of the items like my phone, wallet, glasses, etc. that I need for everyday use. It has lots of pockets, which I love, and I put my chapstick, phone charger, and earbuds in. The only problem I have with this bag is the zippers. The bag was shipped in such a folded and rolled up way that 2 of the main zippers don't work at all!!! As soon as I got it, it was clear that the zipper at the top and on the side pocket we're not going to close. I was incredibly disappointed about this because I really do love everything about the bag!! But after using it for only a little while, I realized that the zippers were a bigger issue than I thought."
3.0,"These are super cute and I love them, but the quality isn't great.  After one wash the waistband started to come undone.  Luckily I have a sewing machine and could fix this, but it's not perfect.  Great with a tunic or dress to cover, but not suitable to be worn with just a shirt that goes to the waist.  The material is thin, these are not warm  It's almost like the material for tights but not so confining.  They do not droop in the crotch and the waistband easily goes over my belly and doesn't roll down so they are very comfortable to wear."
3.0,"The whole reason I bought this hat is because my old one was getting worn out. It was a $7 version of this same hat, that I got from a Dollar General. This new hat's material is much thinner, the Velcro is much lower quality, and the fit is quite different. The product numbers are identical, meaning it's the same product. The quality has gone down, while the price has gone up.<br /><br />If questioning whether to buy this hat or not, I'd go with not. A trip down to any dollar store will almost certainly yield you better results."
3.0,Not as long as picture depicts. Runs small.
3.0,It was decent for the price.
3.0,"The short was similar to others I have bought in same style and design, but the material was opaque. Was t expecting that. Didn't like the material compared to the cotton"
3.0,Loved the color and design but it looked really baggy on me.  Decided it ran large.
3.0,Wore it once and didn’t feel the relief or effects of this sock. Felt itchy as well. Could be I’m just allergic to the material.
3.0,"Like the design and pattern, nice fit"
3.0,One time wear
3.0,"The necklace itself is very pretty but when my friend got it, she said it was broken. Overall, gorgeous"
3.0,My daughter loves the shoes but has only worn them a handful of times and the Velcro already ripped off. Sending them back for a replacement.
3.0,Nice outfit but way too big!
3.0,don't like that the clamp in behind the ankle hard to put on
3.0,Cheap metal quality compared to price.
3.0,Very cute. Thin material. Arms are tighter than I'd like.
3.0,It’s very thin which makes it perfect for summer but it’s see through so it’s really only good for a swimsuit cover up.  Beautiful color though.
3.0,Fits big and has extra panels on the side making it look like a maternity shirt.
3.0,"The first one I got was a nice purple color but not right size, reordered and received but color was not same purple color, a little disappointed 😔"
3.0,They were way smaller than I imagined.  They are very thin as well.
3.0,"These boots have held up over the months that I've had them. They're actually very comfortable to wear - I often use them as walking shoes for trips into the city. The only downside, and the reason I give them three stars, is because these books look very cheap. I have bought cheap products before that look nice, but these boots just don't look very nice. Because of this, I usually don't wear these boots for dressier outfits, even though I'd like to have a nice black boot."
3.0,The design is good and they fit well but they keep super hot.  Will look for cotton next time.
3.0,Daughter where's a 9/10 and I ordered a large 12/14 could get dress on but to snug and to short so had to reorder a xl and it fits. Only other complaint is top needs a lot thicker material on the inside for the liner so that it isn't see through.
3.0,"The pants are short enough that you need the fake boot tops to cover I between your shoes and the pants.  The covers are so small they would not fit over my calf’s.  I have never been accused of having large calf’s.  The wig was nice, the beard was rough and scratches your face, so would not recommend for a long wear time.  The hat was thin, small and cheaply made."
3.0,"This sweatshirt is vivid and fun, but is not lined, making it thin as far as sweatshirts go.  It works for a light extra layer, but definitely not for much extra warmth.<br /><br />I ordered up a size for extended use.  The cuffs allow the sleeves to fit without falling over my daughter's hands and this will likely enable her to get 2 years out of it."
3.0,"I thought I’d found the exact color I needed to replace a broken lace, but these arrived darker than they appeared in pictures. Good lace, overall."
3.0,"The Bebe on the cami written at the waist peeled right off during the first wash of all four! Otherwise, it is cute & served the purpose."
3.0,Falls off easily nose piece was too loose
3.0,Cute dress. Arm holes a little tight.<br />A little short and I’m 5’2.
3.0,The product was new when it arrived and after 3 hunting trips it came home in pieces. The price was good but the quality was not!
3.0,I'm normally a medium and I got a small and the dress was still rather large and looked bulky. The slip on the other hand was very small and only cover half of my rear end. I'm going to wear a second slip underneath and make due for the evening.
3.0,"My daughter tried it on, as we were looking for casual play dresses. She looked like she needed to go brush her teeth and crawl in bed."
3.0,The length was as expected and it seems warm enough but the material is cheap..with one use the thread keep coming up..not that satisfied
3.0,"These are OK. The fit is pretty good, but I did have to pull them up every now and then even though the product did fit. I ordered a size medium and that is my typical/suggested size. If I go for a large it would be too loose and if I go get a small it would be too snug. My biggest complaint about these biker shorts is that the quality was only OK and while they are cute, long-lasting in re to appearance they were not. I ordered these in mid-August (so a little under two months ago) and the inner thigh fabric area has become more linty, less soft, and honestly less appealing to the eye. I did get a darker color so no one else can fully notice it (unless they get super close, which lol - please keep your social distance or more away from my thighs, haha) BUT even when you're folding clothes or what have you, it's not pleasing to touch that part of the fabric either.<br /><br />While these are affordable, I don't think I would repurchase and would seek other biker shorts alternatives with fabric that doesn't get that unpleasant feeling after less than two months of wear and tear.<br /><br />I also just want to add that I didn't always just work out in these. At the risk of dragging myself, these were mostly for lounging and walking around my house. So I don't understand how the fabric degenerated that fast. Lol."
3.0,"Is not real leather like they claim, came fast it’s ok but will not last long"
3.0,So fit and style was great! But... I had 3 people try to pull a string off my shirt.. but surprise it was screened onto the print. Right in the front! A permanent string for free with this dress. So I was bummed!
3.0,They do not fit quite as good as the last ones I bought
3.0,I love the googles and they work and fit excellent but the nose pice is sh!t. You can not adgust it and slides right off your nose. I can not get it to stay on<br /><br />But I love the googles they are great<br /><br />I wish it was cheaper since the nose plug is not worth it
3.0,Fit as expected. The arms are a little long so if I had kept I would have had to fold over. I returned because it’s very see through and it’s too hot to wear layers of spanks to cover it up.
3.0,It’s ok runs big
3.0,"The image wasn’t clear, it was pixelated. But it was a fun shirt for a 90’s party. I just wish it was better quality."
3.0,I gave u a 3 star because it's damaged... But it's an extremely beautiful shoe
3.0,"Beanie is on the thinner side, and not very stretchy. I would not buy this one again."
3.0,"Unfortunately, I had to return this shirt because it was WAY too big.  I used the sizing chart and ordered a shirt size consistent with all my other shirts, but the large fit more like an extra large.  That said, the shirt appeared to be good quality and looked really cool, so hopefully they'll get mediums in soon so I can order another one someday.  The return is in process, but one important thing to note is they will charge you for the return shipping (deducted from your refund when you return it) which is a bit discouraging since I ordered the shirt in good faith based on the sizing chart included.  So overall, I gave it an average 3 stars with 5 stars for the shirt, but 1 star for sizing/return policy."
3.0,"You get what you pay for, for $100 it does the job but with cheap material, I suggest going for the one that's $300 but that's up to you."
3.0,"Like wearing a tent, which can is fine if you're into that sort of thing"
3.0,"I really like these but several have already broken and fallen off. If not for that, these would be one of my favs!"
3.0,"Like the size and style, but hard to tell time with the dark face"
3.0,"Too tight and I gave thin arms, otherwise they are nice."
3.0,"These are cute slippers, but mine are so wide at the opening that I only can shuffle along, I can’t really walk in them, and I would never ever walk up or downstairs in them. They would fly right off. I’ve noticed I can wear them a bit better if I have a thick sock on. I’m a size 9 and I see that their women’s 9 is a European size 40-41, FYI.<br />Anyway, they are warm and cute but I can’t really use them unless I am sitting still !"
3.0,"I love this choker and got many compliments when wearing it. Unfortunately, it came apart very quickly. I think someone who knew how could fix it, but I don't."
3.0,This dress is cute if you haven't had any kids. The light pink was so revealing of every inch of my body I didn't feel comfortable. I am short but this dress was too short for me. I returned the dress.
3.0,Nice size for storage bag
3.0,Ripped after a few uses.
3.0,Very nice and light for summer/spring evenings.
3.0,The first  time  I washed  it there was a hole in it.
3.0,"The band is heavy and you will notice the weight when movements of your wrist make the watch shift around a little.  There could and SHOULD be a guide estimating the number of links you should remove for your measured wrist size.  My wrist is about 170 mm and I removed 5 links for an approximate fit that is not too tight. The pin removal tool is terrible. When you lay the band in the tool, the pin in the link doesn’t align with the tool you twist to push it out.  AND when you remove a pin, it sometimes has to be forced out and you bend it so that it can’t  be reused.  AND, when you replace a pin after removing a link, it will NOT<br />go back in the direction the instructions indicate; there is a slightly wider part of each pin and it must go back in with that part LAST, not first.  Otherwise you WILL bend the pin because you can’t use the tool until it is almost fully in, and if you try to put it back in wider part first it resists and trying to force it will bend it. So, adjusting links is trial and error, and made more difficult by a poorly designed tool and directions that don’t work well."
3.0,"Short in length and tight around hips. Ordered a size larger than needed, and still small and short"
3.0,"The bathing suit is really great quality, but it did not fit. The bra was too small for my 36D sized breast, but the panties fit perfectly. I wear a size 12-14 in pants. I usually wear under wear that are a L-XL."
3.0,"Nothing great about these socks...They are thin. Well, they are cheap..You get what you pay for..."
3.0,Great customer service!! I had issues with my hat after receiving it and requested a refund. Within a few hours they had reached out to me to offer a replacement.
3.0,"Fit a 3-5 year old.  Our 18 mo old is quite small for them.  Not as thick as I expected.  Nice quality product overall, but I'll shop at brick-and-mortar for our next.p mitten purchase."
3.0,"works but would like to have an on off switch, or better yet an automatic off!"
3.0,Had to make alterations in order to fit certain areas
3.0,"The dress was beautiful but too short, I am 5’7 and ordered a medium so it fit great on the top but it was above my ankles and I want it to be long enough. I didn’t dare ordering a large because then that might be too big for my on the top part so I gave up :("
3.0,Cute but too short. I'm only 4'11 and there was no way I would consider this a dress!
3.0,"They're too small, so Ill give them to my daughter.  But They are thin & cool for summer !!!"
3.0,"At 3' the included USB cable is too short for any practical use,the surface area is rather small for a gaming pad and the USB connection area wastes more pad room.The LED looks nice in a dark room.The glass Cyber Snipa is the best pad I've used so far but is discontinued."
3.0,"Top is cute although a bit thin. BUT it runs super big. My daughter wears a size 6 in shirts and going by reviews, I sized down. The top is still very big around the chest. If she moves around the top falls down in the front and shows her nipples. She doesn't like that and I sure don't like it either."
3.0,They were pretty but too big for what I was looking for.
3.0,I wish the size chart would have been better. The mediums are really small.
3.0,I was really excited to receive my first cuff earring only to have it fall off my ear 5 days after I got it. Sigh. What is life.
3.0,I like the Keychain but it's SUPER small. I was expecting something more for $8.99.
3.0,"This shirt is very pretty, firs nicely, kind of billowing but sometimes I really want that look or want to hide certain parts lol but it feels like the neckline is up a bit high and the top slightly pulls in weird subtle weird way. I felt I was constantly needing to pull it down and adjust it. I like the shirt, i have two of these and will wear them both again. They are wonderful for those days you really want to look classy and professional."
3.0,"These did not fit even a little. I literally couldn't get them past mid thigh. ( and I followed the<br />Size chart)  They were cheaply made, there was a piece of waist that was sewn to the opposite side..it was all bad."
3.0,This was so big on my daughter it went up to her chest even when ordering the correct size.
3.0,I love the sleeve color which is why I ordered. The top was large I'm a 36 d but the tummy section was tight (I'm 180).
3.0,Couldn’t give 5 starts bc maaaan does the little pointy parts scratch and stab! Sheesh. My arm look like it was in a box with a cat after a day of wearing on my bracelet 😂 it was tore up. Very very cute but maybe i have to buff the corners with a nail file or something.
3.0,I usually don't order clothes online but I love these dresses I have bought several now in different colors and they fit great.. They are very comfortable they are form fitting but not tight
3.0,"Love these cufflinks. Beautiful and useful. However, after about 4 weeks of daily wear, one of my inlays fell out."
3.0,Used for my brother's bike. It's not waterproof but that's the only issue. Good otherwise.
3.0,Was so excited when these jeans came. I had read the reviews and asked about whether they would fit. I'm small and was assured the size small would fit just right. It didn't. Was much too large and about 10 inches too long. So sadly I had to return them. I think it's the first time I've needed to return a purchase from Amazon.
3.0,It so big like men's watches
3.0,"He loved the color but wished I fit true to si,e"
3.0,"They are really pretty, and seemed to be made of quality materials. However, the shoes were HEAVY, giving them a bulky feel when you walk. Tough to keep them on my feet. Had to return"
3.0,"TOO WRINKLED CANNOT REMOVE, im gonna try cleaners"
3.0,"Love the style.  A little small, but I can still wear it."
3.0,This shirt has holder pads and feels rough
3.0,"Fit was good, fabric was nice, but the stripes are not straight. I look crooked when I wear it because they are at a bit of a slant. 😜"
3.0,Looks just like I thought it would.
3.0,"Super cute. I'm 5'2, 138 lbs. Pants are tight, but will do. Top fit great! I was disappointed to see that the tutu had a 1 inch hole. I will not return because my mom can fix it. Fits like a women's size 2-4."
3.0,looks pretty cheap but it was pretty cheap so you get what you paid for.
3.0,"This bag is awesome. Kinda looks like Burberry. Has a lot of room and great for travel. The problem is the smell. Smells like rotten fish! Even tried to wash it, but the smell never went away."
3.0,The weight of the fabric
3.0,"Retro, lot of compliments.  Downside is it looks like a baby hat on a man."
3.0,The bottom part of the shirts roundness was a lot smaller than the top of.the shirt but was am ok buy
3.0,"I'm sad to say that they didn't give me what I ordered. I selected the &#34;white&#34; socks from the dropdown menu and saw completely solid white socks. I received socks with colorful stethoscopes, syringes, and scissors on them. Unfortunately, my uniform doesn't allow patterned socks, so this was a loss considering returns aren't accepted! I'm disappointed that the product name was misleading and that I can't actually use these socks for my job.<br />Since I can't return them, I guess I'll just wear them for fun or something. I wear a size 6 in shoes and the socks fit fine for my small feet. The length is a little long though. I'm 5'1&#34; the socks stop halfway up my knee so they kind of bunch up behind my knees. I'll give them 3 stars because I suppose they do what they're supposed to and they fit okay, but I just wanted plain white socks..."
3.0,"Fit about 2 sizes to large- I almost always wear a medium, so that is what I ordered. I would say their medium is more like an XL.<br />Company sent me a small, but still quite large. Comfortable material though."
3.0,"I expected the compression to be somewhat tighter. The sizing is ok, just not very much of a compression."
3.0,I thought the bracelets and the card would be assembled together but they aren't
3.0,Seems to be small for a medium.
3.0,Decently made shirt. Neck seems extra big.
3.0,A little larger than expected. Very pretty.
3.0,"I LOVED IT, BUT MY WIFE SAYS NOT SO MUCH.  GOOD SHIPPING AND PACKAGING."
3.0,"Nice dress, love the color however.....the fabric is too thin and shows allll of my flaws"
3.0,Didn't live up to expectations. More stretch and material thin.
3.0,It looked and set strange.
3.0,"the image they use to sell the product takes up the whole shirt, but when i got the shirt you can see that the image is way smaller on the shirt. this is a size small. it’s for my 4 year old daughter preschool ugly sweater day, i would return it because i’m pretty disappointed but i don’t think i’ll find a replacement in time ☹️ i do have to say their customer service response is great tho because the package was misplaced by my mailman and they replied back immediately with the tracking information and suggested i check with my neighbor which i did.. i’m just bummed about the size of this picture being so small compared to the actual shirt being shown"
3.0,The description says cotton blend. There is no way there’s cotton in these. Maybe a polyester spandex blend. I bought them to dye and they are useless to me. Asked for a refund and they said they would only refund 15%. Not happy. They’re fine if you don’t intend to dye them. That’s the only reason I’m giving it 3 stars.
3.0,"The paint the glasses use isn't the highest quality, but the lenses are great."
3.0,They were to big for my 3 year old granddaughter so we couldn't try them . Hopefully  she'll be able to wear them next winter
3.0,The material is very thin and I think the sizes run small.  My grand daughter was excited about it and loves it.  So I kept it because she was so excited about it.  The price is to expensive for what you get.
3.0,I got this for a wear every so often ring. I liked it at the start. After a few uses it became a darker cold faded color. Discolored my finger. Its too bad as I like the simple style of it. I got the rose gold and silver and same on both.  The picture with the 2 is when I first got them. The single one is after 2 wears. Looks more discolored in person.
3.0,A size smaller than expected
3.0,"This dress is so cute but WOW they run small. I am 5'8'' and almost always get mediums. I ordered a large and it was still too small. I've returned it, but it's so cute I might try the XL."
3.0,"The sweat shirt is fine, except that it is not new. You can tell by the missing tags and the ones they attached probably after it had been returned. I am keeping the sweatshirt as it fits and it seems to be in good shape. However this feels like a slight of hand trick. ""Don't look too carefully this is not new."" If you are selling items that are not new a slight reduction in price seems fair."
3.0,"It was really pretty. But very cheaply made, the sleeves ripped 2 hours into her party. It wasn't even tight it was big."
3.0,I evidently ordered the sm size instead of the lg. So they will not fit. I'm not taking the trouble of sending them back.
3.0,Too large but easily fixable with sewing machine. Otherwise it's a cool skirt. The color is not as bright yellow as I thought it would be
3.0,Lil Diamonds slowly fell out
3.0,"It's okay, not impressive"
3.0,I normally wear a 9 1/2 wide they were huge. Way too long and way too wide. Not sure if I’ll reorder. I returned them right away.
3.0,"Red boots were to bright, more like a hot, pink red.  Not a dark red as pictured"
3.0,"My daughter LOVES this suit. But it is wide and short, pilled immediately and faded pretty quickly."
3.0,I like the product but only received 9 out 10 promised.
3.0,it’s too small:(
3.0,Pretty good for the price but the finish of the beads run off though
3.0,"I like the color, but not crazy about fabric, more clingy than I wanted."
3.0,Too small. Not sized right
3.0,a little tight across bust
3.0,"Comfy material, however in person this scarf is not  nearly as thick as pictured. It also is difficult to lay correctly because of the thinness of the material."
3.0,"I like the quality of the skills, but the lights don’t work and the battery case is glued shut so you can’t replace the battery."
3.0,A bit too big for my size 7 feet.  Very soft and warm.
3.0,"The only thing I would add is to wear socks under the wallet. It does take a bit to get used to it on, but it is invisible under pants."
3.0,"For a while using this watch, I have noticed that it has begun to smell metal on the strap, it is a cheap watch. only for casual use"
3.0,The dress is cute but I sized up 2 sizes and still quite small. Its nice just wish it were truer to size.
3.0,"cheap fabric like a heavy weight tee shirt, clings and NOT in a good way. I am 5'5 and 130 lbs 34 C cup I visit the gym everyday  I know it is form fitting but this is not fitting properly pilled up even when I hand washed. just spend the extra $ and get a nice dress."
3.0,"this suit is great. it's great quality, has removable padding, and i love the way it fits. the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because when it arrived, the cups were wrinkled."
3.0,Colors not pink more salmon but I still like it
3.0,"This is a pretty piece, looks vintage and all BUT it isn’t put together very well. Missing stones on the ear and the largest stone is misaligned and it’s all noticeable. It’s kind of heavy and pulls on the chain that comes with it. I got it as a gift for my mother but couldn’t give it to her. It looks poorly made and unfortunately it’s not gift worthy. It also took a very long time to arrive from overseas. Not sure if it’s worth the trouble sending it back for $3.97, although a refund  would be appreciated."
3.0,"I don't know if my face is too small or what but this glasses are too big and is not flattering at all, I don't think I will wear them, I would return them but I don't live in the US and it's too complicated for me."
3.0,Lightweight but I feel would fit better on men it's way to big for my face.  Bought it for environmental purposes to reduce my plastic use and this is why you should still buy theee glasses.
3.0,Cute. Soft leather but small almost more childlike...but still cute enough for a concert type event
3.0,"Fantastic earrings, lightweight. the back / stem that goes through your ear is of very pool quality and bends, will probably break off."
3.0,Even though it was to small it was still a great item!
3.0,Cute purse but that was a couple black spots on it and the Zipper was broke I thought this was supposed to be new got a refund
3.0,"So this dress doesn't hug your shape as well as it does in the photos. As someone who is 5 foot, the dress was a lot longer then I expected it to be, but that's just me being short. The lace is very delicate, so I would handle this dress with care. It also has no support, meaning the dress is very fabricy. I would suggest wearing spandex and a tanktop under it, as it's a little see through if you wear the wrong colors"
3.0,ITS alittle big. It'll be nicer if come with smaller.
3.0,"Looks good, but disappointed in fit."
3.0,47 out of 50. Close enough. Please count them next time.
3.0,Not what I would consider leather for the band
3.0,The model must be extremely tiny.  The coverup on me did not come down that far.  It was more of a large shirt.  So if you have large breasts and broad shoulders it will not fit as pictured.
3.0,the necklace does not look as good in person. the pendant looks good.
3.0,This dress is adorable but I'm having a hard time justifying the price tag. Not worth $26 especially with all the loose threads! Sizing seemed spot on.
3.0,Would have kept if not so wide
3.0,The charms are cute enough but the chain is extremely cheap looking.  I bought this for my 5 yr old grand daughter for her K-4 graduation and so I was a little disappointed with the quality.
3.0,"Fabric is great, color is perfect, just runs a size too small. Order one size up from the sizing chart."
3.0,"came in in black, instead of the white I had ordered. luckily, i still like the look."
3.0,"One of the shoes felt like someone else with really wide feet had already stretched it out. Their ok, but probably won't buy again. Too bad, because Bear Traps are a great brand. Probably not so much to do with the brand as it was who I got them from. If these were returned from someone before, maybe they should check them out a little better before they resale them. And I'm not saying that's what happened."
3.0,"I bought this band and requested black with rose gold.  The band is beautiful, but once again I was shipped gold - not rosegold.  Even the package said Rose Gold.  When I look at the picture of what I purchased it shows the rose gold, but what I received was gold.  I put it on a friends gold apple watch and it looked great."
3.0,These are made small. They are good design and very pretty. Seem to be made very well and sewn very well. The distress is just right and would look great with anything. Just made small.
3.0,I have say this is beautiful band . I tried it on my watch . I fix was a little big. the closer kept coming open  when my wrist would brush across my pocket of my coat.
3.0,Very disappointing. The ' Long Leg ' as shown is not what you get with these underwear. Needing a mid-thigh fit I was very taken back when putting these on. Don't waste your money on these...
3.0,"The quality seems decent, but I couldn’t get a good sense of whether or not these would fit well from the description. They are too short for me and continued to pull down as I wore them."
3.0,What you expect. Nothing better nothing worse.
3.0,The bottom half of the shirt is very boxy fitting.
3.0,These shoes were for my daughter. Initally they were very comfortable and she enjoyed them. They seems to tear up pretty easily with normal wear and tear from a child.
3.0,I ordered the blue lens with gunmetal grey. Look more like a dark blue with black frames. I Like um just not what i thought when i ordered
3.0,Very loose & not supportive.<br />But comfy & soft.
3.0,Not bad design at all. But not for a too large body.
3.0,I like the length and the pockets but they fit a bit snug.
3.0,Not what you would expect?
3.0,"The color and pattern is really cute and just like the picture, just make sure you go at least one size up because the sleeve cuffs are tight and the bust and neck are tight."
3.0,Cute but not very durable. Looks a little cheap.
3.0,"I wore this as a necklace, it broke after about a month., not even sure why, it wasn't snagged on anything.  The clasp is really nice. I think the leather may be too soft."
3.0,I got pretty much what I paid for.
3.0,"I understand it's gold plated, but I wish the plating lasted longer for future wear. The plating wore off after the very first wear, but only on the anklet with the initial on it. Other than that, it was quite stylish and complimented my outfit very well."
3.0,se sube para arriba nolo puedo usar
3.0,these work fine and are a really good price
3.0,"This purse is only Okay.  It looks and feels cheap, which makes sense for the price I paid.  I'm going to return it."
3.0,Very sturdy and seems to be well made. Advertised as “stainless steel 316G” but neither stainless steel or 316G imprinted on clasp. No negative skin reaction so far so good. The 316G is very important because of skin allergies and is usually imprinted but not here.
3.0,"Slightly deceptive description and overpriced, but we made it work for our purpose.  9 year old daughter needed old lady glasses for a play.  I searched children's costume glasses and this came up, but the packaging states 14+, so it's kind of misleading that this is one of the results when searching for children's glasses.  For my 9 year old, these are too big.  They slip down on her nose a little, but it will work for the play she's in.  Also, I think the picture on the website used to be different.  The frames previously looked silver when I ordered them, but the current picture shows their true color -- brass.  I was surprised when they came in a &#34;Santa eyeglasses&#34; package.  Again, the glasses are okay for a costume, but I thought the ad was a little misleading in terms of frame color and suggested age range."
3.0,Too large. Was hoping they were smaller.
3.0,"The boots are exactly as they look on the web site, perfect for my daughter's Halloween costume. However, they run small, so I would order at least a half size bigger if you'd like them to last for a bit."
3.0,"After the first wash, the bottom part of the dress  was noticeably lighter than the top. Im also not a fan of the straps in he front so i just wore the dress backwards.  The bottom half of the dress was made with 3 different pieces of fabric so the lines are noticeable but i dont think thats a big deal.  The pockets do stick out a bit but maybe after another wash they'll soften a bit more. My husband loves it! Very comfortable as well."
3.0,I received theses shoes very quickly. I'm happy about that. I do have to say I'm disappointed that it didn't come with the charging cable like it said it would in the description.
3.0,Hard to fasten and then later it falls off - it’s happened every time I have worn it
3.0,These are nice but they ripped at the calf on the seam after about 3 washes. I never dried them.
3.0,"Very clingy. It fits, but it's more like an undershirt than a dress or tunic, so going any larger wouldn't solve the problem. It barely goes past my crotch. It is too form fitting to say it has any &#34;drape&#34;. I've only worn it as a sort of tank top under vests and flannel shirts."
3.0,"Good quality material, a bit too small for my liking but seems to be good quality."
3.0,This bra was sized way too small.  I have another bra made by this company that fastens in the back.  It fits fine.  I could barely fasten this one.  It was just a bad fit overall.  Sent back.
3.0,"This runs quite small. Also, while I understand this is lingerie, it's pretty cheap looking. The picture looks much better than the real item. Sure, the price is inexpensive but I expected just a bit better quality look. Trying to be realistic, as you can't expect champagne on beer money."
3.0,Very cute but runs too large! I ordered 0-3 months and my 3 month old is swimming in them! Fits more like a 6 month. They are worth holding onto tll
3.0,The look I love. The backs are hard to put on. Make sure you have them on tight. I lost one the first time I wore it.
3.0,"I just got  this dress today and I am not pleased.because it  isn't my size. I ordered extra small I don't think I got the right size, there is no label on the item and it's too big for me. I am planning  to return it. I like the way it looks though."
3.0,"very thin fabric, expected better quality"
3.0,Zipper doesn't open smoothly.
3.0,Very lovely dress...light fabric. WAY more pink than purple but I still like it!
3.0,"The hat is very nice and of nice quality, but it fits a little tight. It may need to be stretched out or if you wear a medium, go a size up."
3.0,"I was looking for a lightweight, low profile hat like the picture. It is a very nice hat but sits up a lot and is thick.<br />I will keep it as it is very nice I figured I'd show what you are actually getting"
3.0,"This was very cute and fit my child well, but we decided to return it because she said the material was itchy"
3.0,"Pros: thicker, squat proof fabric, super cute design, great price, decent construction from initial try on.<br /><br />Cons: fabric is pretty textured and a little rough actually, size L fits a little smaller than expected. Figured L would probably fit since I wear L bottoms in lots of sports leggings/shorts but these are too tight to wear comfortably - fits like a Fabletics or Gym Shark L which is NOT plus size friendly typically. I mean, it's hard to get a sweat on when you feel like a sausage in a casing!<br /><br />Keeping until spring since will probably keep sliming down and they're cute enough to hold onto. But I would not buy them again cause of the texture :/"
3.0,"I really wanted to like this shirt, but unfortunately it was just way too big for a small (I am 5'3"", 135lbs, B cup). I was able to try this on at work just by putting it over my already loose fitting, 3 quarter sleeve shirt and you couldn't see it at all or tell I was wearing two shirts; it's not necessarily that it's too long, the length was okay, but it was the arms that felt too billowy and came down past my wrists. An extra small may fit, but this also felt a bit like a graduation gown or a judges outfit, so if you're looking for a Ruth Bader Ginsberg look, I definitely recommend this shirt for that! I still want to like it, but I think it's too much material for the style of the shirt."
3.0,Fabric is no where near as soft as I expected. A bit stiff I guess is the right description. Drawstring is difficult to adjust and is really long. Fit is fine. Sits a bit high and is baggy up top. Highlights my short torso but hoping some heels and statement earrings help elongate the look.
3.0,The material for this shirt is incredibly soft. I loved the touch of it. I purchased the white color and it is more of an off-white. The torso of this shirt is very clingy and see through. It showed every lump and bump I have and you could even see my skin color through the shirt. The way the top lays is very nice. I would size up unless you are okay with having a form fitting shirt. I really like the style and was going to exchange for black and a size larger however it was out of stock.
3.0,"Since I purchased my first Kale bag, I fell in love with this brand.<br /><br />This shopping bag is my 5th Kale bag that has been ordered through Amazon.com.<br /><br />When this bag arrived, I was looking forward to a leather but a light and practical bag which can be used for shopping or a gym bag.<br /><br />Kale makes beautiful and gorgeous leather bags but leather does not seem to be a good choice for shopping bag.<br />If something spills and makes stain inside the bag, it will be unlikely that that stain will be removed unless it is professionally taken care of by the dry cleaner that Kale recommends.<br /><br />However, it would be a stylish and luxurious gym bag for everyday use."
3.0,great for summer. very light weight
3.0,"The dress is nice and the material is not bad; however, the sizing is weird.  I am 5'7 and about 145 lbs. I got a small based on other reviews I read.  I am small-chested, which worked out well because the chest of the dress is incredibly tight.  The problem is that the waist is loose so it makes you look larger than you really are.  You can't get a size smaller because of the top of the dress and if you have larger breasts then you will definitely need to size up (which will then make the middle much larger as well.)."
3.0,i was expected it is a lot  thicker fabric to wear in evening  without the coat but it is  thin as silk in a blouse but then i can't wear it as a blouse because it is too long as a blouse. I love the combination of colors though.
3.0,A size too small from my regular size. I'm a small ordered a medium still too small
3.0,The size of the shirt didn’t match up with the provided measurements
3.0,"Very thin and not great quality, but price made it work."
3.0,Stitching on the inner leg started to undo completely. Returned after a few days of wearing them.
3.0,Good quality and fair price
3.0,not so bad..
3.0,"After reading some good reviews of products from this company, I was disappointed when I received the bracelet which was a gift for my wife.<br />The clarity of the diamonds was very inconsistent with a few of them being almost milky.  Considering the price, I would rate this as only fair."
3.0,Runs very small. Order at least two sizes up.
3.0,"Very cute pin, but much smaller than I expected. Its tiny. It almost gets lost on clothes. With the cost of shipping, it is not worth the price. If it was cheaper or you find it in a store, than go for it. My mom who owns two Dachshunds did enjoy it though."
3.0,"only 1/4th of them worked, but they shine bright"
3.0,The material is ok in general although the size was a bit large for me.<br />Be careful regarding the color. The received product is darker than what it is shown in the picture.
3.0,SUPER CUTE!! FIT GREAT!!! However material is very thick and heavy which left me feeling smothered in it.
3.0,Average quality
3.0,"I really appreciate the swift delivery of my product, the softness and texture of the bonnet but it is not very functional. I was looking for something that could stretch for my ‘big’ hairstyles and I will still have to try and find another one because this will not be sufficient. Yes, it is nice but very thin. I completely understand the reviews that I saw from others they did not give this a very high rating."
3.0,"The watch itself is beautiful and I adore the packaging, but I was unable to wear it. The instructions for adjusting the band are simple, and the necessary tool is included. After ten minutes of trying to adjust the band, I gave up for fear of breaking it. It's a shame; I genuinely like the watch otherwise, but it's too loose to wear otherwise."
3.0,"I'm 5'8"" and thought the dress was too short for me at mid /high thigh. Im a slightly busty. It was a little tight in the chest but fit great in the waist so I didnt want a larger size. I gave the dress to my teen daughter who is shorter than I am so the bum coverage is better."
3.0,"Received dress with a white crease down the front of bodice area.  Requested a reply if I could wash the dress to remove crease or I would have to request a refund. Dress looks lovely, however I don't want to return because it's sold out in my size. Don't know what to do....."
3.0,"Very cute, Ends don't screw on evenly, kitten end face backward it sideways, unable to use"
3.0,"Product does not match color of picture, plus it runs big"
3.0,Item came faster than they said. Which is good. Sadly one leg at the ankle came completely unhemmed. I’ll have to fix it before I can wear. Other than that they seem good.
3.0,I love the bracelet but it runs so small I gave it to my granddaughter.
3.0,I would have rated higher but I wish these came with a hard case like they used to
3.0,"I bought several of these and was vert dissapointed. For 7-10 dollars I expected something a little better, these feel like there worth about 3$. The first time i tried to adjust one of the straps it broke, and i was being gentle with it. I ordered medium and it was prett big for me, but im a very thin person at 110lbs 5'7&#34;. I gave 3 stars because the company was very polite and i had no problems returning. This is the first negative review i have had to write."
3.0,"I'm 5 ft and this skirt is at least 3 inches longer than the floor.. it looks like a midi to me in the poc but mine wasn't. I got a medium not knowing what to expect and idt the small would help in this particular area... im size 27, 5 ft 120 lbs for reference... other than that the condition is beautiful I wish it fit!!"
3.0,Pretty - perfect for a teenage girl
3.0,"I received the earrings in good time, in a very nice little box. It included a small polishing cloth. The quality of the earrings is very nice considering the price and they are very well made. The only issue I have with them and the reason they did not rate five stars with me is that the color is way off. I was expecting a true forest green stone as shown on Amazon, but what I got was a grayish-green stone. Somewhat green,  but not  true forest green.  I was disappointed because I have been looking for a beautiful green pair of earrings for the longest time. I will keep the earrings even with the odd color because they are very pretty, just not the color advertised."
3.0,"It's beautiful but the fit is way off, tight across the shoulders and bust-line. I even ordered a size larger. Very disappointed."
3.0,They have good color but came to me with the hooks off . Was able to put them back on. Not made as well as I had hoped .
3.0,A little too snug with socks.
3.0,"I gave this to my mother for her birthday in April.  By December, the color had faded quite a bit.  It looks nothing like the picture now, and really it never did.  It started out &#34;ok,&#34; but now it's really worn looking."
3.0,"I love the top, but it runs very small, the XXL was  more like a large."
3.0,These socks provide some support but I find them very difficult to put on.  I have experience with support hose and the hose are much easier to put on than these socks.
3.0,Was to small for my daughter school book's
3.0,"pretty top, just way too small.  Sizing is not like regular sizes."
3.0,Oxidized after sometime
3.0,Very pretty but I ordered a 14 and it fit more like a 10.
3.0,Very cheaply made but you get what you pay for I suppose.
3.0,"I love the look and feel of these watch bands. I enjoy wearing them and bought a couple for different looks. The only cons i have are because the bands are so soft, they are a bit difficult to remove from the watch face when you want to change bands. Also, the fabric picks up dirt and absorbs moisture if you forget to remove your watch when dealing with messy stuff.  Example:  i live in the south near the Gulf of Mexico.  We eat a lot of spicy boiled seafood. I forgot to take off my watch when eating and the seasoned broth dripped onto my wrist and soaked in the band. I cleaned it and it looks clean, but my puppy still sniffs and licks it whenever i wear it!"
3.0,"I really love the design of these socks. My issues are these socks are not made of quality material, and I imagine after a handful of wears and washes, they will be getting some holes in them. This wouldn't be an issue if these were super cheap socks, but they are the same price as dress socks you would find at a retail store."
3.0,The zipper does not have a smooth action and can be difficult to use.
3.0,"Should have investigated the high star ratings before buying. Most five star reviews are just one word. The tag is cut out of the shorts, but the bag has a sticker on the outside. It says made in China and the materials and size. The drawstring was lost inside the waistband but I fished it out. Sadly the drawstring had holes in it. I'm hoping my husband doesn't notice when I give these to him for Christmas. Also, they had a strong plastic smell, probably from the bag they were packaged in. I'm hoping it goes away after washing."
3.0,Nice looking flip flop and comfortable
3.0,The colors are not very vibrant but overall okay for the price.
3.0,"I use these as work boots - not enough support for hiking.<br /><br />The ""loop"" eyelets bent so I had to press them back with pliers."
3.0,"Would be better if there was a zipper or eye/hooks. If you have large hips, so its difficult to get into, but once it's on it's fine. I like that the buttock has a stretchy material that doesn't flatten it. The firmness is great for everyday wear. No ripples or lumps that show through clothing. The fabric is breathable. I had lipo, so my waist is small(26) but hips 42."
3.0,Check material bc it’s not cotton.
3.0,"They are ok, I have had better, sort of stiff and harsh and actually prefer the three pack for $10 at the H..D..."
3.0,It was to small for my 10 yo
3.0,The leaf is very oversized. Super big on a small wrist. More bothersome than I like wore it once and it was annoying to always move it to feel comfortable
3.0,"I'm 5'6. 135ish lbs Athletic. C cup. I got a medium. The top was kind of big bit fit. The bottoms, however, were SMALL. I DONT have a booty. I'd say I'm average, but I couldn't keep the bottoms on, they kept wanting to come down because they were so tight."
3.0,Smaller then offered
3.0,"I usually wear a small or medium but I ordered a large because previous comments said they ran small. IM SO GLAD I DID. I like this bikini but it is very small. It also hardly covers your butt so if you want a full coverage bikini, this is not for you. It's pretty decent for the price"
3.0,Material very thin. Hard to tie a knot that looks nice.
3.0,"Love the design but my wide couldnbt wear it because it was too small, even though we went by the sizing chart."
3.0,The shoulder straps are a bit long. Ill have them taken up. I would have liked this to be in petite.
3.0,"Comfortable, and soft. I wanted it baggy, and got a large and it was alittle to big, so pretty true to normal size ranges."
3.0,They were very tight on my nose. If they could fix that issue it would be a great item
3.0,Very cheaply made mask and too small!
3.0,A lovely blouse but it fits too small I'm really disappointed first bought a large and then I bought a extra large the arm is way too small.
3.0,I liked it but I’m really picky about my clothes it has to be soft or I hate it I was so excited that is came so I feel the inside and it was hard. So if you are picky about your clothes you might not want it but the the picture was good not cheap made.
3.0,"The angle isn’t quite a right angle, so it tends to slip out when barely brushed against but I love the colors and the gems haven’t fallen out yet"
3.0,I loved this set. Unfortunately one velvet pouch was missing which completely annoyed me. Outside of that it was cute and fun for my daughters first grade class.
3.0,Came very tarnished. Should be exactly what I wanted once I get it cleaned up.
3.0,This dress had 2 fabric imperfections that look like snags.
3.0,"The bag looks beautiful, but it's only been used for three weeks and parts of the bag are starting to come apart at the seams. I reccomend if you buy this bag to not put too much in it. I only have it half full and its ripping on the front and on the strap."
3.0,I thought the top was white but its more cream. Its still nice just not what I thought it would be
3.0,Length is rather long. Had to return.
3.0,Broke after one month use
3.0,"Washed it by itself. When I pulled it out of the washer the blue ran into the white. So now there are blue spots on the shirt. I love the way it fit, but, was unhappy that it bled through."
3.0,Cute chain. Seem like it is decent quality. But it is made for a left handed person to clip on and off. It is hard for me to hook it.<br /><br />I will write more on this item in a few weeks!
3.0,"Great looking dress. I bought a size larger than what I typically wear and it is big on me so the sizing chart is very accurate. I am 5,4 and weight around 200lbs, 38in waist for reference.<br />The lace is a little scratchy but I mean that's lace for ya. The only thing I found weird and took away stars which I think is on Amazons fault more than the vendor. The dress smells like cigarette smoke. Theres no staining and the smell washed out fine, but it was weird to open and the smell was pungent. But overall the dress length is perfect for me to wear to work, and the seams are well sewn, I plan on altering it to fit a little better around the waist, but that was because I bought a larger size than usual. I would definitely recommend this dress for anyone looking for cute retro style clothing that's inexpensive."
3.0,"Very cheeky and doesn't cover much. If you like you butt hanging out, this is the swimsuit for you.  I don't have much butt, and the bottoms barely covered my crease. The top is very small too. I had too much bottom boobs showing.  I tried it on, and didn't wear it in public."
3.0,"Much to light of material to “swing”. Great for beach coverup in warm climate. I needed an actual dress so I returned this. Cute pattern, as shown in description."
3.0,Very nice dress just to small
3.0,"It hurts my ear after wearing it for a day or two. You cannot sleep on it without it causing discomfort. However, it's cute to wear out but just not to sleep with."
3.0,Loved the way they look but they are bit sloppy to walk in
3.0,"General: Fit was good, these are extremely lightweight. Not willing to test the limit of “unbreakability” but they seem reasonably durable. Should hold up with some care. Installation was easy and coverage was good for my glasses (rectangular type frames from Costco)<br /><br />Complaint: the silver mirrored type created some kind of annoyinf reflection inside my glasses. Going to try the dark grey or black instead, will update."
3.0,"The watch band feels very good, but is already starting to tear and I only bought it in December. The band is not nearly durable to be ripping already"
3.0,This is a well made hat and it's very warm.  I like the knitted style but wish it had a bit more of a flop to it.  My biggest issue is that it's small and a bit tight no my head (and I have a fairly small head).  I can still wear it and I'm hoping it will stretch out!
3.0,"Just writing this review so others know ahead of time how small these shirts run. I ordered my boys the size they regularly wear and they were way too small. After a return and refund I reordered and got 2 sizes bigger thinking that would be safe (they wear 10/12 and I got 18/20 the 2nd time). The 18/20 barely fit. I would compare them to a a sz 8, maybe small 10. It stinks that they will get so little use out of them."
3.0,They were quite a bit bigger than I wanted
3.0,Good for the price. Kinda strange fit but lightweight
3.0,Cute dress but small!
3.0,"pretty nice for the price. buyer beware; the band is very small, if you are a full grown adult the band may not fit."
3.0,"Bought fo my mom who wanted the larger display, very cute"
3.0,"Shirts looks nice and is very very thin.  I used the size chart a chose a larger size and it still a bit small.  ill give it to my godson,"
3.0,Not as grippy as I would have liked but worked okay for what I needed them for.
3.0,Cute pattern.  Nice length.  5’6” hits middle of my knee.  Disappointed in shorts.  Too short and they ride up.  I cut them out and use as a skirt  instead.  Try YogiPace brand for longer shorts that don’t ride up.
3.0,"I am 5'9"" plus long waisted and this shirt did not flatter me at all. It looks cute on shorter people for sure, but did not look nice or fall in the right places."
3.0,Runs a little shorter than i thought it would and the cut out strap is too long. A few adjustments and i make it work.
3.0,"Shirts cute and fits like a boxy crop, the sleeves could be a little longer and tighter tho.. the main issue is the stripes are dark blue not black like the photo and than the sleeves are black so it’s misleading but still cute"
3.0,"It fits.... but it makes the bust look flat and wide if you are a larger busted girl. That said, they never said their bras were appropriate for larger busted girls.  I can really only wear this bra with loose fitting blouses.  If I wear it with anything tight, it makes my bust look too matronly.... and makes me look heavier.  All of this would be solved if they did two things:<br /><br />1.  Make the apex of the bust closer together - which also means making the clasp in front less wide.<br /><br />2.  Underwires!!!!  The wires would be covered by cotton so what is the fear of using an underwire?<br /><br />3.  Maybe use an inner non - stretch cotton panel  on the bottom outer third of the cups so that the side of the bust is more supported and doesn't get squished too wide.<br /><br />All in all these guys could make sooooooooo much more of their company if they did more colors and options.  I will watch to see if they decide to do more/better styles.<br /><br />To the Cottonique team: I hope I've offered some useful input.  (I've been  a lingerie model for years.... I know about fit. )"
3.0,Got these as a gift.<br />Construction is excellent.<br />Their a bit bulky but its not somthing you can't adjust to.<br />Thay keep my hands warm just enough that thay dont freeze in low temperatures.<br />Biggest complaint is the battery's charger. Ive only chraged them a hand full of times and the battery's are already failing and this is why.<br />Thay give you 2 7.4v lipos for power.<br />These battery's are a 2 cell battery whitch need to be balanced charged to keep them working properly.<br />The charger doesn't support this.<br />And the battery's dont have a balance lead.<br /><br />I intend to dismantle and add balance leads to the battery's so that i can charge via a hobby charger or replace battery's with hobby grade battery's.<br /><br />If the company would give you proper battery's and a proper charger they'd have it made.<br /><br />Over all not a bad product considering the price.
3.0,Lindo como lo miras en fotos
3.0,"These are good for the price, but they do run a little small. Overall good quality though."
3.0,"I like the case, perfect for my reading glasses however it did not come with the cleaning cloth as advertised. This was one reason why I chose this case and was disappointed to find I was shorted."
3.0,It fit my daughter perfectly. I purchased it for her dance class and after about 2 months the one strap randomly ripped and she is no longer able to wear it. She only wore it once a week.
3.0,"Runs small and fabric isn’t as described, but overall it’s cute."
3.0,4 Large shirts 4 different sizes. Out of the package of 4 of the same shirts three are 3 diff fits. I usually expect a small difference but one is super tight. Two are loose. And one fits perfectly.
3.0,Small but nice!
3.0,"This item is really cute. I got it as a charm for my Tamagotchi. I didn't give it the full 5 stars though, because the bell that came with the charm arrived tarnished."
3.0,"Very nice, and very see through."
3.0,probably great skirt but it was way too big. if u have a 24-26 inch waist get the extra small not the small.
3.0,"It is really cute once it's on, but like other's have said, the fold-over at the top, which is supposed to keep the hem in place, is really awkward.  It has no stretch, so it creates a line across the chest where it hits, and has no give.  The material is nice, but definitely not drier worthy."
3.0,Feels more like pajamas than sweatpants.  Not very fluffy.
3.0,There is no black in lettering and stars-just silver. I am the only one who would ever know what the lettering is. Very hard to read this charm so I feel it was overpriced. Very slow delivery of 3 weeks.
3.0,"cute, but large and impossible to see out nose holes for twelve year old.  As an adult, I too could not see well enough to feel safe wearing this"
3.0,"I was hoping that the material blend in this top would be softer and drape/hang more, as it looks on the model in the photo. It is thicker and more rough even though I’ve washed it quite a few times. Not enough cotton in the blend I suppose. Also, it doesn’t hang or drape nicely on the body. The bottom is rounded, not cut straight across at the hem as it appears on the model in the photo. I keep it to wear when sleeping on chilly winter nights when no one sees me. I wouldn’t wear it out in public as I don’t care for the look of it much. The white is nice and clean looking however. It arrived in a timely manner, was packaged nicely and the size was as I expected."
3.0,"Very beautiful necklace but it came broke. I fixed it and got several compliments. It's not heavy and looks great.  FYI, be careful to not wear a shirt that snags, as this necklace will pull the threads."
3.0,I REALLY love the look of these and I want to give 5 stars however the backs are poorly made and the ratings fell off several times due to the backing jus slipping off the post.
3.0,"NIce style, but the material is thinner than I expected/wanted.  Depending on how loose you like your shirts, I would suggest ordering up one size unless you like a body fitting look."
3.0,Dress is nice. The one I received had the end of the pocket sewn up in the side seam. Material is ok. Not as breathable as I would like. More polyester feeling.
3.0,These are well-made gloves and they might be rain resistant but they are not waterproof by any stretch of the imagination
3.0,"The material for this dress is thin and it clings to the upper body like a second skin, which in my case is not a good thing. Has been hanging in my bathroom for days and the skirt is still wrinkled, so will try steaming or accept the rumpled look. Beautiful color. This dress was a steal so no big deal if I end up donating it or end up using it as a casual “shopping dress”, but not suitable for wear to work or any social occasion that calls for a little effort in dressing."
3.0,Nice and very well-made. Too big and way too heavy for the straps to hold it up.
3.0,a little disappointed.  Has a black lining and seems more like a regular umbrella than a sun protector.  I should of researched more.
3.0,Cute but a bit big.
3.0,Some were cracked and some of the inserts to hold the picture in fell right out. I had to use adhesive on the edges to hold it in.
3.0,I ordered a large and it is like a  X large .  It is comfy and soft . I use it for when it is chilly and don’t want to wear a jacket
3.0,"This is nice, the fabric is thin and the size is not good"
3.0,"Beautiful Item, but runs extremely small."
3.0,Not true to size.  larger to true size. May need to buy one size down from your normal size.
3.0,"Was great at first, after a week or so the liquid leaked out. Wish it lasted longer."
3.0,Sized karge
3.0,"You can tell that they are not as good of quality as the original band that comes with the watch. They were good quality for the price I paid. However when I put the bands on they did not latch as good as the original. The watch kept coming unmatched at the watch facing. I didnt have the watch on tight, nd I was able to wear it for about an hour until it came unlatch for no reason. Then it would not latch back for more than 5 seconds after that."
3.0,"Very tight fit. Material is okay,<br />Does not stretch"
3.0,I mean it’s cool but the zippers break after a couple months :/
3.0,Was hoping it would have more shine. Very thin and dull and looks cheap.
3.0,I’m a 34 DDD and this did not work for me.
3.0,"Hello I liked the glasses but I did not get the myopia ring, how can I do to have them or do I have to return them? Greetings, thank you<br />."
3.0,Very short. Dresses this one is modeled after were at the knee or a little past it.  Not the case with this one.
3.0,"It was pretty much what I expected however, it does run small"
3.0,These were super cute and comfortable. I ordered size medium. And unfortunately the were way too long.  I am 5’0.  If you’re 5’5 or taller these will work for you.
3.0,Last through Halloween
3.0,"Great color and quality, but I agree with the other reviewers. The sizing is pretty bad and not for a grown man.  The beads are way too small and so hard to get on."
3.0,The belt itself is attractive if not leather. It's got a plastic smell not leather.
3.0,Material is flimsy
3.0,Loose but it's a Steelers hat so whatever.
3.0,Fits good. A little long. Good material but there is no way you can wear it alone.
3.0,"I bought three pins as Christmas gifts. I would normally give this 5 gold stars, but I am disappointed with the packaging. The box was not wrapped in clear plastic as it usually is and although the pin is beautiful, the little blue bag is missing as well as the extra replacement crystals. The packaging of the other 2 pins was perfect.<br />One reason I always order EVER FAITH is because it comes so beautifully wrapped and makes a wonderful gift."
3.0,Good quality but much smaller than the stones represented in the picture. Not quite the size the description said they would be.
3.0,I was so excited to get this shirt but very disappointed as it was about 3 sizes too small.
3.0,Disappointed with this dress. The top area fit way too big and the tie was in a very odd spot. It was too low and needed to be on the bodice area. This could've been a super cute dress if it fit properly. I returned it :(
3.0,cute cute and good quality but runs small
3.0,"Las bandas muy buenas, dos venían dañabas y eran colores diferentes y me enviaron colores repetidos y no son los colores como se muestran, son colores muy pálidos. 😕"
3.0,I wish the top had a little more support for my large breasts. Other than that I like it. The shorts run a little smaller than the top but for the money it is fine. Good material.
3.0,Works great but too small for me personally
3.0,"It's cute and good material, fit true to size but you can't move without the top two buttons popping open and revealing your whole chest."
3.0,it didn't say it was a kids size I ordered a xxl
3.0,My ears ate sensitive to certain metal so im always looking for stainless steel but by the end of the first day my ear was swollen and i couldn't get it off I didn't have pliers to remove the back so by the next day i had a bump and my ear was turning blue...
3.0,Nice fabric but they did not fit as expected. I ordered the same size as all other pairs. These run small. I returned both pair and purchased a different brand
3.0,It is smaller than I anticipated and doesn't fit loosely as shown.
3.0,It’s a nice shirt and hangs really nice but I would recommend sizing down. The shoulders are a little wide set and that makes the arms a little too long for me.
3.0,Decent quality runs small
3.0,Rolls down
3.0,Too many unicorns and zebras
3.0,Came damp and had a musty smell to them.  Washed up really nice are dry and does not smell.
3.0,A little 2 big even with adjustable...piece
3.0,"It is a beautiful bracelet, but does not flex at all. It was too small so I had to return it. :-( I wish they made more normal sized bracelets. I can buy bracelets from most stores that fit fine, these are for very small wrists or children."
3.0,They were too large and I returned them
3.0,"Not bad for cheap shoes, but not the most durable."
3.0,I like the design and the price. I think it’s a good deal for the money I spent. What I notice is that the gold is starting to wear out and I have barely used it.
3.0,"Good looking shorts. Back ripped within first two hours of wearing, from simply getting in and out of the car. Company was swift with their response and offered full refund plus shipping costs for the shorts. Super satisfied with the customer service I received."
3.0,"When I first put these shoes on, it felt like I was walking on two pillows.  They were soft and very comfortable.  It will take at least a day to get used to walking in them, especially if you've been wearing bedroom shoes that long lost its support.  I live in socks and bedroom shoes so good support is a definite need, however these did not last long.  The soft and cushioned support went flat after two weeks and it felt like I was walking on the floor.  While I expected to get new bedroom slippers after a couple of months since I wear them all day, every day, I did not think I would be replacing these within weeks of purchase.  But that is what happened.  These shoes may start out comfortable but they have a very short life and you will find that you have to buy new slippers sooner than expected.  So, in my opinion, they are NOT worth the money."
3.0,"I would have had no hesitations in wearing this piece because I like the look and it was just the right kind of heavy, but it had a black noticeable scrape on the very front.  It bothered me too much, so this one was a no go for me.  Too bad because if it wasn't for that scrape, it would have gotten 4+ stars!"
3.0,The dress was beautiful but if you have bigger arms be aware that the lace does not give.  The dress seemed a bit small.  I wear a size 10/12 so got the large.  I should have gone with the XL  But it is beautiful and well made. I recommend
3.0,"The cap came inside a flat plastic bag. The crown of the cap was flattened and creased. Otherwise,  the cap is good quality."
3.0,The top was a nice fleece but the pants were not a nice material and i thought the whole thing woild be soft fleece..it was a gft
3.0,"comfortable, yet very thin material; i.e. you get what you pair for. Shirt doesn't soak up much moister, but is cute and comfy."
3.0,"Super cute, but although I ordered size 3T it fits our 18 months old, normal sized, Granddaughter just nicely so in fact it's way too small if one would order the actual size of your child."
3.0,They are Oak
3.0,It looks nice but you can hardly see the writing
3.0,"Well made but do not stay on my Easter Eggers. I have a broad-breastfed Barnevelder who was the only hen who wore her ""dress"" for longer than 20 minutes - she wore hers for several weeks while recovering from a slash injury. But the other three hens tripped, stumbled and were caught by roos grabbing their hen saddles. Put them on at night while birds are sedate. They'll wake up the next morning thinking it's normal to wear a hen saddle."
3.0,"I wanted to love everything about this top. The fabric is great, the length perfect, it is super snug on the arms, particularly in the back of the arms, and under arms... I had red marks under my arms after wearing it for a day. I am typically a S/M in tops, so the arms IMO are some out of proportion with the rest of the garment which is flowy.<br />The color, and structure of the top are well-made, however there is NO give/stretch to this top, so if you have slightly bigger arms, beware..."
3.0,My husband bought this for me & I regret having to return this garment.. the Shoulder straps kept slipping off. I guess I’m to Petite for this wide strap
3.0,The arms are WAY to narrow.  You will need to have sticks for arms with this jacket..
3.0,"I wear a men's 10.5 US in athletic shoes and a 10 US in dress shoes. They are a very snug fit. Like a compression sock snug. I think these might be made more for women. I've worn them several times now and they do breathe well and are very low profile so don't show with boat shoes or Chucks. However, maybe because of how tight they fit, two of them now have holes in them at the ball of the foot. If you are a man, I would say only order these if you are below a size 10."
3.0,"This is very pretty & soft, but the tag says SILK LIKE MATERIAL."
3.0,"Bought for my 3-year-old who is roughly 30 lbs and on the slim side.<br /><br />Top width fits fine but shoulders are WAY too loose; almost like an off-the-shoulder top. When the shoulders are up, the back straps are loose.<br /><br />Bottom fits around the waist, but way too loose in the bottom and back. :(<br /><br />Quality is good. Have washed it a few times with no ripping. Only the elastic in the waistband seems to twist inside the fabric and you have to twist it back.<br /><br />This was the cutest Belle swim suit I have found anywhere online."
3.0,"They looked nice, but were not comfortable enough. I ended up returning them. There was not enough give, and they were tight on my ankles."
3.0,I was excited to try this dress on. I have several other dress from this brand which I like. The neck didn't fit well. The two flaps were opened and didn't sit well on my chest. Returning this product.
3.0,A lot longer than I wanted.
3.0,"This wasn't what I expected. I know you should not trust everything you see in pictures, but I really needed a pair of ear muffs so I trusted what I saw. The picture shows a thicker set of earmuffs. When I received mine in the mail, I was super disappointed with the quality. The material seemed cheap and thing. It is extremely lightweight, and does fold okay. It somewhat does the job and helps my ears a bit. I don't think it was worth it. I will most likely be buying another pair of ear muffs."
3.0,I thought the size ran small.
3.0,"Cute, but didn't come close to fitting me gave it to my daughter and it was still to small on her"
3.0,Quality product but color was not as advertised. The top half came in navy not lime green.
3.0,"I am a big woman, but I am also a short woman. Some people just don't relise that big does not always = tall."
3.0,I wanted hats like this in a lot of different colors but this is little too small.Make it thicker and bigger and it will be great.
3.0,the paint will peel off and the lens is very easy to scratch
3.0,"It's a cute dress, but all the sequins are really easy to come out. Just taking off the dress I had at least 10 sequins come off. The fit is a little small and tight. Overall, I would buy it again, but I would've gone a size up. It's a good price for what it is."
3.0,"My rating for this is actually more a 3.5. I'm only rating this so-so because I didn't get all the colors that are shown here. I ended up receiving three black rings and not the silver/with pink jewels and the rose gold colored ring. I reached out to the seller and was immediately helped with the issue. We reached a resolution, but it wasn't necessarily what I was looking for. I was really hoping that there would've been some way for me to get the two missing colors. Out of the options I was given, I chose to keep the rings and got a small refund.<br /><br />As for the actual product, I think that they look exactly as pictured and are surprisingly sturdy. I don't know if they've made the rings smaller as a common complaint is that they're too big. I didn't have this problem and I have a really small nose and face. The rings fit perfectly and looked pretty real. Shipping didn't take as long as estimated and I received the rings in about two weeks.<br /><br />I say go ahead and take a chance with this product because you can't beat the price and the quality is surprisingly good. Just be wary that you might not get all the colors that are shown."
3.0,"Fine as a shirt, not as sharp as I had hoped.  Fabric is light, however the big issue is the 'bleeding' of colors shown in the photo...  just not crisp, lightly pixelated, and fuzzy..."
3.0,Definitely very cheap. Came with threads out but is fun for dress up.
3.0,"Very high-wasted, quality is ok. I would consider these to be more footless tights than leggings, as they can be a bit see-through. I am 5'5&#34; and wear jeans around a size 6-8 and these were a bit big for me. They fit my 5'7&#34; and 5'8&#34; teenage girls who wear between 9-11 size jeans much better."
3.0,The material was a little to thin for me. I like more thick material.
3.0,The watch is nice and of a good size and weight. My only concern is what will happen when I’m not wearing long sleeve’s or a jacket because the clasp keeps coming undone. Will it fall off and break. The clasp needs to stay closed until i push the two buttons.
3.0,"This dress fit fine and looked reasonably okay on. It's a bit long -- certainly past my knees on a 5'4&#34; frame. I was hoping to wear to a wedding, and it simply did not fit the bill. I can't imagine wearing this to anything except a costume party."
3.0,"I normally wear a size 18.  I ordered 3 vests size xxl allowing for extra room.  Unfortunately,  they are entirely too small, I can't even button them close.  What a bummer because I really liked the style and quality of material."
3.0,"For a quick and easy costume, my teen daughter wanted to be a cat. All she needed was ears. These looked cute and so we picked them up for her this Halloween. These shipped quickly, and arrived in good condition. She threw on all black and popped these on her head and done! Not even an hour later the black ribbon that wraps the headband unraveled and was dangling off her head. This pulled one ear back and made her head look lopsided. With no way to reattach the ribbon while out at a party, we were forced to remove the ribbon all together. These are literally fuzzy ears looped onto a wire head band. The loops are white elastic and visible against the black ears and dark hair. Overall, they just look and feel cheap. They got the job done and from a distance looked ok, but I'm sure there are much better options available!"
3.0,"received quickly, but the frame’s integrity was questionable. It was certainly quality Persol glasses, but the frame came defective."
3.0,I really was expecting extreme comfort from these but the truth is my feet were killing me after walking around in them all day. 2 days later I wore my cheap walgreens flip flops and had no pain.<br />update: July 2009- Finally sent them to the Goodwill. Didn't wear them more than 4 times total. Bummer.
3.0,It fits good but has bad finishing.
3.0,They are pretty heavy and bulky.
3.0,"Wanted to love these for my son who has autism and sensory processing disorder. He usually likes a lot of deep pressure, but these were too tight around his head for him. He has a larger than average head for a 7 year old and he wouldn't leave them on for even a few minutes."
3.0,"The design is actually cool. However, the octopus has 6 legs...that kind of thing kinda drives me crazy. I am a science nerd."
3.0,"This is ok, I don’t expect a lot of durability from it. This is made from the same fabric that a small child’s backpack is made from...the nylon made to feel like canvas stuff. It’s also not as big as I thought it would be but it still holds a lot."
3.0,They worked ok but I was concerned that they would hold up better when my daughter was using glasses in gym or while playing ball they could be a bit tighter.
3.0,The reason why I left a negative feed back is because i Could not snap it in the second snap
3.0,The straps on this are adjustable but it still didn't fit properly and was rather itchy.  It's a very beautiful nightgown but I would recommend going up one size.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress. The fit and design are great, and pockets are a PLUS. However, I did not like the material of the dress. It reminded me of parachute material. It did feel lightweight which is nice, but not sure it’s a very breathable material. I was planning to use this as a nursing dress, the button are real."
3.0,"I purchased the gray with the black stitching. I do like these and the stitch gives a slimming effect, but they are not ""squat proof."" I must either wear them with flesh colored undies or with shorts. This isn't the end of the world as the price was good, but it is a little disappointing. Most likely would not recommend them, but also not a terrible choice for someone on a budget."
3.0,Comfy but runs big
3.0,"The finger-length was WAY too long for my 6yo. I am not much of a seamstress, but I cut anywhere from 1/2"" to 1"" off of each finger and re-sewed them so she could at least function while wearing these with her Halloween costume."
3.0,"I ordered a large for someone else and the shirt was tight on me and I take a small, so the sizing is terrible. This large shirt would only fit someone who is a size 4. I am a size 6 and it was too tight."
3.0,"Love the design, but item received was a very dark blue, almost black. It was a present or I would have returned it."
3.0,"Almost impossible to close, can't even do it when they are not in my ear.  They look nice though and are the perfect size for someone who does not want dangly earrings."
3.0,"I usually wear an XL in dresses, I cant even get this over my head, very cute, but size is much smaller than expected"
3.0,I bought it for my sister and she liked it..BUT she has a thin waist and breasts higher than the average body so my gramma had to adjust. the fabric is not very comfortable then our gramma has sewn a fabric under the dress
3.0,I've only worn this dress a few times and the seams are already beginning to come undone. I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,The little Dimonds started fall out.
3.0,The Credit Card slots are too narrow...
3.0,"Just a bit more snug than I was expecting.<br />I'm about a 10/12 US dress size 36DD.<br />I usually wear a L but for my chest and workout purposes, I got an XL of this order.<br />It's actually snug all the way down and not just in the chest.<br />Great material but it looks painted on.<br />Hope that helps!"
3.0,It was simply “alright”. Not bad. Not good.<br />Not as nice of quality bad described.<br />Ordered for my history buff son. The idea was good.
3.0,"The mask looks good but it’s silicone, and the straps are placed weirdly"
3.0,Does not have any stretch to them. Verrrry right. Size up.
3.0,"The barrettes are very cute, however one of them does not work.  The purple barrette does not have any tension, so it does not stay in my daughter's hair."
3.0,Its pretty. Charm broke quickly but i was able to still apply it to the chain.
3.0,I mainly use polarized glasses for driving but these don't quite meet expectations in that regard.  I'm keeping as my back up pair and use them for yard work or anything sporty. Lenses are kinda yellow and could stand to be a shade darker. Very light weight.
3.0,"Sizes for teen girls, not women, everything was small."
3.0,Really comfortable fit. Super gorgeous skirt. Great day/night look.
3.0,Though it was a dress but it's a skirt and blouse..
3.0,The wallet didn't last long before it started to fall apart.
3.0,I love the charm but the chain broke the second time i wore it.
3.0,"It's cute, but it's long. I have to keep pushing it back in. It works for now, but I will wind up replacing it and most likely never wear it again."
3.0,"Looked great but came bent at one corner, was a gift so I didn't have time to return for a new one. Much thinner than I anticipated, seems cheaply made."
3.0,"The dress fits slightly smaller than anticipated. The print is almost blurred, which happens in a lot of clothing from overseas. I don't know if I would buy this again. The fit and print were off from the description."
3.0,"Really pretty, but too big and heavy for my lanyard."
3.0,Pockets are little awkward but overall comfortable dress
3.0,I ordered this watch band and it was not what I wanted. No specific reason. Just not my style.
3.0,I loved this. Purse itself is made well. Just the button was not. Id purchase another if theyd change that feature
3.0,Boots did not hold up well.
3.0,I’ll start by saying this was my third such coat. The first two were Aussie. The same coat was re-branded as Aquadash.<br />The towel lining of the coat does not dry if you use it every day. Mine developed mold spots after about a week and then fell apart after 5 weeks (shredded). It does not stand up to daily use.<br /><br />I was outside the return window and so I tried to contact the company through its website. I did not get a response. Another reason to not buy this coat. No customer assistance<br /><br /> I called Amazon and got very good assistance from Amazon. I do not recommend this coat.
3.0,The gloves were OK the only problem is there’s still a little too thin and my hands get cold
3.0,Fits big. Needs an adjustable strap  otherwise a good product.
3.0,I bought these for my husband for washing dishes. The fingertips have been ripping so easily that he used all the pairs already in 2 months.
3.0,This is really small. Its a nice bright shirt but order many sizes up. Also the back is WAY longer then the front so I find it limits what I can wear it with.
3.0,These were comfortable and fit well. However the minute you wash them they do shrink a little.
3.0,Took forever to get here. Chain is very short. Too inexpensive to send back haha. Gave it to my mom
3.0,"Its a beautiful color and so soft but the pockets are really in a weird spot. They are too far back and right at the widest part of my hips, not a good look"
3.0,"Really pretty watch, but mine won't keep time properly.  I have wound it up, but it tends to stop running😞"
3.0,Gloves are too thin. Fingertips poke through gloves easily with limited effort.
3.0,"Very pretty, but a little tight."
3.0,Yesterday I got this beautiful earrings. There is one stone missing from the earring. When they send product need to check carefully. Very disappointing 😕 😞 😔
3.0,It came more black than silver than it looked in the picture
3.0,Exactly as described online. Beautiful color and shape. Love the “drawstring” adjustment. Very comfortable.
3.0,They are OK. However has already started to ball up on the outside after first wash.
3.0,It would have been nice to get the actual item shown and described.  I gave three stars for that but the product was still a nice silk  scarf.
3.0,"returned the item. It was pretty, but the fit was too big and loose around the top. I ordered an XS."
3.0,I have used it a few time and it looks nice. The biggest issue I have is the glare on the glasses I guess you can call it.  It might come in handy at work but at home I just have flux.
3.0,Comfy ... But ripped in crotch area first day... And they fit perfectly fine
3.0,"It’s decent, not hard to get the coin in and out. But it’s just a bit more bulky than you want for something in your pocket."
3.0,"soft, but not sure how long it'll last. i got it around 10$, at that price, worth it."
3.0,Fabric did not have the expected appearance
3.0,Love the style. Material but I am 9 weeks postpartum and the shirt clings to my mom tummy. Not flattering.
3.0,My legs are still pretty achy after work
3.0,Too tight on my head.
3.0,The coat ran really big. I ordered a M to ensure I had room for bulkier cloths but this crazy big. I’m 5’8” and the sleeves went to my fingertips. I suspect the coat was mislabeled.
3.0,Short sleeves!!
3.0,It was really hard to get this to attach to the watch and then when I did get it attached it kept falling off
3.0,I don’t think this was made with the large bust women community in mind. Too much boob action for me (36 DDD)
3.0,"Bag is much smaller, as well as very shallow;  was expecting more room from Amazon description, But will keep and try traveling with it a few times"
3.0,I really like this dress and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it it’s beautiful but it’s not gonna hold up very well.
3.0,It was a great bag just a little big for me. Love the color.
3.0,THIS SHOE WAS TOO BIG FOR MY SON
3.0,Its hard to put on actually but I guess this one fits on little arm..like for teen girls only...
3.0,"I was looking for a leather dice cup and this was suppose to be one.  After using it for about a year, the inside of the cup started to come apart and the leather started to peal off. I know a year is a long time but when you pay extra for a &#34;quality&#34; leather dice cup, I would think it should last for a very,very long time.  It's not like I used it every day, like say in a Tavern, just at home on game night. I had a dice cup I had bought years ago and I had it for years, but I moved and it got lost, but it was in a lot better shape then this one after only using for a year."
3.0,I got a large because I usually wear a medium and it was too big.  I wear a 6 or 8 and should have gotten a medium.  I would exchange it because I love the style but found it a little see through for my taste.  Looking in the mirror I could see when I had my legs parted.  If this came in a darker color I would buy that.
3.0,"I don’t have an overly large head, but I do have long hair. It feels snug but not TOO snug to use for me. I had my 14 and 12 year old sons try it, and they also felt it it was too snug. The younger one has sensory issues and it was too uncomfortable for him. The sound quality is about what I expected. Have not tried the mic. Mostly got this for laying down and listening when my headphones won’t work without risking breaking them."
3.0,"With the pandemic, it took 3 months and 2 days to receive the dress. The dress is very cute; however, it didn’t come with the ribbon to lace the dress.  Therefore my daughter can’t wear it! :(<br /><br />I’ve sent numerous messages to the seller (Sold By: LauVery) requesting the missing ribbon, but they have not sent it.<br /><br />Instead, they have requested a picture of the missing ribbon!?!  My iPhone will not let me attach an image to our communication via Amazon; therefore, I requested an email address.  I received another response, this time in German, telling me again to send a picture.<br /><br />I can’t post a picture using the Amazon message function; however, I can post a picture here in the reviews...so maybe now we can get the missing ribbon!!!!  Fingers Crossed"
3.0,"Cool design, it's a little too short though."
3.0,Broken when it arrives.
3.0,I bought this for my wife thinking it was Alex and Ani and not knowing anything other than its a metal bracelet with a single charm I bought this. the quality is ok and size is ok. It sticks when you try to get it on and overall its not very comfortable.
3.0,"Nice looking locket and as pictured--except--my daughter wore it one time and the seashell broke off and she lost it. The locket is smaller than a nickel and about the size of dime. It does open and you could put some very tiny pictures in there, but as I said it broke off the first day. If not for its durability it would have made a nice small gift / token for someone. I would not buy it again, unfortunately."
3.0,I ordered two different colors of this dress.  One fit.  This color did not.  Could not get it down across my chest.  Was way too tight.  So disappointed as this is a cute dress!
3.0,THE MATERIAL IS A BIT THIN BUT NOT SEE THRU. PAIRED GREAT WITH TIGHTS TO HELP KEEP SKIRT FROM SLIDING DOWN.
3.0,Christmas present so no ideas if it’s fits or not.
3.0,"Decent for the price, but a bit deformed from shipping and the tint in the eye area was falling off/crinkled."
3.0,"Really fast shipping, love the look of the sneakers.  The only thing is they do run small and tighter than normal.  The left heal also had a little defect in it probably from the factory and it cause blisters on my sons heal.  If not for the defect would have given 5 stars."
3.0,Wrong size was shipped. Nice ring though for the price.
3.0,"I'm a 36D and this fit fine, for the most part. It fit my cup just fine, but everything else just wasn't comfortable. I returned the item."
3.0,The purse was smaller than I expected and it definitely was not a shoulder bag as advertised.
3.0,"EDIT: company said they were going to refund full amount.<br /><br />Literally two minutes after my son brought these shoes up the road from the post, two things happened: he proclaimed he loved them-and then part of the shoe came off easily. Fortunately it was only the part that was sewn to cover the ends of the laces...but now the lace ends are exposed and the tightener can easily slide off. Actual shoes seem great-slight defect on laces"
3.0,This was slightly smaller then expected. It still fit but just a tad too small.
3.0,Overall not a bad product for the price. The finish on each link didn’t even match each other. Pins like to pop out which is irritating because there are a bunch. Once everything is together however and sized to fit it is really comfortable and cool looking. Gets noticed.
3.0,"It came with the color faded, and it didn't fit quite right. The links doesn't lay down, but I still received a lot of compliments when I wore it."
3.0,to much fabric
3.0,"I like everything about this except the microfiber feel. I bought my husband an expensive name brand one that feels more like a heavy towel and I feel that one keeps warm more and also absorbs better, as far as the water from my body. I don’t think I’d buy this type of changing hoodie again, but it does the job"
3.0,These barely fit my daughter and she is on the smaller side.
3.0,Extremely cute but super tight in the chest. It makes it hard to breathe and my nips can be seen it’s so tight. Please let this be known in the item description. Thank you.
3.0,"Ok for price, too thin and just a bit more coverage than I expected."
3.0,"I expected this item to be more sweatshirt material, but it is more along the lines of athletic material. It is thin material, but the white is nice and bright and the stars a nice navy blue.. I will be keeping it because it fits and looks nice, but wish it were sweat shirt material to be warmer for winter weather.  There were no posted reviews when I purchased it."
3.0,"I already read the negative reviews and my experience wasn't much different. It was difficult to work with and the vinyl tore easily. I had a plan though. I painted a blocked out section white, put the decal over it, then painted the wall back to the color I was wanting over it. The next day I came and peeled off the decal and got a perfect design on the wall.<br /><br />I'm going to give it three stars instead of two because it worked for what I was using it for."
3.0,"Would have been nice if you are tall, but if you are not 6 ft tall you’ll drown in the dress and it won’t look good."
3.0,"The arms are very tight can raise my arms at all. It also isn't exactly as picture, similar but a cheap knock off of the actual pictured suit. I'll be returning"
3.0,"I want to love this dress; I've had it on my wishlist for a while, so when I got it as a gift, I was so excited.  However, there are too many issues with it.  It doesn't look nearly as cute on me as the girl in the photo.  It looks fairly frumpy, which is unfortunate.  I also thought it would be above knee length, but it is more like mid-calf length on me.  I love how lightweight the fabric is, but it is fairly see through as well.  Lastly, I'm a size 16/18 (received a XXL in this dress), and it fits everywhere in the waist and hips well, but the bust is pretty tight.  Inbetween the buttons gaps, and I will have to wear a cami with it."
3.0,Disappointed with the actual color versus how it looks in the pictures.  I ordered the Oatmeal Heather and received a hoodie that looks way more like Ash Heather.  The hoodie is true to size and is comfortable though.
3.0,"They fit exactly; however, they don't ever stay in place. I have to be careful that they don't fall off, as they don't stick in place.<br /><br />Other than that, they're well made and are an exact fit for my glasses."
3.0,Haven't worn it out as yet and might have to add a under shirt because I have D size boobs that'll be too sexy to wear out
3.0,"I do not have big ankles by any means, nor do I retain water, but these are too tight at the top and leave a mark. Otherwise, they are really good socks, nice thickness, nice on warmth. My ankles are 8.75 inches at the top of these sox."
3.0,This pendant is very pretty but it is big. It would be perfect if it was a little smaller
3.0,I thought this was cotton but it's a light weight nylon.  It's very pretty but dressier than I wanted.
3.0,Very durable quite heavy looks as pictured but if you dont have a silver or rose gold face I dont recommend purchasing. I was going to change the face by placing a casing over it and it didnt look any better now I'm stuck with both bands and I dont like either of them.
3.0,"Fit much smaller than expected. More of a clingy type material, not cotton. It is well made and heavier material, so there is no need for an undershirt in my opinion! I got the 2x, and normally wear that or an XL. It just was tight in the bust and arms and a bit too clingy in the tummy area. The lace on the back is put on nicely, I do not see it coming off easily. My shirt came with a tag with washing instructions, which was rather nice. I am not super upset about this, I was able to gift it to someone else. I do think the photos however are a tiny bit misleading."
3.0,It's smaller than what I would've thought. Maybe I should have read the dimensions. Otherwise it seems like a pretty good bag. I'm a little concerned about the zippers though...
3.0,"Great product for price. It does tarnish after a while, but hey, it was cheap."
3.0,Pros: Made out of great material! The v-cut in the front isn’t too much. The color is perfectly royal blue! The slots in the legs are beautiful!<br /><br />Cons: I got a small and I’m 5’ 2” and 120 pounds. I had to get the legs shortened because they were too long even in heels. The bust was also too big even with a bra on.
3.0,"I like how easy they are to put on I hate that they shed, yes the inside fur or what ever it is shed like crazy. I order in gray, black and brown."
3.0,Returned to big
3.0,"Very pretty and good quality, but the middle stone was broken off."
3.0,Cheap but they work great so far.
3.0,Nothing special and needs to be on sale.
3.0,First time I put them on the chain broke off of the other ring.:( Definitely not worth 8-9 dollars. And the metal looked rusted when I finally got them.
3.0,"Nice looking ring but not true to size, I'm a size 6, have been my whole life so I bought it in a 6 and it was too small.  But overall it was gorgeous."
3.0,"The item is what I expected. But the price is 2x or 3x what other cotton bandanas sell for on Amazon.<br />I chose Rothco's product because of their support of our military services. I figure a few extra bucks is worth supporting US companies.<br /><br />I was hugely disappointed to find the product is a run-of-the-mill Chinese made hanky, after all the crap China does to this country. If I wanted to support China, I could have saved money and bought much cheaper bandanas on Amazon which are just as good."
3.0,Not strong for daily use
3.0,Smaller than expected but looks as cool as in the photos.  But quickly degenerates to fuzzies and has a very short life looking like new.
3.0,"I haven't worn it out yet , but I spent an hour ironing it. Also it has alot of loose threads."
3.0,Pins were nice but received 2 sets of the the same 3 pins!
3.0,I’m 5’2 and wanted an oversized fit so I got a 6. It’s comically long and the “hip flare” is nowhere near my hips. Returning
3.0,"This hat is kind of small, I ended up giving it to my 11 year old nephew because it didn't fit me that well, it looks great on him though!"
3.0,Very cheaply made. Sorry I didn't return it
3.0,"Pink was way brighter than the picture,  almost too girly.<br />I returned it."
3.0,"This bag is totally fine as a shopping bag or book bag, but don't be thinking about using it as a purse.  There's absolutely no styling to the bag - it gives new definition to the word basic.  I have serious doubts as to the zipper as it looks like it is already about to come unstitched.  The fabric is thin, although I do love the corduroy!  Just okay, it comes folded into a very small flat square and has a strange odor that went away after a couple of days airing out.  At the current price point, I can't say I would recommend it."
3.0,I read all of the reviews before purchasing this dress. I really wanted to love it...however it’s not the right fit for my body. I’m 5’11 and have a long torso. This fit more like an empire waist than true waist on me. The material was also not entirely what I was expecting from how it looked in other people’s photos. I usually wear a size twelve and ordered the XL.
3.0,"It looks nice! But it runs too fast, I don't know what to do with that, faster an hour per week. I like to make adjustment by myself, if anyone knows what kind of tool to open the back cap? I amended my review as one star because it runs so fast but 5 stars for its appearance and luxury look, so I changed the rating to 3 stars as overall."
3.0,This bag is very pretty in person. I haven't used it yet so I don't know how well it will wear. But I did observe that the handles are a little thin. I may replace them because I like the bag.
3.0,"It is difficult to really give an accurate review of these sunglasses. The product materials used are very good and the glasses are comfortable.<br />The issue I am having is if the product really helps me see clearer at night.<br />I've read some articles that say yellow or any tinted sunglasses do not improve night vision.<br />So, I will continue my own testing. But the sunglasses themselves are very good quality."
3.0,"I was hoping to get a lightweight summer skirt, but this one is as thick as denim & stretchy. It doesn’t have the kind if fit shown on picture. It just stetches tight around your legs. It doesn’t flie. Looks cheap."
3.0,The Item was at least two sizes smaller than expected from size chart; I am  ~1.7 meters tall and of slim build. The material however was very comfortable.
3.0,"I ordered the black and fuchsia dress in size 3X. I usually wear a 2X, but was worried it would run too small. I am 4 ft 10 and 280 lbs. It fit me like a glove. It was tighter than I had hoped, especially since I ordered one size larger, and the material is really see-through. I could read the Amazon reviews for this dress THROUGH the dress. Literally. The Fuchsia, which looks purple in the picture, is more like hot pink.<br /><br />I live in Florida and it was comfy and breezy while it was over 80 degrees with 90% humidity. So plus for the dress. Tighter than I normally am comfortable with, but I still wear it. So comfy!"
3.0,Too short of a chain for style
3.0,"The cover photo gives the impression the handband is gold. The color in real life is no where near the color in photos. In real life, headband is a very muted champagne color. Pleased with the quality of the product but I bought item wanting a gold headband. Color isn’t overly flatting and doesn’t pop well when worn."
3.0,Nice gloves.  But the little leather buckles came undone.
3.0,Didn’t look good in me
3.0,Want charge really was looking forward to this
3.0,They shrink a lot
3.0,"Size runs a bit small.  I am a large and these were closer to a medium.  After the first washing, 3 of the boxers have fallen apart with the stitching coming out and are not wearable.  There is a tag on the inside of the waistband that will scratch you and irritate you back to no end.  Otherwise they are comfortable.  We will see how they hold up after a few washings."
3.0,"Side button does not stay closed, leaving interior contents exposed. For someone traveling through NYC via mass transit, its not a bag you would want to store your valuables in and wearing as a messenger on your back. Cannot be used for intended purpose. Also, there are frayed pieces of thread that diminish the finish of the bag. I loved the blue color, though! I returned the bag."
3.0,I ordered my usual bra size and it was way too small and ill fitting.
3.0,It was perfect price. I love the fabric. But a kittle priced compared to the previous one I bought.
3.0,Un poco pesado el diseño muy bonito pero para usar un poco de tiempo nada mad
3.0,"Style was nice, poor quality"
3.0,Not the color in the picture! I got the red one for my job at ruby Tuesday and it is actually some weird shade of pink
3.0,The neck lining of this shirt fit very weirdly on me. It was very wide and I could not adjust it to feel better. I wear a lot of t shirts from target and Walmart that are stretchable and adjustable so that might be why I didn’t like this purchase at all. Overall a super cute shirt.
3.0,Not the typical great Adidas quality. After first wash collar does not lie flat and looks bad.
3.0,Wish you were a little bit longer in the front comfortable but I needed a test to be a little bit longer in the front love the color we'll probably purchase it again in a different color
3.0,Not a great material
3.0,Definitely a size difference from one company to the next - will definitely go a size smaller next time
3.0,Love the way these look on! Very stylish. Frames feel a little flimsy and the lenses have this weird iridescent sheen to them that make them look fake.
3.0,"Pretty. But too heavy and bigger than I thought. They’d be perfect if they were hollow, lighter weight and a bit smaller."
3.0,This keychain clip is cute but it is really small. I actually like the size except that the picture is a bit blurry.
3.0,"Ok so it looks cute in the picture of the item description, but when I received it , it was totally not like it was advertised. It looked frumpy and poorly made. It had no tapering in at the waist it was just like someone had sewn a big square of fabric together and thrown on some accent pieces. So needless to say I did not wear this on Halloween this year and I’m taking it completely apart and redoing the outfit all together. I will make it look better than what was advertised and DEFINITELY better than what I received. So unhappy"
3.0,"Cute hoodie but no thickness or warmth to it at all. Was under the impression it'd be more of a jacket. Thermal type, waffle patterned material. Great for layering."
3.0,"Returned, too small.<br />If they had the next size up available, I would have gotten it."
3.0,The size and color are great but it makes my neck itch because even though it is soft - it is scratchy.
3.0,For the price I was happy. But after 2x in the wash the strap came unraveled. The skirt is wonderful. Both fit my 2.5 year old well. Unfortunately don't think the leotard will last through the end of this season.
3.0,Very sharp-looking ring only problem is is wider than the finger is so while wearing it it catches on everything the Batman symbol is not really proportional could be narrower close to the width of the finger and be the same Heights and then look really hot
3.0,"Ordered a small but get XL. Soft, comfy fabric. So I keep it"
3.0,Very cute glasses but when I went to put them the side part snapped off :( not great quality
3.0,"The product' logo of Serpent on the back of the leather jacket is a sticker, not sewed in. The product is not true to size. Check size charts before buying; the item runs on a petite size chart."
3.0,"After a couple days it stopped but it turned out that the internal assembly was partially unscrewed and when I tightened it, all was well.  Now a month later a plastic rim in the assembly broke so I will need a replacement part.  I advise getting the extended warranty.  It works great when it is not broken.  I have a backup so there is no problem with a little down time but if it is your only cleaner,  I am not sure about long term reliability."
3.0,Delivery was too long and untraceable.<br />That’s worried me.<br />Chain and necklace is fine.
3.0,This is a cute necklace but parts of it look like a very cheap metal and it just doesn't seem to hang right. The longest strand I would think would hang in the middle is like it's several links too far to one side making the whole necklace look lopsided. I plan to see if I can pry it off with some pliers and place it somewhere more centered. Other than that I do like it.
3.0,"I really like the fit, print and fabric of these leggings when they arrived.  They were more substantial than my thinner leggings from Maurices, but not quite as soft.  Sadly, the pattern was faded terribly after about 5 washes in cold.  They got torn when my neighbor's dig ran into me a with a big stick.  I was surprised how easily they tore, but since they had faded so quickly, I will not replace them."
3.0,"If you like wrinkly shorts these are for you. Very lightweight, fit OK,  but not my style. Sending them back."
3.0,"Fits decent, fabric feels nice. Color runs. The white stripe is bluish after washing. Says you have to hang dry as well, annoying. Do like the large pocket. Phone fits well"
3.0,These are cute and well made. One pair is bigger than the other and fall off a lot.
3.0,Good quality and comfort; but too small
3.0,Cute shoes but they run small and a little narrow
3.0,It is tight in the chest area not very flexible. I weight 157
3.0,Runs so big order a size down but super cute.
3.0,"cute boho dress, may not fit well if chest is large"
3.0,"The dress is beautiful but awkward. My daughter is usually a 4t, I ordered a size 4 at first, which was too big. I returned for a size 3 but her little boobies were still out (even though the dress part looked too small for her). I think the straps need to be made somewhat smaller for a well fit. My daughter is tall for her age too."
3.0,TOO SMALL...
3.0,"The white shirts fit perfectly are form fitting yet loose, whereas the black ones flair out around the stomach like a dress. Ended up keeping them cause I was too lazy to send back, but be forewarned fit isn't great on black shirts. I am 6'2"" and got the XXLs"
3.0,"Bought these awhile ago. Hard plastic which isn't a surprise but is still nice. The metal spikes came loosened and many broke through the hard plastic over the years. I came to notice that the middle most spike had never been included and I'm fairly glad it was the only one. Pretty dangerous weapon when it comes to it one punch with these covering the knuckles and someone's eye is getting poked out, but they'd most likely break so, do with that what you will.<br />They're pretty stylish and can definitely satisfy anyone wanting to make a fashion statement.<br />Overall, pretty nice product, would buy again if I wasn't afraid of recieveing a few missing spikes. First it's one, but then if it's two Im going to go crazy. Especially if it's unsymmetrical."
3.0,"This is SO sexy... unfortunately it would probably only fit my 10 year old niece... .and she is certainly not wearing this. As cheap as it was, I had to give it a try. Shipping was much faster than expected. The material was of great quality too. I have it hanging in the closet as a &#34;Maybe one day...&#34; piece. The laugh I got when I tried it on was completely worth the price of the item."
3.0,"The size is definitely closer to the 6M mark. I bought another Carter's sleeping bag that is sized as 6-9M (versus 0-9M), and it is MUCH larger than this one."
3.0,IT WAS GOOD
3.0,"The quality was good. Nice material, soft."
3.0,ordered a medium and im 5'2&#34;.  torso was a little short making it a bit uncomfortable.  tight fit
3.0,"I really liked it! But I bought it 7 weeks ago and it already broke right next to the hook and I can’t fix it. It is past the return window, but I would love to send it back and get one that isn’t broken."
3.0,This is a cute dress but it is small. I wear a medium- large in dresses so I ordered a large in this one just in case. I should have ordered an x-large! The back end is see through as well (which I knew) but the piece that covers my butt is nothing. You can see my whole butt because it is shorter and such a thin fabric.
3.0,Waistline too low.
3.0,"I love the shoe as a whole, but they rub the top of my feet. Have not worn them anywhere except to just try on when I received them. I’m not one to return things I usually donate. And that’s what I will be doing."
3.0,I didn't like that it came all rolled up in a bag. It has dents in it now that don't look very good. Hopefully over time they go away.
3.0,I was soooo disappointed that the sleeves fit a bit tight but also they weren’t stitched together (probably to fit better) but they started to unravel before I was even able to wear it.<br />Otherwise the dress was amazing!! So beautiful and comfy
3.0,Smaller than expected  material is cheap
3.0,"The quality was great, love the idea you made it into a kneclace. The only thing it was to small. Gave to my daughter who is 10x smaller than me , barely fit around kneck and definitely couldn’t fit around a collared shirt, which it’s made for."
3.0,It has a very unique display and the rose gold tone is rather cool. Good price came in quick.<br /><br />I would not recommend this though it is very cheap feeling ( GET A STAINLESS STEEL WATCH their much nicer and durable ) This was very hard to size considering noone wanted to size it for me cause it was difficult. Much like plastic. Feels like it could break but who knows.<br /><br />To be honest though its one of the nicest looking watches I own because of the moon and the sun on the side but i would still get this just cause its nice but seriously look into some Stainless steel watches or some hi g else before buying from this brand.
3.0,"The shirt was very cute, but it ran pretty small, and after one wash barely fit my daughter."
3.0,"It fits a little oddly. I don't have broad shoulders, but I feel like I'm stretching the neckline with my shoulders. And it's way too long for me (I'm 5'2&#34;)."
3.0,They’re good they work perfect
3.0,Adorable buy they pop off and you loose them quickly
3.0,Just wasn't what I was looking for so I returned it. I am also 5ft 2in and it was too long for me.
3.0,"Cute, fits like expected but where my boots were rubbing on my pants little ball of fuz were their. Also they aren't spandex. They are fitted but not spendex."
3.0,Crown and the panels dont seem to have much rigidness to them. This translates to the hat having creases and sitting unevenly on your head. Maybe I just had a weird shaped head
3.0,Online sizing incorrect. Run small in arm length
3.0,"They are comfortable. I do wear them often but I thought they would be more supportive, and body shaping. But No. Not at all."
3.0,"While these do work to hold your bra straps in position, they are hard (impossible) to put on without help. They attach to the bra straps easy enough, but when you turn your bra around to slide your straps up your arms, they fall off. I had to get my husband to attach them after I put my bra on."
3.0,"These are super comfortable but most of them are getting holes after 5-6 laundry cycles. Sorry, but I don't want to buy new socks every two months, not for me."
3.0,"Band under bust is extreamly tight with no give, almost by 2 sizes, but adorable looking."
3.0,Not what I was looking for was only one sided returned
3.0,Really small for a medium. Extremely thong like but that's shown in the picture. Super cute decent quality but order bigger!
3.0,Ear bands are too short.
3.0,"Super soft and comfy. One drawback, they're see through. I wasn't expecting that."
3.0,Bought to wear on vacations so I could leave my real diamonds home. Looks OK. Buy 1 size bigger runs small
3.0,Would suggest wearing with a belt. Just kind of hangs and makes you look wide.
3.0,good for the prize
3.0,Extra tight
3.0,Does the job.  Can be difficult on very tight case backs.
3.0,When I first received the necklace it seemed to be ok but it's changed to an odd yellowish color.
3.0,It's a cute dress but the pockets are awkwardly up on the rib area and can't really hold anything. I've worn it publicly once and now it is a house dress. A few adjustments in the shop and this can be a beautiful piece. I'm 5'4/205 and I ordered an XL.
3.0,It fits very strange and you can't mold it to fit your head. Pretty color
3.0,Cleans lenses good !
3.0,"Far too much back glare!  They were stylish, but I couldn’t deal with the glare from behind. Very easy return so I give them kudos for that."
3.0,I recommend to buy one size bigger. The material iand the color are fine
3.0,Don't like material!
3.0,Overall small. I usually go with and xl for busy and hip space. The largest size of this it just too tight for sleep comfort and too short to be a dress.
3.0,Aqua Blue seemed to be darker and of poor quality compared to rest of the pendent.
3.0,look good but it's a cheap material fits loose
3.0,This shirt is ok.  Does not launder great and does shrink if you dry in dryer.  The pockets are nice but they are not deep and often will “pop out” and hand outside the shirt.  Works for around the house chores but after a few washings I could not wear this shirt out in public
3.0,No wristlets strap
3.0,Hard to attach but once done it is as expected.
3.0,hard to put on each toe
3.0,"Its a normal, comfortable sweatshirt, but it definitely does not match the color shown. It is bubblegum pink, not neon pink."
3.0,I got a medium. The size was great but it is NOT the length they show in the picture whatsoever. Its short. Where she has it tucked it is like the actual length. The material is very sheer and a weird silk like fabric. Honestly not worth $16. Maybe $8.
3.0,very nice and soft. But the seam in one of the shoe is already ripping apart. this should not be the case for a shoe that is not used daily not is it used roughly.
3.0,Really REALLY small - gave it to my 33 year old daughter! She loves it. For the price - why bother to send it back?
3.0,"Does not look like pictured.  Small, no silver, just gold tone."
3.0,"Strange sizing 5-X = 16-18. The halter straps are not supportive for full-figured women. It was cute, though; just cut small."
3.0,I would had given five; but the problem is the bead strands are not right and looked tangled instead of uniform. The beads are beautiful; and the design.  Not happy with the assembling.
3.0,Thinner material than I expected and a bit smaller in size. If buying again I would go up one size.
3.0,Nice colors but way too long and too small across chest
3.0,"Sorry didn't like them, not what I expected. And they were to Big and thats because I ordered a Small. The leopard print patches in the jeans were stitched on Horrible and loose.  AND It was satin material...Yuck!!!"
3.0,It's not cotton like described. Looks wrinkly.
3.0,I like the way it looked but unfortunately it was to small but still a very beautiful shirt.
3.0,The dress was nice and well made but if you have a little thickness in your arm then the lace sleeves suck. I can't really wear it and I got an XL. Pretty sad about it.
3.0,Slides up out of pants but decent
3.0,"I thought I had ordered the purple one, but got the white with black stripes. I love the dress. It's flows and it's comfy and it will really be a nice change from my usual big t's and shorts...I would recommend this but I would recommend that you  make sure you're getting the color you want. That could have been my mistake when I ordered it, but I really did expect to open the package to a purple stripe dress. It did arrive early, so that was a  plus. 3 stars had it been the purple one."
3.0,"Bummed because this is a very cute dress, but the top button will not stay no matter what I do about it, and I don't have a big chest or anything, it's just flimsy. Otherwise it's DECENT quality and the rest of the buttons stay, but because of that top one I can't really wear it unless I decide to make some other alterations to it myself."
3.0,"I bought this nightgown on March 14, 2019 and today is April 2, 2019.<br /><br />The nightgown overall is the MOST comfortable (fit/flow flattering) and is EXTREMELY soft. Purchased for hot flashes/menopause and is great at controlling/adjusting to body temperature. BUT after 2 washes, stitches are already coming apart  - even while following care instructions (above left breast stitch-line).  I am VERY sad about this as this nightgown cost $70.  Super sad and disappointed! :("
3.0,The pendant is much smaller than I thought it  would be and I am returning it.
3.0,Couldn't see the sparkles in these but otherwise great
3.0,would not fit on my head correctly no matter what i did slipped down or off
3.0,Belts are well made. but the reason for the 3 stars is the sizes. If you need adjusting there is not much room for up or down to tighten or loosen it. The catches work well but very limited.  my suggestion.. make your size the middle of the chart so if it says 30-40 it will not go any lower than 30 that is it and it will not go any higher than 40.
3.0,These are really cute earrings.  They are heavier and longer than I thought they would be and from what I normally wear but I really loved them.  I wear them at work and just when I am out and about and have gotten a lot of compliments.
3.0,"Belt was very comfortable, did stretch a few inches, but after 6 1/2 months the metal tongue that goes through the belt fell off."
3.0,Will work for a while but I thought Champion made a much better quality shoe than was done so with this pair. The bottom arch part of the shoe is good quality but the top is thin and it appears to be plastic like where the shoe laces are threaded. I like to buy shoes that will last the entire school year and these will not last that long.
3.0,fit as describe
3.0,Bottoms didn't remotely fit but I love the top! Is there anyway I can get a different size bottom but keep this size top?
3.0,Can't really rate them as they are too small to wear.
3.0,"Feels cheaper than expected. Strands have also started to appear on the sides (like it's falling apart). Also, two of three spring bars that it came with have already popped off. Randomly leaving my watch hanging out. It's scary and a little embarrassing."
3.0,Cute but they don’t stay up well if they are comfortable but they will stay if they are painfully tight.
3.0,This is a super cute dress but it does run small.  Buy a size or two larger than you would normally buy.
3.0,"They aren't the best quality, tend to grab every skin defect as you pull them on. They look nice. No grabby stuff at the top of the stocking so you need a garter."
3.0,"I had to return this dress because the red collar was really large / wide. I am a professional woman but this made me look like I was trying to re-live my 20's. Cute, just the wrong style for me."
3.0,"I received my purse today and am torn! Here are some clarifying need-to-knows for you:<br /><br />1. It feels heavenly and is very well made. It isn’t real leather, but it’s super high quality feeling!<br /><br />2. It is NOT white. It is light grey on one side and a lighter grey/beige on the other side. The handle is black on one side and a lovely brown on the other.<br /><br />3. The insert DOES NOT attach to the bag in anyway, but it DOES have organizational pockets! (One zippered and two open.)<br /><br />4. It is not nearly as big as I thought it was going to be. People have talked about getting it to put their laptops in? I wouldn’t think that could happen with this bag.<br /><br />If this bag were truly white and a smidge bigger, I would absolutely give it five stars! However, since I even asked the company about the color, I can only give it three. I haven’t decided if I am keeping it or not.<br /><br />(One photo has my current white bag next to this one, so you can clearly see the color diffeeence.)"
3.0,Bought for my mom who wears a size 4. Very tight
3.0,Be careful if you have thin ears the stem is very long
3.0,Too small. Should have had an actual sizing picture.
3.0,"I thought it would look like the picture, like a stone, but it’s just plain purple. The plus side is that it came with another earring as a gift."
3.0,Loved it but they fall off and break way to easy.
3.0,Box was broken
3.0,Too small. See through also...maybe because they are too small lol! Size up like 3 sizes!
3.0,I like the shoes and the fit.  It would be a little better if they had some for of cushion inside of the shoes for support.  I had to go out and buy some
3.0,"It's cute, but I went to a concert the other day, and it turned my neck green. My advice, don't wear it when it could get wet or sweaty, which kinda stinks because I live in Austin, TX and its always humid here!"
3.0,"Shirt looks great, but runs small.  Order one size up."
3.0,This was way too small !!! They fit my 13 year old that's a size 2 ..
3.0,"I had to actually cut the ties off this dress. After tying them they hung almost to the floor, they were so long. I bought it for Christmas Eve, so had to scramble and add another belt to the outfit once I cut the ties off. I am 5 foot four 138 pounds, but the medium, and it fits perfectly."
3.0,They didn't come up as high as they do on this picture.
3.0,Purchased because they have adjustable shoulder straps. The do but the straps are thin and also very stretchy so adjusting them doesn't really do anything to put up the girls. These are called &#34;sports bras&#34; I got them for wearing around the house  but  they are not supportive and would be useless for any activity more strenuous than walking to the mail box to get your mail. The fabric and design  are nice bad so are the colors but the removal modesty pads are quite thin and they are hard to put back into the bra after washing.
3.0,I need to return this bra as it is too small.  May I exchange it for a XXlarge.  Misunderstood size chart.  I have copd and it needs to be larger in circumference otherwise I think it will work very well.
3.0,Should really have a size. Does not fit my 5yr old
3.0,looks better than they fit
3.0,Hurt your ears after a few hours. :( Great backs though!
3.0,they look nicer than they really are. But it is good that they have a velcro strap
3.0,"From the thighs down, these are great, but the waist goes so high they could almost be a unitard! The fabric is almost like tights on the inside, fairly thick, but the outside is smooth and the image is well done. If the high waist was going to bother you, I would recommend against these. The girl I gave them too is extremely flexible and just scrunches them down a little and wears them with hip-length tops so it isn't an issue for her."
3.0,"i thought the nails beds were actually like nails, they were like stumps and you insert a nail. i found a way to hold the nailts in place, but other than that, they were ok"
3.0,"The dress is cute and comfy, but I wish I had bought a medium. I normally wear sizes between 4-8."
3.0,There was no complementary gift box as advertised therefore I am disappointed. The quality of the jade and sliver seems OK
3.0,"This watch was perfectly serviceable for the first few months. I've had it since October, but less than 5 months in and the date has stopped working. It was OK. I'm going back to timex though."
3.0,"I was looking for a waterproof jacket with removable liner and the MOUNTEC 3in1 Men’s Waterproof Outdoor Jacket with Removable Quilted Inner Coat seemed to be exactly what I wanted. It is a lot of jacket for the money but quality is a mixed bag. First the good parts, and there is a lot to like about this jacket. It is very warm and provides good rain protection. I have warn it on cold, rainy, windy days, and it keeps warmth in and wind and rain out. It is an excellent buy for the cost when compared against similar products at Amazon.<br />There are a some aspects of the jacket that are irritating. I would echo a frequent comment in reviews that the jacket is sized too small. I ordered a large, and it feels like a medium. Order at least one size larger than you need. Some parts of the jacket are flimsy, probably due to cost cutting. The straps that attach the liner (which is very warm) pulled out of the sleeves the first time I took the coat off. If it had not been so snug due to the sizing I mentioned earlier, the straps might have lasted longer. The flimsy straps plus the small sizing made the liner pull the straps right out of the sleeve when I removed the jacket. It wasn't enough of a bother to make me send the jacket back. I just wish the straps were sturdier.<br />The zipper is puzzling. All men's coats I have ever owned have the zipper slider on the right side. This one has it on the left, probably just something the manufacturer wasn't aware of. The jacket is made in China. The zipper slider is in 2 parts both of which slide up and down the zipper. Again every other zippered coast I have owned has the bottom base attached to the zipper; it doesn't slide as this one does. I puzzled over the design for days trying to figure what it was supposed to accomplish. The zipper won't close unless the bottom slider is all the way at the bottom of the zipper. The unattached design made it more difficult to zip up the jacket. Finally I gave up trying to figure it out and, superglued the bottom slider in place at the base of the zipper. It zips shut normally now.<br />So with these caveats, the MOUNTEC Outdoor Jacket will keep you warm and dry on cold and wet days, but buy a bigger size than you need, be prepared for the liner attachments to pull out, and unless you are much smarter than I am, save yourself some frustration and glue the bottom slider in place."
3.0,These are smaller than I expected and the frame is kind of stiff. I would have sent them back but they weren't eligible for returns so I had to keep them.
3.0,"Purchased this for my cartilage piercing and I loved it. Sparkly and the perfect size. Unfortunately, I had to take it out after about 3 weeks. In my opinion, the ball seemed too small and it started to go through the hole. Very painful."
3.0,Shirt was adorable. However- I ordered two sizes larger and it still did not fit
3.0,"Very basic Festina watch. This brand is not very popular in the USA, although is well known Spanish brand known for its long standing support of cycling sport (somewhat controversial lately). Band is very comfortable. For those who are looking for their first Festina - suggest to get a larger sport watch. Overall, was a bit disappointed, since I have few Festinas. As brand - highly recommended, especially for a very reasonable price for quality of watches."
3.0,Way small had to cut the ear straps and add my own elastic.<br />this is not adult sizes that's false advertisement.<br />the picture is beautiful the materials nice it's actually like Silk almost just very small
3.0,"I liked the shirt much better in the picture, however its not horrible.  The buttons make the shirt look cheap and juvenile.  I do not like that.  The fit is perfect and the lace sleeves are nice.  Its really unfortunate about the buttons because they really &#34;dumb down&#34; the shirt.  I will probably change the buttons out for some black ones, or solid gold ones."
3.0,"I’m 5’5 and purchased a large. The neckline covers well and the straps just quite a lot, length is nice and I don’t trip on it going up stairs. I like the dress quite a lot. The one thing that’s kinda a bummer is that I purchase the same dress same style same size one in dark red and deep blue and they are different fabrics. The red is quite a bit heavier then the blue. And the blue is slightly see though so wearing it out and about probably would be a bit more scandalous then I am comfortable with. But as a nightgown or swimsuit cover would work fine."
3.0,the seams are weak around the straps
3.0,I'm still gonna wear it but it fits like it is plus size. I'm skinny and it's not for skinny girls
3.0,It does not look as pictured - I mean the color and size.  But it is pretty to display.
3.0,"i ordered the largest size because i am a size 16/18 in womens and the biggest possible size fits like a 10/12 so if you are an XL in mens or bigger than a size 10/12 in womens dont bother,it will not fit, gave it to my friend that wears a medium in mens and it fits perfectly."
3.0,"since this is a slip on, it should have more spandex"
3.0,Fit great good quality
3.0,"The are ok. Way less shine than pic, but ok. The only thing is they are way to close for anyone’s earlobe to go through."
3.0,Quality was okay. The fit was too big on my waist. Gave it to a friend. Im 5'6 120lbs
3.0,"i love the fact that this dress has a little sash to cover my belly because that is one of my biggest insecurities. it also fits extremely well in the chest area (i wear a size 38H bra). however, the bottom of the dress is shaped weirdly. i dont know if it’s because i got the wrong size in the dress or it is just the design, but it looks like someone took a very long tshirt and just cut the bottom of it off to make a dress. it also hangs off my body oddly on the bottom too. will be returning"
3.0,Silver faded real fast
3.0,I thought the product was okay. It fit pretty well but I wasn’t in love with the material.
3.0,This shirt was very tight for an xl. The material is like a netting. However breathable but not soft and does rub the skin. My chest size is 47
3.0,Am the green is beautiful color - it’s super soft & light weight (thin) - if your big chested like me good luck hope you have some great boob tape to hold ‘em up &  if you do share the link please 🙏😂<br /><br />So I don’t know if it was just my dress that was  stitched wrong or what but the creases in the front definitely are stitched weird - ( see yellow circles) they go opposite directions making my stomach area look weird - the. Belt hells a little bit only if u continuously oar attention & keep rearranging h it - irritating - Isag on the side that’s already low cut - see yellow circle in pic  - not attractive r- think I’ll return and try again & hope maybe I just got a defective one  - wish me luck 🍀
3.0,I can't post the pic idk why but they key is rusty and looks like it was worn and the color rubbed off doesn't look like the rest of them. It's cute but I was expecting it all to be good bc it's a gift for my mom now idk if I'll give it to her.
3.0,Love everything except it fits tighter then my son likes it hes 11 and al large shirts usually fit him maybe I'll order the bigger size if available
3.0,"Material is polyester & spandex, a very &#34;limp&#34; fabric. Good for a &#34;cover up&#34; over a bathing suit or such..."
3.0,2 hours battery 👎
3.0,Does not hang properly.  I kept adjusting it on my body because the neck is too big.
3.0,"Unfortunately, the dress that arrived didn't look like the dress in the picture.  First of all, the fabric was completely sheer, necessitating wearing something underneath it. Since I was looking for a summer dress, this does not work for me. Also, the sleeves were long sleeves (or maybe 3/4 on a not so short person) when the picture has short sleeves. And one more thing...the belt did not come with the dress, and the dress has a triple elasticized waistband which is truly unattractive. I still do like the pattern of the fabric, and since it's a type of polyester chiffon, it flows nicely. I actually like the dress, even though I'm going to have to find my own belt and have it altered. And I more than likely won't find anything to wear underneath it until fall rolls around and I can wear leggings underneath it.  I am a bit disappointed, because this dress was not what I expected. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and unbiased review. All opinions are solely my own and I have no relationship  with either the manufacturer or the distributor"
3.0,"I bought this as a teacher gift for my sons preschool teacher. It came on time and is very pretty, however the picture shows the apple has little white stones. My necklace was just all silver. Still very pretty but not as advertised."
3.0,"I am a 36DD... I got the large and it worked but they were really small. I would've preferred a bit of a larger cup. I was at a wedding and it was about 80 degrees out. After about 30 min of light sweating, they no longer stuck to me."
3.0,i enjoy the color selection and the good quality but they are on the large side.<br />my mom is a size 7 and im a size 11/12 and we spend a lot of time pulling them up<br />because of the free size which makes this purchase not a good fit.
3.0,Like them but larger than they appear. Would be good to show pic with them on a person
3.0,Nice simple but elegant watch. exactly as shown in the picture. great purchase. highly recommend<br /><br />I have to update this review and grade from 5 star to 3 star. At first the watch was everything it said it would be but when I went to wear the watch for the first time the strap was undone. It was just glued around the pin and hence didn't last. I have to spend extra money now to have the strap fixed and the other strap reinforce. I am not pleased. Would not recommend
3.0,Seems well made. But it's rather larger and thick. Even straight form the package before anything was put in it. It was returned do to its size. But again. It was well made. 3 stars only as a neutral vote.
3.0,Large but not what I expected
3.0,My wife loved the style of the sweatshirt but she has worn it once and the fabric has already started to pill. Not sure what will happen when she wears it more. As of now she will only wear it around the house because of the pilling.<br />Very disappointed!!
3.0,Extra cute. Perfectly waterproof. Not well made. First wear one side of the belt came unsewed. Button came off in first wash.
3.0,Spider webs don’t look like webs at all. Headband is flimsy. Not sure I can even wear them without them falling off.
3.0,Great statement piece for the price.
3.0,If you like your sweaters none baggy the cl fit good . I prefer a little loose so I should of went up a size .<br />It is a very pretty sweater
3.0,"It’s a gorgeous piece, but it runs verrrry small. Because of the asymmetrical cut, it needs to fit just right and it was too small on me. I even sized up one and it wasn’t enough."
3.0,Buy a smaller size and also it's not made for shorter people.... brought it for my daughter who thought the top had the beaded portion on it... but it will be wore ONE DAY hopefully!
3.0,"I ordered these for my daughter for her Easter outfit, they are SO big!  I ordered the size that she measures as, they were too long in the foot and the straps were HUGE tightening the buckle to the smallest hole did nothing to help. She is heartbroken that I had to send them back :("
3.0,Although the bracelet is cute - it is actually two bracelets. I am disappointed that the charms are separated. Now I'm trying to figure how to take it apart so I can put everything onto one bracelet.
3.0,"I was a little disappointed in these leggings. I was excited to get a pair that had pockets on both sides, but they’re just not comfortable enough that I will wear them a lot. The pockets are deep, and I do love that. Deep enough to hold any phone out there. They’re a nice material and length. But they are tight!  I ordered the right size, but I really had to pull to get them up. They kind of wrinkle up on the back of the thighs like something died when it’s too small. And the description says high waisted but to me these are not high waisted. I have several pair of high waisted leggings that come to my belly button, and these do not. And not only that, they ROLL. The waistband rolls every time you sit down or bend over. I really wanted to love these, but they’re just not comfortable enough. These will probably make their way to the bottom of my drawer to wear when my favorite ones are dirty."
3.0,"It's ok..much longer than i expected, but nice design."
3.0,"Using these for bruise protection.  Unfortunately, they could be 2-3"" longer."
3.0,"Color and size are good, but it does not give, so it is tight around the middle."
3.0,"I’ve gotten a lot of these costume pajama things over the years, some of which are of better quality than others. I’d say that this is probably in the bottom half of what I have as many of the onesies I own are much nicer than this and were no more expensive, but I’ve seen plenty that were worse than this as well. The material is soft, but it’s also a little thin. There are pockets, but they are small. One of the more annoying this about this is that the pink color that’s on the front as well as the red from the coxcomb and tail actually transferred some of their color to some of the white, so there are several spots where there is pinkish staining. It’s not hugely noticeable, especially in dim light, but it is there. It’s OK. It works. But, it could be a little better as far as the quality goes, especially at around $29."
3.0,Beautiful product & shipping from China took a while but less than I figured. Only rating 3 stars cause the little strings are tied to the leather by little strings which already came loose after only wearing twice. Still love the bracelets though
3.0,"--If this review helped you, please click ""helpful""--<br /><br />This dress is super cute and would be flattering in the correct size but it runs WAY small! I am usually a size small. I read the reviews and people said it ran small so I ordered a medium. It is still so small and short. It's being returned and I'm still unsure of what size (if any) to buy next. Bummer!<br /><br />--For more Amazon reviews, follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram--"
3.0,"This is a really great tee.  It has seams at the shoulders that give it a fresh up style look.  The problem is the screen design.  The color hue is too close to the shirt color.  The font for the writing is too narrow.  You really have a hard time reading what it says.  I kept the shirt, but I wouldn’t have bought it in the store."
3.0,good but pockets are too small
3.0,Nice coat. Zipper sticks a little. Don’t know if it’s worth the price
3.0,Good 99.9%
3.0,Although you can do it yourself with a belt or pin it up
3.0,"I bought this just for the orange bikini top. Top fits fine but bottoms are huge.  Very, very thin material.  No lining, no padding sonthe nips will show.  But what do you  expect for $6..  it will<br />Serve what I bought it for.  The orange & white tie shirt is cute.  I’ll wear it with a white tank & shorts.<br />I bought a large so the bikini top  will cover the girls but needed a small bottoms ."
3.0,These run small in my opinion. I bought these for my husband to sleep in. He likes them comfortable and baggy. They fit pretty straight up and down if you order by the measurements they provide. If he was wanting to wear them under some slim fit pants they would be perfect. For sleeping... Order 1 to 2 sizes larger. Closer to 2. The elastic is very smug.
3.0,"Cute baby legs but I didn't receive exactly what was listed. Overall I am happy with the leggings, they've held up well and would consider purchasing again. I just wish I got the items shown or was advised of the replacement"
3.0,Cute but runs on the smaller side.
3.0,"Nice sunglasses.  These are not polarized, even though there is an option of the same style with gray lenses that are polarized.  This was a little confusing to me as I ordered.  These are very pretty and light-weight.  I decided to keep them because I liked the style and fit."
3.0,"I'm 132lbs. B cup. 5'5. I wanted something fitting, it was a little loose. The fabric was fine for the price. I returned it."
3.0,Loved the material. Cute but runs small
3.0,"Very pretty and light nightgown. My only complaint is that it shows buttons down the nightgown and they are just for show, they do not unbutton. I’m a nursing mother and would have liked it to have this feature."
3.0,"They work good. kinda small in legnth, had to keep stretching them. I perfer the nike ones tho..."
3.0,"Design is cute on the model. However, it looked like a mom-to-be top on me! And I am a petite Asian woman. May be because the separating line was way up instead of on the stomach area.<br />Secondly, I am a size S, and I ordered S. But it was too loose for me. This added to the mom-to-be feel of the top!<br />Also, I felt the neck was too wide, may be because it was big for me.<br />I am returning the item.<br />Material - cottony with ribbed/twill kind of feel. Pretty thick so as to sit well, not transparent. The flowery print and sleeves are good.<br />Stitching - decent quality."
3.0,It is really cute and nice soft material but it is ultra short in the front
3.0,"Nice shirt, okay quality very costume feeling not a shirt to wear out but more for Halloween or costume party.  Sleeves are way too long about 6-8 inches too long so if you have to hem it, it takes away the effect of the bell sleeve."
3.0,"I was going to order a size larger, but read reviews that the fit was loose. So I ordered my regular size, medium, and was disappointed at how tightly it fit."
3.0,too thick for my climate.
3.0,I like the green one fits perfect. The black one must be a size smaller because it’s a lot shorter and a lot tighter other than that the product is not badp
3.0,"I love this shoe. I ordered a size up and it fits my foot perfectly. However, the ankle straps are too big for my tiny ankles. This is a problem I anticipate having with ankle straps but they generally work if there are enough holes to adjust them tighter. Just be prepared to add a hole and you’ll be okay."
3.0,"I love the blouse and the necklace is so pretty. However, I gave it 3 stars because there is no stitchin on the hem or the ends of the layers or sleeves. Weird. It doesn't look like it will unravel but it looks a little unfinished if you know what I mean. I got it to wear out because it looks so pretty and fits great but because of the unfinished look, I will wear around casually"
3.0,"ok but is too simple product, I dont liked."
3.0,It was just okay. A little too large.
3.0,"Love the fit of the bottoms and that the top has adjustable straps. However the top is too small, and the colors are not as described. It came as more navy than black."
3.0,They dont really stay stacked well if you're actually using your hands a lot.
3.0,"This item was somewhat misleading for me. I was aware of the size before I bought it, but it still feels a bit big (even for me, and I'm a big guy.) I'm very wary of wearing anything especially big because it feels like a cry for attention. This piece in particular has kind of a &#34;Hey! Look at ME!&#34; sort of vibe about its size. I would also like to have known that the back of this piece is totally flat. The picture makes it look much more rounded, as if it were the same shape on both sides. KemetArt should really have taken and posted pictures from more than one angle with this listing. If I had known it were flat-backed, I'd have bought something else (something decidedly less expensive.) I'm going to give this a few days. I may get used to it, but if not then I'm going to return it for a refund and buy another pendant.."
3.0,"Okay, nothing special.  I tried 38 c (one of the highest sizes available) which ended up being loose for someone who is normally a D size. Style wasn't anything great but a good price for what I got."
3.0,Shirt was too large!
3.0,"Not as see thru as expected, too wide for me."
3.0,This dress is comfortable and I love the flutter sleeves. I will say that the fabric seems to hold a ton of static though. I’ve tried several things to get rid of it but for a swing dress it gets annoying to feel like it’s “sticking” to me. I ordered a slip to wear underneath which does help but maybe not worth the “summer-y” feel to have to wear a second layer underneath.
3.0,"It looks just like the pictures, however the &#34;rose&#34; color faded after a day of wearing it. Now it's just gold colored"
3.0,"Product was different than expected, hard to tell by the photo how high the sock would actually be on your foot. Thought they would be more like the socks you can wear with dress shoes or heals. These could be worn with regular shoes tho."
3.0,They were a little bit small and tight. I will give them to a friend who likes them. No loss.
3.0,Ok.no too bad
3.0,Head circumference is too small for my head!  I had to give this hat away because it was too small.  I don't think I have that big of a head.... :(
3.0,Small and thin but wired for Halloween costume
3.0,"This ended up being a lot shorter on me than expected. The colors are too similar and it's hard to tell it's actually dinosaurs on the print. Fabric is stretchy and shiny. Cheap. However, return was quick and easy."
3.0,Wouldve five starreddddd this if the little buttons didn't rip off because of my big ass head lasted a month
3.0,"The product matches the dimensions in the description, but it doesn't look like this size is what is pictured. Too small to fit in a Daith piercing and fit correctly to where it lays flat. All I can really see this jewelry working for is for a helix piercing, and even then depending on personal anatomy and piercing placement there could still be too much ear cartilage in the way."
3.0,These didn't really fit very well for being one size fits all. They were too big for me and I'm a size 5 in US. They might have worked for their purpose if they had come in a smaller size.
3.0,"Works OK, line in the middle is distracting but can be ignored.  I wish the angle was adjustable. Works as expected and price is right."
3.0,My friend love them since they wouldn't fit me.
3.0,"I wanted a compression shirt to smooth out my body lines, but it does make for a nice undershirt"
3.0,"This is a bit shear first off. Which means don't wear it when it's cold. It also means wear a nude-ish color bra underneath or else every one will know what color you're wearing. It fits small so I ordered a larger size. But it's comfy, it's a great color and good for those like me who look good in earthly color tones.<br /><br />It has these weird flap things on the side but i dont' see how i'm gonna be able to raise up the sleaves.<br /><br />ALSO BE VERY CAREFUL WASHING THIS ITEM! machine wash cold and air dry for best results. other than that. I'm pairing it with a modern blazer and pants for a work office look paired with simply jewelery ."
3.0,Small and weird material not a classic tshirt
3.0,"Cute, but not made that well."
3.0,This one was not same texture as y previously purchased one.. too fuzzy to my liking snd not sure the description indicated such..
3.0,Hat is a much darker green color.
3.0,The watch is very pretty; however the battery was dead on arrival. I had to replace the battery which is the reason I gave 3 stars.<br />When you buy a new watch you don’t expect to have to pay to replace the battery when you open the box.
3.0,"pretty earrings but a little small for me to handle, especially the back"
3.0,The dress is more of an orange than red. Material is like a nightgown.  I am using this as lounge dress.
3.0,Fits a size too small. This XL fits more like a L.  I bought an XL (my usual size as I don’t prefer tight fitting shirts) and it fits very snug. I wish I would’ve ordered a XXL instead.  Which makes me sad because I was exited for the “Here comes the sun” logo and a new summer sleeveless shirt!
3.0,"This dress was very pretty and made from a nice, soft, flowy, material. It was definitely sized small so order a size or two up. My biggest disappoint was after washing. I washed this on delicate handwash cycle, it came out of the wash full of holes. I was really, really, sad. On a positive note, I was able to return the item for a refund."
3.0,Took a long time to ship but it's very well made and looks good
3.0,Battery life last for about an hour. Sound quality is very low. I bought two as stocking stuffers. Both my son's just wear them for the warmth
3.0,I so wish I could rate these better... they are so cute! The velcro just did not hold up for anything on the straps and my daughter is re-sticking it every 2 minutes to keep her shoes on. Such a bummer... she wanted them in multiple different colors but we will have to find a different brand that will hold up better.
3.0,Fits everything but looks cheap
3.0,"The material is pretty thick a light skin color, so it loses the illusion of being a real tattoo. I wasn't expecting to really fool anyone, but it would be nice if it was less obvious. If printed on a more &#34;nude&#34; stocking material they would be perfect. Packaged well, strong, fit large, I could pull over my leg and make tattoo ankle-to-thigh sleeves out of them."
3.0,Runs too small. Ordered  size M.  Very nice quality for the price. About two sizes too small. Too bad they dont make it in XL. Otherwise I would have purchased the XL.
3.0,"Great look soft and comfortable, but deff go a size up for what you normally wear. The crotch area is to small and almost gives you a front wedgie haha."
3.0,"these came in time in without damage and were a great shoe for the beach, but I had to glue down the straps with super glue because they fell apart at the velcro"
3.0,The color started to come off of the silver one within a few weeks. The other colors seem to be holding up fine. If I ordered again I would stick with just plain black.
3.0,Size was too small for me
3.0,"nice design, leather is a little waxy."
3.0,I love the design but my 4 month old was getting bad markings because the length of the band is too small. I ordered these because some of the reviews state that they leave no marking and are being used by children as young as 7 months. I sadly am sending these back as well as another set ordered from same seller. Very cute but could have used them when my baby was only a month or two.
3.0,"They say 3 is a Charm, it took 3 orders to actually get what I wanted/ordered!  However, I do like glasses!"
3.0,"Very comfortable material, length was perfect (I’m 5’3) however, it’s see through in the chest area."
3.0,"I don't know why, as a pear-shaped woman, that I bothered with a one-sized, two-piece suit. I am 5' 4&#34; and 138 lbs and the bottom was a little too tight and the cup size (I'm between an A and a B cup) on the top was huge on me. Going back! I'm so disappointed because it's a super cute suit."
3.0,"Loved the color and the quality of fabric, but they didn’t fit—too loose and baggy for workout clothes."
3.0,"Love it. Wear it casual or put a dressy tank under it to make it dressy. However, after wearing it for a handful of times, both sleeves are coming undone."
3.0,But they would hurt if u leave them in so I returned them
3.0,Print way to large—felt like a Halloween costume.
3.0,Is very thin for the price<br />It would look better if was a little heavier. Not what I expected but is beautiful and the color is exactly.
3.0,it great but it keep getting caught on on everything my carpet and my couch and a ball broke off it very cheap
3.0,I ordered a lot of dresses and this one didn’t work. It was way too short and tight.
3.0,"The charm is beautiful.  Both halves have Mother on one side and Daughter on the other, which I LOVE.  It's very pretty to start and looks just like the picture.  It's also a good size for the rest of my charms.<br /><br />There are a few flaws, however.  One such flaw is that it is VERY top-heavy.  The only way to wear it is upside down.  I'm thinking of getting one of the rubber spacer things to see if that will fit and make it stay upright.  Also, I ordered the dark red (garnet), but it looks like a slightly-off red.  It's super similar to the other red charms I have.  Finally, the gold coating has work off already.  I've had this charm for 4 days, and the only gold left is on the top and bottom of the body.  Perfect?  Certainly not.  Worth the price?  Yes.<br /><br />Edit: The silver coating is now wearing off as well.  It looks very cheap.  If you get this set, coat it with a clear nail polish first."
3.0,They slip on my feet all the time & are the right size
3.0,Cute but XL is like a U.S. Size 0
3.0,Loved the dress but the zipper ripped the first time wearing it. Very disappointed
3.0,"I like small jewelry and these are small to me. I like the design, but they are just overly small and thin. Think of these like the pictures on a cereal box (the ones that read, this photo has been magnified x times to show detail). Although I wasn't expecting these to be big at all, I was surprised at just how small and thin they are. I purchased when they were $11.99, and for this price, I will keep them, but I honestly don't think they are worth much more than that. Although I am not a jewelry expert, based on past purchases of similar items, I would value these at about $15."
3.0,"It's a beautiful dress but defiantly not flattering in any way if you're more than maybe a size 2. The straps are also very long and do nothing for support or anything. The slit is fun but don't go near wind or it's gonna be dangerous. The fabric becomes completely see through if it's tight at all also, especially in the breast area. I'm a 36C and let me tell you, everyone can see. Overall, not a good choice if you have any curve to your body at all."
3.0,"Fabric too thin, not plush as it appears."
3.0,"Material is easily wrinkled and when I ironed it, I had to iron it a number of times... almost sorry that I bought it because of that... Love the style and fit otherwise..."
3.0,"These shoes are really cute and I wanted them to fit, but sadly they are too narrow for me. I could barely get my foot in with no sock on. I could see where they might stretch a little over time, but not enough for me. I have a pair of Ahnu sports sandals that I love and the width is perfect on those, so I guess they use a different mold for their shoes."
3.0,"I thought with the stretchy band, this watch would stretch to fit my wrist, but was wrong. The watch is way too big and constantly flips around so you can't see the face of the watch. Also, I thought it looked prettier on the website then in person. I would not buy this watch again, but will not be sending it back since it was decently cheap. I guess you get what you pay for :)"
3.0,The top fits great!  The pants were way to small.
3.0,It says in the description to order a size up. You should order 3 sizes up! I wear an 8 or 10 and ordered an extra large and it fits snug.
3.0,"Love the earrings, but they sure are way to tight! I fear trying to loosening them as they may break and then where am I?"
3.0,Very pretty and works great will be ordering more!!<br />Does run small!!!
3.0,It's nice and better then I thought. It just didn't work for my larger ankle.
3.0,Fits great. Not what i thought it would be but it's okay
3.0,Un poco clara la tela. Esperaba algo mas consistente.
3.0,Looks good but it's way too big for my head. I dont think I have an abnormally small head but am second guessing now...
3.0,"Like the band style, but my fingers are a little too fat. But I still like the rings. Gonna keep them and make toe rings out of a few of them."
3.0,The pictures look way better than in person. In real life the fabric has like a cheap shine fabric. Waa:(
3.0,I like it because I love the bold print but it's not as long as what is shown in the picture. I need something that long so it will get returned.
3.0,Couldn’t get it up one thigh. Way too small. Returned.
3.0,"I'm a big guy.<br />6', 250lbs, broad shoulders.<br />Normally, a 3X is just a little baggy on me.<br />Loose enough to be comfortable.<br />This shirt runs small.<br />""Fat guy in a little shirt""<br />That's too bad because this is a great shirt.<br />Lots if useful pockets. Ventilated cape back. Breathable, stretchy synthetic fabric...checks all the boxes.<br />Just too small.<br />Order a size up; two sizes if you like it loose.<br />Skip it if your bigger than 2X."
3.0,"This jumper was somewhat small, but, it's what I expected so I purchased one a size larger. It fits okay...nothing to write home mom about! Really smelled like bleach. Had to was it a few times and put it on the line outside."
3.0,Head piece was huge even though I got it small
3.0,"It's a cute trapeze style dress that fit great but WAY TOO SEE THROUGH!!  You definitely need a slip- the picture shown is NOT how it looks on, I could see my underwear through it and I had on beige colored. I will try again with some type of extra slip but you can't wear this without."
3.0,"Very nice watch (If I didn't receive it broken it would have been a five star, but I left it as a comment within the product handling). May be hard to read the clock face a times due to the dark background and black roman numeral letters. Also, my product did not come with the link removal tool.."
3.0,Cute but very short. Gave it to my 11yr old
3.0,"They  serve the purpose, but I won't be purchasing again."
3.0,The pockets do weirdly puff out from pant.  Almost seems you need to put a &#34;seam&#34; in the pocket to get it to lay flat.
3.0,"Within 1 week of using this bag it got stains of using it, I could not return it since I had taken the tags off but I would not buy again they should be more resistant since they are purses. The only thing I like is that it has a lot of space but its not worth it because it gets dirty quickly and won't come off. Now I dont have a decent purse to use. ***UPDATE*** I gave it 2 more stars because thier customer service was great, they care about the customer and try to make things right."
3.0,"I was very excited to receive this shirt.  It's a perfect rich red wine color.  The wash instructions are simple and can be washed with like colors in cold water.  Thats about where my likes of this product ends.  I am a consistent size 3x girl.  I picked up a 3x size and verified it before trying it on.  This shirt is most definitely NOT a 3x.  I would say these shirts run small.  Please be mindful of that when purchasing this shirt.  I believe if you can find the right fit, you can be happy with this purchase.  For me, I cannot wear this shirt."
3.0,"Its OK, not leather and has an unusual odor. Priced right"
3.0,"straight up polyester, not really a rib knit. sizing is very small. neck hole would fit a child."
3.0,"The transparent lens is great for keeping out the sun. The adjustable strap is comfortable and I tried on three different size heads. No complaints of discomfort. However if your person who needs to wear glasses, these do fit a awkward with them on, the fit is better without glasses. Otherwise I think it will work great for shoveling, sledding, etc.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount or no cost in exchange for my honest review. The seller had no influence on my opinion of this product."
3.0,"It's very cute i usually wear a medium in swim suits i'm 5'7"" with butt measurement of 40in so per size chart should be a medium and so i ordered a medium. it's ginormous on me especially the bottoms, top is ok. i dont know if i want to deal with returns since it was cheap probably going to give to a friend. Overall would recommend just get a smaller size, it's nicely made."
3.0,"The quality is just okay.  I returned it because it's far too small to get around my wrist.  If it had fit I would have considered keeping it.<br /> But don't use the pins that come with it, because they're flimsy."
3.0,"Very cool watch, my daughter loves it. But the battery was dead when we received it and the chain broke after just a couple days."
3.0,Okay but not really what I thought it would be
3.0,Really cute but runs small..<br />I ordered an xxl and fits like a large.
3.0,"I generally wear small, medium sometimes.... I had to get large in this shirt.  It is comfy and I agree with everyone else in that regard, thus far.  But there isn’t much stretch in the arms or bust... and I’m not that busty.... but couldn’t even get the small past my chest....  I have the light gray.... maybe color/size varies.  I ended up returning the large it’s just too tight... no stretch."
3.0,The lining falls down inside the purse constantly. Hard to get anything in or out. But very pretty.
3.0,"Sweet mother of pearl these things are LONG!!  They fit snug around the waist,  but man oh man are they ever TOO long!!  I bet I could stand on my husband’s shoulders and these suckers would come all the way up to my neck.  Ok, seriously they aren’t that long, but my husband is 5’11” and they are way too long for him."
3.0,was not as nice as I thought it looked in the picture sorry but will not order from this company products again.
3.0,I’ve only had them for a month and I just noticed this tear on my right slipper.
3.0,I love this shirt but it does run a little small around the waist and under the arms is very low.  I had to sew under the arms to make it shorter and cut the sides of the inner layer of the shirt to make it fit my waist.  Still really cute!
3.0,"The only thing wrong is the bottoms came in a larger size then the top and are to big, so won't be worn."
3.0,False advertisement - very nice coat but NOT a 3 in 1 system
3.0,Not as expected. Runs small.
3.0,"I purchased these shorts and well they fell great.  I bought a large which I normally wear, well I should have purchased a size larger.  Don't expect them to stretch like traditional cotton for example."
3.0,"I like these except that the panty lines are way too obvious. I’m 5’7”, 150lbs. The XL was a good fit."
3.0,"I am so disappointed with this ""loose fitting"" shirt. I'm 5'3"" and 145 pounds. I like a loose fitting shirt and based on the sizing table and the item description as ""loose fitting,"" I figured I'd be safe with a large. Not so. It is a fitted shirt on me. It is not long enough to wear with leggings either. But the sleeves go almost to my fingertips! The sleeves are also very tight where the fabric changes.<br /><br />I like the color and the fabric, but found the pictures and item description to be very misleading and did not match up with the item I got in terms of fit. The shirt is presented as ""loose fitting"" and oversized, but if you want the look presented in the image, you apparently need to go up 2-3 sizes."
3.0,Broke the third time I wear it
3.0,Four of mine were cut upside down! So sad.
3.0,Fits more like a choker
3.0,"This is actually a pretty high quality metal rope, and it looks awesome, but there are some issues with it.<br />First is the issue of comfort. This cord is very thin and made of stainless steel, so it can be very uncomfortable. This is especially an issue if you're sweaty. I worked a summer job where I had to wear a lanyard for four hours at a time. That lanyard was made of a wide piece of cloth, and it never once irritated me. I almost lost my lanyard because it was difficult to notice whether or not in was on my neck! On the contrary, this metal string has memorably ""bugged"" me about every other day, and I'm always aware of where it is. I only kept it because it looks fantastic<br />The second issue is safety. Many lanyards are ""breakaway"" lanyards, meaning the cord will separate in the middle from any kind of pull or tug. Not so with this single metal piece. If your glasses get caught on something, your neck is essentially caught on it too. That's really not safe, and the design should be revised.<br /><br />Overall, I like this thing because I think it looks really neat. However, if it ever breaks, I'll find a cloth strap to replace it."
3.0,"It has a vibrant color but not sheer and light as the white and black one .  Its like a rayon & wrinkles and the inside is somewhat white like a whitewash, not the same color.  Wish it was sheer.  I kept it because of the vibrant color. Looks good with jeans."
3.0,Was ok had to return did not like how it fit
3.0,Should not be listed as one size fits all.......small size is out.....list as med. to large
3.0,"These rings are small, and that's what I wanted. It's a little bit of a hassle getting them in and once they're in, you can see the end of the ring at the bottom of my nose. My nose seems to be getting irritated by these but i'm not sure. They're okay for the money."
3.0,"Good but not great. They are honestly kinda cheep looking but for a growing kid that changes sizes practically over night, they are fine."
3.0,"Im not super impressed. Its VERY cute and weighty but even on the biggest snap, i cannot wear it. Its too small. Im a petite female. It should have fit. It is absolutely adorable as a decoration."
3.0,"Super cute! I ordered a medium and I’m usually a small to medium in sports bras, and this was like an XXS!! Way too small! But looked cute and padding was good!"
3.0,I ordered a 2 X since this said they run so small. The package it came in said it was a 2 X but the cardigan's tag said XL. I would have liked it more if it was the size I ordered. Otherwise the fabric is nice and soft and lightweight. Seems to be good quality.
3.0,"I really like the design of this shirt, however it's extremely thin and really short."
3.0,I will be returning this shirt. It is too small even though I ordered the next size larger from what I would normally wear. I think that this shirt is so pretty and hate to return it but it is just too small
3.0,I bought this a week ago and one of the crystals felt off already. The earrings are gorgeous and can't beat the price. Wish they were a little stronger.
3.0,Fits aight not my cup of tea though the bones on the side hurts after a while.....is for short term use only
3.0,"The picture in the featured ad shows a single lens across the entire bridge on these sunglasses. I received an imitation of this item with separate lenses. The item I received looks similar, but is not what is pictured."
3.0,Saw this and thought it was adorable but it runs a bit small and if you have any kind of curves on u either size up or find a bra that doesn’t such a small strap in the back( it rolls and kinda hurts ) I’m a 32 DD so finding bras are hard regardless
3.0,Kind of ugly in person
3.0,Not for every night use. They're fantastic but wear down easily.
3.0,Love the shirt but runs a little small...
3.0,"I loved the photo of these earrings on Amazon, but potential buyers should know that the posts are quite thick.  I managed to get them through my ears, but the ball at the end ( being larger than the diameter of the post itself) hurt my ear.  Also, closing them properly is a little complicated as you have to feel around to locate the horsehoe clasp holder, and since the post isn't very long, you're tugging on your earlobe while feeling around."
3.0,"It's a very nice dress, but I bought it size 12 and actually when you wear it it's like a size 8. It's very small and tight."
3.0,They were a gift for my granddaughter. She says they fit fine.
3.0,"No instructions for attaching bag to handle.  You have to use your best guess.  This bag is the perfect size bag for what I need to carry the exercise belts, weights and other items that I use for my senior fit class.  I have been testing the climbing feature at home before I use it outside.  I find that it does well with climbing up the steps but not so good going down the steps.  If I have to lift the bag to go downstairs, then it won't be useful for me, as the bag would be too heavy for me to lift.  Have to make a decision as to whether I will keep this."
3.0,"This runs really big and I felt like I was wearing a giant diaper around the lower half of my body. It is quite warm and comfy, but order down."
3.0,"They are ok, not as cute as I thought"
3.0,"Not my favorite.  It arrived crushed and remains wrinkled looking, not as chic as pictured.  It is super floppy with no shape at all.  I do like the adjustable band inside.  The hat itself seems nicely made and perfectly functional.  It just constantly looks like someone sat upon it.  Not all the crisp structured hat shown in the pics.  Overall disappointed.  Even with the adjustable size it is not that comfortable to wear.  I think it is because the hat without adjusting is too large and when I tighten it there is no give."
3.0,The fit is snug.  I wear a medium shirt and after getting this on almost thought large would be better but this works.  The zippers seem like they're for left-handed people.  And the worst thing is that the pockets are located too high so too awkward to walk with your hands in the pockets.  Extremely long draw string for the hood.  The inner zip up layer is shorter and ends around the belly button.  There are also no inner pockets.
3.0,"This is a lovely, delicate bracelet.  However, I wore it one time and it broke.  For the cost, the craftsmanship should be better.  I'm going to have to take it to the jeweler and have it repaired."
3.0,Pros: The burgundy color is beautiful!<br /><br />Cons: The fit is weird. I ordered a size up and it is really snug on my arms but boxy on my torso. The front lays weird on my chest. And the material feels pretty cheap. It doesn't feel cozy or breathable.
3.0,Great hat runs a bit big though had to wear bandana to keep it falling off his head.
3.0,If you never had a real diamond maybe this will fool you. It's ok for play but not to pass as real. If it wasn't so colorful it could pass as colorless flawless. When light hits it it's rainbows galore. Compared to a real diamond and white gold set.
3.0,Really pretty but fit was odd
3.0,"Very very small. Nice product, though."
3.0,Pretty but the bottom part of the earrings will not stay attached to the top of the earring
3.0,"The edges need to be weighted, fabric is way to light. I have to adjust it alot"
3.0,did not get the size I was expecting and they run very large.
3.0,"Isn't glass, it's plastic. Also it gets really foggy and you can't clear the fog up."
3.0,"Very short.  The green lining reaches the crotch, maybe, and is attached to the outer shell (black net material with sequins and fringes) at the side seams.  The outer shell is maybe 1 inch longer than the lining. Unless you have a super short torso, you'll need to wear baggy pants (still fashionable in Shanghai in the '20) or opaque tights or leggings or perhaps a black skirt to extend the ""dress.""  This is really just a long Asian themed tunic with long fringes which are not well attached.  Several fringes were unravelling.  They were easily fixed by singeing the nylon cords. The style is interesting, but a bit anachronistic.  Fringed Flapper dresses never made it big in China, and Egyptian, not Chinese, design influenced fashion and culture of the 20's in the US.  The sequin job was nice.<br />I am Asian, so like the mandarin collar and the unique fusion of flapper tunic and Chinese design, so I did wear it to the 20's themed Christmas party.  I went with the baggy black pants option.  I am 5'6"" , 41-30-40, and wear size 10 US or medium.  I ordered a medium which fit well otherwise."
3.0,"it was well made, nice color, plenty of room, but is too bulky for me. Have to return it. For someone who doesn't mind your wallet be a bit ""fat"", you may like it."
3.0,Not happy with the fabric and it ran a size small.
3.0,"Girlfriend bought this and not happy with it. The problems is the sizes in different brands aren't the same, normally she's a 34B but thinking it would be too snug she bought a 36B instead, a bit big. She likes the way the straps feel, dont dig into her skin before or after a workout. The sheer on the cups she doesnt like since her nipples can show, she prefers a padded cup with coverage of them and of course the extra padded protection. Other than those things this bra isn't what she expected but she will wear it when it suits her."
3.0,"I love the cut, but the fabric is very thin and of cheap quality.  It’s supposed to be line dried, but dries in a mass of wrinkles.  I do not typically iron a knit dress, but it’s really necessary here.  Even compared to the thinnest Lula Roe fabric, it’s thinner than that.  You definitely need carefully selected undergarments with this dress.  I would never wear without thick leggings."
3.0,It's slightly short in the torso so it cuts into my shoulders a bit (I'm only 5'6&#34; with an average torso length). The bra padding is very stiff and tends to shift while lap swimming so I'm constantly having to adjust them (I'm a C cup... Maybe the padding is designed for D+?)
3.0,"Really nice-looking.  Runs a tad narrow in the toe-box.  Even though they're leather, they scuff pretty easy."
3.0,"I like this gloves, fit well on my hand, easy to work with and also avoid cut/damage from the thorns of the tree/plants with the long over arms."
3.0,"I have not seen this in person yet. I bought it as a gift. It was well received and came with extra rhinestones. I was told that due to its weight, she will only be able to wear it on heavier garments."
3.0,"Material wasn't what what expected, however the item fits cute"
3.0,Nice feel but to tight no room for movement
3.0,"Cheap, but a good stocking addition."
3.0,"Regular crew socks of good quality, but not what I ordered. I'll keep them because we are preparing for a hurricane and good socks are must.<br /><br />Update- They said they would issue me the correct socks. I can review those when they come."
3.0,"After wearing the belt to work everyday for 7+ months, it now squeaks when I walk."
3.0,"Works fine but it is larger watch than it appears in online photo.  Also what I thought was a very easy to see second sweep hand was instead intended to allow you to quickly see what time it is in a different time zone and which you have to set yourself.  Included watch bands work but are hard to get fastened; maybe this will improve with use.  I was interested in durable, accurate, easily read face with contrasting colors of hands and dial.  Water resistance feature a plus but not a big deal for me.  Date is displayed and easily read but must be manually adjusted for 287, 29, 30 and 31 day months.  Price is a little more than some others with same features."
3.0,Way too big for what it says. Also not great quality
3.0,Does not fit my watch. Checked & ordered correct one. Would like to exchange for one that fits & works if I new how.
3.0,"I bought the red pair of these leggings, tried them on, and they are so dang see through."
3.0,"My son likes the glasses and they fit well, but they arrived with a scratch on the lens.  Disappointing."
3.0,"These boots are super cute, but beware they run small! Every pair of shoes/boots I own are a 7.5 and 8. I ordered a size 8 in these boots and they are way too small. So I am returning and buying a size 9 because I love these boots and really want to wear them!"
3.0,Had to have a small doesn’t fit well not really the best
3.0,"I loved the ring however, it gave me an allergic reaction."
3.0,"Depending on body frame, you will need to get 1, mostly 2 sizes up to fit.... These are made in China so its all about thier culture/body frame."
3.0,Cute but somewhat larhe abd the strings you cannot tie
3.0,"This is a sharp looking watch. It was purchased new less than a year ago. I expected a Rolex to be well built and last forever. This one didn't live up to expectations. It broke down after less than a year. It wouldn't store energy after being wound and would stop shortly thereafter. It needed to go to the Rolex service center after about 8 months. It needed a major repair which cost $700. As it wasn't purchased from an authorized dealer directly (I did have a warranty card from the authorized dealer), Rolex did not honor the warranty.<br /><br />Shortly have I dropped off this watch to be fixed, my other Rolex, a Milgauss, purchased new less than 2 years ago directly from an authorized dealer, also stopped working. Brought that watch to Rolex service and it was repair under warranty this time.<br /><br />The point, whether bought from an authorized dealer or not, I have had two Rolex watches both less than 2 years old that had to go back for service. I have serious doubts that the brand is really producing well made watches as I am 0 for 2. I would not spend any more money on Rolex watches. I love the looks but don't trust them to last."
3.0,"Material is nice, length is great. Not true size"
3.0,"For all the tall girls out there, I'm 5'10 I ordered a large and it didnt touch the ground. kind of disappointed on how it looks, I would tie the bottom side into a knot just to help give it shape."
3.0,Make sure u order 1 size bigger it runs small and shrink..
3.0,"I don’t like the material, and it’s big too"
3.0,This dress was way too big. I ordered a small & it fit my mother in law who wears a large. It was very pretty but the material was transparent & cheap but still pretty.
3.0,"Very nice, not sure when i will use it, but it looks exactly as shown. Did take about a month to ship though so be warned."
3.0,"These earrings are okay, but they're borderline costume jewelry-type earrings. They don't look like they came from a 5-year old's jewelry box, but they also definitely don't look like they were bought at a jewelry store. I wish they looked like they were of higher quality since I did love the design."
3.0,"Its beautiful, just not for me."
3.0,"This nightgown sheds lint all over the place. At the price I paid for it, I would not reccomend"
3.0,"When ordering the shirt, I thought maybe the monitor I was using was off. The color was ""Deep Green"", but it looked dark blue. Either color was going to work for me, so I went ahead and ordered it. Well, what I recieved was definitely not a green shirt. It looked accurate to the image on screen. It was a combination of various dark blues.<br /><br />I normally wear an XL or XXL. Lately I've been leaning towards XXL for roomier fits and so it holds up to shrinking in the laundry. But, despite normally still being able to fit into brand new XL garments, I could barely squeeze into this shirt. I ordered the XL but it feels much smaller than that. I stood no hope of getting it buttoned. My wife will also sometimes buy men's L or XL shirts if something catches her eye; so she also gave this shirt a shot. She couldn't fit in it either.<br /><br />My recommendation would be to go up at least one size from your usual size, two if you want room to move. And pay more attention to the images on your screen than what they name the colors. Otherwise, it seems well put together, and it's really soft. It's just a shame that the manufacturer doesn't seem to understand sizing and colors."
3.0,"Cute, nice color, comfortable fabric. But at least two sizes up of you have a thing for comfort."
3.0,It is very cute. Perfect for my Medusa costume. But I had to adjust it through the night.
3.0,"I really liked this dress. Nice fabric, lightweight & breathable. I bought one previously & returned it due to a middle seam being in the front instead of the back. Recieved the new dress & it was the same issue. The pattern hid this oversight very well so I decided to keep it & wear to my event as intended. No biggie. Bought a medium. 145lbs, 5'2"", DDD"
3.0,"I like the looks of this corduroy hat, but I wish it ran just a little larger. It feels just that bit too small. Too bad; it's a cute hat, and I like the corduroy."
3.0,"Not the right color, and too short."
3.0,"This dress was really cute. It seemed to be well-made, the fabric was soft & cottony. It was a decent length (I'm 5'5"") & I bought a 3x. Unfortunately, the neckline was really high, not the pretty scooped neckline shown in the ad.<br />You can see in one of my photos,  when I tugged the neckline lower, the shoulder seam was brought forward. The sleeves were also a bit tight, causing a tenting-effect between my arms & chest.<br />I don't know if it was the tightness of the shoulders or my bust that caused the pattern design at the neck to be distorted, but it wasn't a good look.<br />Overall, it would have been a good purchase if it had been cut for a woman's figure. Sadly, most of the clothing from China seems designed for women, or maybe girls, without breasts or shoulders. They just cannot seem to properly cut plus-sized clothes for adult women."
3.0,I liked how it looked but it only worked for about 10 seconds. Get what you pay for. It’s crap
3.0,"The shirt itself is good quality and looks nice, but unfortunately runs about two sizes too small."
3.0,It was not a true color
3.0,I'm disappointed with the quality. I used it the first time and the bottom part near by the wheels were cracked. I will not recommend.
3.0,Only fit the front incisors.  Needed  one for a chipped front tooth.
3.0,"i bought the white tank with yellow flowers and it is not the same as the others. i had previously purchased the black and white tie dye AND the black with sun/moon, and the two of them fit different but they were both normal. this one is WAY more cropped and it just overall looks weird, like a baby doll shirt an adult is trying to wear. the embroidery was a plus though, i was expecting just printed graphics."
3.0,"Not flattering, maybe on a different type of figure.  I returned it"
3.0,This shirt is very thin and light it is cute with a shirt under it or you can go without one under it as well it is a bit sheer but pretty
3.0,"These are cute but extremely small.  If you have two piercings in your ears, these can be worn with a larger hoop style, with an intent to showcase the letter."
3.0,"The chain link part broke off within the first weed!  I'd say it is made cheaply, but once I took off the braided metal chain link part off, it turned out to be very cool looking."
3.0,The material isn't amazing but the dress is nice
3.0,It is made with paper thin sheet metal. I was hoping for a better quality heavier metal plate. Theres also an annoying fake leather patch behind the plate that i hear alot of people dislike (I wear it side ways like Zabuza hahaha). Although for the money it was worth it to me in the end.
3.0,Beautiful design! The only thing that I was slightly disappointed with was once I received these earrings..they were more of a rusted color than gold. :( but since the shipping took forever I decided to keep them instead.I may give them to a friend as a gift.
3.0,Just a boring tie. I returned it.
3.0,"Really cute, REALLLLYYYY Small leggings.  I ordered a Medium thinking I would be ok.  I am 5""8 and 135lbs.  They are small and not really high waisted.  They are warm though.  I am returning them today and will look around for something else."
3.0,I like the shorts very much but they are to small and my size is 38 and they small.
3.0,Ordered a large for boy who wears large size as a gift. Tag in back says 4XL?!?!? Why did you do this ?!?!? The pants are nice but I think he will not like them because of the tag saying 4XL! I feel too worried to give them to him.
3.0,I like the shirt but it looked like it came off the floor. Maybe your description should be more accurate.
3.0,aesthetically pleasing but not water proof. It does come with a clip to clip them both together so you don’t lose one. But the band is wayyy to small to place on your wrist Maybe to clip on to your jacket if you have a clip. For this reason mine fell somewhere in the snow when I was carrying my board in hand. Why was I not wearing my gloves you ask ? Bc water got got in and at that point it was colder to have the wet gloves on that no gloves at all. Also note water didn’t get in through the wrist it got in via the fingers.
3.0,This is a pretty collection of necklaces that is perfect for younger girls or teens but definitely not for someone who is actually in to crystals! They are very pretty but not real stones.
3.0,5'8 with long torso- this dress fell more like an empire waist than a natural waist. I would have loved it had it not been so short waisted. Cute style. I returned it due to fit.
3.0,"This dress is cute and I really wanted to like it, but the fabric around the leaves is a very slightly darker pink than the rest of the dress, which makes it look like there are weird splotches on the dress. Might not be noticeable if you're not looking closely, but it bugged me enough to return it."
3.0,"super cute, but wouldn't roll up past my ankle."
3.0,The necklaces are fine but the red on the rose is clearly cheaply painted onto the regular necklace and is very disappointing
3.0,Quality is not that much .
3.0,These are a lot more green than pictured!
3.0,Was excited to find this product on Amazon.  My soon to be four year old son loved these when he first received a package of finger lights so I thought they would be perfect for goodie bag party favors for his birthday.  Just received package and the are literally 40 loose lights in one small package.  Some of the comments made it appear they were perfect for party favors so I made the mistake on believing they would arrive in small packages of four as my son had received.  Not sure now if I will use them or return.
3.0,"I love the moon design and the benefit of having essential oil with me at all times. However, the little orb with the felt ball is not made with a locket latch. In order to change the color of felt ball, one must pry open a jump ring, remove the circular cage, open it, replace the ball, reattach the jump ring and then crimp it closed with pliers. Bad design."
3.0,"First after reading all the reviews I ordered up.  Thankfully!!!!  I'm only 5 feet tall and needed this as a ""dress"" for an 80's themed party.  I cannot imagine it would fit as a dress to anyone of average to tall stature though.  It's a mini on me once belted.<br />The material itself is not what is pictured.  i thought I was receiving a solid black sweatshirt style material - what it is is a gray/black marbled light sweater like material.  I can make it work - but it's definitely not as pictured.<br />Lastly size WAY WAY up!  i'm normally a small.  I read the size chart and decided a medium was probably best.  Then after reading reviews i decided to go with a LARGE.  And it actually fits.  I'm NEVER a large!  Si if you want the oversized look as pictured I'd say size up two sizes."
3.0,Was a great fit for my daughter but the plastic pieces by the ear cracked within a couple months
3.0,"They're super comfy, but you can kind of tell they're not &#34;real&#34; jeans."
3.0,Small hat
3.0,"Thus far, these socks are great! I've had them for a couple months now. They're the only socks that do not slip off my heal! They are thin, which is nice, but I do worry that they will not hold up for much more than a season..then again, most of my socks don't. As of now, I'm very pleased!<br /><br />Update: all three pairs now have holes in the toes. Bummer. Wish the toes were reinforced a bit more. Downgrade from 5 to 3 stars"
3.0,"Cute mask, but was too small for my kiddo"
3.0,bust area is very small
3.0,The bags a little longer than expected. I can't keep it on my shoulder. The strap just a little too short. But all around I love it. I get lots of compliments for it!
3.0,Cool looking pen however I did no realize that I was purchasing one pen by random selection. The photo is misleading and you MUST read the description to understand that you are purchasing only one pen.
3.0,Fits too tight in waist too much spandex? Looks ridiculous baggy on top and tight in middle
3.0,"I’m a size 12/14 heavier in top.  The colors and fit were nice on this excluding cups.  The cups did have underwire, but unfortunately seemed very small.  I was spilling out of them.  Having to return :("
3.0,Have a hole after just two washings! However teh fit is really true to size
3.0,It catches on a lot of things and snags. Only thing I don’t like about it.
3.0,"It’s cute, but two sizes too small."
3.0,"No me quedo bien exacta en donde va la tira en el iPhone, pero de lo demás muy bien"
3.0,I ordered it in May and didn’t get it till July31
3.0,"I do my homework and read the reviews and knew this ran a lil small so I ordered up - normal size18 is comfortable lil baggy, not this one, very tight. Had to return it - really bummed the material was very nice and soft."
3.0,They run small and I ordered white... you can see my panties and my tattoos through them.. I plan on using them as sliding shorts for softball now :(
3.0,"For a 44B, the 2XL is definitely too small. It was next to impossible to get on (it required two people) and was constricting breathing."
3.0,"love the style very comfortable and military, a couple of the pins came loose on there own but replacement ones good so far."
3.0,Shirt fit great but halfway through they said something about a different warehouse so it didn't even ship for a week but the shirt is nice
3.0,"Not a good fit, but workable"
3.0,The material is good and I always buy rompers at Xl . I am 5'11 229lbs & everything fit but I have a long torso so it is too short in the waist
3.0,I guess they were too small because you can’t tell it’s dogs when the material stretches iut
3.0,"Not bad, but doesn't look as good In Real Life as the picture here. My main complaint is the rubber pinbacks fell off, lost, and now I'm digging through old pins trying to find proper metal ones that will stay on.<br />Would not buy again."
3.0,"Not a deep red as shown in the photo, more of a bright red.  But still pretty."
3.0,A little small for the toddler
3.0,If you have a larger bust-this is not your dress.  36 DD needs slightly more room to make this work.
3.0,Pretty but runs small through the bust
3.0,The bands are too thick for this watch.
3.0,Wrong color. It was brien instead of black and white
3.0,"The watch looks great and fits well. Unfortunately, the magnet does seem to mess with the time, often causing the watch to freeze if I tighten the band all the way. It works fine if I wear it loose on my wrist where the magnet is further from the watch face, but that kinda defeats the purpose of the magnetic band."
3.0,"A little disappointed with the quality of the fabric. It only has ONE button on it which won't keep it from flying open while wearing it, but what do you expect when it comes from China."
3.0,Original Box was a mess.But when you open the thin can that was inside the box. I was sure it was brand new. Thanks btw.!
3.0,Material is very shiny and the fit is a bit loose in the top and sleeves. Rethrning it.
3.0,Looks nice and sturdy - doesn’t seem to have a clasp to open or close it . More junk to accumulate 😐
3.0,Shirt is the cutest and fits good. Shorts not at all 😔
3.0,This dress wasn’t nearly as flattering as I had hoped.
3.0,She loved it....
3.0,"Cute top and great color (purple).  I am 5""9"" and the top is too short to wear with leggings and too long to wear with jeans.  The cuts at the top make it more appropriate for Las Vegas than a trip to the grocery store, but that might be due to ""the girls"" being above average in size.  ."
3.0,the mask is beautiful but it came down too far on my face.
3.0,I ordered the coral and black . The black fit well but the coral was lose and the under wire was sticking out on the side. I kept the black one but all and all it was only worth $25.99. You get what you pay for and buying a Chantel bra will last longer and fit better and I have several of them. Does not have enough padding for modesty.
3.0,Easily torn on the part between thumb and pointer.
3.0,"I like the colors/logo...went to ECU, but live in northeast where no one knows what this hat is, so I like that...<br />But zephyr is kind of cheap I feel like...its hard to get buttons to snap into place in the plastic strap, and its noticeable thinner than something like new era or mitchess&ness ...I feel like a higher crown would be better,these dont fit my big head well (7 3/8-7 1/2"" fitted)"
3.0,Quality was less than I expected. Material didn't have enough body.
3.0,"The colors are not the same as pictured. Was sent boots with the first 3 buckles being red. The platform form for the sole was correctly colored.  The seams completely frayed.  Used fabric glue to stop that. The fabric is nice. Feels like canvas.  Stitching is poor, buckles are poorly made. It can be fixed with some DIY and crafty abilities.  Would not purchase again."
3.0,"Just a heads up-The material is not much like satin at all... I usually wear a 6/8 I got the 12/14 size because the 8/10 was out of stock, thank God I went up-it fits a bit tight. Im 5’2 at 140lbs hopefully this helps"
3.0,The strap broke off after using it for a month. But I did love how big it was
3.0,Having trouble with the zipper sticking.
3.0,The colors and pattern are very cute but I ordered a medium like I usually get and it fit more like a small or XS. The chest part was not very flattering on me but again I think it had a lot to do with how small it runs
3.0,"The ""leather"" straps are peeling to the point that they will break soon.  I don't carry it anymore.  I have made two purchases from this company---a purse & a wallet---I'm done..."
3.0,This will work
3.0,"I liked the fabric and color. The neck ties cross in back pulling the waist too high.  I cut them at the waist, tied it behind my neck."
3.0,Nice boot . Calf was to tight
3.0,"My wife had an issue with the studs...could be that they are brass.  Will have to return.  Picture is hard to see with respect to what is in the middle, so when they arrived we were a little surprised."
3.0,"Interesting watch, but use great caution in using and adjusting it. Just an FYI, if you need to adjust the length of the bracelet, the directions supplied can be wrong! Unlike metal watch links which use spring pins, the wood links use pins which are smooth on one end and serrated on the other. So, they only go in one way. The directions on mine were wrong, so trying to press the pin ‘out’ as shown in the pic drove the serrated end deeper into the wood, splitting it and breaking the link. If you press the pin out, you should see the tiny serrated end right away (2mm). If it seems stuck, stop immediately and try the opposite direction. Haven’t worn this watch much, but I can see the wood case or links breaking rather easily if you bumped it against anything solid. Forget about getting it wet too! The tiny date window is so small, you need sharp eyes 👀 or a magnifying glass to see it. On the plus side, it’s wood, so it’s very light and comfortable to wear."
3.0,The skirt is ok but it is not made for ballet dancers.  The material under the tull is small and does not allow to lift the legs for ballet dance.  I had to cut the cloth under the tull so it could be used.
3.0,Cute not tee shirt material silky material.
3.0,I loves the pic of the shirt when I ordered it. However the shirt ran small and is made out of very thin material. More like a cheap tshirt.
3.0,"Cute and stylish until you touch them.I loved these glasses when they first arrived! After wearing them a few times it needed a bit of cleaning on the lenses, but immediately when I touched them they fell out! Now I have cute frames and no lenses in them anymore."
3.0,Kind of cheap made<br />Fits way smaller than tag says
3.0,"This is ok...very big to me, and it's more of a tank/tee material where I assumed it would be more blouse-y"
3.0,Do not get these wet! The matte coating will chip off and get stuck to you and in your hair
3.0,"The dress is beautiful. The fabric is slightly cheap feeling, but it doesn't affect the look. I did have a problem with the zipper at the bottom detached from the dress, nothing a quick stitch will fix. The armholes seem very small too"
3.0,"I returned this clip in less than 24 hours. I loved the weight of it, but felt that the clipping mechanics just weren't strong enough. It had a weak, wobbly feel to it."
3.0,"I'm really sad. They're well made and all, but they're too loose for my wrists. I would like to return them but that's too much of a hassle."
3.0,It's will do
3.0,Was sent one that was used with deorderant on it and no tags! It’s cute though.
3.0,Jacket was thinner than I thought it would be.
3.0,I really like it but it was to small so I had to give it away.
3.0,All really cute. My favorite is the spike hoop. It has a better clasp than the other hoop. The stuffed hoop clasp (click part) has only lasted about 3 wears. I would return everything but the spike hoop because the other items don’t stay in place well without hurting my ear.
3.0,"I really liked the color, but the material of the ring is very cheap and is not the same as shown in the Amazom, page please send stick to what they show on the website so that the customer does not feel disappointed"
3.0,The size is perfect. But the material could be better.
3.0,The shoulder chain is extremely flimsy and light. It's going back.
3.0,"It's super cheap, arrived to me with the chain broken, nothing a little jewelry pliers can't fix. Great piece."
3.0,"Meh. They're ok, but kind of cheap looking. They are more like leggings. I know they weren't expensive but I don't think they're worth $20. Sidewise, I'm 5'9&#34; and usually wear size 4 pants, I ordered the small and they fit around the waist but legs were WAY too short. I'm returning"
3.0,"Love the design of this hat. Brim is just right size to protect better than baseball cap. Opening in back is large enough to easily go over your hair up in a clip.<br />Unfortunately, the velcro tightening is too large to tighten down. I was on the last tiny bit of velcro and it was still loose on my head."
3.0,"This bra runs a full size and more smaller. I read the reviews and purchased up a size and it will work for my needs... it’s a snug fit! The fabric and style and construction appear rather nice, will know more in time."
3.0,Think It looks good
3.0,"I read the listing and thought these were heated.  I guess they've changed the listing  so now, Okay I looked up what the definition of thermal was and this is what it says for thermal socks.<br />""thicker and sweat-wicking, will keep your feet warmer than traditional cotton socks.""<br />So with that said I have to say that I don't think that these can be considered thermal.  They're just normal cotton socks and they kind of look like soccer socks we used to use in the '80s OR '90s.  They're kind of cute, I like them, they're high, they go all the way up to your knees but the fact that they say heated is really irritating cuz they're not and I also don't believe they're thermal either.  They are not warmer than normal."
3.0,"It was okay shipped the same day, looked elegant but we lost a few stones the first day"
3.0,Cute hat but the fuzzy ball started falling apart only a week after having it.
3.0,Nice variety but texture of fabric not so great..nylon
3.0,A little disappointed. Not what I expected.
3.0,Didn't like it at all.  Very cheaply made.  Sleeves too long.  Amazes me that outfits for plus size women always have extra long sleeves.  Why? My arm does not hang down to my knees.
3.0,I order 2 boxes of these bands for my sister and I and we both have one defected band out of each package.<br />The band come apart from wear you connect the band together to close it.
3.0,I'm 55 158 lb and got a medium and while they did feel very comfortable and fit me perfectly they're definitely not squat proof and they fit the crotch weird
3.0,They were awesome!!! But... They were entirely too big and couldn't barely adjust them.
3.0,"Bummer, it's a great color but too revealing for me at the gym. I'll be able to wear it in the summer over a swimsuit. For ref. I'm a true medium, this is a small."
3.0,Fit isn’t as pictured. Maybe it is not my style . Will return.
3.0,Feels plasticy
3.0,It's hard to see the citrine and the grey rock is 98% of the piece. I did not get anything Drusy related. I did contact the seller after the order to ask for a piece that looked best as the sample. Mine is shaped OK but all the grey rock is ugly. Nice sellers though.
3.0,"I was expecting regular size chain links, but this is very slim and small. It's not bad looking at all, just not what I expected."
3.0,"Cute shirt, a little large up top by the armpits.  Also it is solid blue, not heathered like the picture."
3.0,The material was a little scratchy and thin. I didn't trust the buttons to stay on.
3.0,"This is such a beautiful dress. I don't know what I was thinking... But I should have known better. Because I know dang well that my BIG Boobies wasn't gonna fit in a dress like this. So this dress is definitely NOT made for Big breasted women. Also it's not made for thick women.. Ya'know with all those good right curves. So if you have big boobies, thick thighs, hips, buns. Then this dress is not made for you. Also it's very short. But the fabric feels soft and lightweight."
3.0,"I purchased these for my 8 year old son.  He is tough on clothing.  Every pair of socks had holes.  When these arrived I was pleased by the quality and the thickness of the socks.  He loves the colors (electric green and black).  However,  I've noticed that his feet stink when he wears  them. The smell is so bad  I can not be around him when he takes off his shoes.  I will be purchasing new socks to replace these."
3.0,"The color is a little odd, not really the wine i was expecting. The attached handles are too short for shoulder use and the purse is pretty stiff. I am sure it will soften with time. Otherwise it fits my style."
3.0,The price in not bad but I gave it to my 6 year old to year.
3.0,The top bust band slides off to easily!!  Did not work well.  Bottoms fit great!!
3.0,"OK.. Just rated a pair of glasses as shoes lol...  Well, as glasses they're alright. A little flimsy and don't really suit my face. A little droopier than typical aviators. But super cheap so what do you expect."
3.0,Could've been better
3.0,"Ordered these in the past and was very happy with them.  After over a year of use,  they began to loosen.  I tried to reorder but this product became unavailable for a while.  This new version costs less and is smaller and harder to handle.  I prefer the larger, more expensive version of these as the current size of these backs makes applying and removing earrings a tricky and annoying process.  The size change is not an improvement!"
3.0,The silver chain was thinner than the two mm I orderedefinitely wasn't twenty inches Either. I ordered it to Put my daughter's urn  pendant on.
3.0,Closer to womens sizes. Order at least 2 sizes up.
3.0,"Judging by another review, I'm not the first person to complain about the smell.  There's something about this particular fabric and the smells that generate when in contact with human skin (and not even sweating heavily).  The shirts go from smelling like nothing and then reeking of basically nasty body odor.<br /><br />It's definitely not me, because I put one both before and after showering, and the result is the same: stanky smells.<br /><br />Very unfortunate because the fit is awesome and they look great.  I haven't washed/dried them yet...but I'm skeptical if that would even matter."
3.0,Not as cute as depicted
3.0,Wish they came with more instructions but I guess worth the buy if I practice
3.0,"Nice, just fringe was peach colored and didn't go with my dress."
3.0,"Its for my Granddaughter. I'm sure she will love it. The spinner part, ( elephants ) seem like they're going to come off."
3.0,Pretty small in size. More for kids faces but also a little bigger for them. But not large enough for a grown man.
3.0,"These are decent. Pretty thick if you like that sort of fleece pajama. They are very soft.<br /><br />They did not, however, come with the advertised footies. For such pricy pajamas, this is very frustrating especially given that these were a gift."
3.0,"I ended up getting a 2xl reading the reviews and it was way too big but also very boxy, no shape to it for it being a woman's jacket.  I could've tried a smaller size, but I just decided to return it instead."
3.0,Fits well to size. Doesnt come with battery pack.
3.0,"It was too long, if it was a little shorter I would have liked it better."
3.0,"My seven year old twins love this toy.  The variations they are able to make keep them busy.  They never get bored re creating their lightsabers, and challenging each other to battles.  Be warned these did not last three months in our house."
3.0,Problems with the zipper.  It pulls away when trying to close
3.0,I ordered big based on other reviews but is still smaller than I like.  I wear it but not my favorite.
3.0,"Love the shirt. But not the best material, it’s very hard and the color already looks washed out.  I just wished the material was softer, and it was midnight black. It just looked liked I’ve washed it and put it to dry in the sun a few times."
3.0,"The product didn't last long, and started coming apart after the first wash; I am very disappointed to say the least."
3.0,"I’m 5’3”, generally size 12 & large. DDD bust. XL was too snug. Didn’t reorder. But what arrived was nice quality. Cute dress. Was disappointed it didn’t fit."
3.0,The suit is super cute and flattering but I probably should have sizes up. The one I ordered isn’t high neck and the bustline hits lower and pulls tight so it fits odd.
3.0,"If you are looking for a heavier fabric dress, this might work for you.  I live in a tropical place, so there was no way I could wear this. Style is cute and I liked the color.  I had to return it."
3.0,"Loved the style and the cost, purchased the same size earlier in a different color and the fit was perfect"
3.0,They were nice but some of them were smaller than expected
3.0,Great watch for my 5 year old.  Fits perfect<br /><br />The glass scratches easily but nothing major
3.0,Nice but fit was tight
3.0,"I have bought so many different brands of tanks and was so excited to find these amazon choice, at first they were amazing, the softest tank tops I have ever seen. Washed them all in cold water so I could wear them and the stitching around the lace completely pulled and frayed."
3.0,vneck was too low for me and sweater was too tight
3.0,made cheap but good price
3.0,"I am glad I ordered these after the price dropped. They say they are for adults, but they did not fit my face. It did not fit like the picture. Clips would not stay on the mask folds. I so wanted these but am very disappointed. Useless"
3.0,Not too bad for the price. .
3.0,Returned it it came the wrong color thought it was gonna be a deeper red and it’s really bright red but had to return it
3.0,"I have three ultimate direction belts so I am versed with this brand. This belt is great for the Velcro closure that allows a snug fit without having a big clip digging up into your esophagus and for the big pocket which allows for a light jacket to be stowed in it. The pocket for the bottle is too tight, so hard to get in/out and the bottle is hard to use as well- it’s hard to squeeze (plastic too thick and firm)  and creates a vacuum when you drink from it forcing you to blow air back into it in order to make the next drink possible. Bite valve again, too much work. Makes me wonder if anyone tested this on a long run going fast-it takes too much energy to fiddle with everything. The plastic cage bottle holder was easier to use in previous belts as was the bottle, thinner plastic. Please create an easier to use on the run belt and bottle. I have another same brand belt that has pull ties to open/close water pockets which are also too much energy to use on a run..."
3.0,Mot sewed correctly
3.0,not so good.
3.0,"Not the denim color that I was expecting, but I still like them."
3.0,"Snug for big heads like my own. Quality is ok, comparable to flea market sun glasses. NOT INTENDED FOR LARGER CRANIUMS."
3.0,Way smaller than size listed.  Its more like a medium than a XXXXXL.  In fact my 11 granddaughter can wear it. But Colors are great.
3.0,"I bought this watch because it's the smallest and the lightest watch that has a ROTATING bezel. I need it for cooking and doing my laundry.<br />The first thing I tested when I took the watch out of the box was the rotating bezel - the main feature of the watch (for me). To my dismay, the bezel didn't rotate properly. It was rubbing against something with a gritty feel. The ratchet mechanism wasn't holding the bezel reliably in the same spot, It had a free play within a 2 min range. Don't get me wrong, the watch (and the bezel) work, but I didn't want to settle for a mediocre product. I want something like a Swiss Army Maverick whose bezel is a joy to click."
3.0,Average tee shirt
3.0,"I've traveled with this jacket on 1 international trip and multiple domestic trips now (both air and car).  I bought this jacket because I need to wear something when I travel (I get cold easily) and I like to travel as light as possible (meaning no check-ins and avoid the roller boards if possible)--so the many pockets in supposedly a non-bulky presentation were my main draw to the purchase.  So here is my breakdown for the pros/cons of this jacket:<br /><br />Pros<br />- lightweight<br />- Teflon coated = rain literally beads off<br />- so many pockets, if you don't like a designated pocket for one thing, you can just find another one that works for you. For example, I hate the chapstick pocket in the right arm sleeve because the zip catches and the loose sleeve prevents quick in/out zip action. So instead I found a mini nested area within the left outer pocket to store my chapstick and have super easy access to where I don't have to fish for it either<br />- the weight management system works. Even with a small water bottle in my pocket, I don't feel weighed down<br />- certain pockets are really well thought out. I especially appreciate the pen pocket (so easy to grab for filling out paperwork during travels), the glasses pocket with the lens cleaning cloth attached which also has a map on it showing all the pockets of the jacket and reminding you what they are for, and of course the inner secured RFID blocking pocket for security (though my passport doesn't fit into that easily, which I find a bit annoying because I prefer to keep all my important cards/documents together).<br /><br />Cons<br />- definitely runs small. Size up for sure! Remember only medium and up fit full size Ipads, etc, so look and the scottevest website for details before purchasing so you aren't disappointed!  I sized up to a medium though I am normally very much a small, and felt the jacket was loose in certain areas and tight in others (bust was fitted and shoulders were loose)...this would have been ok if my plan to not look ridiculous with filled pockets worked out ok (it did not..see below)<br />- I'm not a big fan of the unzip feature of the sleeves (great in theory to 'easily' turn it into a vest, but the zip itself is cumbersome (keeps catching on itself) and since this design gives a very bulky look to the shoulders (it kind of sticks out in a weird way), I'd have been happier to have a properly sized jacket without this feature.<br />- although the weight management helps you to not feel weighed down, when you put even normal stuff (wallet, phone, keys) in your pockets, it is very visible. I would have expected better masking of at least the basics because I fully expect to look like a fool when the pockets are all full, but not with the minimum expected items. Even with my medium, I look very bulky with my basic items in the pockets.<br />- wish it were a bit warmer...planes get cold and this is a pretty light jacket<br />- no hood. Why? The jacket is Teflon coated, but my bare head is not.<br />- I'm probably in the minority here where I really wish there were a few more outer pockets so as to more quickly access things. Like I feel there should be an outer breast pocket so I can stick my phone there if I want to access it quickly and not go on opening my jacket to do so. Same for other small things I'm not ready to stow away in the inner pockets because I'm going to need them again soon and don't really want to keep zipping/unzipping myself (boarding pass, passport, etc)..it really annoys me to have to zip and unzip myself repeatedly for things stored in the inner pockets.<br />- what's up with the washed out colors? I ordered the boysenberry at first since it looks like a deep color in the pics. Nope. Check out my photos here, it was faded. I actually think I got a used/washed product the first time around since there were several suspect things, but I reordered the red and got a much deeper, rich color. The navy suffers from the same washed out in real life syndrome, as evidenced from my online image searches which you should definitely look at it you are particular at all about the color<br />- the ear bud wiring system only accounts for normal-sized buds. Got a noise canceling ear bud set? You will be out of luck because the loops don't easily accommodate the larger ear pieces.<br /><br />Overall, I really wanted to love this jacket.  I am pretty much the perfect target audience for this thing, but unfortunately because of several key design issues, I am not that big a fan.  Add in the purchase price and I'm really very &#34;meh&#34; about the thing...for $150, I feel like I should be able to get something that fits the all-round bill a bit better."
3.0,"Pretty, and I like them.  Metal is to soft.  Backs bend easily."
3.0,"Es grande, estira mucho"
3.0,"Runs super big.  No matter how big your gear, this will fit.  Absolutely huge (unusable) if you are not wearing padding.  Quality seemed okay"
3.0,They are very beautiful but not very comfortable. They have no stretch at all and the itch my nose like crazy. I’m already looking to buy new ones.
3.0,Was vary cute at first.  But after one wash the nick part was all messed up making it ugly!
3.0,Not as pictured 😕
3.0,"Product looks just like the picture...but for some reason it seems to scratch extremely easy, which changes it from a dark blood red brown to a light tan color. The mark can be rubbed repeatedly to get it to partially return to it's original color, however I was not expecting it to be so susceptible to scratches..."
3.0,I give it a 3 because one was broke 😓
3.0,Runs large. Bought a small for my daughter who is 5ft and it is very large on her.  Otherwise it would be a cutr dress
3.0,"Tshirt is fruit of the loom, not Gildan as stated in description.  Fit is a little weird, will do the job but nothing all that great.  Blue Sun logo is distressed and looks very good.  Haven't washed yet so don't know how it will hold up to the laundry process."
3.0,Kind of small thought it would have been bigger
3.0,Not worth 24.99 but does the job. Purchased in hopes that one couldn't tell I was wearing prescription glasses under these...but no.
3.0,"This dress is so super cute on but man oh man is it SHORT.  If you're tall - just pass on this dress.  Stinks too because it really is just so cute  on.  I'm 5'8"" and it didn't even come down all the way past my tush. :-("
3.0,Looks cheap in person. Lens coating came off quickly. Wont buy again. These are only good for back up sunglasses.
3.0,Cute dress. Tackles are fun but it runs big. I ordered the small and it was huge!
3.0,5x = US large. Dissapointed since it dosen't fit but otherwise it's awesome. If it fit we would have rated 5 stars.
3.0,There were no instructions on how to set the extra dials on the watches.
3.0,"Earrings were a little larger, heavier than I expected. The color of the earrings are beautiful<br />sea foam teal ( as advertised).  I was expecting the earrings to look more like stone, the material looks<br />more fabricated, than the picture shows, I suggest ordering &amp; waiting 10 days instead of paying<br />extra $4.00 for shipping, earrings are worth $8.99 not $12.99, in my opinion."
3.0,Sizing was not inli e with USA sizes.  Had to return
3.0,"Not exactly the blue Rosary I was looking for, but I like it."
3.0,Fits very weird and tent like. Very thin and feels cheap. I returned it. Not what I expected
3.0,"I was wavering between ordering a large and XL, I put in the order for large and regretted it. They were not so small that they didn't fit - just a bit too tight, so that might have been my error in ordering.  Even if I had gotten the bigger size I still don't think these would have qualified as 'high waist' which is how they are listed. I'm 5'7"" and 185. I was going to just exchange for a size up then I saw a different set with the side pockets big enough for a phone, so I'm going to try those instead."
3.0,The jacket is okay . But the pants are not as stretchy as I thought they would be …
3.0,"The top part of the slippers started to crack, so I eventually just ripped them off because I didn’t want to fall."
3.0,"Not a bad pair of cheap polarized sunglasses. They fit me fairly well. My only complaint is that one of the rubber ends fell off and I didn't notice so it's lost. I can still wear them, but not as comfy as with it."
3.0,"I am keeping my shirt, but I’m glad I bought both sizes—L and XL.  According to the size chart, I should be L—way too small, right around the shoulders and biceps in particular.<br />XL alleviates this enough for me to keep it, but I probably will need a think camisole underneath the fabric—your bra will definitely show through.<br />The fabric feels nice even though it doesn’t allow for the fullness of the ruffles as you see in the pictures.<br /><br />I like the collar is a bow—it stays up high on the neck without choking you."
3.0,It rubs against your skin and makes you sweat
3.0,It's nice but it's a small 10 inches
3.0,"Pretty, but poor quality. Front gem is held on with very low-quality glue; it fell off almost immediately."
3.0,I was disappointed that they were defective and had to send them back.  I loved the look of them and had it not had a shaddow in the glass.  They were light and I loved the look.  Can't decide if I will try again.
3.0,"This is a nice dress;however I should have gotten an extra large,but will keep it"
3.0,"The product itself is great that’s why I’ve ordered it three times. However; this time around just like the last two, I ordered two packs of two. And what showed up was one pack of two so I should’ve received for table tops but I only received two."
3.0,"This would be great if it were actually a charm. This is more like a pendant. It is huge! It's about an inch, or the size of a quarter."
3.0,I bought this as an xmas gift. I'll update this once xmas arrives
3.0,Cheaply made but ok
3.0,"The earrings are extremely heavy and can't be worn for long periods of time. I went out and bought some earlobe support stickers just so I can take pictures in them. The bracelet is also heavy but it's fine bc it's on my wrist. The necklace I had to do ""surgery on, it came in the packaging with a broken clasp. I took apart a cheaper clasp and attached it to the chain. It worked great so I'm not upset, but someone else may not have an alternative laying around."
3.0,Very pretty stone
3.0,It runs a little small I bought matching shirts for my husband XL and son SM mens. They didn't like the girly rollup sleeve held up with a button and loop. It washed nice and they liked the snap buttons
3.0,Cute but I don’t recommend this for anyone with larger than a C cup
3.0,These insoles are great for people needing stability . The arch support - what I was buying it for - is not fully transversal and therefore not enough for me. It is a personal issue and these are the closest I've found so far from my need.
3.0,Seam came loose on first wearing.  Had to take to tailor to be sewn.  Decent shorts otherwise.
3.0,"This is cute, but it's really tight along the bottom - the band right under the pocket. I got a medium and I'm 5'4&#34; and 120 lbs. The rest of the shirt fits well, the sleeves are the perfect length, but that bottom band just seems tiny. I may just cut a few slits on each side so it fits, haha, it was cheap enough."
3.0,They work well blocks all noice but are a little heavy...I purchase these for my grandchildren because it said they were good foe children but they are very big and heavy on the head they will probably never wear them hopefully the parents will get some use out of them
3.0,Great durable fabric and shape. The top was way too big and I had to alter the top drastically to make it fit. Falls past the knee. Looks good with or without a petticoat.
3.0,"They are pretty, and nice.  The biggest gripe is they are very rough and sharp on the edges.  They weren't polished smoothly."
3.0,I bought this watch for my mother. She said she couldn't hear it even with her hearing aids. The face is one of the most readable I've ever seen. I could hear it say the time.
3.0,It was a little small in the neck size for me.
3.0,"After washing, these did shrink so I consider them 'somewhat small', order a size up to avoid having to order another size in a month or two- unless you have a small guy!"
3.0,Ours haven’t washed up great and we have a nice washer and dryer set.  The pink set has faded dramatically.
3.0,I ordered a larger size but it was still too small and I cannot wear it. I will order XXL for any other purchases in the future.
3.0,Not very comfortable. Fogs up quickly
3.0,"I bought this for a friends baby shower and its super cute. I ordered 6-12 months however I think it is more like 3-6 months for the average baby. I love the fact that it is a one piece fancy outfit. The quality is average and the material is thin and the bow seems a bit loose.  I received this item for free or at a reduced price, however I am not obligated in any way to give this item a positive review. Therefore please consider this review as honest and unbiased."
3.0,These shorts are flowy and cool.  They fit a little big but that was what I wanted.  Unfortunately they will only get worn around home because in the hot humid weather they absorb sweat and make it look like you've peed yourself which i dont believe is a good feature for something that is supposed to be worn when it's hot and you're likely to sweat.
3.0,I really like this top.  It is just a little thin that you need to wear something under it.  But I do like it.  I ordered another color! :)
3.0,For some reason this product give me a really itch in my ears. I give it to my sister but in her nothing happen still same color and look really nice. It's really small to my preference I think will look better in the nose or in inner ear.
3.0,Cute skirt but XL didn’t fit me and I’m not that big or curvy (but I am a very tall size 10). Very cute skirt but wasn’t for me so I returned it.
3.0,"Ok shorts, they have a weird inside liner like swim trunks I ended up cutting out. They do run small so go a size up"
3.0,"The quality is fairly decent for the price. The pockets are actual pockets; it's fully lined; seams are secure and the fabric is a nice weight.  However the red is MUCH brighter than the photo.  I was expecting closer to a burgundy as shown but it's fire engine/cartoon red.  The buttons are detailed but are just cheap plastic with no weight to them, which is fine for the Halloween costume it's going to be, but would be nice if they were more substantial."
3.0,"Beautiful. The fabric is wonderfully thin, and soft, the colors are perfect. But there is a problem. It runs small. For me to be comfortable it would have to be at least 2 sizes bigger. And that size is unavailable. There is so little room in the breast area that I would have to wear something else to cover them, but that would not fix the lack of room in the shoulders. I felt bad sending it back because if it had fit, for summer it would have been perfect."
3.0,It's cheaply made but cute. I found another one for cheaper and much better quality.
3.0,"I hate to give a bad review.....so....I'll just say, a bit too girlie looking for my Marine hubby"
3.0,The clasp on the back of the top had no adjustment to tighten the bra back. Otherwise it was a nice suit. Top was not able to be adjusted
3.0,"Cute top but WAAY too small. I have other colors in this style but I have never seen a lavender purple like this one! So I was super disappointed when I tried all sizes and even the large felt like it was suffocating me! The small size on me was a joke.  To note I am a 5 foot petite Asian girl around 100lbs. I’ve never had to say this but, PLEASE MAKE BIGGER SIZES & more colors please &lt;3"
3.0,If you are prone to drop things as I am then don't get these glasses. Dropped them off table and they hit on one of the arms bending it..  happened 3 times. I'm afraid of the bending causing metal fatigue and snapping off it is so thin
3.0,"I'm not thrilled with the texture. I had assumed it would be more like sweatshirt material or flannel, but it's a light polyester. The front is high and with the weight of the hood it is a presses on my lower neck. This would be fine for part of a Halloween costume, but is not daily wear cozy."
3.0,Gave these to my tall niece for Christmas. Had to order early as they were low on stock. Mens medium didn’t fit a 14 y/o girl…too tight in the legs. Didn’t even look like mens shorts when you held them up. Could only return within 30 days of ordering and that window has passed. Very frustrating to not have a gift fit….ended up ordering from another company.
3.0,Chain and metal gets discolored quickly.
3.0,Very cute until you dry it. It will shrink two sizes down so buy larger. Unfortunately I am tall so I was only able to wear once before it shrunk.
3.0,Ok for around the house.
3.0,"I bought my normal size, and I would say it fit as it was intended to fit, but I didn’t like how firm fitting it was. I would need to wear shape wear to prevent visible panty lines, for example. I prefer a little more roominess and fewer hugs to my mom waist. The material feels like the kind that easily pills, and that means it won’t look nice for work after a few washes. Ultimately I decided to return it bc I am not fond of the style or the material. For anyone between sizes, I would recommend sizing up if you prefer a loose fit, but I think sizing up for me would result in too much room in the wrong places."
3.0,"The material does not feel good on skin, top is too small.  Inexpensive, but I won’t wear it."
3.0,These are really cute. I wouldn't recommend if you're curvy though. I was looking for it to be more on the loose side but it hugged me a little too much. I ordered the XL and it fit but not the way I wanted it to fit.
3.0,"Wife liked these fine, but almost too small to even tell what they are while being worn."
3.0,"Since I discovered that silk bonnets help keep your hair from getting tangled or frizzed while you sleep, I've been on the hunt for a perfect one. Unfortunately this one was not it. This review is of: BXZUSIO 100% Mulberry Silk Bonnet for Sleeping Hair Care Night Silk Sleep Cap with Adjustable Elastic Stay On ...<br /><br />This is my favorite sleeping cap as far as looks are concerned. It is a beautiful purple Mulberry Silk. I usually will put my hair up in a bun for sleeping and this cap will slip right on over that. This bonnet is also the smallest I've ever tried. With my fine thin hair in a bun, this cap fits snugly. So snugly, I thought it would stay on all night with no problem. It does not. I have to put in bobby pins or hair clips, otherwise the cap slips off and gets tangled up in my pillows and blankets.<br /><br />I laundered this in a delicates bag on the delicate setting on my washing machine and I let it dry naturally, it came through fine and didn't shrink-it still fit snugly the next night.<br /><br />I really like the fit on this, once I got used to the tightness of it. I also like that  the front is flat so it leaves no elastic marks on your forehead. The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't stay on. It's a shame too because it's so darn pretty!"
3.0,Nice warm flannel nightgown. Very comfortable.
3.0,"I like these, but I'm 5'6 and they're a bit too short. About right above the ankles.<br />Material is ok. Like a nylon. I like them, but I'm not in love with them."
3.0,"I like the look of the dress but it was way to small, I could not use it.  I ended up giving it to someone else"
3.0,I love the color but I'm disappointed that the 12G taper has a wrong color aside from that I'm happy with this product.
3.0,Thin material.  I worry it will rip but it has held up so far.  I bought as a gift for my 10 year old. He likes it.
3.0,"Nice weight for winter/fall, not see-through either.  Glad it at least has some cotton in it.  Feels nice to the touch although not very stretchy.  Ordered size small according to the sizing guide and fit as expected.  Found the collar difficult to work with, could not get it to lay right, thus the 3 stars."
3.0,The zipper is constantly popping open at the bottom. I’m going to have to hand stitch it to reinforce. Fits ok. Not soft material.
3.0,"Very nice looking, except some of the earrings are backwards. You have to push through the back of your ear to put the front on. Not a huge fan of that. Otherwise, nice set."
3.0,Love the pants just a bit too big
3.0,"this is a very cute shirt, but the proportions are a little bit off. i have a small waist, but DDs. i had a hard time squeezing the shirt over my chest, but it fit perfectly on my waist. the shirt falls down, exposing my bra. if i get the shirt any bigger, it will be loose around my waist. i'm 5'1, 110 lbs for reference !"
3.0,"Large was too small.  Since I am between an 8 and a 10, large usually works for me.  Dress looked cute and well made but I did not like the color."
3.0,I really liked these jeans but after five times of wearing them they ripped :(
3.0,Very pretty but runs half size small.
3.0,Waited over a month to get this kimono cardigan. Looked a little different than the original photos and description. Wish I had ordered a smaller size since this one seems to run big.
3.0,Chewed up my foot.
3.0,"this product is SUPER SMALL. It looks like a child should be wearing this. There is very minimal room for storage in here. Took it on a 4 hr hike and worked well though, didn't cause the typical back discomfort I usually get when I wear a larger sized North Face backpack."
3.0,The product is excellent.  I love everything about them EXCEPT THE PRICE.  The price at other retailers is only $10.50 per pair.  So I returned the 6 pairs to amazon and bought 12 pairs for $25 less than I paid for 6 pairs thru Amazon.
3.0,Really cute but came broken. I was able to fix the clasp but really annoying.
3.0,"This is a great dress but it's way to sheer for me & wearing a slip like panty hose is so 'back in the day' lol.<br />I ordered my usual size following suggestions of others but for my '5'1"" / broad 42"" back w/less small B up front / heavy bottomed45"" body' it was too loose. I'm sure it'd be great for as a cover up or hanging around but it's not worth $26.98 for that purpose."
3.0,"Giving these workout leggings a 3-star because of the problems I had with the waistband.<br /><br />Firstly, I love how these leggings feel when I work out, and I opted to buy these leggings after buying and trying out the 7 inch shorts from Tesla. I had bought the shorts in a XXL and the fit was a little big, but the waistband stayed put when I would jog. So when I had ordered the leggings, I ordered a XL to have a better fit. Upon trying the leggings on, they fit well, even to as expected, but after going out to jog, I found the waistband dropping.<br /><br />I will still enjoy working out in these, as they do not completely drop, but I hope other high-waist leggings will have a more reinforced waistband to actually be a high-waist leggings."
3.0,The bag is great exactly what I wanted! Only problem is they left a security tag on it! Now I have to figure out how I’m going to get it off.
3.0,Nice for kids. Not quality product to gift an adult.
3.0,"I love the double-chain. It looks like a nice tie chain and works well; however, unlike the type of tie chain that you find at a department store, this is only half-finished. One side is polished smooth and the other side if rough cut. It went straight into chrome/silver dipping that way. If you purchase from a department store, it will be smoothly polished and clean from either side.<br /><br />It's not ugly. Just be careful because this one can be put on backwards and you wouldn't want to do that."
3.0,Very nice over swim suit or over a straight dress. The edges need to be cut and finished better if you want this dress to endure washing and drying. I did this myself and it helped a lot I purchased this item at a discounted price for an honest review.
3.0,"Bought for husband.  He says size 2XL was ordered and received.  Opened the package and they looked like they were a size M.  Yes, they stretch but.....  Waistband rolls.  Will not buy again."
3.0,"My son likes this hoodie, but it is thin (it's jersey and not sweatshirt material). Also, he is already getting holes in it around the pocket."
3.0,"Okay, this wristlet is pretty and inexpensive but the material it's made of is thin. I hope it doesn't rip."
3.0,The leggings washed up great. Other reviews said order a size up. They are cut small.
3.0,Sewn a little weird.
3.0,The material looks sturdy but the stitching looks like it’s going to fall apart after a few use or if carrying anything heavy.
3.0,Runs small and looks cheaper than the picture
3.0,Visa just OK they break very easily. All of mine only have one arm and I will have to throw them all out.
3.0,Wife likes it. Have had to repair the poor quality chain twice now.
3.0,"I live the belt but the material it's made of just collects hairs, fuzz and lint and end up looking just terrible very quickly. Beside that it's an incredible belt for an active person. I have 2 I use for work and 2 I use for climbing.<br />I love these belts and hate them at the same time."
3.0,"Cute, but runs small. I wear a size 10 in jeans and this skirt in a L is a tight fit."
3.0,I'm not displeased. Wasn't what I thought it would be. Very nice for the price. Style is fine.
3.0,Snug fit.  I like looser clothing
3.0,This bracelet was a gift for me from my sister.  Purple is also one of my favorite colors.
3.0,"The vest is very thin, not as good as described. Not sure if it is filled by down. I had to return."
3.0,Good style and fit for me. Only problem is they cracked on top above lens.  So upset because i really liked them. Dont think im going to buy another pair
3.0,Overall the product has very nice quality and good material but the bar spring were defective. I had to use pliers to break it because I could not take it off after setting it up.
3.0,"I love the look, but admittedly, the tassels don't stay straight.  They tangle and get crinkly just like hair.  It served the purpose of the look that I wanted and I have learned to treat them carefully and lay them down away from other items."
3.0,I first ordered the charcoal pair and am obsessed so I tried ordering in two different colors - the green and the black. But they are not the same :( they aren't as comfortable. Feels like a more elasticy material.
3.0,Material is rough but the color is great
3.0,"Nice, soft fabric. Handy for after a shower. Not super absorbent but can’t really use it as a towel anyway because of the huge Velcro fastener along the top edge. A simple tie or loop and. covered button would have been better."
3.0,"I actually like the idea but it didnt fit well with my not firm 38D big bust. It didnt hold really well and when I pull it up, it looks weird on the side of the bust and its only covered the nips part. It seems not fit for big bust unless you hv silicon and firm bust. I guess it's recommended for woman who has small bust or never had /breastfeeding a kid"
3.0,Buy up a size or two!  Fabric is very thin...definately a summer gown.  Cute and the colors are great....but had to give away because of size.
3.0,"Love the earrings, but they were too heavy for my ears so I returned them."
3.0,Items are nice. Just did not receive the hair ties! Not a huge problem but do not like expecting something and not getting it.
3.0,It looked like the picture it just didn't fit well on me. Over all though it looked good
3.0,These are okay. They're really cute but the sole is very thick and feels kinda cheap. Almost koke those thick foam flip flops from the 2000s.
3.0,Got these for Florida in April because of their material and breathability.  Put my daughter (who is an adult) could not wear them - they were way too big
3.0,"Touch screen ""pads"" work pretty well.  These are not much more than ""magic gloves"" you can pick up fairly cheap.  They do have slightly more of a lining inside but not enough for New England winter use.  I do like that they have grip on the palms so I could use while driving."
3.0,My grandson only likes to wear dri-fit t-shirts. This was advertised as dry-fit but actually 2 of the shirts were dri-fit and two of the shirts were a cotton blend. The cotton blend shirts had the graphic design. Had I known that half my order was not what I wanted I would not have ordered this item. Disappointed.
3.0,"I was soooo excited to get these kitty ears, but I was a little bit disappointed when they came. To start off, they were late. It was only by three or four days, but still. Then when I put them on I realized the ears weren't centered. So, I have to slide the headband over a little bit so they look right. This wouldn't usually be a problem, but the wire digging into my head on that side is a little bit uncomfortable. Maybe I'll wear this with wigs, so my head has a little bit of protection from these nasty wires, but other than that it's probably going to just sit on my dresser and collect dust. Oh well, after all they were only like two dollars."
3.0,I didn’t like how they hurt my ears.
3.0,Very huge.  Size down.
3.0,It's too small for my nose. It didn't look like I had a nose ring on.
3.0,Very cheaply made. Length is longer than expected . Had to Iron them after Dryer.
3.0,They are very cute but when I got them there were lots of little threads coming out of them. They work well if they are just for a little bit but if worn and washed frequently they don't hold up very well.
3.0,I normally wear a large and could definitely have worn a medium.
3.0,The shirts clean to you wanted them to be a little less tight to skin
3.0,Did not have a choice.  Only one that would fit half dollar coin.
3.0,"It keeps the crud off my pant legs and feet so for that part it's a win, otherwise, for the price, it's fine. Nothing spectacular and you probably won't see this on the runway anytime soon."
3.0,Not as good looking as the picture! Wish it was a little more appealing.
3.0,"I really like the feel of this shirt, it's super soft and looks nice. I ordered a size larger than I use normally since I wanted something loose for working out. What should be baggy is actually fitting at least two sizes smaller than what it should be, it's super super tight on me. I've given it to a skinnier friend that can use it, but I'm super disappointed that the shirt size could possibly be this off."
3.0,"Fabric was good quality and cut, but if you have hips the stitching is tighter at your hips. I think this dress is best for someone with a more narrow figure"
3.0,Too small. One size does not fit all.
3.0,Very light compression.Major back surgery and need strong compression in rib area. Cute but just not enough strength for me.<br />5
3.0,"Giving only 3 stars because Parts were falling off when I received the glasses. Have not been able to wear them lately, but after I do, I will give more feedback"
3.0,"The material is nice as is the print, but it fits like a mumu. Its not cute when it's on."
3.0,"The 8mm earrings (bought both gold plated and sterling silver) are lovely to look at, but the posts on both sets are rough, not smooth enough to put in and remove without hurting my ears and making them sore for several days. Trying hard to justify keeping them, but really disappointed in an earring made in Italy. All other jewelry I have made in Italy has fine finishes. I wonder if other purchasers noticed this problem, or if I should try for a replacement."
3.0,"They fit and looked great but they didn't even last 6 hours before a tiny snag became a giant hole. My daughter is 8 and didn't fall in them or anything, so not sure what happened. Wish we had gotten more than one wear out of them!"
3.0,Nice material but I ordered 1 size up and was still 4 sizes too small returned item
3.0,Definitely not for heavier wrists.  Comfortable for maybe 7 inch wrist.
3.0,"The watch is very cute and seems to be of decent quality and it keeps time well, but it isn't practical to wear. The problem is the the watch face is really high off the band and very thick. I bought it for my daughter but it is way too big. So I tried wearing it myself, but the face is so thick (tall off of my wrist) it catches on everything. Watch fail."
3.0,"Metal is VERY light. Hardly feel weight of ear rings,  lost one without noticing.  Bummer."
3.0,"I'm 5'1"" 110lbs and these were short on me. Very cute"
3.0,"I really wanted to love these pants, but they are too small.  Not a little bit too small, but a lot.  The fabric has almost no stretch to it.  I can barely get the medium on and I'm usually a size 8 in jeans for comparison."
3.0,"The quality of the skirt and the color were correct. Unfortunately the fit was too tight and found it to be more of a fit of a large. Overall if size was correct, it would’ve been an ideal product."
3.0,"The boots fit as expected. The lining is soft and fuzzy. Haven’t had a chance to test them yet in the snow/cold as we purchased ahead of the season for my son so he would not be without once winter starts. I expect them to be ok. Probably not good for an entire day in the snow and cold but warm enough for the 5-10 mins to and from the bus stop and 20min school recess. They were cheap so I don’t expect all Day protection from the elements.<br />The one negative would be how they are packaged. The leg part of the boots were completely crinkled and smooshed. The boots were shrink wrapped together soles out. We have them stuffed with some T-shirt’s to try and straighten them out before he needs them. Will probably be ok, just disappointed. I’ve never seen footwear packaged is such a way. Just doesn’t make sense to me."
3.0,"It’s suppppppper flattering, but the sizing IS weird like other reviews say. I’m between an S and a M, and I decided to get a L. The waist and butt area fit great but the arms were huge so it looked off :( but if I went down a size, I felt like the torso would be too short."
3.0,"Straps are not adjustable (which ran big so I had to cut and sew back together) and the suit in general ran big. Super cute pattern but  not the quality I expected. But for under $8, you get what you pay for."
3.0,It’s super cute but one of the keychains broke on the first day
3.0,This coat was not quite the quality I was expecting it to be. I’m usually torn between ordering a medium or a large so I ordered a large (as I figured I’d have fall clothing underneath). It’s a bit snug around the waist so order up!
3.0,"Nice, but very small and hard to see, okay if you have short hair. Kept them anyway due the price, okay if I put my hair up, do the earrings can be seen."
3.0,"Eh... they were shorter than I expected, and a little too tight on the thighs."
3.0,The emblem faded very fast😔
3.0,"The socks are varying lengths, with one pair reaching higher than the others. The dark colors are thin and can be a bit see through near the thighs."
3.0,Size runs small. Way too small !
3.0,"Thank goodness I read reviews because this is definitely a super small superhero shirt! Normally wear a medium, ordered an XL and it fit perfectly. Otherwise it's a pretty great shirt."
3.0,Cute but wayyyyy too big. I got it in black and it looks more flattering than the white. I’m 4’11 with a very small frame
3.0,"These are almost too sturdy. You have to really work with them to get them stretched out and able to put around your wrist. Otherwise I have no complaints, colors are as shown and overall great purchase."
3.0,"okay.  Be careful with it, it's delicate."
3.0,It was okay. I’m not a big girl but I have big girl legs from working out and it just didn’t feel flattering
3.0,"The red and white tie has glitter in the white portion. I asked my husband if he would wear it. He didn't know if he would or not. The other tie is blue and looks like most blue ties. They are made of polyester and are machine washable. If he doesn't wear the red and white with sparkles tie, I already am churning around ideas in my head for uses."
3.0,Give it a couple months than i can really give my opinion on it
3.0,"These are very comfortable shorts but would not work for the purpose I purchased them for which is running. They are not compressive at all, loose in waist and legs, and I could tell they would ride up if I tried to run in them. Since they are not tight and fabric is so slippery and lightweight, a phone would not stay in place in the pocket. They run a size large. For reference I am 5’3 105lbs and ordered XS."
3.0,Nice necklace looks somewhat like a dozen the photo a little smaller than I expected which is actually a good thing and the center charm peace with the horoscope symbol isn't done isquite as well as a photograph all in all it's an okay necklace shipping took a long time it was late
3.0,"I have a pretty big running sock collection and thought these were really pretty, but I was not in love with the fit.  They were a bit too tight across the top of my ankle and caused irritation of the muscle during my runs.  My husband's however, fit well and he loves them."
3.0,"This is a cute little tie set.  The black tie is decorated with breast cancer awareness ribbons and the pink striped tie has silver threading running through it.  The packaging is nicer than I would expect from tie of this caliber.  The quality is definitely low end but if you aren't planning on wearing the much, it shouldn't be a major issue for you.  The big problem is their length.  They are super short!  My husband's torso could be said to be regular to long, and the ties only came to the bottom of his chest area.  They looked like silly clown ties."
3.0,"Got this for a Maleficent costume last halloween. It was perfect. I'm 5'11 and it was dragging on the ground in the front and back. It is also VERY sheer. Didn't realize my butt cheeks were visible every time I bent over. Over all, If I'd just have gotten a slip I'd really happy given the price. I knew quality wasn't their main target when making this item, but for a halloween costume it was perfect."
3.0,These are really cute but poor fit. They seem to be wider than long. While there is plenty of room to grow out this is too small length wise after one washing. Will have to buy an extender to get some life out of the outfit.
3.0,This are BLUE not black...so they collect dust on my closet instead of getting worn...
3.0,and also a little heavier in fabric.
3.0,Wasn’t a good fit
3.0,Cute dress but the color on top was red skirt is burgandy. Not as shown. But seller was very nice.
3.0,"Hat is average quality and has an okay fit. However, symbol is very cheap...looks like an iron on sticker."
3.0,"Good neck tie, I work for buisness that I thought the smiley face against the navy blue background would put forth a good enthusiasm. But the smiley faces are small, too small. It just looks like a poke-a-dot tie until you face to face."
3.0,It doesn't wash off pretty well. I kept it but I wouldn't recommend it necessarily.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:6b2f89b2aa3bc8cd3e5423a268a85260]] Would be perfect if it actually lit up and worked ...
3.0,I thought it was bigger but it fits and it gets the job done.
3.0,over all this is a good product.. the straps are made out of elasctic which doesnt seem all that sturdy to me. but the brightness and quality for the price isnt bad at all
3.0,Cute top.  But to short for me. Nothing like the girl modeling it. It’s a crop top.
3.0,Do not fit comfortably in my ears.  Would not purchase again.
3.0,Cute dress but high waisted and not great quality. If I was a teenager I might have kept it but it looked wrong on me.
3.0,"Great fit but the color bleeds even after washing. I put this on with wet hair and the fabric stained my bed sheets. I washed it, then wore it a 2nd time and it happened again. You should wash this fabric maybe 3-4 times to make sure it doesn’t bleed onto another fabric"
3.0,"Loved the top! However, although I have a small build and typically wear a 6-8, the medium was snug and I had to return the top."
3.0,"This is a cute dress. I would definitely wear this in the summertime, but without a t-shirt under it as it is tight in the bust. I am a size medium and the size I got was a medium, but was snug in the bust and the waist.<br /><br />It is adorable. It looks like it would be easy to maintain, but will need some ironing, but doable. The material is soft and made of rayon, which is better than polyester, though not as comfortable as cotton. It'll work for a casual wear in the office on a hot summer day.<br /><br />I would definitely get this again, but in a larger size as it seems to be on the smallish size."
3.0,"These are the type of shoes you wear from your house to the car, car to the restaurant, and back to the house.  They are not very comfortable.  The V creates a peak on the front of the shoe and in the back.  It is kind of a hard ""faux"" leather material and it is higher than it looks in the photos. It rubs on the front of your ankle and in the back.  You can wear some small bootie socks to improve some of the comfort but those 2 places are still going to rub due to the ""V"" style.  They are a pretty brown color and a very soft material, but overall not designed for comfort.  They have potential, but I would have probably returned these."
3.0,"I love the idea of this shirt and the quality isn’t all that bad. However, it’s HUGE on me! I ordered a M thinking it would be a looser fitting (I’m usually a small) but my husband who wears a large and has muscles lol can fit it! It’s much too big with large sleeves and collar too."
3.0,"You get what you pay for, that being said this was ok considering the price. My daughter likes to wear her costumes over and over to play. This probably won’t last too long. It does run small. My daughter is a 6x, I got the M(8) just to be safe and it barely fits."
3.0,Para mi tablet
3.0,"Shipping was very fast, I purchased these to wear while plowing snow on my ATV , fit was great, but had a scratch on top on lens, right where my right eye is, but for plowing they work and fit well."
3.0,"This is a cool concept, but when filled with sand, it’s almost impossible to carry and it’s so heavy that the seams are bursting! It does have a carrying handle that’s reinforced. This seems like it would work best if it was used in just a single location; never having to move it after initially placing it on the umbrella pole."
3.0,Cool purse when you need a see thru bag fora concert. Everyday not so much. Never stays right side up. If you forget to zip it easily flips over to dump everything out. Fun and cute but don’t forget to zip!
3.0,I like the material.  It does fit as snug around the ankle as I would like it to.  Over all boat is good for rainy days.
3.0,It's a nice product if you can keep it on your watch. Mine always snaps off and goes flying whenever i reach into my pocket
3.0,Fit is way to small. Fits more like a shirt. Didn't not even try the tights I thought they were leggings.
3.0,This was very cute but it's made from two very different materials. The top was a soft cotton and the bottom was a much rougher stiff material that I didn't think would wash well together. I returned it
3.0,"These are just ok. I ordered to match a black and white striped top. They are a little snug around the leg openings. I'll wear it, but I think there might be a better fitting option out there."
3.0,"I ordered a large which would have been a little big on me.  It's so big, it fits my 3xl partner very well in length and arms and a bit snug around his belly."
3.0,Ordered a size XL and I could not get it over my legs. I am 5'6 170 lbs with a bigger thighs and butt. Luckily my sister is very small about 130 lbs and this did fit her so I kept it. It look very cute on her but I would say that no one who is bigger than a size small or XS will be able to fit into this as the XL was more like an XS. Also took about 20 days to deliver because it came from China.
3.0,These are just what I wanted for everyday wear.  I especially like the elbow length sleeves which are difficult to find.
3.0,"I bought the watch in Dec. 2018 for a Christmas gift for my husband.  Due to a variety of circumstances...he did not start wearing the watch until September 2019--it stayed in the box (untouched) until that time...He has worn the watch a maximum of 10 times and when he put it on this morning, the second hand had fallen off and was floating in the face of the watch.  He loves the watch but now is uncertain as to what our next step is.  Jewelers are hesitant to even work on these watches..We had a link put in the strap and the jeweler was uncomfortable doing that."
3.0,"Wore it twice, it broke, breads lost. It smells bad too.  I started with Lysol... Later perfume.  It still smells like carcass."
3.0,It’s nice but runs small.
3.0,Larger than anticipated and didn't shrink. Ok for bumming around the house but I don't love it. Ok for the price I suppose.
3.0,"Very pretty !!!!but, extremely thin I'm afraid it will bend as soon as I wear it."
3.0,One of the bracelets has issues with the magnet latch. It doesn't stay closed.
3.0,"Too short, small size"
3.0,"The other reviewers helped me understand what to expect. I personally wanted these for the middle size pair. And after swapping around backings I have a pair I can work with. But these earrings are overall a hot mess.<br />It’s not that they have stripped posts. It’s a combination of 2 other problems: 3 out of 6 backings have too wide of holes & slide on the post threads.<br />And the other problem is one of the earrings, I like, appears to have an uneven post, because the other backings slide at least 2/3 up the post & catch back on the threads closest to the ear.<br />Also the backings are not gold. All 6 are some pewter colored grey metal.<br />So really crappy earrings. But I’m working with them."
3.0,I was so excited when I got this piece I love bling.  Unfortunately after 2 days the bling disappeared
3.0,"The fit is nice, but it was a much brighter yellow than I expected. I still wear it, but it's not exactly as pictured."
3.0,My son has outgrown his youth large pair of gloves so I went ahead and ordered him these in an Adult Small. They are a little to big but are a nice set of gloves for him.
3.0,"Great looking sunglasses, loved the wood look. I wish they had different sizes as these were way to big for my face. I had to send them back."
3.0,Too big for a Pandora
3.0,Could have worked but was too tight in the chest & arms. I’m 40D & usually a 14-16.
3.0,"Excellent quality. Excellent brand. Super fast service. But I don't think they fit as expected. I am 40 waist and  I bought  for a 2XL package. They are definitely super tight and very uncomfortable. Super tight. And as they are made of very good material, are tight at the waist until the piece lasts. Very uncomfortable."
3.0,"I purchased this dress at the last minute for a more relaxed wedding. While the color of the dress is beautiful, I was not a fan of the half slip. Meaning, that the dress was made of a thin material while the bottom half had a lining that stopped above the knee. Another drawback includes the hole to tie the wrap dress. While I was wearing the dress a friend pointed out that they could see my skin through the hole on the side. Just an FYI."
3.0,"The shirt looks cute, fits a little bigger and longer than expected. Maybe size down for a nicer fit. The fabric is not that soft, however, I have not washed it yet. Hopefully that will shrink it and soften it up a bit."
3.0,"Very soft. Nice and long. Love that it has pockets but the way they are, it brings your eyes to the hips."
3.0,Beautiful colors. Fits way to tight :(
3.0,"This is a beautiful bikini that’s very well-made, but it runs REALLY small. I’m usually an XS, so I ordered a medium and it was way too small. Also, the bottoms look like the sides are adjustable (which would be great) but it’s just for looks and not for function."
3.0,"This gavel is perfect to complete the outfit of a judge. Lightweight and perfect size for any hand, kid or adult. But it broke after a few hits of pretending to use it as a normal gavel, bummer."
3.0,"By reading reviews, I ordered a size XL but it was way too large .. should have ordered mine.. So returned and ordered again in my size"
3.0,I was sorta disappointed with this dress. I looked at it online a dozen times before I bit the bullet and purchased and I feel sorta meh about it.  I guess I don't have the right body type as the hip area almost comes up to my chest.  This causes the bottom half of the dress to flare out far up my torso and makes me look bigger than I actually am.  I'm hoping maybe if I lose a few pounds it'll be more flattering.
3.0,I loved the item how it fit but the material seamed cheap will be returning because the stitches have discoloration completely white not black
3.0,"Comfy and nice, but a bit small and definitely transparent."
3.0,Good price for this handbag
3.0,The ear straps stretch out and makes it hard to keep mask on/covering nose and mouth.
3.0,"Loved the dress but to small. Also returning they do not cover postage, because it is considered international it is $20."
3.0,"It doesn't work as well as my last one, bought a long time ago from a different manufacturer."
3.0,"The one I received doesn't have the white, small pearls as shown. The pearls are all very large. However, it's not bad for the price. A clasp would be nice, so that it could be doubled."
3.0,"I'm giving the bracelets a 3 overall because one is absolutely beautiful and the other has not come close to meeting my expectations.<br /><br />The bracelet with the phrase plate &#34;Where there's a will there's a way&#34; is the problem child. The leather strap in the middle came out of its bracket on one side two days after I started wearing it. I was able to push it back in but I anticipate more issues with that in the future. The rhinestones/crystals at the respective edges of the phrase plate overlap the letters and are too big for the size of the plate giving it a gaudy appearance for a masculine bracelet in my opinion.<br /><br />The other bracelet fits fine, albeit there is no room for looseness, and is very attractive on my wrist. The clasps take some practice to close with one hand but are very effective at holding the bracelets closed.<br /><br />I didn't expect much for the price but it's literally been a mixed bag for my experience.<br /><br />Update 3/31/16 - The company contacted me and sent me replacement bracelets. I am going to wear the one that I had issues with for a while and see if I have any problems. If not then I will update my rating accordingly."
3.0,"First off, these sandals are really cute and seemed well made. That said, the ankle strap made these unwearable. It is very tight and has zero give. Although I could zip up the back, I could see that wearing these for any length of time would become excruciating...and I have very average sized ankles. Other than the ankles, they fit very well and were true to size. Sorry I had to return them."
3.0,"I like the material used. The pockets are good, color as expected. My only two complaint are the crotch is a bit large compared to my 511s, Propper and Tru-Spec. The second is that I like the hidden elastic band on other pants, specifically my Tru-Spec. It feels and looks more professional."
3.0,Fast delivery.  Fits perfect.  In my opinion it is to thick.  i am asthmatic and i feel that it make it difficult for me to breath.
3.0,"Not one of my favorite pair of shorts. I'd imagine they'd be less loose than they are, however, they fit well and I'm able to work out in them - that's all that matters. The pockets are pretty legit. I had my phone in one and keys and wallet in the other with more room to spare on either side. The fit is loose and wide in the thighs / adductors section. They're not too short and not too long."
3.0,"I liked the overall fit and look of this dress. I bought the blue one to wear to a blue-themed black tie work event. After reading other reviews, I thought a size small would fit my 5' 2&#34; frame just fine (I weigh about 120 lbs). However, I have a long torso and I'm a bit &#34;busty&#34; after having a baby. The dress looked fine, but was very very short (the front part where it splits, and has a panel under). When I moved at all, it would ride up and barely cover my underwear. I thought it was too risque to wear to the event, so unfortunately I'm returning it."
3.0,Not sure. It is definitely cute and drapes well. The quality of the material is what scares me.<br />I'm not sure it will be the same dress after its washed.
3.0,I orders the 3-4 it fit a little snug and the quality was a little poor. Lots of strings hanging off and fit different than pictured but it still looked cute.
3.0,Legs are long. Fit a little snug around the waist and hip area.
3.0,My ears are allergic to everything and I thought stainless steel would help. My ears became infect after a couple weeks of wearing them even with every other day cleaning. I liked how pretty they were though.
3.0,Nice dress great fit very comfortable and soft material. I was going to give 4 stars but the color of the dress in the picture looks white but it is actually gray with the animal print. But I was okay with that. Looks great on.
3.0,"At the price, you cannot go wrong. However, it's not a steal of a deal. This is just a very causal ""teenage"" leather hand band. If that is what you expect, I recommend buying this."
3.0,"I love this shirt. It’s perfect for layering tops because it’s a good crop length and the collar and neckline are great. However, it didn’t last me very long, and quickly pilled when I layered it."
3.0,"Super super small for the price of money. The eye is just as big as the ball, I would have liked the eye to be bigger. It gets lost on my belly button"
3.0,The clips to adjust the ear loops are a hard plastic that in a short time hurt the back of my ears. I have other masks that have a round soft clip. The mask itself is good but I can't tolerate the hard clip.
3.0,3 stars only bc it runs super extra small. I ordered a next size up bc of the reviews and it's still small.
3.0,"Everything is as pictured but the colors are way off. The mask is great quality, wings are two separate pieces."
3.0,"The only disappointing feature that even though it allows to set the month, but the watch itself no where to be found to be able to display the month on the dial."
3.0,They are really light and plastic feeling and the second inner hoop doesn't move.
3.0,"It is, as advertised, 'lenses for ....RB8302'. They fit. Are they, in any way, comparable? No. Way too light. Disappointed, for the amount of money they cost. Had I seen them in a store, I wouldn't have paid more than $10."
3.0,"The shorter pair easily stretched but aren’t that durable but as soon as I tried to put the long pair on, they tore on the ends."
3.0,"Lightweight, runs large.  Nice style, though.  I will be giving it away to someone larger."
3.0,More pink than red.  Very large
3.0,Don't seem any lighter than the 20-30 mmhg socks. Haven't put them on as yet...will let you know more when wearing them.
3.0,Too long for a petite
3.0,"These are really too tight. I wasn’t able to wear the skull ones, the only ones I could wear were the bones but even they were too tight after 13 hours. The pattern doesn’t allow much stretch, even the L/XL size."
3.0,"Way small in the bust area, Had to return it."
3.0,Nice top but it was too big. Will be giving it away since I do not have transportation to go to the post office to return it.
3.0,"The minute I took it it of the bag, before even trying it on, the gathering at the bust line popped. The dress was still wearable but not gathered at top as it should have been<br />Pattern very pretty, light and comfortable.  Quality disappointing, but still a cute summer dress. You get what you pay for"
3.0,"I thought it was cute, but when I got it, it was 2 sizes to small."
3.0,They seem to be of decent quality but they were WAY too small and there was very little stretch.
3.0,"Very roomy toiletry bag. I like it. The material could be a little sturdier, but other than that, it holds a good amount."
3.0,"The outfit looks nice, it keeps me warm, however, super super cheaply made zipper, broke the first day after zipping and unzipping all day."
3.0,"I bought two versions of this dress, but have only received one. It was sewn crooked and in the imagine the elastic band part of the dress looks like it sits at the waist but it actually sits under the bust and caused bunching at my breast area. This isn’t a bad dress actually, but it really didn’t look like in the picture so I returned it. Hopefully when I receive my next one it will be better. I got a small and am 5’6 135 lbs 32D."
3.0,Not very good quality material.  I can feel that it will not last the entire summer
3.0,"I got this for my wife, and this is what she says. This dress is made of a medium quality knit. The design is cute and sexy, but the fit isn't great. It is short waisted. It is tighter overall than most size M dresses. So she feels it is okay, but not great."
3.0,OMG what can I say about this cute dress..<br />Well I was looking forward to this dress but Unfortunately due to my body type it didnt fit at all. This dress run super small like super small.. it disnt cover my backside at all.. I love this dress but I had to send it back and I could not even exchange for a bigger size because That was the biggest size they had. But if this dress would have fit me well I would have give this dress a 10
3.0,The hat was nice until it was packed into too small a box which caused the brim to be bent up a sharp angles on two sides and the back.
3.0,I ordered several different colors of these and they are good for relaxing in. They all have the same &#34;flaw&#34; though. The arm portion gaps weirdly right where it starts at the armpit. Enough so several people have commented on it.
3.0,It's very thin and I think worth less than what I paid.. but it's a jacket.
3.0,"The quality of the jumper itself is very nice. However, their sizing chart and customer advice is way off. According to the chart I bought a large and two of me could have fit in it. So be aware they run large."
3.0,I bought  two pieces.. one was  very good and other was bad quality. no finishing. I was disappointed.<br />Every piece has missing/broken one kundan
3.0,"I'm 5'7"" and a 36D. The dress overall fit well. I had a few problem areas that the dress did not suit. I have longer legs so while the slit up the front center of the dress looks cute while standing still, be prepared to pull it down every few feet while walking. Or just take little steps. It also did not fit my bust well. The seam for the bust line fell above where it should have and ended up on the lower half of my actual breast. Hard to tell in the third photo, but the seam to fit my bust needed to be about an inch and a half lower. The material is also thin. Be sure to wear black underwear. It is see through in direct light."
3.0,"Nice casual pant she says and the material would definitely dry quickly.  There are two ""catches"" she says.  1) They run very small so size up and she says size up two sizes - this from a 5'8"" 125lb fit woman who thought ordering a size 6 would do it--but not so much.  2) The material is ""noisy"" when moving and she thinks that might put some ladies off a bit--she does not like the rustling or scratching sound.  Other than that, the look is nice, the gray color is nice and the build quality seems quite excellent."
3.0,They are much thinner than expected for being advertised as a boot sock.
3.0,Got these for my husband....Does the intended job and looks great style wise. Only down side is there is a constant rainbow effect when looking through the lenses.
3.0,The material is a bit scratchy. Other than that it's a cute sweater.
3.0,"I have a CPAP machine I use at home.  When I go on trips I do not like to lug it around and take up space in my luggage, so I bought one of these things just for kicks.  Well, it worked; i.e., it stopped the snoring apparently.  I was asleep at the time, but my wife tells me it worked--Hah!  Anyway, the downside is getting used to the contraption.  It felt somewhat uncomfortable to me, but I did get to sleep.  Like everything else I suppose, it's a matter of getting used to it.  It is adjustable for tension, but don't make it too tight.  It just has to keep your trap shut, not hermetically sealed!  I skeptical, but it did work for me--so I'm told."
3.0,"Easy to attach and detach from my Samsung galaxy watch and really easy to adjust length. However, I  got a rash after wearing. Tried only wearing i during the day while working but rash ontonied to get worse."
3.0,Like the producr but the bag was cut open and was missing 8 pieces.
3.0,"It's fine, but it's not idiot-proof. I tried to undo the clasp to adjust the strap to my wrist size, but I bent the clasp because I didn't know what I was doing. Now the clasp won't stay shut. If the clasp was sturdier this might not have happened. I don't feel like dropping another ten bucks to get another one so I can do it right, but at least we can all learn from my hasty mistakes.<br /><br />Edit: Ok I broke down and bought another one. It works fine and makes my watch look fancier than it is. Also, the clasp is steadily getting harder and harder to use, presumably due to the weak metal it's made of. I increased my review from two stars to three stars."
3.0,Faded to purple after awhile of wearing. Love the fit.
3.0,"The shirt is nice quality but it does not fix like it is pictured. I chose to return it. However the vendor was very friendly, helpful, and prompt with my return request,"
3.0,"I just got these, and they are going back. Two things: (1) they are small. (2) They are a solid pattern.  There is no eyelit design on them.  Pro: I do think they are pretty good quality for the price."
3.0,The ship broke off after one wear:(
3.0,Bought for my wife who always has a cold nose. Did not expect much andthat is what I got. Nose part is fine but the ties are coming apart.
3.0,Didn’t like how it looks
3.0,"This is a nice sleep shirt, fits great. The only thing is that the elastic is too tight on your arms."
3.0,"This seems like a great idea but doesn't work for me at all. I purchased this to keep from losing my rings while swimming. As soon as my hand got wet, the medium cover and my rings slid right off my finger. So I tried the smallest cover and had the same result. The small cover was a struggle to get on. But once on, it was stretched out and also slid right off my finger when wet.<br />I can see that this cover might protect your rings from scratches. But any liquid, lotion, or soap will still get into it. And once stretched over your rings, it does not hug your finger. Oh I wish it worked!<br />I recommend the cover that is just a black stretchy spandex band that slips over your finger"
3.0,"The product is good but the material is too hot I leave in a very hot city, for me is not gonna work"
3.0,"Like so many other reviewers stated, I ordered black, but received cream speckled with orange and green. The hat is thick, and made even thicker by the fleece lining. The pom on top is large. These features make the hat very nice.<br /><br />The faux ear muffs are off white, so they don't quite go with the rest of the hat. They are also flat. They are just a weird accent to this hat, so I may remove them.<br /><br />I have a large head, so it's hard to find a hat that fits. This hat is too small. I would say the size is perfect for a woman with a medium-sized head."
3.0,Comfy but below average in terms of flattering. On the short side.
3.0,Fit was a bit big and the toggles looked cheap.  This was returned.
3.0,love the inscription and color and bought a small but it ran large and an extra small is not offered.
3.0,"I'm a watch collector and I mainly collect new and vintage watches in the ""affordable"" price range. This Benyar automatic is right in that range at $118. Let's look at it in detail.<br /><br />It's a 41mm case size with a 20mm lug width and it's 13mm tall. It's a Rolex Submariner homage so you know the basic style. It's all polished except for the outer sections of the bracelet. It has 100m water resistance and no screw-down crown so, it's not really a diver. It has a sapphire crystal and that's definitely a plus in this price range. The watch and bracelet are all stainless and it has an exhibition case back.<br /><br />The good: This watch is mostly well made, using good materials. The sapphire crystal is great at this price. The Chinese movement surprised me by being only 36 seconds fast in a week - that's a fraction over 5 seconds a day - and that's not bad at all for a Chinese automatic. The bracelet is solid link with hollow end links - normal at this price - and the clasp is secure if nothing special.<br /><br />The bad: The bezel is terrible with a lot of play in it. It's maybe 60 clicks and you can move it a second or two without hearing a click. The exhibition case back only shows you a crude looking rotor and really doesn't look good. There's no screw-down crown and only 100m water resistance. The overall finishing shows some scratches here and there, mainly on the case back and bracelet, and generally poor fit and finish. The ""12"" and ""6"" markers are not lumed so you have these big gaps at those positions when looking at it in the dark.<br /><br />I can compare this to an Invicta Pro Diver 8926 which I own and costs only $80 yet has 200m water resistance and screw down crown with a unidirectional bezel that's a true 120 clicks. The Invicta doesn't have a sapphire crystal but has a much higher level of fit and finish overall with a Seiko NH-35A movement which when I checked it initially was only 9 seconds fast in a week.<br /><br />This Benyar is just too expensive for what you get. Yes, it has a sapphire crystal, but it lacks overall refinement and simply doesn't offer enough value. There's certainly some things in the good column, but just not enough to overcome the negatives. This is a three star watch."
3.0,"It needs to be fix/ sew in the opening of the shoulders, both sides, the rest of my order was fine"
3.0,"Cute and the quality is really nice, however it runs much larger than expected. I’m typically an XS (2-4) and based on the reviews I ordered a small. However this fits like medium to large on me (I like a snug fit). Since I ordered the smallest size they offer and the quality is good I’ll either keep it to layer or give it away."
3.0,Is way too small
3.0,Mine were true to size and very comfy. The bad thing about mine was that the legs are different lengths! Very noticeable! Quick fix with my sewing machine but I shouldn't had to.
3.0,i got this for vacation. eve tho i never used it it was nice went i tried it on
3.0,"It is of low quality. But for the price, I cannot complain."
3.0,Love the earring shape.  My problem is the post hoop is too thick for my piercing.
3.0,My son loved these shoes but a few days after he wore them half the lights on one of the shoes didn't turn on anymore. I will reorder them again and hope for the best.
3.0,"Only a 3 star because this thing really needs to come with instructions. Everything else is fine, but put putting it together takes an act of god(or whatever)"
3.0,It is a cute dress but I am a size 16 and this is a soft clinging material and was not flattering on my figure at all!
3.0,"I thought that these were much smaller than they were. The picture makes them look very small, like I wanted for my upper ear. Turns out they will be used for my second piercing. I’ll have to find a different one for my upper ear. A bit disappointed."
3.0,Great quality shirt but it was a bit smaller than I expected which was a bit of a let down but I made it work for what I needed. Just make sure to go a bit bigger than you need unless you want it to fit tight.
3.0,"Needed a discrete way to secure my wedding band after losing some weight. The soft squishy silicon feels much nicer than some of the other hard plastic ring spacers I've tried before. Another plus is that the silicon is quite clear so at a glance, a casual observer wouldn't notice you're wearing it. These are probably the only two positive things. Unfortunately, it's a bit fussy to get it positioned just right so that it's completely hidden underneath the band. Even though my ring has a wide band it's still hard to hide these underneath without bits of it squishing out.  These might work if you have a ring size that is significantly larger than one you typically wear but if you're only a half size off it might not be the best choice."
3.0,"I loved the dress, very pretty and not something you see everyday. But the straps are not adjustable... had to return because it made my tits look smashed"
3.0,"The shoe size is a bit smaller than normal so I had to return it and Amazon ended up charging about $7, which is about 25% of the cost of the shoes.  The leather doesn't look too good and it covers too much of the feet!"
3.0,"Hmmm ... what to do about this dress ...<br />Fit is definitely cute! Its a little big under the arms but purchasing a smaller size would mean tight in the chest and the rest of the dress. It's under the arms anyway so no one can see it. Pockets are cute and overall fit is good. I'm 5'9 and length was just right.<br />I'm not sure if I'll be keeping this dress though only because of the material. Its that material that shows creases and folds. Out of the bag you can see where it was folded, and I don't mean nice crisp fold lines, I mean when the material gets a little &#34;dark&#34; on the fold line - and the lines are all over - borderline would only use it around the house kind of lines. Pretty sure its going to be difficult to never have those lines especially after washing it. I don't want to try to iron it out bc I'm afraid of what that might do to the material and then I might not be able to return. So I'm not sure ... not super expensive but for just over $21 and not sure how the material will hold up, it might wind up as a return."
3.0,"I purchased this for my son (11 year old) for Christmas and within months after purchasing, the hands on the watch stopped working properly. Hence, the 3 stars. The digital display still works and keeps the correct time, however, we wanted him to learn how to read time analog and this watch sadly disappointed us."
3.0,Scarf was not the color I wanted.
3.0,"Wanted it to be a little more stretchy. The end of the sleeves don’t adhere to my arm, it’s a little open and loose which makes them ride up, so that’s annoying but still pretty cute overall"
3.0,"In the picture, the dress falls about mid thigh. Obviously not the case. As you can see it falls mid calf, and in not a short girl. I'm 5'6"" and 125 lbs. I ordered a small, and it fit how it was supposed to, but just way longer than pictured. Slightly disappointed."
3.0,Cheap came slanted on one side
3.0,Too strong
3.0,"Cute but very, very small."
3.0,"So, a lot of people are saying how this thing doesn't fit right or it's really tight. Well, of course it is! It's a bike jacket. Like all bicycle jersey's, or it should pretty close to skin tight to limit wind resistance. Knowing that, I ordered a medium and it fits like a medium. It's not super tight, but the fit is perfect.<br /><br />That being said, I bought this thinking it was water proof. It's not water proof, at all. The water goes right through it and it will stick right to your skin -- not fun. Oh well."
3.0,The Amazon description said it has two side water bottle pockets. It DOES NOT.
3.0,Super cute but the button hole wasn’t cut and it was a little tight around the hips.
3.0,Dress is ok for what it cost. I am large in the bust (40H) and typically have trouble finding dresses to fit that area. This dress was almost too big up top. It seems like it was sewn poorly though so maybe not all of them fit this way. The arm hole was way to big as well. It will need to be altered to wear...not sure if its worrth the money but I am going to keep it and try.
3.0,Sticky pad would not hold the weight of the headphones
3.0,This would have been great had I received it by the date promised. I ordered it pretty far in advance so the fact that it showed up past the latest date promised doesn't sit well with me. It arrived crammed in a small package which is fine. The item was as expected.
3.0,was a bit to small of a swim suit for me.  I wanted more material.
3.0,Will wear it regularly.
3.0,A little cheesy
3.0,"Cute pattern, quality material, looks so cute until you put it on. It puffs out around the stomach making it look huge. Unless you have an extremely flat stomach, this is not a flattering look. Disappointed because it was so cute"
3.0,The shirt is cute but not what I expected. It's much shorter than an average t-shirt. The picture on the front is done with very cheap vinyl like material so it kinda makes noise when I move and I'm pretty sure it will start peeling off after a wash or 2. Probably will not wear it much honestly.
3.0,I'm 5 foot 2 and I weigh a hundred and 112 lbs. I ordered an extra large and it is too small was not happy with my purchase
3.0,"They are okay. They are light and breathe well so happy with that. But, they are kind of short and I was thinking they went further up my calf. They stay up okay for now. We will see as they wear."
3.0,Towo big
3.0,"Really cute, but one of the balls fell out.  :(  I can't find it anywhere. Would have wore them all the time, as I love the little bit of sparkle they add."
3.0,"Dress is bigger than what it should be. Unusual wear xl and it's slack on me. I am 180lbs, bought the xl, measurements b40-w38-h44. The print is the exact same thing but not as bright as the picture but still bright. And the material is thin thin thin! However it does not fade when washed and this dress is so soft and comfortable I can wear is everyday"
3.0,2 sizes larger than I would have expected for an XL. Otherwise I like it.
3.0,"Cute skirt but it is navy blue, not black as described."
3.0,Having a really hard time getting the creases out of this top.
3.0,Run small. Average adult head - they are too small.
3.0,"i like the product, but it came late 2 days."
3.0,Already falling apart after a month
3.0,Not quite efficient
3.0,"A little too small for what I needed, but fine other than that."
3.0,Received my order today. This money belt is a bit small and will fit well on my wife and daughter. It will work for the trip we are taking.
3.0,"This dress looks beautiful on the model, however, it didnt look as beautiful on me. The top part is tshirt material which was a little see through.  The bottom on this dress was SO heavy. Since the material was so heavy it didnt cling, which was good, but it was a dress I ordered for summer and it would be too hot."
3.0,I ordered this shirt in green and pale gray and the small fit wonderfully. I ordered it in black and the small was half as big as the ones I bought in other colors.
3.0,Nice but material not as expected.  Super thin material
3.0,It works as its supposed to just never received charger or instruction booklet for it.
3.0,"I took a chance on this since a size wasn't given. I was sent a size medium. I usually go for a large these days, so I'd say this is probably pretty close to true to size, since it was a little too small for my tastes. I like things to flow around my stomach more and this one was a bit tighter above my stomach, which just made my belly look bigger. That might not have been an issue with a bigger size, though. It was also a little lower cut than I prefer. There is smocking on the back, which usually isn't the most comfortable thing for me. This one wasn't comfortable at all. While I do believe the sizing contributed to the discomfort, I don't think it was completely to blame. The outside material isn't my favorite and it's on the rough side. It does have a softer lining. It's a really cute dress, though I would have used it as a tunic had it worked for me, since it's too short for my tastes. Even if I'd got a larger size, I still think my rating would be the same, simply based on how uncomfortable it was on me."
3.0,"When I opened the product, I immediately knew the quality wasn’t quite what the photo portrayed and the color wasn’t as dark either. It was more of a Christmas Red rather than a Wine Red color as shown and listed. Once I pulled the dress out, I noticed a strange smell. I went ahead and put it on and the head hole was definitely small so make sure that if you decide on this dress, you do hair and makeup after putting it on. The dress also didn’t arrive on time. So all in all, not an awesome experience unfortunately but for the price... it’s not a terrible option. I’m 5’,2” 140lbs ... I try to be detailed so this can be as helpful as possible."
3.0,Quality and color were great. Just too big. Had to return.
3.0,"Not disappointed. Not wowed. I wanted these colors. That’s good. What I don’t prefer over the other one I typically wear is that it has a buckle rather than a pin fastener and the strap is flat rather that slightly curved on the bottom inner side of the band. A slight cup to the strap makes it more comfortable with less actual skin contact, keep the wrist cooler."
3.0,They are good quality. But the reason I'm giving a 3 star rating is because they dont look Rose Gold. They are much closer to gold in color. I took a photo with the silver and the rose gold next to another gold stud I have.
3.0,"The online photo doesn't show the pads through the shirt, but mine does. Now I can only wear it as an undershirt."
3.0,"Cute shirt with good support, but runs small. I'm 5'5"" and 150 lbs, and a large was too small for me. It's very tight. Unfortunately I'll keep it since they don't offer anything larger to exchange for."
3.0,Material too stiff
3.0,It's the perfect color! Feels soft! It's just very narrow in the torso. I would go up 2 sizes but then arms may be to long...bummed brcait was a Great color!
3.0,"Returned product, since the pants did not."
3.0,I at first thought it was real nice.....however it has not held up. The jewels fell out and its tarnished.
3.0,"I gave these Pro Compression PC Runner compression stocking a 2.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Fun colors<br />Shipped quickly<br />Easy purchase thru Amazon<br /><br />Cons:<br />Price<br />Compression is not great. *I have some socks from UA that feel like these.  So, to pay $20 agh...not so great. I have to wear compression knee highs due to reflux disease, so to go from the PRO Compression knee high great form fit and feel-great compression this running sock of theirs just isn't the same quality."
3.0,Large and heavy. It was stunning just not practical as a broach unless wearing on something that can handle the weight.
3.0,Ok for small heads only.
3.0,Should have went one size bigger with the elastic around the middle
3.0,"Size up, the top look very cheap."
3.0,I love it. I wear it almost every day. Unfortunately the silver is rubbing off the back of the charm.
3.0,Seam is a little crooked on the right collarbone.
3.0,I ordered the black and the grey. The sleeves on the black dress were much tighter than the grey one. I am sending the black dress back. The grey one fit fine. Tag says 65%polyester 35%cotton. Both are size large. I liked the fabric even though there is no spandex.
3.0,The back sides of these tend to roll/ride up.
3.0,"It’s just ok.  Material is kind of like cardboard, but it’s not bad for the money.  Needs to be broken in a little to fit well"
3.0,Too hot to wear in Midwest weather.
3.0,I got a medium & I am usually a small and the medium still didn’t fit. It was squeezing my arms sooo tight so if you have tiny tiny arms you’ll be fine. There’s no tags at all on the inside and it is quite see through. Unfortunately didn’t work for me.
3.0,"This JoJo Siwa jacket is cute!! My daughter asked for this for Christmas and I was able to find it in her size (10). However I should have sized up, it runs small. It’s not a warm jacket so my daughter wears a sweatshirt underneath, but it will be a nice jacket for late spring or early summer. It washes well and doesn’t shrink. I air dry it and the color has not faded."
3.0,"None of the bands latch well and they keep popping open at random times. We initially thought maybe the problem was the watch as ALL bands had the same problem, but then we tried the original bands and another brand and it did not happen. So sadly, as nice as they are, they did not work well for us."
3.0,It is a little too tight and I ordered my usual size (large) but it’s fine. Also the material wrinkles easily so I know before every wear I have to iron it.
3.0,"I ordered the black knit .The color was darker than photo , the ear  muffs are  BLACK . The ear muffs are small ,with hair to small for an adult in my opinion .They are a little adjustable to smallish . Warm and nice looking. About 12 to 13 inches inside  curve or smaller .May work well for a child ."
3.0,"The front was longer than I expected. It hangs down past my knees, the back hit around the hips."
3.0,"Quality is good, but they run small. I wear 9 1/2 shoe, & I can wear them, but they are confining, &tight. Gave hem to my 8 year old grandson, & he loves them."
3.0,"Although I cannot attest to the water and wind properties, all the reviews I read spoke of the quality feel, the snappy way the umbrella opened and closed.  All I can say is, don't try to close this without two hands and lots of time.  I've probably owned 30 or more umbrellas in my lifetime and this is so far the hardest to close."
3.0,"Great customer service and the locket itself was beautiful and great quality. The only problem was it was too small for my pearl! We tried putting three different pearls in it and the locket was to small and would not close around it.  So, only buy this product if you have a small pearl. I appreciate the easy return process though."
3.0,"The Blotona Toddler girl Summer cotton Linen Outfit is made well, extremely soft. It would have been so cute but is runs really small. This particular 2T item seems more like a 18 month.<br />Soft, adorable just order up a couple sizes."
3.0,Work out fine..
3.0,"These feel nice and wash up nicely. Saldly, they are too small, measuring from the top of the nose to the chin, and so they slip off my nose when I talk."
3.0,"Really cute- but maybe best for a taller, thinner woman? I'm 5'2&#34; and about 114lbs, pretty thin-wear a size 0/2 at the Gap (for reference).  The armholes are very large and bag out too much for my taste and comfort. Great fabric, so soft. Just must be designed for a longer torso and larger chest?"
3.0,"I have allergic reactions to most non-titanium metals. So I was excited to get these. It fit and looked good.<br />But, I starting having reactions.<br />So, 3 stars because I really wanted to love them."
3.0,"Nice satin cap, keeps the moister , but the color of the cap is allllllll over my pillows and I purchase the black one a little disappointed"
3.0,"I was expecting better from Punk Rave, this is the first thing I've gotten from them and I'm a bit disappointed.  The material is okay, the seams are designed to show rough edges, which feels like sloppiness disguised as fashion.  But the big problem I had was the sizing.  I ordered a size up (L) as some reviews suggested, and the waist is super roomy but the sleeves are almost unwearably tight.  I will not return because I despise returning things, I'll probably try to alter it myself but I'm seriously disappointed considering the price, and I don't think I'll be looking for more from them."
3.0,It’s regal however a bit too large for what I was looking fir
3.0,"The skirt is very comfortable, soft, and ankle length on me at 5'10, which is what I was looking for. But I ordered the light brown color and it's more of a pinkish brown. Doesn't quite match the things I bought it to go with but I've made it work with other things because it's so comfortable! Would order from this line again."
3.0,My son is an average 2 year old but I ordered 4T so he could grow into it & get many wears. The 4T was extremely tight & narrow! I could barely get over his head. I should’ve kept tags on so I could return. It’s a cute concept shirt but order 3-4 sizes up!
3.0,So cute but the strap was not stitched on one end.
3.0,"proper band size, but the cups are better suited for a 30B. I'm 38B/C."
3.0,"[[ASIN:B071HSZQF7 ACEVOG Womens Short Sleeve Swing Pleated Casual Flared Midi Dress with Belt]]<br /><br />Cute dress!  Sexy yet modest at the same time. I like the fabric, it's stretches but it keeps it's shape and does not get lose after wearing it for some time. Good work dress...<br /><br />I am 5'6, 160lbs, 30nch waist and 36DD chest - size Small"
3.0,It looks more stainless steel industrial and less silver &#34; jewelry like&#34; than I had hoped.
3.0,too thin and tight
3.0,Got it for my girlfriend who wears a size small. This was just way to short for it to be comfortable.
3.0,I loved the style and cloth was a bit strechy but the top whee the chest is at there is a v shaped wire that kept coming out fro the sides. It is very pretty but downside is that and the fact that the glitter litterally looks glues on. Its perfect as a costume or if youre in a dark place where you dont look at things in detail.
3.0,"Doesn’t fit the watch perfectly, as it is not the original band. Button seems to be a little too far in from the slot, so takes a bit of work to get to. Band is comfortable and could fit a large wrist. It was fairly easy to install. Have the blue HR that I wear to work and workout/swimming, so it will work until I need another band or new workout watch.<br />Update 4/20/19- Bought in January and it broke today. The band broke from the watch unit- there was already a gap there from the initial installation, and today while tightening the band it finally gave way. Updated pictures attached, too. Not sure where I’ll buy the new band from, but since I use this watch for work I will replace the band soon. Original 4stars, update 3stars because I wish it was more durable and lasted longer."
3.0,Runs really big! I'll need to downsize by two sizes.
3.0,Item runs true to size.
3.0,"Narrow, I have another pair of boots of theirs, didn't need any break in time and are oh so comfy. These on the other hand run narrow and pinch. Don't buy these unless you can try them on locally. Mine are just sitting now :("
3.0,"Too short waisted for me. Pretty, but will be donating it to someone lucky at a thrift store."
3.0,"This is very soft and fits well, but it is a very light blue. Not at all the color I was expecting."
3.0,Comfortable  - a little tighter than expected based on size chart - washes well (no shrinking)
3.0,Would have been better if hands were not white. That are hard to see on the white face.
3.0,The color was a bit more yellow tone then I really liked.
3.0,Not for plus size. The xxl is more like a large. Fits my 13 year old who is not plus sized.
3.0,I like this it looks very nice on.
3.0,"While this is super cute, the cut of the one I got was awful. The anchors are so spread out that I ended up with a mostly blue half with a few partial anchors on it. There are only anchors near the middle and edge. Its not worth returning and we will probably still use it but its a bit disappointing."
3.0,"Mask fits pretty tightly around the ears of a 12yo but is workable - fits better than an adult sized mask would. Probably is better for kids up to age 11. The picture of the extender fitted around a thin white string is misleading. There is no way the floppy rubber extender will stay on the thick black elastic ear loops of these masks. Tie dye designs are cool, very vibrant."
3.0,Doesnt stay put
3.0,Too small at the top/ I have large breast!
3.0,its not what i expected.
3.0,I’m normally a medium the medium fits like a large.
3.0,I liked this shirt and wore it a few times. Last time I noticed a small hole in the seem on the sleeve.  Therefore I've come to the conclusion that the quality sucks. Yay for me I have a needle and thread.
3.0,"Very cute hat, hard to adjust for size. The biggest issue was that shipping took way too long. Was supposed to be there in three to five days, took over two weeks."
3.0,"It is ok, except the skin of the holder wears away quite quickly from normal use."
3.0,"material is pretty thin, but length is good"
3.0,I ordered these for my son. He's 12 and loves to swim. The only thing that he didn't like was the length of the legs. He thought that they were a little short. I think that they look fine on him but I tend to agree that the leg length is a little shorter than what we normally buy for him. The weight of the fabric is good and they fit him well. We both feel that these will definitely be a good option for him for the coming summer season.
3.0,Super cute! Snaps on back broke pretty quick tho...it’s hanging on by a few snaps not broken tho
3.0,"Compression? No way. I am 5'10"" and 166 lean pounds. These shirts are about 1.5"" too short and are only a tad tight across my chest, otherwise loose. I usually wear a Medium, ordered Large. I am sure Medium would have been even shorter. 3 stars for quality construction."
3.0,This run small. They arrived a did not fir
3.0,Almost shiny material
3.0,"Love the black it is good stuff. After giving my shoes the once over these made heels look good, but the brown is almost a clay color instead of a more walnut of darker brown that leather shoe soles normally come in. The applicator to prevent getting too messy is the perfect size to get things done without getting on the leather as well."
3.0,It has a definite odor and is already a little small. I should have ordered a size bigger.
3.0,"This is a cute shirt but runs small. Adding that with basic cotton shrinkage after washing, be careful with size selection. The materials and print were nice and the shirt seemed well made."
3.0,Didn’t fit too good but love the style
3.0,I was so excited when I ordered these leggings because I live in leggings! Everything shipped fast and arrived on time.<br /><br />However after opening the package and inspecting the product I noticed two pulls in the fabric. I am disappointed because other than the damage I absolutely love the leggings. They fit comfortably and are super soft! Overall I can only rate a 3 because honestly who wants to buy damaged leggings.
3.0,the underwire was poking out of the bra. so much for inspection before shipping.
3.0,"This cotton yarn worked up much nicer and had a softer feel than the other popular cotton yarn that I have used and would use this brand again.  However I realized that this yarn has different dye lots and are significantly different from one another depending upon the source and date so be very careful when ordering.  I am not sure if you can control dye lots on Amazon.  Also, I paid a very high price for it compared to the price at my local hobby yarn supplier - almost 3 times as much.  Word to the wise..."
3.0,My daughter likes the dress not what she expected (more of a party dress not formal) and it fits too tight.
3.0,"Neat costume dress piece, not good enough quality for anything more formal. I was hoping it would be subtle enough to wear with an ode to Shield. But just okay."
3.0,"I got this for the swimsuit coverup, which I do love. But it's so thin and I worry about tearing it (think light scarf material). I tried on the swimsuit itself, ordered a L and am usually a M. The bottoms fit well but the top was too small, definitely wouldn't wear to swim in. Runs at least a size small, so order a size up for it to be more likely to fit."
3.0,"Wallet is wider and taller than it needs to be to hold cards. The thickness is just right but I think most people will agree for a minimalist wallet it should have been less wide and less tall, I do like the center pocket and the magnet on the clip does seem pretty powerful."
3.0,I did not realize it was so shear.
3.0,Didn’t like the fit. the Bra that came with two in a package were not in the packages. Didn’t like that
3.0,Can't expect much for the price. Does seem to run a bit small.
3.0,I really like the style but the ties on the arms should be longer in order to be able to tie them off...
3.0,I am returning two of these tops (in size large) because the fit is way too snug up top. They have a nice length and it is ok at the waist. Definitely do not size down in these if you are busty at all. I am size 14 and normally prefer an xl but went by the recommendation to size down and regret it now.  I would consider trying these again in an xl.
3.0,"Has a strange oily coating which disappears with use, but smells odd."
3.0,The fit is perfect but I hope the garment is thicker.
3.0,"these are very nice shoes, but I am returning them because they are too narrow. i will buy them in wide."
3.0,"They're cute, cheap material, but hey...they're a novelty sock, not a luxury sock."
3.0,Definitely for taller ladies.
3.0,Pretty blouse but thin. I'm not sure how it will hold up after a few washes.
3.0,I thought it would be longer. I'm between 5/3 to 5/4 and I wanted it longer to cover my hips and bottom. It's a very pretty sweater and it's so soft. However I will be sending it back.
3.0,I receive it before time and it came in the right size
3.0,Very cute! Super thin material!
3.0,"I followed the measurement chart, but because I got between two sizes, I sized up. That was the wrong choice. The dress was so big it looked like a mumu. And the sleeves were extremely long. I would have just exchanged it for a smaller size, but it is also pretty thin. It also doesn't have a defined waist. I am chubby and an hourglass shape, so I like a defined waist with a flare to the bottom. This was more like a tunic."
3.0,"I will have to give these to my daughters, large is maybe a medium."
3.0,Design and quality feels and look good. But very stiff and Tight on my head.
3.0,"These are nice pajama pants, they definitely keep you warm, but I agree with another reviewer that they are clearly over-priced."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this, but the waist on it is quite a bit higher than it actually looks in the picture. I personally don't look good in empire waist dresses (they make me look pregnant or just fat), so I had to send it back. It was nice quality though, and if the style had looked better on me, I would have kept it."
3.0,this is a cute dress however it is a bit big in the chest area.  I will need to wear a tank top under it.  I ordered a 1x and I am 5'3 and weigh 200lbs. I will be keeping it but it is more of a comfy dress for work!
3.0,Too small I would suggest buying a size bigger..
3.0,"As other people noted these socks do not go over the knee of a normal North American woman. They are currently hanging about my ankles as slouchy socks, which is fine, because it it cold and I'm wearing pants. When I do pull them up they are just below my knee. I am 5'5&#34; and a size 12-14.<br />But the odd thing about these socks is that they have a seam down the side or the back. I picked the black socks so the seam is not all that noticeable. Maybe it is a throwback to the days when nylons had seams on the back. Odd.<br /><br />PROS- Soft. Warm. Slouchy.<br /><br />CONS- Seam. Slouchy. Overpriced for the quality."
3.0,"Comfortable, good fit. Most of the upper is leather however I've noticed they snuck in some man made materials that appears to be leather. I guess thats to be expected at this price."
3.0,I thought that it would be longer dangling but that wasn't the problem. It was hard to put on but when it is on it is comfortable. If you don't mind taking a couple minutes trying to put it on I would recommend this. the color is spot on I thought over all it was fine.
3.0,"Item is very pretty however, the earrings are way to heavy for a child to wear.  Was very disappointed in this.  Daughter can't wear earrings at all."
3.0,This belt was ok. Too big in my opinion as it didn't fit me! Returned it. It would have been cute had it fit!
3.0,"Have owned this for 8 mos now, it still has a moldy odor. The PVC material is still rigid after this period of time. The inadequacy of the main compartment zipper is still at bay.<br />I use it primarily for my ID/ keys, phone for the gym. It holds a Samsung S7, keys, ID, a few bills. Not nearly the amount of items described as holding."
3.0,Tank top rides up and does not stay where I want it to. Straps do not adjust well and lace is very high on neckline
3.0,Way too small for the size they were sposed to be. Gave them to my granddaughter
3.0,Good mask for Halloween. It does smush your nose but overall looked legit for being fake.
3.0,"I got this in blue and the color is beautiful. Material is soft. However, it's boxy and unflattering. I'm a bit overweight though so maybe that's why."
3.0,I want to like this top - I still kind of do but I have not worn it out yet. It's not terrible but the quality is meh.
3.0,"I have tried a lot of compression stockings and these are my least favorite.  If I am in pain they don't go nearly high enough (not as pictured for sure).  But, then again most stockings are much more expensive and on a smaller or petite women they might work."
3.0,"The distance from one end to the other is quite short, probably best for a child’s head, not an adult."
3.0,I did not the length to long.
3.0,This outfit is very short! It is also very itchy. I ordered a large and it fit as expected but am returning due to my cheeks hanging out! I am 5'9 and 190 pounds and I wish it were a couple of inches longer and less itchy otherwise I would keep it.
3.0,"I have to return it, it is already very heavy empty."
3.0,Clasp is pretty cheap broke easly
3.0,"I knew by the prize that it would not be an extraordinary item, but it is still cute. The little cat head looks like its made of glass and the ring doesnt close enough. Im a size 6."
3.0,"Cheap fabric and stitching. Got this only to match my granddaughter for whom I purchased same print dress. Needs a lining. The three stars are for the hourglass shape and fun print.<br />I got a Small in similar model from sister brand and returned bcz it was see-thru and knee-length, but it fit. I had to get Medium here since Small was sold out, so was expecting to alter it. But it fit the same, go figure, just a slightly bit below knee which I prefer, and a bit baggy in shoulders. I'm 5'4"", 130 lbs, 38-27-37."
3.0,I am 5 feet 3 inches tall and weight 160 pounds. This dress did not fit me n the waist. Like the dress but it did not fit right. Loved the fabric.
3.0,Dry clean only
3.0,I like this jumper however it was a lot longer than I expected and the material felt different than I expected also. Nonetheless it’s still a very nice jumper
3.0,I purchased these socks for all the good reviews and for the fact they were actually no show when worn with tennis shoes. I only give them a three-star because I probably will not be purchasing them again. Details below:<br /><br />The Good:<br />- Definitely no show<br />- Fit size 12 1/2 no problem<br />- Breathable<br />- True to color<br />- No slip grip on inside heel is a nice touch<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- No padding whatsoever<br />- Expensive considering amount of material<br /><br />The ugly:<br />- They appear of lower quality<br />- Will probably get holes quicker than others
3.0,OK this is probably the ugliest thing I ever bought online. The olive material was like tent fabric so I’m returning it. I’m petite and ordered a small but there’s excess material at the bottom it’s like a big pouch — I could stuff a small dog in there ! you’ll notice the model is kind of clutching to her side to keep that closed.
3.0,"This is super cute, but it hung down more than I liked it to. I have a big ankle and it fit but I had to use the extension. I think if you had a smaller ankle it would fit nicely because you could make it tighter and it wouldn't hang as low."
3.0,"The luggage are nice, but I don't think they accounted for the way the airlines handle luggage in their design. the medium luggage is damaged to the point where it can no longer be used.  the largest one has also been damaged, but it still has some life left to it. The weakest points are around the wheels. the zipper is also somewhat weak."
3.0,The flare is to big for 2g
3.0,"I guess I didnt read the materials but it wasnt really denying just like polyester dyed as denim color, the overall product was okay for what I wanted it"
3.0,Very pretty for a slimmer shape woman. I ordered a size up and it was still quite small and snug.
3.0,"Sudadera liviana, material delgado, aspecto sintético."
3.0,the feel is not the best for wear but my wear into a better comfort feelig
3.0,They’re nice! Silky material and likely wouldn’t show a seam line. Runs small.
3.0,"I bought a small and it is still on the larger size where I usually wear a medium comfortably. The cross over the front I think may have been accidentally sewn on the back...because the tag for the shirt size is located right next to one of the straps. (it's sewn backwards. The fabric is good quality, i can still wear the shirt as is, and it's pretty comfortable aside from having to adjust the front because it is backwards lol"
3.0,"Running a little on the smaller side. Very happy with the color, and picture design, no flaws. Just smaller than I predicted."
3.0,"The product descriptions says it fits wrists 5.5-8.7 inches. My wrist is 8.125 inches and it barely fits, after some modification. Thre are two loops for tucking in the free end of the band, one sewn in, and one free-moving. The band was too short to tuck into the sewn-in one, and the free-moving one would not slide over it. I had to cut the sewn-in one out so I could move the other one close enough to the buckle to allow me to tuck in the end of the strap. It's more comfortable than the silicon band that came with the Fitbit, but it's about 1/2"" shorter. It does attach securely to the  Fitbit Charge 3."
3.0,"I got an XL because I wanted a big, oversized sweatshirt. This was soft, fleece material and very short! I’m normally a size Med & the XL didn’t even come to the middle of my bum. Just not what I was expecting. More of a cropped shirt (at least for the XL)."
3.0,"Too thin, have already worn a hole in the heal. Haven't had them for six minutes nth"
3.0,Nice fabric but much smaller than advertised size
3.0,"This dress is a weird material that wrinkles very easily. It it was cotton it would have been perfect!!! I wear a medium, but based on reviews i sized down and it fits perfect."
3.0,My daughter loved it! Fits perfectly. Only thing is the lettering and designs peel off very easily
3.0,It's too small for my 4 years old and she has small head.  It would be great for younger kids.
3.0,Did not look as pictured
3.0,I got these for a Halloween costume but they are so unflattering I didn’t even wear them. They go all the way up my thingy and pinch the fatty part in the worst way that makes my thighs look so gross. Wish they were longer
3.0,Did not like the fact that it was too small for the intentes size
3.0,"I’m 5’2” and 115 lbs. ordered small. While the concept was good and everyone else’s pics looked super hot, I just had way too much material in the front part and it bunched out. Maybe I should try an XS but honestly wasn’t wild about the whole silhouette. Pass."
3.0,They're very cute but cheaply made as soon as they I got them out of the packaging they broke so I linked them back together but I'm only wearing them for one day so they'll do.
3.0,Quality was OK
3.0,I sent it back. Made for child's wrist.
3.0,Bought this 2 years ago as i need a tough ring. It looks great but a diamond fell out about a year in and it does get scratched
3.0,"Accurate picture, I just didn't end up loving it in person."
3.0,The medium was too small and the large was too big (loose)
3.0,Great fishing boots but the sizes are way off and Ihad to return my first pair and I am hoping I do not have to return the second pair!!  They run extremely BIG!! I wear size 11 in everything I put on my feet!! 11 in these was way to big!! A real disappointment!! I had to return and am waiting for the size 10 which I HOPE WILL NOT BE TO BIG!! Great Boots but be careful of the size.  So far I have had to pay the shipping both ways! NOT HAPPY about that!! Be careful of the Size but GREAT BOOTS!!
3.0,"Sizing is WAY off for this shirt. I wear a 2XL, but wanted this to be loose to wear with leggings so I ordered a 3XL. This shirt in a 3XL is probably close to what is usually considered an XL shirt size. So I had to give it to my teenage daughter to wear as a sleep shirt. The color is great; really deep, dark purple. It is a somewhat heavy, stretchy, yet soft material that feels really good. After seeing the color and feeling the material, I really wish it would have fit, but the sizing just sucks."
3.0,Distorts the view under water but for just over all swimming they do the job.
3.0,I didn’t like the way the lines of the dress hit on my body.
3.0,"I did like the shirt, but it was not what I expected. The shirt is sheer material. I was looking for a T-shirt type of material. I wore a white camisole underneath. It has more of a blousey feel."
3.0,"Understanding the bag is handcrafted, I get there will be imperfections, but, the bag stunk like wax crayon or old rancid leather, so I did return it.  Also the shoulder strap is ridiculously long, but you can add extra holes, as its like a belt."
3.0,Loved the colors and the fit was great. It is a little low but a tank top took care of that. The only disappointment was that this dress does not have a split as shown in the picture.  Bummer but still ok buy
3.0,"$38. scarf-  beautiful, but poor Quality"
3.0,"These shorts turned out to be way too big. They don't hold in all the lumps, and if you're expecting it to work like a softer version of spanx, then don't buy it because they won't firm your bottom half at all. I still do where these shorts though when I'm wearing summer dresses that are flowly and don't necessarily need any tucking in. I would recommend this product for anyone who needs something to wear under baggy and/or flowly dresses, and not for someone who needs some shaping for a tight dress/skirt."
3.0,The belt was pretty and would have been versatile if it weren’t so flimsy . The chain wouldn’t stay on .
3.0,Very comfortable to wear but so difficult to open them up I get nervous that the force I’m applying will rip my ear lobe off lol
3.0,"Does not compress as expected. It,seems very fitting but does not compels in the shoulder area which is what I want."
3.0,The skirt is cute. But not good quality. It is not what is depicted. The waistband is not as thick and you can see where it is stitched together. Size is made small. I'm always medium and I could of gotten a large. Color is not as depicted or as depicted in one review. Mine is green-green and flowers are brown. A little disappointing but I'll still wear it.
3.0,I hated the blend of the fabric. I sized up so it wasn’t clingy and it ended up being too big and clingy. Wasn’t worth the trouble returning. So it’s a night time shirt
3.0,"Ordered one of these on a lightning deal special because it was 1/3 of the price of the original Slidebelt/Mission Belt and I had never tried one before. A little weird to loosen, and I felt like over time that little ridge holding the belt tight would wear out. Felt kinda nerdy with the loud ratcheting sound every time you tighten it.<br /><br />I cut it to the shortest it would allow, but it was still too long in my opinion. I don't like having a belt where the end goes way past the side pants loop. Quality was decent. It just wasn't for me. Amazon handled the return amazingly though. I was scared they would reject me because I cut it, but they prepaid return shipping, received it in one day, and I received a refund confirmation the same day. So Amazon gets an A+ on the customer service side."
3.0,"This dress is gorgeous, comfortable, and flattering. BUT: The inside seaming around the waistband is so thick that it creates a little ridge around my ribcage.<br /><br />It’s hard to explain, but imagine a raised bump all the way around the top edge of the waistband. Not cute. Such a bummer because I otherwise loved this dress."
3.0,Fit and length were great.  (Small). Problem being it came folded up and the wrinkles were almost impossible to get out.  Hoping after washing it will be better.
3.0,Perfect for the Queen of Hearts theme but they roll down and won't stay over the knee.
3.0,"I was unsure of the style before I bought them, but after they were delivered I did not care for the look of them. They are very light (pretty much made of plastic)&#62; The accent / brace that goes across the top of the glasses looks cheap and is made out of plastic. I thought it would be metal. They were packaged very nice ly and came with a procttive carry / storage case. The company seems to be a good one that cares about teir product, but these glasses just do not look good on me.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and this review is 100% my own opinions.

3.0,These are some nice leggings they shape well their color is beautiful but.. the integrity of the seams in the crotch are very weak after a few wears I have a hole in them I knew almost instantly when I got them they would do this though because of how weak the seams were holding the fabric together I also saw multiple people with the same issue it’s a manufacturer problem
3.0,Small and itchy.
3.0,Fabric has an odd smell to it.  Not as soft as I typically like things either.  Perhaps with a wash both of thos issues will go away.
3.0,Do cute and comfy but arrived with a broken zipper!
3.0,The pants are nice/. However my husband had large calf muscles (he would die is he knew I said that😝).  And due to that- too small.  Very narrow at the bottom.  However- nice quality fabric.
3.0,they were warped when arrived and you can not adjust
3.0,"The main reason for only 3 stars is the edge of the band can snag the sleeves of delicate or knit fabrics. I only wear it with short sleeve tops. Other than that, it’s great."
3.0,Nothing special and doesn’t fit great but the price is really good.
3.0,a little bigger around the waist than i expected it to be but overall fits well.
3.0,Time needs to be readjust constantly by a few minutes
3.0,They aren't what I thought but I guess they will do.
3.0,I was excited about finding this shirt to wear to an event but when it came I could tell without even trying it on that it was going to be too small and it definitely was. Order a larger size than you usually wear.
3.0,"This dress was made nicely but it was a very heavy material that sunk when worn. I should have gotten a size smaller but I think even if I had, it would have been too large in the arms and chest. The video neck really plunged down low and was not very attractive. The arms too lose which made the dress much less stylish. It was very comfortable though. I'd say size down and plan to wear a tank underneath."
3.0,Didn't fit good 😕
3.0,After a few washes the owl has peeled off and material has stretched out. They are a year old now and we are still using them but the quality isn t the best
3.0,This lot was mixed with some that were obviously scrappers and some that seemed decent. The obvious scrappers got turned into necklaces or given to the art department and I kept the others. Still a good price just don't expect them all to be keepers.
3.0,Not the best quality. Very stretchy and almost loses its form after a very short time of owing the band
3.0,After about a week the design started to fade. Not good for exercising in otherwise very vice band.
3.0,"38D does not stretch across chest.<br />Bright colors and pretty design. Worth keeping, but order up at least one size if not two."
3.0,These were just ok. They were a very stiff fit and had an awful plastic smell that still isn't gone - even months later.
3.0,Looks cheap. Thin material. Design stamped on. wouldn't buy again.
3.0,"It’s very pretty, but the moons catch on everything. I snagged 2 sweaters and scratched my daughters arm😥"
3.0,"I like the sweater but I doesn’t fit anything like the picture. The neck is way too small to come down on my shoulders and it’s not as long as the picture.  Otherwise, the sweater is a good quality and the color is nice."
3.0,Too big for a size small. It’s a nice dress though and I got compliments for it. I need to have belt with it so i wont look pregnant.
3.0,"I like the look of these glasses and the strength, but they are just too tight on the side of my head.  I will need to go get them adjusted."
3.0,Small in arms big in the middle
3.0,"Love it. I'd give it 5 stars however, not to seller... it's best when selling an item for $40 to be 100% sure the $19.99 price tag you paid for it isn't still in the box with the item.<br />Other than knowing how much I overspent, lovely product."
3.0,Its okay for the price.  zipper is a little annoying going around corner.  Not enough card slots and very tight but okay for the price.
3.0,The clear plastic bag is thin and could puncture easily. The black bag inside is nice and it could be used as a crossbody bag.
3.0,"I'm not sure what I thought I was going to look like in this, but I looked exactly as one would expect: Like a middle aged mom dressing up like her daughter for ballet class. It's cute, but way to cutesy for my taste. Give me my jeans and t-shirt."
3.0,"These are just okay. The weight of the material seems to differ from one color to the next, and some of the skirts I received have several vertical seams in odd places, while others only have two vertical seams on either side. It's not annoying enough for me to not wear them, but it almost seems as though extra scraps of fabric were just sewn together. They aren't exactly made uniformly. That said, the odd seams aren't noticeable, and I've been wearing them, along with other maxi skirts, almost daily, so I do like them enough. Quality control just needs to be paid closer attention to. Would be great if they were offered in more colors... a blue and a brown would be great."
3.0,"These leggings are light compression and are not a brown color but a dusty purple.  They were advertised as rosy brown but this is not the color. I would suggest, if you want high compression leggings, these are not the ones. If you prefer a gentle pressure these are perfect. The fabric is not soft like some yoga pants. These are good for yoga and have a mid to higher waist, but we all know these depend on body type. I think for causal exercise use, yoga and pilates these are perfect. They are a good value for the price.  I gave it a three because the color was not brown, the fabric was not very soft and the compression was not what I needed"
3.0,"On the plus side: Soft, comfortable fabric which drapes nicely and is flattering with colurs that are vibrant without being overwhelming. Great given the price.<br />One the minus side:  I'm 5' 6&quot; and based on the 5' 9&quot; model expected the hem to hit the floor in bare feet at least; it doesn't. The neck line is a tad higher and smaller than expected for an off the shoulder garment.<br /><br />Generally, be aware that it runs large. I ordered the large orange which turns out to be far too voluminous - looks more like a xxl."
3.0,"Got it for my coworker, she loves Betty boop"
3.0,They’re cute but they’re so hard to see through during the day because of the layer they have on for the heart. Super cute at night though.
3.0,Are these made of lions?  because it covers my whole head and makes it look awkward to wear. Nice mask if it fits right
3.0,Socks smells more rubbery compared to Zensa and it’s too long for me but for its price it’s ok
3.0,Bought for my Halloween costume.<br />The edges stabbed me in the head and arms all night.
3.0,"Works just fine for 4 days...  However, I had the strap on my wrist and I was serving graduation cake... guess what happened.  Naturally, the strap BROKE!!!!  My iPhone 5c ended up in the cake icing along with a visible strap broken."
3.0,Nice wallet but it does not hold as much as you would expect. hard to get at the outermost pockets.
3.0,"The descriptions say ""leather"", but I'm not convinced it's actually made of leather. The stitching on the wallet is done with thick thread of some kind, which makes it look lower quality in my opinion. However, there are several pockets for credit cards, a clear pocket for an ID card or picture. It will work fine as a wallet.> I got this as a first wallet for my son in middle school. He's happy with it. I would guess a high schooler or adult male might think it's a little too low quality, but that's just my opinion."
3.0,They were larger than I thought. Very pretty.
3.0,These sunglasses have nice lenses and fit ok.  Unfortunately they are not semetrical.  I thought the frame was just bent... but the lense actually appears lopsided on one side. So if you have one droopy eye the should work great for you and look decent.
3.0,"The description and guarantee states that there is a gemstone in the product and there is a picture that looks like there is one. When i received it, there is not stone. It's not bad, but not what i expected."
3.0,I think a more contoured cap would be more appropriate for women.  It's somewhat large for a woman's head.
3.0,"Great dress for the price! As others have mentioned, the sequins near the sleeves are scratchy and after worn for a bit started to leave scratch marks on my arms."
3.0,It is ok.  I have had coach purses in the past.  This one seems poor quality.  But it wasn't that expensive. I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,"The gloves were made of nice leather, but the liner was really thin. The seam that ran along the index finger was also crooked on the pair I had. It made it feel funny on your hand."
3.0,cute print and good quality polyester silk just clearly is NOT mulberry silk as advertised
3.0,"The fit is good. The fabric is much lighter than I expected, more like silky."
3.0,"The price is obviously great considering how much these dresses cost.  I wasn’t expecting high quality, however, there is a hole in it.  The dress looks the same as in the picture."
3.0,Not as comfortable than I had hoped
3.0,Pretty colors but slides off really easy.
3.0,"Its size 8, the pants are ok but the top is short on my 6 year old"
3.0,The material is cheap and see through so i wear it around the house. It has no tag so its hard to know the front from the back
3.0,[[VIDEOID:50da9b00c12f242faccc92137ad8927]] I purchased the ring for a tobi cosplay and if you didn’t know tobi wears the ring on his thumb which I thought would work because I have small hands but the ring will not go on my thumb without forcing it on.
3.0,Very cute dress. I usually wear a small. I'm a 36 B. I got a medium and it was tight.
3.0,These are JUST ok. They've shrunk so they're a lot harder to get on.... as if you thought that was possible. They worked well at first but became more of a problem after a few washes.
3.0,"Cheap quality, but cute."
3.0,"Material is kind of itchy, low quality/synthetic but at this price point it's acceptable. The logo looks good."
3.0,"the material is nice, but i just didnt like the way if fit. i have since returned"
3.0,I ordered this dress in both dark green in the acevog and rephyliss. I had expected them to be very similar in fit and fabric. I followed the sizing charts and ordered the xxl on the acevog and the xl on the rephyliss. I'm 5'1&#34; and 170lbs. When they arrived the rephyliss fit slightly big as I could pull it over my head but had a really good fit all around. The fabric was a nice dark emerald green. The Acevog(this dress) fit really weird the dress itself was really big had ample chest room. I'm a 36D and the girls were swimming in fabric. The back felt loose as well. The armholes were TINY! They cut pinto my pits. I didn't have that on the rephyliss. The other comparison was the fabrics are two totally different fabrics the rephyliss was a stretchy dark green knit while this Acevog dress was medium teal green and a harder broadcloth type fabric.  I would not recommend buying this dress. I rarely return things but this was totally a returnable.
3.0,I ordered the M/l because I wanted it to be baggy and it fit like a S/M . It's made okayyy... could be better construction. Print is vibrant tho.
3.0,a little too tight  Not sure how warm they will be when we get colder weather
3.0,I was expecting a bigger smile it’s really small  but Very comfortable
3.0,Won't stay up. Defeats the purpose. This color only. The other patterns are great
3.0,"I ordered large per other recommendations, It's OK"
3.0,Lighting wasnt that bright
3.0,"They might have been cute, but the lenses were much too orange (I have another blue light blocking pair of glasses from another brand and the lenses aren’t orange at all). I did not like the look with so much orange tint in the lenses. I returned them."
3.0,It fits but the elastic is like a grip of death! But I am glad it will never fall down haha! my waist is only 76 cm or about 33 inches around. But it is definitely tight so I can only wear it for a few hours before getting nauseous. Oh the price of being beautiful. If your not between 22 - 30 inches in the waist just pass this product by because you will definitely not fit into this without trouble.
3.0,"I really loved these goggles at first but over weeks they hurt around the outside of my eyes over time. They bruise the outer, upper part of my eyelid even if I loosen them. they do work great if I want to deal with the pain."
3.0,Only reccomend fir a petite or short person due to the sleeves being too short for the size ordered.
3.0,"Loved them, they were supposed to be a Christmas present. Ordered LG but received M, I'll donate to Goodwill"
3.0,Pretty piece but a strand of beads broke the first time I wore them. 😩
3.0,"ok, fits it lot bigger then stated. wont buy from them again. to much of a hassle to return. ill donate it"
3.0,"Skirt bottom is really cute and does not look like a grandma bottom. Sits pretty low on hips but offers full coverage in front and back. I'd suggest sizing up one size. I wear a medium (sz 6 in AE brand for reference) and ordered the medium. It's pretty snug around the hips, wished I went with a large. If you need a &#34;smedium&#34;, the medium will fit you perfectly."
3.0,"ok, not much insulation"
3.0,Falsely advertised as being from Japan. It is a very good product.
3.0,"Cute, as described and pictured. True to size. Material is a bit cheap but you get what you pay for. Using as costume so it's serving purpose. Overall satisfied and ordered an XL because of athletic, muscular frame. 5'8 usually a large but ordered up just in case. Chest 38 to 41"
3.0,The colors looked different when it arrived and it was kind of floppy.  I needed a more sturdy purse.
3.0,"I bought this as a gift.  It's definitely cute, but very obviously cheap.  My advice would be, get it for yourself, or for a child, but don't give it as a gift to an adult.  The ropes are actually just plastic.  Also, I had to tighten some of the little connecting loops.  The charms are the best part.  But even they are made of a cheap, lightweight metal.  It's worth it because of the price, but you do get what you pay for."
3.0,"I purchased this pair of sunglasses for a relative who has poor visual acuity. Because of the material which regular sunglasses are manufactured, there are plenty of models which do not allow any opthalmic graduation so these flip up clip sun glasses are a really nice workaround solution!"
3.0,I am a size 8. The sandal are totally cute but too wide.
3.0,"The shirt seems nice and I will keep it, but the product name says hoodie sweatshirt.  There is nothing sweatshirt about the material.  It is a very lightweight knit.  Like leggings.  Wasn't what I was expecting.  And yes, you do have to size up because it is made in China and they make clothing a lot smaller."
3.0,"The bag was pretty , but the color was too gold.  Photo showed a more subdued shade of gold.  Didn't match with my shoes."
3.0,Simple and cute - can't beat the price!
3.0,"I ordered this sharpening stone for use with my new knives, Nowhere did it say the size of the stone. When it came 3/24 it was about 1 inch by 2 inches. I paid $8.99 for that you must be responsible !!. Something is totally wrong. Put the size of the object in the ad so one knows what we're getting. I've been ordering from Amazon for about 3 yrs. This is the first time I feel scammed​."
3.0,This is a super cute jogging suit but is just to thin. I was very disappointed with the material for it to be a jogging suit the material was very light and thin. I think it will be cute to wear in the fall but you will freeze putting it on in the winter. I'm not to happy so I'm sending it back need something THICK  to wear in the winter.
3.0,This slipper feels good.  My shoe size is 10.5 women(USA) and no room left for anyone who has a bigger foot.  The horn on the Unicorn is not spiraled like shown in the photo.
3.0,They are okay. Lenses do not seem very dark and can see glasses through them.
3.0,Popped after one week
3.0,"I bought them as a gift hope she likes them,"
3.0,Shoulder lapels were not secured...thread unraveled easily and had to be sewed back down.
3.0,Color is not like the photos. The fit is nice but material is a little in the thin side.
3.0,Too small. Missed return window.
3.0,I'm still debating whether or not I'll return the pants.
3.0,Cute and have gotten a lot of compliments on it but it is very see through so I use it as a beach coverup. Order up in size since it does run a bit small. Also short in the back
3.0,It’s cute but faded quickly
3.0,It's okay but it slips off my bra strap.
3.0,"Collars worked great for about three weeks, then while placing the weights back on the rack one of the collars came apart and fell on the floor.  Had to use spring collars to finish my set of squats. will be returning them.  Since I love the convenience of the placement and removal of the collars, I will order another set from a different manufacturer. Perhaps I'll have better luck, if not, will order the boring spring collars."
3.0,"Very wide, but cute!"
3.0,"Lightweight, functional for gentle use. Nose pads grip well to prevent slippage. The plastic frame is chintzy - always feels like it's going to break or snap. (So far they haven't because I've been extra careful.) Lenses are plastic so must protect from scratches. The neck strap that comes with it does not work - the rubber ends that go on the ""arms"" are too loose and don't grip causing the glasses to slip out. The quality is what you would expect for the price."
3.0,"Both my hubby and I wear sunglasses that fit over our RX eyeglasses. We like to have them right ""at face"" when we're outside walking or driving. We've had several different brands, and I tried this set when I saw a good price. I gave one away for Christmas (no feedback yet) and have one attached to my Rite in the Rain pen to keep tabs on that. The difficulty with these is the rubber end that attaches to glasses' temple piece. The rubber is tight, and you can't enlarge the opening well enough to get the end of the temple piece through it. I do like the color of the string, and the length is perfect. I will keep at it and hopefully get this to work."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:32e1dd3409e49026511b1db4f0e4b97b]] I’m a mechanic and I use this to work everyday. It’s not that comfortable but it has lasted quite a while.
3.0,These are much smaller than suggested on photo on model in ad. Ad misleading.
3.0,I like the stick on I did not like the material
3.0,"A little cheaper looking than I expected, but OK"
3.0,"They're look pretty,  but just ok...i already had one fall out."
3.0,"Really cute, but wayyyy too small. It fits my medium sized sister. Costume quality. Really thick also."
3.0,"They're nice, they just didn't stick very well on my shoes."
3.0,Somewhat girlish.
3.0,Cute but hard to breathe
3.0,Looks like an old man’s watch
3.0,"while the ring is smaller than pictured, it is ok."
3.0,"These are very thin, but the circle is big. So you get the presence without the weight. Dark black and more Gothic style than what I go for, especially since they are large in my opinion."
3.0,"Super cute, but not super sturdy. Would work better if you don't sleep in them."
3.0,"The cut and dimensions were off on this dress for me. Probably better on someone with broad shoulders and no hips. I sent it back for this reason. The fabric was nice, flowed well and had a good weight to it. Seemed that it would be comfortable to wear all day."
3.0,"Very cute shoes, but a bit tight."
3.0,"Great gift for the team or regular wear, but the letters wears off easily."
3.0,I wanted to love these.  They seemed like the perfect statement drop earrings.  But the part on the bottom is just a little bit too much/too large.  The style is beautiful; I would 100% have kept them if that piece on the bottom was just a bit smaller.  I returned :(
3.0,I normally where a XXL so I bought it in that size. I now where to lounge around the house or sleep. Almost big enough to where as a dress.
3.0,"Nice quality. Great look and design. However, the sleeves were so long on me that I would have to have them altered at least 6” 8” inches. Sadly I had to return this top."
3.0,I have been using these watches for many years. Never been disappointed except this one. The light feature does not do the job.
3.0,"I was reading the reviews and saw that they were talking about how perfect the fit is... not sure where those came from. Because unless my body is disproportionate, I'm preeeetty sure that this shirt is awkward. I bought a medium. The arms fit perfectly but the body is way too wide! This is the most unflattering t-shirt ever. I should have looked close at the picture--see how there is excess fabric at the waist? It clings to my chest and hips but the waist is way too loose, and I am not a defined hour glass figure. You might argue that yes, this is a t-shirt, they're not supposed to be tightly fit. But why would the arms be fitted, but not the rest? I could not wear this out without a sweater."
3.0,So one of the two lights didn’t work. Could be the battering or the electronics were fried. My main beef is that it’s not the best for running. I couldn’t get the straps to stop from falling off my shoulders mid run. In my opinion it needs a distinct from and back with slightly different fittings.
3.0,"I SO wanted to like this bra! It did fit well. I have been on the search for one to play tennis in. I am a 36 DD and did not want underwire. It just seems like a woman did not make this bra AND I really don't know why there is not a thin layer of padding to protect from those cold moments. I bought the white and you can SEE through the white, which shows WAY more than you want anyone to see. I like to wear white shirts and this is just not going to work out. If it had some padding it would be perfect."
3.0,"This review is for the Crystal Rhinestone Diamond Watch Strap.  I have a Gear S3 and the descriptions states that it will fit this watch.  After I took the Apple Watch adaptor off, it looked like it would fit the Gear S3.  It doesn’t.  It is too tight.  My husband and I could not even get it to match up without the pin in it, let alone with the pin.  My husband who is handy was able to get the Dremmel out and file some off of the sides of the watchband.  It worked.  Should not have had to do that.  The plastic tool they sent to use for resizing it didn’t work either.  The watchband was too wide for the tool."
3.0,"They are larger and rounder than what I thought, but still ok."
3.0,"The product itself seems to work fine. However, the brush that came with it quickly fell apart. The bristles fall out every time I use it and are floating in the cleaner."
3.0,"Face mask arrived in one-day with express mail. That was great. What wasn't great was that the packaging was torn - it had been shipped in a flimsy envelope, which had a huge hole in it, and there was a crack on the nose piece of the mask. The crack does not appear to go through the whole thickness of the polycarbonate, so we'll use it, but the company would be wise to ship these items with at least some wrapping or in a box. If I could afford to have my son without a face mask for a day, I'd ship it back."
3.0,"I thought the design was embroidered, so I was a caught off guard when it was just print. It fit fine, but I returned it because the bell sleeves made it awkward for me. It just wasn’t flattering on me at all."
3.0,"I like the material, and it looks like the picture. It looks good on, just runs small."
3.0,The plastic gems came unglued. Easy but annoying fix.
3.0,This Ran VERY small but was super soft
3.0,"I use this carabiner mostly for carrying couple of keys plus a flash drive. Yes, it is light, but the finish quality could be better - there is 2019 outside. Check the fitting of the steel spring towards titanium body. Also, another downside of it is the size - could be easily be bigger for an inch or so.<br />Dimensions of carabiner are: 45mm length, 21mm width and 4mm thick.<br />Not really worth $15. Otherwise OK product."
3.0,"I bought an XL since it was coming from China, but the top part of the dress is tight. The picture of the dress is deceiving. The skirt part of the dress is not wide and flowing like in the picture. The material in the picture, looks more like a soft flowing cotton gauze fabric but it is not. The print and the colors on the dress are beautiful as in the picture."
3.0,What I really wanted was a shirt I didn’t have to tuck in since most shirts are long on me . This was just as long as my regular shirt. Slim fit good but covers the pockets on my jeans. Will return. I ordered a navy shirt also will see if it’s any shorter in length.
3.0,"My nephew love it, but I would purchase a bigger size with this swimwear."
3.0,"I like the material. Light and somewhat see-through, with a nice texture. Did not care for the color, as it was not what the picture showed. Would keep it if it was not as bright and more neutral. Hate the bright pink with the neutral beige. Sizing-I went up, I normally wear a medium and bought a large. It fit well and still had a little room."
3.0,"I have never worn this ring as it is too big. They don,t have 1/2 sizes which is what I need.should have returned it but it wasn,t that much for price."
3.0,"I really love large, statement stud earrings and have a hard time finding them. I thought I was going to love these but unfortunately they were a bit disappointing. The major issue is that the posts are attached right in the center of the stone triangle shape, which causes them to be bottom heavy when I wear them. They tilt back instead of laying flat on my earlobes. I was able to remove the posts and reglue them higher on one side and that did help a little but I still think they are too heavy for their size. In addition, one of the earrings had a strange brown stain on it. This could just be natural variation in the stone but I had to make sure to wear that one so that the stain was facing back because it looked like I got something on my earring otherwise. If you have larger/thicker earlobes you might have better luck with these than I did."
3.0,"These were a great price for three tops, but since I don’t really like them, it’s not a good deal. They are much thinner material than I thought they would be and came through the very first wash looking a bit faded and pills forming. They are also slim fitting in the arms and torso, so they are not flattering on me. I wore one to work, but kept tugging and adjusting all day. I can’t bring myself to wear them again and I would have to pair them with a sweater so I won’t freeze in the office. This just makes them too high maintenance for me."
3.0,Face is too fancy; can't read time easily.
3.0,"This is a difficult site to buy from because the pictures are very misleading.  The long sleeved and sleeveless dress show three different styles each.  But when purchased and it was not what I ordered, I was told there is only one style for each dress.  That is definitely not what is portrayed.  I exchanged the long sleeve dress for the jacket and kept the sleeveless version.  I think the seller needs to redo the pictures. j The dress looks cute on my granddaughter and I hope it wears ok.  I needed to give 3 stars because of the way the site is set up."
3.0,"Bought for my son, but they seemed so gigantic on his feet, and he has big feet. They were too big on him. So unfortunately I am returning them; but they look like a great pair of sandals."
3.0,3 stars because they ripped in the first use for my son and my daughters are ripping after few wears. We use for the pool and beach often. They’re really practical and easy to use though.
3.0,"very good for the price but after a couple of times of wearing it, the bottom part gets rusted and turns brown really easily"
3.0,great little watch but didn't hold up for us. it broke within a coyple of weeks
3.0,"For most people i'm sure these are great, but I bought these to stop my toddler from taking her earrings out and she was still able to pull out her earring easily without any force or while sleeping."
3.0,Nothing bad or gray about them.
3.0,"Rings were good, what I expected for the price. They are short, especially if your piercing is higher or you have a larger nose--so definitely order the bigger size. With a little stretching of the ring, mine fit just right. But sadly, I don't know if it's true stainless steel. After wearing one of the rings for about 18 hours, I had to take it out. My nose was NOT a happy camper. Some swelling and oozing, so I am probably allergic to either the paint or the metal itself. I haven't tried just the plain silver, but probably won't after what happened. Ya get what ya pay for!"
3.0,Too short and I am a short person
3.0,"These are ok. Nice quality earrings, but the gem doesn't shine as much as the picture shows. Had it been as iridescent as the picture I would've liked it a lot more. It's a little dull, but they're still pretty cute."
3.0,Straps are too short
3.0,It's pretty but quite heavy!
3.0,Sloppy. Baggy. Boobs everywhere.
3.0,"Nice colors, fabric is a little tricky.  Top and bottom seem to be mismatched.  Top looks as if it runs small but bottom is way to big, hangs in the seat quite a bit.  I’m keeping it but not ordering anymore."
3.0,"While the shorts fit well enough, the fabric was kind of stiff and not stretchy. This made them not as comfortable or good for working out."
3.0,The color of this blouse as shown online doesn't match the real color of the blouse.
3.0,Love the look of the watch but I'm not able to fix the time properly. Not much use when it's stuck on 12:00.
3.0,"Run tight in thighs and short from crotch to waist. I'm  between a 6-8 in jeans, and large was tight and doesn't cover my behind high enough"
3.0,"The fit is a little snug but not uncomfortable (bought a medium). The sleeves are what really bug me, I feel like I could take flight or something with them lol it’s such a cute top and I’m going to give it a chance. The sleeves will be a deal breaker if they end up driving me crazy"
3.0,"Looks way cooler in the picture, silly on me though."
3.0,Shipping was quick. Do not like the material. It's like that cheap nylon material that looks like Halloween costumes. I'm a size 4 and I ordered a small. The dress does not fit very tight. But it gets over. It's not a bad dress for the cost.  You get what you pay for. The style is cute and you can get over at a causal party.
3.0,the set itself is made well however the sizing wasn’t accurate. bought in a larger size for growing room and it was still too small.
3.0,Need to be on a thicker string.  They pop easily
3.0,"Cute, fit as expected, I ordered a size 6, the box they came in was pretty crappy, but who cares about the box? The front is comfy has a bit of padding, the back, however could use inserts if you're going to be standing for long periods of time. The back also slightly rubs up against upper ankle..."
3.0,Beautiful!!! But not an 8?!?!? To narrow.
3.0,To small chain
3.0,runs small but they were willing to exchange but we kept it for my son
3.0,The watch band has already broken
3.0,slipped off a lot and the fuzz isn’t as warm as others I’ve tried.
3.0,"I got this because of the ‘mask leash’ in the description and i loved the blue pompoms and the colorful beads. It is very cute and has good color, but I think it is actually intended as a glasses lanyard. I couldn’t figure out how to get it to attach to a mask as it came, so I added a couple of bulb pins to the end loops that I can pin to my mask to use. With that small modification, it works great as a mask lanyard too.<br /><br />I received this item for free in return for a fair and honest review."
3.0,Thought would be thicker rings. Very thin. They fit but takes. Good look to notice they’re there.
3.0,I ordered a large and it fits like a small. If i was a size small then this short would fit fine and be perfect for nursing.
3.0,Cute but pockets too small for a phone
3.0,"Item arrived scratched, appears to possibly to used, returned, etc. gave it a try that evening, after an hour the thing got noisey and had to shut off. For this price I expected better..."
3.0,poor quality but looks good
3.0,"Wore gloves for an hour in 38F at night time on freeway, doing 75MPH.  My hands were perfectly warm.  But, the fingers are a bit short and squeeze the tips of my fingers, and the bulk makes it hard to manipulate controls.  Touchscreen is so so, but does work, sort of."
3.0,The shoe was ok but the sol which is the bottom where u mark a line in black should of been the same color as the bow and also the shoe laces
3.0,nice cool shorts
3.0,Too big i bought a large.
3.0,Not the right earrings
3.0,"These are really cheap plastic, and are exactly what one should expect from three dollar rings. Not bad, but don't expect too much from them."
3.0,"Fast delivery which was great. But I did notice that the pants stretched out way too much. In the morning, they fit good, but by mid day they were very loose and looked terrible. The shirt was form fitting and pants ended up looking like joggers, loose everywhere and tight int hr ankles."
3.0,"Great quality for the price, but this these are much too long for my five year old."
3.0,Looks and feels like a good quality hat. Not a one size fits all. It’s made for extra large size heads only. I wear a size M/L flexfit and this was much bigger than that. I will be returning this item.
3.0,"Dress is super cute - so cute that I ordered in other colors.  However, the elastic button clasp has already broken and I haven’t even worn the dress.  So disappointed.  Will see back up since I need it for a trip, but disappointed that it already broke.  5 star dress without the button issue!"
3.0,Started to lose shape after a few months.
3.0,"I wanted to like this earring, but it looks a bit cheap."
3.0,"Sleeves very stiff, neck more of a crew style, definitely not possible to be worn off the shoulder. Accidentally put in the washer or I would have returned. Cute, but not what was expected from the description."
3.0,"I thought it was bigger, the quality of bag is light weight thin leather. I was not what I expected for the money."
3.0,No pouch for the goods in front making for a tight scrunched up fit. Otherwise good material and construction
3.0,"Actually really like the jacket but the sizing is horrible! I usually get an XL in knit type jackets because they tend to run smaller and I have long arms. After reading reviews I decided to size up and ordered a 2X. Upon receiving my jacket I realized that the tag inside the jacket said 3x but the hanging tag said 2X. This had me super worried because I needed the jacket for an event that night. I tried it on and what do you know, it fit! Now, I still think I could've wore the 2X but since it's a jacket, a little big wasn't too bad. For reference I'm 5'5 180 lbs, usually a 12/14 and L/XL."
3.0,"Too tight and I had to return. I didn't like them enough to get a bigger size. I think they're meant to be super tight, but it just wasn't what I was looking for."
3.0,Way bigger than I thought
3.0,"Stone fell out of first one. Replaced,  which was nice. But now its fitting too tight. The first one fit fine. So maybe if there's a next time, I'll order it a size bigger and pray."
3.0,The watch is beautiful but it arrived discolored. I’ll be returning it.
3.0,Es bella pero el.material la tela es de mala calidad. Pica mucho
3.0,"It looks amazing, super happy with the price for the value of this little novelty.<br />But the wings are really sharp....maybe I can smooth them down"
3.0,It's not for bulky dudes but it does look great.
3.0,"This dress is cute but the material is very thin. It also hangs down much further in front than back, almost like a maternity dress. I kept it to use as a nursing nightgown but wouldn't wear it in public."
3.0,"Good looking received lots of compliments, bright and fancy colors too. but would have given a higher rating if the card slots did not dameged my credit cards. They just lasted a short time, it kind a wears them everytime you pull them out or in. I noticed this was happening when i used this wallet. Anyway if you use it for short periods can be a good option."
3.0,served it purpose. i bought 3 one for each of my sisters. necklace was itchy a bit
3.0,Fit exactly as expected but the material feels a bit plasticy. Didn't catch they are not 100% cotton. My son doesn't mind though so they're in use!
3.0,Good quality but too big for my ears.
3.0,"The beads and embroidery were really nice and extremely well made. The fabric was also really nice, however the dress was large at the top and fit perfectly around the waist and hips. I liked it so much that I went to the tailors to get it fixed and they said there was no way to fix it because of the embroidery, so the sleeves kept slipping off the shoulder and the chest/abdomen area was all quite large. You really need to pick the right size as most likely it will be extremely hard to tailor the top part due to all the beads/embroidery. We didn't return it because we are still hoping to be able to tailor it somehow as it is very beautiful indeed."
3.0,"Great company, but this shirt runs very small."
3.0,I like this dress but I had to return it.  Order a size down.
3.0,"Really sensitive, turns on without even being touched."
3.0,"I ordered a 9.5 and the length was perfect, however the width was too wide. If your feet run normal-narrow, don't buy these. They run normal-wide. Lengthwise they are true to size. They are also more metallic gray than the picture shows, not gold as shown."
3.0,the product fit well in the upper and lower body but HUGEEEEE in the mid-section.
3.0,"This fit well and it was perfectly warm, but the fabric quality is meh. I really like it, but I don't want to bamboozle anyone into thinking this is the better than it is. I recommend the sweater, but it will honestly only last maybe 2 winters."
3.0,"while these fit in the foot part, the ankle part they are a little too tight."
3.0,They are tube socks with toes. Also I ordered crew length and they are knee highs. They are just ok.
3.0,"It’s a nice top, but a little tight on shoulders and chest. The sizes are not accurate. The material is ok though. If you are small and petite this is a good fit for you."
3.0,Very cute BUT the boobs are VERY close together. Didn't look right...
3.0,"This is sooooo cute! I like the fabric and design and feel of it. I am normally between a Large and XL. I ordered the Large and it was still too loose and baggy. I like my bodysuits to be very tight/form fitting. The straps keep falling off my shoulder, it's baggy in the crotch and ankle area (it could be because of my height, i am 5'2). A medium would have been perfect."
3.0,Fabric to loose
3.0,"So I bought these to wear under my jeans when I take the dog for a walk during the frigid Chicago winter's.  They are very comfortable, stylish, and cute.  Do they keep my legs warm......ah........maybe a little.  I have an old pair of Cuddle Duds that are like 15 years old.  I bought these pants to replace my old Cuddle Duds.  I think I'm just going to keep wearing my old Cuddle Duds on super cold days.  While wearing these, my thighs got ice cold and numb in the 15 degree's and below range while my old Duds keep my thighs nice and warm in the same temperature.  I do like these, but for those freezing sub zero temperature's, they really don't keep you warm."
3.0,certainly not for a wide foot.. I went a size up and it's still feels like I'm walking off of the sides
3.0,Good quality material - but way too short for me. I'm 5'8 and it hits way above my ankles.
3.0,"Son loves these shoes but as a parent, I dont like how the heal part is larger/bigger than normal.  I understand they need room to hold the heelys. Thats about all the complaints I have.  I like the fact how you can store and hide heelys.  led lights are pretty cool."
3.0,"Too small, followed size guide"
3.0,Shirt is slightly tight and cotton material not as good as expected for the higher cost than competitors.  Haven't wore it or washed it to finish a review.
3.0,Not exactly as shown.
3.0,Nice but a bit smaller than I expected
3.0,Works ok. Would be better if it could be applied to inside of ring to hold in place.  My rings still slid around sometimes.
3.0,"The hot pink with the model in the image was what I thought I was getting, the real hoodie is more than a few shades lighter. Kinda disappointed, but going to keep it just for wear around the house."
3.0,"Not sure if this is an authentic Coach. There was a small cut in the leather above the logo and it came without any protective packaging or protective storage bag. I returned this item, needless to say."
3.0,I was hoping these would be similar to the Nike shorts with the two layers but I found these to be very flowy and baggy. They almost look like a skirt when you wear them. Not really what I anticipated but the material isn’t bad.
3.0,They are too tight and smaller then excpected. My feet became so sweaty that I was wondering if it a perspiration or rain  hot wet them inside. Actually thery are slippery too.
3.0,The flipflops are nice but they are very hard. Maybe that's how the design is? They are also a bit heavy. I will wear them for a few months and see if things change.
3.0,Size is not right at all fits more like an xxl
3.0,I usually fit more of a medium and snuggly fit into a large.<br />The cups are also a bit strange so I ended up taking them out and inserting some from a different suit.
3.0,"You get what you pay for. The watch looks very cheap up close, but from a distance it looks very classy. I often have to change the time so for a time teller it is BAD, for a aesthetic piece I'd give it a 7/10. Keep your money and save up for something nice. Gold face it 2&#34;."
3.0,The white shows dirt easily & doesn’t really wash completely clean.
3.0,Only used them one time.  Not a big difference but still evaluating.
3.0,"Cute, but didn't fit my 5 year old's face. Good for younger kids."
3.0,"I've purchased these leggings multiple time, but this last time around hasn't been as good. The leggings (XS) used to fit perfectly with a thick compression that rivaled the quality of more expensive brands. They are now a little looser and thinner, I probably won't be purchasing again, but if you're only looking for a looser fit definitely go for it!"
3.0,It tangles very easily.
3.0,*****If your seeking drape order a lager size please..the shirt over all is nice though*****
3.0,"In response to your email regarding the fact that two of these socks (one from each of two pairs) keep riding down off the back of my heels, I wear a 7 1/2 size shoe."
3.0,a bit larger than previous card holders I have owned
3.0,"Sent it back because the WHITE was not white, it looked dirty.  America's colors are red WHITE and blue"
3.0,Does not hold numerous hats very well.
3.0,The waist fits fine. The top layer of shorts are fine. The part underneath that’s supposed to be tight compression like is the same size on the leg so it’s not snug at all.
3.0,"These dishwashing cloves arrived very soon. Was happy to receive it and was excited to use it. However, sadly, these gloves don’t work well when washing glassware, Corning ware dishes etc. These tend to slip from your hands easily. The gloves however work well on big pots and pans, especially on stainless steel. As far as fitting goes, both my husband and I have small to medium hands so they fitted well.  They are easily washable in the dishwasher. Not sure if I would invest in these gloves again."
3.0,"Well, you can't really wash this thing. Seems like it's a one-off, need this for a costume, party, event, tomorrow night, type thing. Unfortunately, I bought it for my 7 year old daughter who LOVED it and wore it all the time!<br /><br />We actually purchased it specifically to wear over her bathing suit, at camp. They're often running around before they actually swim, or after, with their suits still on. And given that they are in fields, creeks, etc ... I wanted her to have a bit more comfy protection, layering. This skort seemed ideal.<br /><br />But how the love has faded, along with the material.<br /><br />Given that she was wearing it around chlorine, in the dirt, etc -- we had to wash it regularly. And. after the first wash, it already had splotches of missing glow. After a couple more, it seemed to hit an equilibrium of faded but still peppy and poppy. After 5/6, it's kinda a dull pinkish, lazy tie dye job looking thing.<br /><br />It's already been relegated to ""spare outfit"" in her locker at school for those muddy / got hit by the science experiment / experimented with the paint ... need to change days at school, at least until the weather turns. Then it will become part of some craft or doll clothing.<br /><br />I really would not have cared, cause at this price ... having a faux, fun coverup for one season of camp -- well thats just about right. But she really did love how sassy this had been. So, kinda worth it, maybe. Just wish it was more clear that this was not really meant to be washed, and more of a costume piece. Also, handwashing doesnt really address the issue if this is for a child. Cold water and woolite gentle dont get out mud and stuff."
3.0,The shirt is really cute but the pants are very cheap and thin. I dont think they will last more then a few washes
3.0,"Loved the style, and it fit as expected.  I would have kept it, but the seam across the chest wasn't flattering."
3.0,"Sizing leaves a lot to be desired, as does the material..."
3.0,The shirt was ok but not long  about to your head only  .but the shorts was very short so keep that in mind .and it’s very very  Paper  light weight  .for a teen or 20s cut but for  middle age you might want to make sure you have and light rope or cover up if you out side or have company I bought this for a cruise i be going on  I feel like I may need a light sweater or cover up if I leave to leave room or balcony  .
3.0,They changed the style of the socks last minute thought I was getting the hemp leaf sock but just got regular ones. Still nice socks thick and comfortable. Just wanted more for the style
3.0,This cardigan seems a little big for a medium for not way off. It’s a heavier weight than it looks in the picture and the knot is a little cheap looking. It’s a decent item for the price.
3.0,"I am an adult who has a small wrist.  I liked this watch, however after 8 months, the band started to peel into layers at the end and in the middle.  It also started to split on both sides of the hole I select for my wrist.  I got it wet once in the shower and thought it was ruined.  It turned out ok except some of the lining on the inside peeled near the edges.  Wish the band would have lasted longer.  The watch is still ticking and the style is cute."
3.0,"It wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be, which makes for allot less protection from the cold weather."
3.0,Way smaller than expected. Price is good though.
3.0,"I like this as a basic black lace body suit. I got a small (5'4, 122 pounds, usally size small) and it did fit. My only issue was that the torso space was kinda small (the area between the kitty and the boob area) it seems to kinda pull. I did do some readjusting and it fit better. A nice feature is that the neck attachment can come off, there is velcow on it."
3.0,The dress is beautiful but it is way too small. I ordered it a size larger than I normally wear assuming that it might run a little smaller but I can't even zip it all the way up.
3.0,Cute very fragile but get alot of compliments . A tad cricket a little bending helped
3.0,The metal is made of cheap material
3.0,I like the setting but when I received them there was a black residue in each tray. I have to scrape each tray before using. Will probably look for a similar tray elsewhere
3.0,"This bracelet is very cute and the color combination is pretty. I like the way it buckles, I've had other similar bracelets that would get tangled (because of the way they buckled) but with this one there is no getting tangled or twisted. I think for the price point the quality could be better, it broke the first time I wore it. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a fair and honest review."
3.0,Too manly for me. Quality was good.
3.0,"was a bit large, and after a couple of delicate washes the wires either came out or bent ."
3.0,OK but not quite the correct design
3.0,This is an ok skirt. It does seem to be a little on the bigger side. Probably would not buy again.
3.0,"This bag is bigger than I was expecting. It is super soft. The lining is barely lining, is kind of a white cloth with holes. There is no inside zip pocket. I did like that there are multiple magnetic steps to keep it closed. I wish the strap wasn't so fluffy. It makes it hard to keep on your shoulder. It isn't long enough to wear cross body. It is an odd length."
3.0,"This band is comfortable, attached easily to the watch, but it wont stay strapped through any kind of physical activity. Looks good though. Maybe just use it to style up your gear for dinner. Just wont work for exercise."
3.0,Needed a spring sweater and had returned one alike that was awful this one cost more was somewhat better but not soft as I desire
3.0,not made very well.
3.0,"its a joker's hat, whats to say?  it got me some laughs ;)"
3.0,Pretty . Nice fabric. Just a speck too big.
3.0,"I've tried a few wireless bras from Amazon and these by far are the best so far. But first let me start by saying these are NOT sports bras. They don't have that tight, keep you in place feel that a true sports bra has. They would be o.k. for light exercise like walking, yard work or house work. I would call them leisure or comfort bras, which is what I was looking for as I'm working from home these days.<br /><br />They are incredibly comfortable and soft and the straps do not slip down. They make the the boobs look full and not squished down. They also a good fit even if they do run slightly large. If you are between sizes, I would order down. I just ordered another pack and I went down from a 3X to a 2X. (I'm a 46 DD).<br /><br />So why only three stars? First, the cup pads did not fit. They didn't cover my entire boob and ended up looking like a cone. Pretty hilarious actually. Also, the straps are a tad bit too long, leaving the boobs a little saggy. I think if they were a bit shorter there would be better lift. Finally, one of the bras was bigger than the others. It was stretched out of shape. I even dried it to see if that would happen but no luck."
3.0,This is a very nice tee but it runs small. I wear an XL but wanted it to be very loose so I ordered a 3X. It is snug.
3.0,"pro tip...use a sim card remover pin to push pins out of links when adjusting band. pro tip #2: use a magnet to hold microscopic screws or when one falls off into your carpet never to be found again, your band is useless junk because they dont toss in an extra screw."
3.0,Not impressed. The ad said it was 100% cotton. I have skin issues that require me to wear nothing but natural fibers. The dress is pretty so I gave it to my beautiful daughter. But I’m still mad about the manufacturer’s/seller’s description. This dress is polyester! Bummer
3.0,Overall not bad and breathable. It is not a boho fit. I am 5”4 135 and it goes up to my calves.
3.0,The fabric was the stiffest satin I've ever felt. I washed it  3 times before giving up and returning it.
3.0,"Quality ok.  Was shiney fabric, not real crazy about that.  Cut was odd, snug around the shoulders and huge around the waist"
3.0,"Nice material, very soft.  Lite weight and breathable.  Stitching is a bit wonky in the shoulders and bunch up on one side.  Didn't notice it until return deadline passed but am pleased with the shirt."
3.0,way smaller than I expected. It looked to me in the pictures like you can carry a few school books in this. But it is the size of a handbag. Still a cute purse if your looking for something small!
3.0,"They are pretty comfortable, but the elastic stuff in the lace falls apart really quickly after a few washes. All the little strings start dangling everywhere"
3.0,"These rip so easy, bottom tears out so easy<br />With or with out shoes height is great"
3.0,Fit a larger than expected but ok . Recieved  with a small part on the zipper pulling out..had to fix it
3.0,The length was too long in the large. I'll have to take it up about an inch and I'm 5'4&#34; tall.
3.0,Ordered a 2XL and it was just a little more clingy than I expected.  Just means I need to exercise more so it will fit perfectly.  I love the color and feel of it.
3.0,"This sherpa is sooo soft! Unfortunately the stitching & quality are a bit cheap.  There's also no lining & it's thinner than it looks, mine got a hole @ the seam in the sleeve after 2 washes."
3.0,Nice watch but entirely too long of bracelet for me. Says you can adjust or take out links but cannot as tried. Metal too soft and some of the screws were soldered over. Pretty but will have to regift.
3.0,"Great little buy for that extra pair of leggings for a non leg day! I just wish the fabric around the ankles was as taught as the rest of the leg. The fabric around the waist is okay, it won't move or slip but it also doesn't provide that &#34;tucked in&#34; comfort feeling that you need when you try to bust out a hard leg day session. Overall a decent product for a good price."
3.0,It’s ok for a night out btw don’t take showers with it will fade out
3.0,Too cheap-looking for the price... Quite unfortunate
3.0,Es bastante mas corto de las medidas que describe el vestido
3.0,"A little bit thick and heavy, but that’s not what bothered me with this item.  The zipper was not centered on the front of the shirt and it kept pulling to the left.  I can’t return to get it replaced because I already cut the tag off and threw the packaging away."
3.0,"I’m surprised that I don’t like this top as much as I thought I would!<br /><br />CONS:<br />~ the weight of the hood pulls the neckline open wide & I feel it pulling.<br />~ the knit is thin with a hole pattern, so will need to add a cami for wearing in the winter.<br />~ the bottom has notched sides & just hangs (no ribbed band). Every picture of the woman in the picture shows her hand in her pocket & it must be so you can’t see how it just hangs!<br />~ the sleeve cuffs are quite fitted on me - the pictures show them pretty loose, but they’re not. Maybe ordering the next size would help this.<br /><br />PROS:<br />~ the colors are very pretty.<br />[SIZE REFERENCE]:<br />I’m 5’8”, 140 lbs, 36B & ordered size Medium. The company size chart was correct since I wear size 8/10.<br />It fits well overall, so would recommend ordering your true size, BUT - - if you want a roomier fit, go up a size.<br /><br />Overall, I think this top is fine but just not comfortable to me. I fiddled with the neckline & shoulders a lot while wearing it & prefer casual clothes I can put on & forget about!<br /><br />**THANK YOU for reading this Review & I hope that it’s Helpful!**"
3.0,Does not fit my daughter correctly will be returning.
3.0,"There’re a few things I want to talk about. When I took them out of the drawstring bag I thought these are pretty, they had some weight so they didn’t feel cheap, but I was concerned the necklace as a whole was going to be too small, too short. I was on point there. You need to pay special attention to the length of the necklace and measure your neck. I didn’t do that and I can’t wear them because they would choke me to death. I wish they came with an appropriate extender, that matches the shape, look and colors of the pearls. As they are now you will need a thin neck to wear them. I’m not sure what stretch of pearls they measure to give length, but I can’t figure it out so as they are pretty, you need to be very careful and decide how you want them to sit and lay on your neck and measure, measure and measure. If price is a concern for the company then offer an extender for an additional price at least that way bigger girls can chose to buy the extender without the headache of returns or being stuck and unhappy about their purchase like I am."
3.0,the shorts are alot brighter colors and less muted than what is shown in the picture. they fit nicely but werent what i was looking for
3.0,"Cute but cheaply made. It will serve its purpose for halloween, but I would suggest lowering your price or look elsewhere for a cheaper one, since you will most likely only get one use out of the headband."
3.0,"These socks are everything the description states- thin no show socks. I personally feel like these are too small for my feet. They scrunch up my toes too much after wearing them, thus making my toes and feet hurt. I wear a US size 9.5"
3.0,"The material is nice and soft, as indicated, but in no way is their size chart correct.  Maybe one day I'll realize that these manufacturers/sellers don't size clothing in the US fashion and quit spending my money on them.  After reading all the reviews and seeing that the 5'9&#34; model is wearing a small, I thought maybe this would work better.  It didn't.  Because this is supposed to be loose and longer, I thought I could order my normal medium, but decided to be safe and ordered a large.  When I got it yesterday and tried it on, it was very tight and hardly covered my hips.  It is NOT long (I'm only 5'0&#34;) and certainly not loose.  As I said, it is a nice top, but I can't recommend it as being accurate in size."
3.0,Cute pants on. If your thighs touch..the sequins rub together and could be uncomfortable. Could not wear for a long time...but they were cute on. Just not functional.
3.0,These shoes are made well but I had to return them because they were way too big and wide. I can deal with wearing double socks but they were still slipping off.
3.0,I bought this for my 13 year old daughter and she said it’s kind of itchy.
3.0,"The cost was not a problem. The material it was made with is uncomfortable. It is hard and rubbed against my skin causing abrasions. It kept rolling down and I saw I had it on through my shirt/blouse. Also, It wasn’t wide enough and length wasn’t what I expected. I’m not big at all. I wanted it so when I work out and practice my dancing it will help me keep my love handles contained.  I asked fir B a return label and no one responded. So I still have the unit SMH"
3.0,"Cute dress, but not true to size. Will be sending back."
3.0,"This dress is somewhat of an enigma. The top is a tad tight, not uncomfortably so, although I have a smaller bust so if you're well endowed it would definitely be too tight. The colors are also much duller in person than I thought they'd be so it looks more frumpy than I had hoped for. I managed to spruce it up with a brightly colored belt. The belt that comes with the dress is practically unusable since it is so short you can barely tie it and it is the exact same material so it just blends in anyways. The length of the dress is perfect! Exactly what I wanted and the skirt is nice and full and flowy. Overall a comfy, somewhat bland dress."
3.0,Cute for a good price but stretches out so much in less than 30 minutes.
3.0,"Really loved the shoes, but had to return them because they were too small. Didn't have an option to exchange size 🙁"
3.0,"So this I should one of those unfortunate times when you order something in a 2x, knowing that every shirt is a little different and it may not hang the the way you'd like, BUT when you get it it's actually A LARGE. The shirt itself is really cute and seems to be pretty high quality. Although it is always unfortunate when sizing is this dramatically off."
3.0,Zipper cheap
3.0,"The watch is beautiful, however the fake leather strap I am not impressed with. I will be swapping it out with something else."
3.0,I ordered the gray and green tops.  The colors are nice but the fabric is very thin and the armholes are way too big (lots of sports bra showing).  I'm sending these back.
3.0,"I liked the overall look of them. However, they were prettt large and kind of pulled on my lobes because they were pushing against my neck. Hard to explain... They also started itching my ears immediately after trying them so I would not recommend for sensitive ears. I would have kept them if they didn't hurt my ears."
3.0,"First, cute shirt!  It washes well and is soft with a slight stretch to it.  I'm not sure if this is the norm but one of the seams on the shoulder of the shirt is wonky.  It is like when you leave a sweater on a hanger for too long and you have that bump from the hanger?  It isn't super noticeable and I still wear it but annoying."
3.0,Cute shirt but runs extremely small and is made of a very thin material.  My daughter loves it though.  I would have returned it completely if my daughter didn't like it so much - I had to do an exchange.
3.0,"Too small per the size chart, and extremely cheap - as far as material goes.  The product, otherwise, is nice. It needs to be longer, as my wife doesn't want her rear end falling out of the bottom."
3.0,"Nice dress, but the color was a bit pale around the arm pits"
3.0,"This is a beautiful top but as usual with pattyboutik clothing, it is extremely form fitting showing every little bump and bulge. I will need to size up ."
3.0,"They are warm, cozy and comfortable. Worst part is they just stretched right out after two wear , they keep falling to my ankle"
3.0,"Dress fits great and it’s true to size , I’m 5’5  , 165 pounds ,bought a size Medium. The white dress is a bit see through."
3.0,"Like the color and ombré, but the fit was weird. High waisted but not in a flattering way. I've bought several other leggings from Amazon, and would not recommend these."
3.0,Ordered a small and it's more like a kids small. Not an adult small.  The shirt is not minded with hood material. Instead you can remove the hood with buttons if you want. I received product at a discounted price for my feedback.
3.0,"Pretty, but I ordered the Rose Gold, not gold"
3.0,"Beautiful shirt, but the fabric is thin and you can see through it.  It would be a perfect shirt, if it weren't for that.  It runs a tad small."
3.0,very thin material - but cute.
3.0,This is a nice vest and well made.  But it doesn't hang in the front like the photo.  Instead  the two flaps are unfolded and flop forward giving the whole front a mostly plain light gray look.
3.0,I got a large but will fit a small-medium size short person.  It's too short for me to wear as a dress and I'm 5'2.  I can wear it as a blouse but my intention is to wear it as a mini dress.  It came down just an inch past my butt so it wears like a blouse.  It is very pretty and looked to be well made.  Too bad it doesn't fit so I'm returning.
3.0,Love the color. True to picture. The T-shirt was way too long and too tight. Bought my normal size. Too tight. Definitely size up for a regular but not too lose fit through the body but will then be even longer. Too much material to tuck in for someone if average height.
3.0,You can't have a tummy really better be slim. Its pretty and well made
3.0,Love it but it ran a little large.  Thankfully it shrank a little even in a cold water wash.  Hope it doesn't continue to shrink with future laundry
3.0,Sexy but fit is small.
3.0,It wasn’t long enough for a dress and I ordered a size larger. But it’s good material and it’s stull cute enough to be worn as a shirt so I’m keeping it.
3.0,"Ordered a plus and it was huge! I have a 39&#34; waist. I could have lived with a plus, but because it was on the tightest, the end stuck straight out and didn't lay flat. Returning it for the junior one size"
3.0,It is longer than I would prefer and also has a slight torsional bend along the axis so that it doesn't lay completely flat.  The bend isn't noticeable while wearing it.
3.0,"These socks are just ok, they are an 80% cotton 20% polyester. I worried about shrinking and I was correct after washing in cold and drying in dryer on normal they did shrink. The foot shown is a woman's size 10.5 which is a man's 8.5, the sock is suppose to fit up to 13, I don't think this can happen, especially after washing. They are snug and will not slide down but I did notice after one washing the top of the sock is rippled and I think that elastic will let go soon. They are semi soft. All in all they were just over $1 a pair, not bad but not great for what you get, these socks are fine for a teen who will outgrow them fast. I did get these at a 50% discount via AMZRC."
3.0,"It seemed a little dull, not shiny."
3.0,"The fabric didn't look as elegant as it looks on the picture. It also runs a little big. I'm usually size L, I think M would be perfect. Also on the picture the line in the middle it looks on the picture by the waist however, on my case it was underneath the bust."
3.0,The finished hem lines were sloppy and uneven and there were many threads hanging at the bottom that had to be trimmed and needed ironing<br />It was a much narrower fit around the hips then was pictured in the ad<br />It looked like the machine sewing was done in 2 min without ever checking the finished product
3.0,"beautiful jacket, but it runs very small order 2 sizes up."
3.0,"I am 5'6 inches tall and weigh 130 lbs.  I ordered a small in both the grey and the black.  The grey is 2 inches longer than the black which is very frustrating.  It does not fit big and baggie like the picture shows, which I am happy about.  My issue is,  the dresses should be cut with the same specifications. If I buy a small in 4 different colors I expect consistency!"
3.0,This sweatshirt is very thin. It does fit comfortable but is just a lounging sweatshirt or a sweatshirt for the early fall.
3.0,"I love the cut and idea of this dress, but the fabric is so cheap it is starting to fade and slightly pill after 2 washes.  Be prepared to baby this dress, or don't bother.  Such a shame, it's really comfy and flattering."
3.0,More a pajama than a pant. Material is too thin. Comfortable to be used for house wear.
3.0,The sleeve is well made but fits more like a tight sock than a graduated compression.  It feels more like an 8-15 mmHg at best ( that's being generous) but I doubt it's 18-21mmHg compression.  Either way I like how it's made and I only need mild compression anyway. For the price I would buy again for the quality
3.0,"Little sister too big, sister too small"
3.0,"The fingers are stiff, it's hard to bend while wearing them. I bought these to prune my bougnavillas and the thorns didn't penetrate. I wish the sleeves were thicker and longer"
3.0,Very cute top is way too big bottom fits as described
3.0,This was a sturdy product.  I bought it for a Halloween party where I went dressed as a chef.  It was easy to hold and light enough not to be a burden all night.  Had a great time.
3.0,Top is too big bottom fits
3.0,This product was as pretty as the picture I will say the material did feel a lot cheaper than I expected and a lot thinner and I got an appropriate size but it was slightly smaller than I expected I expected it to extend past my butt but it stopped at the small of my back so I ended up giving it away to someone shorter
3.0,The bag looks very nice. Came early. Medium size.
3.0,They are warm to the legs but there is not enough material in the seat so they tend to slide down your backside almost to the point of having a butt crack feel to them which I really dislike.
3.0,"Works as expected, not the most attractive."
3.0,Not as strong or sturdy as I would like. Somewhat loose clamping.
3.0,"I want to like this a lot, but the fabric is a bit see-through at the top, making it necessary to wear a cami underneath."
3.0,"Material is thin, wrinkles easily and requires thorough ironing. Fits very loosely, would recommend buying a size smaller than usual. Color is as shown."
3.0,"Pro:<br />• Great looking shirt<br />• Fits me perfectly (I'm tall and skinny (6'3 170lbs), so this isn't always the case)<br />• Feels comfy<br />• Breathes pretty well<br />• Drys pretty fast<br /><br />Cons:<br />• I bought 2 and within a day or two of wearing both, some of the seams already started coming undone. On one of the shirts, it started fraying around my stomach on the first day :/ (not the seams, but the actual material)<br />• The neck is a little snug. It's really not that bad, but I started having some minor breathing issues recently and it exaggerates them a bit.<br /><br />I love the look and feel of the sure, but I hate the fact it started to fray so fast :/ 3 stars"
3.0,"I bought this because my daughter had a growth skirt and all of a sudden outgrew her praise dance skirt and needed a new one at the last minute. This Was not same material as other praise dance skirts. Slightly off white. And more sheer than pictured. However, in a pinch, with the appropriate layers it blended in with the other dancers’ attire. It is a cute skirt but too sheer to wear alone."
3.0,"Sadly I can only wear it for a few hours. Wearing this band for over 24 hours leads to red irritated skin. Product looks great, but the edges are so rough they cause sensitivity and pain. Because My skin is not naturally sensitive this reaction was unexpected."
3.0,Very pretty but a little too big
3.0,not as loose as the picture makes it seem and the color is a little off in the red but it's a decent shirt and it's super soft. go up a size if you want it to fit loosely.
3.0,Very pretty. Main complaint is that the tassles starting falling out the first time I wore this.
3.0,Looks ok but I honestly don’t like how it fit..Kind of cheap material.The crotch area is saggy so I have to keep pulling the pants up to keep from soggy crotch look🙄
3.0,"Sent wrong size.  Material is nice, light for warm weather. Delivery on time.  3 stars because I got the wrong size and now unavailable."
3.0,Way to big for a normal sized head
3.0,I did not like the quality. I got them as a gift. I bought these glasses not knowing what to expect. The quality is something to be desired and I do not know why we are still selling any product made in China Bad Business
3.0,"It is very nice looking, but this scapular with daily use, (I don't shower in it) did not last out the month.  I do soak it in cool mild soapy water and air dry every 7 days, the images just do not hold up with 24 hour wear."
3.0,I’m so sad because I love the look and fit of these leggings but mine had snags all over them and after further inspection one of the snags was a hole ☹️ It seemed like they didn’t send me brand new ones I hope that they step up the quality because I would order 10 mores pairs if there weren’t holes in them.
3.0,"Got this for my mom for her birthday, because she's born on St. Patrick's day, and loves butterflies. But the chain is pretty fragile and seems cheap, I replaced the chain with a stronger one, and the necklace is smaller than I thought it would be, but my mom likes it so..."
3.0,"It took a full month to get these rings. They look exactly as pictured aside from the spiral ring which is not as tightly coiled but that's not a problem, I like the looser look. I have small fingers (I wear a size three) so I'm glad these were adjustable or they'd be too big. The only thing is because they are metal and they are painted, if you wear them regularly and do things with your hands the paint will begin to chip and you'll start to see silver."
3.0,nice but very thing material
3.0,Expected better quality for the brand
3.0,"Seems like an okay necklace, but not what I saw in the picture.  It looked like there were additional pink stones on the bar and there were not.  I was disappointed."
3.0,shoes is ok but the size is to big.
3.0,Cheap material. Not warm at all.
3.0,I didn't like the style on me and it came a little large.
3.0,This item looks and works as it was described on the page where I acquired it. It does what I expected it to do.
3.0,"Runs small, not made for larger heads. It's a well made hat."
3.0,I really liked the style of the jacket.  Great look but have come to realize I cannot make the overseas sizes work.  I am Between a XL and a 2X.  I would say the if you are above a large you cannot make their sizes work.  Also a bit thinner than expected
3.0,These boots didnt even last 7 months. The cracked in the sole and rubber was busted. Very loud walking boots.<br />Husband liked them at first. But for the price they should last longer. Walmart has better quality! Js.
3.0,Model looks good in dress not me. The straps were short dress came up to my chin
3.0,"Pants were to long. Don't remember getting a top (maybe I did). Use the Bottoms on cold nights, pull the excess over my toes. Works pretty good. I try not to return things because of Amazons Policies"
3.0,simple and gets the job done
3.0,Nice Great leather but the prong attachment which secures the band keeps popping off and actually lead to my watch falling off and scratching at the front glass
3.0,"Tried to find the shortest length that would still fit around my calf (17&#34;). Length measurement for me needed to be 13&#34;.  Makes the zipper buckle (see photo) and compression rings on my legs after removing them.  Dr prescribed them to prevent blood clots. They do provide compression I need.<br /><br />It is also very difficult to keep the fabric of the zipper from catching in the zipper. The zipper also doesn't lock very well, keeps coming unzipped. Will continue to use them till I can find a better fit.<br /><br />Update 3/10/17. The issue of being too long is not the fault of the product, but that my legs are too short."
3.0,Not what I excepted
3.0,Quality is good but too small for my 9 year old.
3.0,"I have this same pullover in black and it washed up fine, but this color pills really bad. Everytime I want to ware it I have to shave it with the Pill remover."
3.0,I got this for my 2022 M2 Air until apple makes something M2 specific. It’ll do for now but it’s not 100% perfect and you can’t charge while it’s in the case. See photos.
3.0,"Liked it but sent it back.  The stone is well set and the craftsmanship is remarkable.  My issue is with the color of the stone.  The only color I could read was white so I guessed that the picture that had a blue cast might be from filming.  As it turns out the blue is a dynamic color to the stone strong enough to look fake.  I have other white moonstones, grey as well.  This needs to be at least sold as rainbow moonstone.  I wouldn't have purchased it even though I loved the setting.  I had a special use that did not include the strong blue presence."
3.0,After 1 week 1 broke :(
3.0,"I bought these slippers for using around the house. immediately after putting them on, I could tell something didn't feel right. I wondered if I had put them on backwards and swapped feet. but that didn't help and felt worse than before. I then realized when they manufactured the slipper, on one of the slippers they had used a right bottom with a left top. so while the bottom of the foot went in the right direct, the top of the foot was pushing in the opposite direction. leaving my feet in an awkward feeling. I still ended up using them for a while thinking I would just get used to it over time. however, I never did get used to it and I ended up no longer wearing them after getting tired of the uncomfortable feeling. However, I will say had I got a properly constructed pair of slippers. I would have given 5 stars as I felt the inside construction was of a comfortable material."
3.0,They were stretched very thin on my curvy bod so I would not recommend trying to wear them as pants.
3.0,Light weight and easily folded into suitcase.
3.0,"my daughter loves to play with it. i had gotten it for myself for a gothic wedding but chose to go another route. well packaged , arrived on time, and is cute.<br />not as long as i assumed it would be and the clip came on glued on the 1st time trying it on"
3.0,"Nice and wide at the lenses, but way to tight over the ears and you can't adjust them."
3.0,"Super cute until I washed it.  I washed it,  let it air dry and it shrunk,  significantly.  I gave it to my sister. I ordered an xl and it shrunk to about a medium."
3.0,"A bit bulky, I will use them.  Alice"
3.0,The stones are nice. This is my first time buying lava stone or a diffuser necklace for that matter but it took a while for the EO to absorb. The chain is cheap looking and feeling. Not the look or feel I was hoping for.
3.0,"This was not what I ordered, but its OK."
3.0,Wish the underwear was more low rise and don't come up so high. Still a good product.
3.0,"very itchy, kind of looks like a diaper cuz of how puffy it is. but other than that it’s alright..."
3.0,Wrinkles very easily.
3.0,"Fabric was thin, making a it a summer weight shirt.  The buttons on it were overwhelmingly distracting, cheapening the appearance."
3.0,"super stretchy, doesn't &#34;slim&#34; or firm."
3.0,"I only gave this 3 stars because I ordered it May 29th and didn't get it until July!  Too long for me.  But, that being said, it is cute and feels quality made.  I got several compliments on it the day I wore it. It feels sturdy like it will hold up in the laundry.  It does run small though.  I got an XL, which is usually pretty roomy on me and it is more snug than I would like.  It's not tight by any means, but definitely doesn't feel like an XL."
3.0,The distressed metal doesn't look the same in person.
3.0,"the top is lovely, though i was disappointed with the material, it was more like rayon/silk  rather than polyester."
3.0,I don't know how to tie it though ! Very cute came in nice packaging.  Great for summer
3.0,"The clutch is a great size, perfect number of slots for credit cards, love that my phone fits in it. But the zippers are VERY glitchy. I wouldn’t purchase again knowing how the zippers work."
3.0,This shirts fits snug out of the package but I'm afraid to wash it as it probably won't fit anymore. I'm a XL and wish I ordered a 2XL.
3.0,"Missing a pearl on the necklace. Not a huge deal as I just took the other one off so it wouldn't look uneven. But still, should have come as pictured."
3.0,i could barely get it undone and now i cant even get it on without it being stuck there for eternity
3.0,I love the color and they feel smooth.The only downsize is tha the top rolls.
3.0,"On the fence with this one. It’s a bit tighter than I normally wear things. I am, however, working with trainer and have a goal to lose 10 more lbs. Using the seller’s size chart, ordered a large, it’s little snug in bust—38D—which is my problem area. I love the style and the 3/4 sleeves bc in the south, 60s are common temps for this season. Really like the color as it pairs well with jeans or khakis. For reference I’m 5’6” and 160 lbs. Typically wear medium or large in tops."
3.0,Love this item/style etc but sizes run super smaller than what would normally be.
3.0,Chain is too big but cute
3.0,Earrings look a little cheap but the bracelet and necklace are nice.
3.0,I bought this and it broke within a week.  Ordered it again - thought hey 10$ is a good price and I love the design.  Second one broke too.
3.0,Too small for 6 month old
3.0,"Most of the charms fell off on the first wearing. They are easy enough to slip back on, but finding them on the ground proved difficult. My daughter was very disappointed. She used her own money to purchase this item because her Girl Scout Troop saw the Wicked musical."
3.0,"Now I going to give this a mixed review of something I don't think people are talking about here on these reviews. Now first off the product itsef is one of the greatest and easier headsets I've purchased in a long time, I've bought several wireless headphones and they don't come close to how good an ideas of a product this is. Now as far as quality it's okay, nothing I couldn't fix myself. The design work on the buttons could be better making it hard to figure out which buttions are which and it's hard to press them...the sound is beautiful, loud and great. The calls work Perfectly but there's one major problem that I have with this, although it's my fault that I didn't research it....the hat size! Omg what a nightmare. Sure when a hat like that is to big simply fold it up towards the top and wallah! Easy fix? No becuase the buttons are sewn to the bottom not possible. Why not get it tailored by cleaners? Nope they do no such thing! I'm hoping that instead of one size fits all they create small, medium, large and charge accordingly, I wouldn't mind paying for he extra detail. If they don't figure that out in their product, then it's almost relatively simple to make you own version of your small hat version. All you need is that product and your mother and I'm sure you can make a good replica of it. I recommend that only becuase to tailor this hat down yourself is a nightmare...cuz of the design button placement and zipper placement makes it very hard you'd have to really cut it up and put it back together again like is what manufacturered not worth it unless you actually like sowing lol. I hope that helps all the people with little to no hair, or small head size but man if you got a big head very comfy 5 stars sound 3 stars for the hat."
3.0,"Cute top, fit is fine but I got  a light pink color instead of black, something I would never wear"
3.0,Color is not yellow as shown but peach tone. I wanted the bright yellow that was shown.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this one. It just fell a little short for my expectations. I’ll start with the pros<br />1. Love the color- I ordered a green one and it’s a great rich color<br />2. The fabric- is very soft and almost silky feeling but it’s cotton. It is a little thin but I like that for a summer dress<br />3. The pockets 🥰<br />4 I like the pleats and feel like they help give the dress some shape.<br />5. The skirt has plenty of float fabric<br /><br />Cons for me were-<br />1. A little too short for me. The pictures made it look longer but this came well above my knees. I am 5’7”.<br />2. When I took it off, the stitching somewhere popped. Being a T-shirt type dress I would expect it to be a little stronger than that.<br />3. The fabric is thin so my white bra underneath was a little noticeable. A diff color bra would solve this.<br /><br />I feel like it is a decent casual dress. Comfy. Not date worthy in my opinion."
3.0,"Super cute! It was right around my chest. I normally wear a medium, but I ordered a large."
3.0,"Like most things, the picture looks far nicer than the actual product.  I purchased this in yellow.  I like the design, but the fabric really bothers me. ****Its BATHING SUIT type material*** -- shiny, a bit thick, and a touch stretchy.  I really want to like it since the cut is ok and the print is pretty, but I just think it looks somewhat cheap and hangs weird because of the bathing suit type material.  This would have been beautiful if they made it in a more gauzy linen or cotton or something more flowy."
3.0,"Cute and fun but not practical.  Material not absorbent, not good to wipe hands on."
3.0,Beautiful costume but my daughter busted the spaghetti straps the first day she wore it. I feel like the straps weren’t sewn well. I sewed it back up so she can still wear it but I’m kind of disappointed.
3.0,Its OK.  Not crazy about  the fabric.
3.0,Received this product the other day because my designer wallet fell apart. So I wanted something cheaper I don’t remind replacing every other year. This one will suffice. I love the slim feel of the wallet and it’s comfortability while it’s in my pocket. My only thing is that it’s very difficult to take the cards out unless you leave them sticking out of the pockets a bit so you can drag it out with your thumb; especially if you want to the wallet to keep its shape it’s best to not stick your fingers in it trying to grab a credit card.
3.0,"Maybe the others raving about this hoodie has a heavyweight zipper. I have never owned a hoodie that has such a thin zipper with tiny baby teeth. As you see it curls does not hang flat. I washed it cold and low heat, the fabric doesn't wrinkle only the zipper.<br />I did want mine to be very oversized so I ordered XXL, I should have ordered XL and it would have been still oversized. You just never know.. I do love everything else about hoodie, how the sleeves are long, and hangs below hips, Love the light weight fabric, and that its not sweatshirt fabric.<br />So disappointing about zipper😒<br />I am debating do I just keep and upgrade the zipper myself?"
3.0,It wasn't that blingy like it looks on the picture but it is nice and love the style it's worth what I paid for it
3.0,"Bought these in the grey and the red marl in an xs and s respectively. The red were really more of a tangerine color and were pretty see through. Definitely could not squat at the gym in these. Material was thin and not as compressive as I'd like. The xs was a touch too small for me (kinda as expected). For reference I am 5'6"" about 135 with longer legs and a shorter torso. In order to get the contouring dots to hit me in the right areas, I had to hike the pants up pretty high. The small did fit fairly well, however I felt like the waistband didn't hit me in a flattering place so I returned them."
3.0,This dress is cute but I was really hoping it would be a little looser and more flattering to a post partum Body. It hugs my new stomach pooch in a way that makes me uncomfortable wearing it out. It’s cute - my body just hasn’t bounced back enough yet for it. I think nursing dresses should be a little more forgiving
3.0,The necklace is not as shiny as the one in the picture. It kind of looks like just metal with no smoothness. I also don’t like how that box itself has the barcode on it and said “to my wife” when we ordered the daughter one. We had to switch the box. I do like what the card says though
3.0,Too big. Had to send back. The back had to be cinched together so you lost the cute cross back.
3.0,Didn't like fit didn't grab the waist like the picture
3.0,Okay shirt for the money.  Nothing special.
3.0,this shoe runs about a half size to small
3.0,"My wife wears a  Xlarge and after washing it shrunk down to a medium/large. its to much of a hassle to return. Not purchasing clothes on line again, back to dept stores."
3.0,I love the design! I thought this was a t-shirt. The fabric feels more stretchy and tight to the body and doesn't not fit loose like a t-shirt should feel.
3.0,I really do love these. The only thing is... if you’re really excited for the white bracelet then don’t get this pack because the white one changes color (if you get it wet)<br />However if you have a small wrist these are good.
3.0,"I was hoping this would work for a summer wedding but….she’s just so thin. Thin enough to where I worry that if I had some fun sweat marks in embarrassing spots I’d be distracted by them all night. This like…fit…but in a weird way. I am  44.5-39.5-53“, size 18 pants, 46D, ~250lbs. The XXL was able to zip and would have been wonderful and comfortable if the fabric were thicker or at least double lined. The top neckline is a straight cut across a few inches below collarbone (but straps are adjustable). There was a poorly sewn flap of fabric on the inside top of the dress like someone didn’t have time to cut excess off a hem. It’s a cute dress, but maybe only for someone who doesn’t sweat and someone who doesn’t use shapewear that is comfortable with their natural skin. The pink color was as pictured. And again, it theoretically fit, but between the fabric and the top flap I have to return her :("
3.0,"I work out in the woods, so I put things to the test. You can get about 2/3 weeks of beating and banging on these bands. Then they tend to fray and stretch. When that happens, the band clip slides a lot and loosens up the watch band."
3.0,"I am 5'7 and 108 pounds bust size of 34a. I'm a 0 jean and an xs waist. I have to take this to my seamstress to fix.<br />It's really big on me around the waist and the bow doesnt fit me correctly. Good for someone with a larger waist and bust but for ladies who are small like me. Please just go to a lingerie store...So glad this was a gift, now I can afford to actually make it wearable.<br /><br />Nice fabric though, It's a mesh sort of, but I think it's perfect for this outfit. 3/5 because it's still a good piece of lingerie, just not for someone my size.<br /><br />ps, the blow is adjustable clip on. Wish it tied instead! Comes undone easily."
3.0,This is a pretty dress but there is no zipper or opening on the back or side which makes very hard to remove the dress. Is too long for me and the elastic makes it look cheap.
3.0,"I only use it once for wild rides, and it’s does hold my Cochlear implants real good."
3.0,"I like the colors but I dont know why the pearls have lines, but I like to wear them so much, they look very nice!"
3.0,We<br />Love it but it is suppose to be all pink. The top is peach and bottom is pink. Since her theme is pink I am a little disappointed about that.
3.0,poor quality material clouded in a week and wouldnt clear up even when washed
3.0,"I like everything about this top except that it is fragile. I hung it on a clothes hanger and when I went to remove it to wear, the neck seam got caught on the hanger and the fabric of the shirt separated from the seam. I sewed it back with a needle and thread. It's unusual to find a linen T-shirt and I like everything else about it, but because of its fragility I rarely wear it."
3.0,"I recently received the Raroauf Mens Cargo Shorts in size 38 and was disappointed to find that the sizing is off. As someone who normally wears a size 38 in loose fit pants, these shorts were extremely tight on me. I would have needed to size up two sizes in order for them to fit comfortably. While the shorts themselves look nice and seem to be made from a good material, the sizing issue makes them unwearable for me. Overall, I would give these shorts a three star review due to the sizing issue."
3.0,Ended up returning - for some reason it looks a lot better in the pictures than in real life.
3.0,love the bracelet but find the closure to be difficult for my arthritic fingers to handle.
3.0,Got two of the same sock instead of the one dot.
3.0,Weight of jeans. To heavy
3.0,"I have owned several pair of hunter boots for myself and two daughters over the years. I've never had a problem with the other pairs. I bought these for my 3 year old and had them less then a month. She's hardly woren them, starting to peel 😒 ."
3.0,Initially I liked these shoes but if I walked in them for more than a few blocks they caused a lot of pain in my foot. I would not recommend if your feet are wide. They are very pretty but eventually I had to get rid of them since they were so uncomfortable.
3.0,Fabric was nice quality
3.0,"The belt is beautiful! However, after the first week, the dragonfly buckle kept falling off and I could not get the tool to work. I ended up losing the little screws that came with it."
3.0,"cute suit, padding in the top is awful!"
3.0,"The bodysuit is well made and looks great but it is way too big. ordered a small and it still did not fit. Needed it for a photoshoot and could not wear it at all. Very disappointed. For reference, I am 5' 4&#34; and weight 106"
3.0,The bag had a VERY STRONG chemical odor to it and the seam started to split almost immediately. :(
3.0,CUTE Undies at a GREAT price...Lace started to rip off after a few weeks...Fit was great...I ordered a Medium and I am 5'7&#34; and 125 pounds
3.0,"Socks are very warm but my husband said they are small. He is size 9.5 and these should fit 8-11. Also, they are clipped together with the metal pins at the top, we pulled few strings trying to remove these metal pins. Warm, well made socks just get a size bigger and be very careful removing the metal pins."
3.0,Clip it a little tuff but what you see is what you get
3.0,Very nice slim band a little small fitting
3.0,Not true to size... you'll need to order 2 sizes up
3.0,"These clip-ons work well. While driving, they're excellent, as the polarization cuts down on reflections, and they are easy to clip on, you don't even need to flip them up or down<br /><br />However, they are terrible outside the car. When the sun is high, it gets between the clip ons and your glasses, which causes a very bright reflection and makes it hard to see, and their small size means they don't block the sun very well.<br /><br />So, 5 stars for use in the car, 2 stars for use outdoors."
3.0,The solar lights do not work.
3.0,"These underwear fit me a 32inch waist better after washing and drying than out of the box, and by the end of the day, the butt fabric is saggy and give me a wedgie though they claim they are wedgie free. I think I should have bought smalls instead.<br /><br />Overall, I love these underwear! They keep my scrotum secure, and feels like plenty of room compared to standard briefs. My only real complaint is the front flap. I don’t have a problem with falling out of the hole, I stay through it even throughout an active day, but the front flap has a ton of excess fabric. The modal pictures show it tightly secured around the models anatomy. On a normal person wearing them per instructions, you can see the whole front of my anatomy, and the fabric keeps going making me feel like my penis is free to roam the neighborhood.<br /><br />I’ve bunched up the fabric and tucked it into the waist band, and feel way more secure, and way more comfortable. I mean the flap has room for an elephant trunk, and the fabric is soft and stretchy enough that even with half the fabric a super well endowed male would have room. I just wish it offered a more secure and tighter hug on my penis.<br /><br />Other than that, I will try the smaller size and see how the front flap and fabric reacts throughout the day, and if it doesn’t get better with the sizing, then I would not re purchase until there was an updated pair, or a pair made of 100% cotton that doesn’t stretch and become saggy.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />After wearing them day after day, and constantly trying to figure out what’s missing, it finally clicked!<br />So after washing them in hot water and drying on hot making them physically shrink, no more wedgies!<br />After wrestling with the front flap I debunked the problem. These underwear are designed to sit higher on the hips than any other brief I’ve ever worn. I found that if you roll the waist band down just so that it reads inside out, then the underwear completely adjust putting your anatomy exactly where it should be in the front flap, and it eliminates all that excess front fabric.<br /><br />If they could run another line of “low rise briefs” and just take a half inch off the top, these would be the best underwear ever invented! But as for me, I’m hemming mine up with a sewing machine and will continue wearing them daily!"
3.0,I was very excited to receive my wallet.  It is very nice looking and seemed the perfect size for my needs.  My issue with it came when I tried putting credit cards in the front card slots - directly under the front flap.  Most of them are too tight for my cards.  I did manage to get a card into one but it is blocked from sliding a card in completely by the snap.  Needless to say I returned the wallet as I do need at least the 8 advertised card slots.  Amazon is great about doing returns.
3.0,review this
3.0,"I'm not gonna lie, they were cheaply made.. but they were cheap"
3.0,Nice looking but way to small for the price
3.0,"The item is beautiful. However, it broke on me. So I would like a refund."
3.0,These were definitely stretchy and comfortable but I’m not sure if maybe I got the wrong size because the waistband gaped on me and I had extra fabric everywhere. I got a medium and I’m 5’4 138ish pounds. It didn’t seem sheer though so that’s also good. I might rebuy in a size smaller.<br /><br />UPDATE - bought in a small and they fit so much better! However this pair came with a few seams coming undone and a piece of fabric that didn’t seem like it belonged there.
3.0,"Nice hoodie, kinda short in the arms tho"
3.0,They are cute but I returned them. They are much larger than I thought they would be and covered half my face.
3.0,They are cute but one pair had the back post bent.
3.0,"Not the best quality, but looks nice."
3.0,"So i ordered the red pattern ad the navy pattern both in medium. The red pattern is gorgeous and fits really well but the navy one is so much smaller in the waist and so short almost showing my but cheeks. I double checked to make sure I was sent the right size and yes, they were both mediums. It's disappointing because now I'm wary of buying another pair because I have no idea what fit it will come in. Wish I would have taken a picture but i QUICKLY returned the navy pair"
3.0,I liked the glasses a lot but the bamboo sides or temples broke not long after I bought these glasses. I fixed them with superglue to continue wearing them but then the other side broke off and I had to superglue that as well. They didn't wear the same after. Today the temple I glued first fell off again.
3.0,I am experimenting. I am not sure its for me. I had bought some at a jewelry store and I lost them taking my shirt off over my head without knowing it. so I am trying again.
3.0,the silver one has loose treading. :(
3.0,Says belt clip but has no clip just kick stand
3.0,I loved this hat design and was pleasantly surprised when I opened it as it is made of a great material that can be folded up and does not show any wrinkles.  I was unhappy thought when I went to put it on my head it was too small to fit me comfortably. I would have loved for it to have fit me as I would have worn it to every beach and sim event I got invited to.  It really is cute and stylish...just too small for me. I feel like I have an average sized head as most hats fit me so I am not sure about their sizing.
3.0,I’m normally a medium and ordered a medium. It fits but large would be more comfortable (normally size 10/ medium). It’s very think material which is ok for summer. Going to return but probably would have kept if it was larger. Embroidery is pretty nice too.
3.0,"I don't think this scarf is made of hemp and cotton. It smells synthetic, almost like a polyester blend of some kind. It also develops holes rather easily, so if you're interested in this item, you'd do well to handle it very carefully."
3.0,Looks nice but it's very fragile.
3.0,"I'm about 5'1, quite slender, usually an XS or S. This dress is definitely designed for taller girls. If it didn't have the second layer at the bottom, it might have been cute on me, but as-is it was too long for the loose A-line style (which I like on me if the length is right) to be attractive. The sleeves were too long, too. The fabric is actually quite pretty. You can't see in the photo, but there's a subtle metallic gold tracing the floral designs. What I didn't like about the fabric was how washed out it looked at certain angles and in certain lighting."
3.0,The straight bar is way to long for my mouth. Which makes it very hard to use.
3.0,"This is a decent backpack. It's a good cheap, starter pack, but this definitely isnt 60L. Its 2946 cubic inches, which is only 48L. That's a huge difference..."
3.0,"In the picture the scarf appears to have a black edge with gray, black and blue print.  When the scarf arrived it is only Black white and gray.  Pretty print but all dull colors wasn't what I was wanting or expecting. Good quality material, and the other scarves I ordered from Datework Womens met my color expectations so not sure what happened with this one.  It will work for a Secret Santa gift but I won't be keeping for myself."
3.0,Slightly larger than expected.  The bottom is a bit wider than my liking
3.0,"it fits pretty snug, not a true XL and the L was too small"
3.0,Needs extra material so it’s not tightly pulled up your rear end.
3.0,I like length but the material is too transparent. The other issue is that that can be causing this issue is material is really thin and it shows the material of what bra your wearing. Ok to wear under a jacket or something.
3.0,A little revealing below the waist
3.0,"I'm a 12/14 and wear a L/XL and the &#34;sleeves&#34; did not fit right and I actually tore them when putting them on.  It was so inexpensive that I just let it go and tossed it out. I found some others on Amazon without the batwings that were a great value and good quality.  I'm giving this 3 stars because it was decent quality and cute, I just think it should be marketed to S/M size women with short arms."
3.0,"Only one size available.  I am 5&#34;2, the sleaves are a little bit long to me."
3.0,"Wife normally wears medium, but needed X-Large."
3.0,Lenses pop out after only a few wears
3.0,8ball rack stinks
3.0,"I like the length and the material is stretchy. However, the material is very thin."
3.0,We love the dress but had to reorder 3 times going down in size.
3.0,the material seems a thinner than i thought but still cute Apron.
3.0,Not worth the amount I paid.  Scissors are loose hard to cut things some times
3.0,"They're ok.  The color is nice.  I normally wear 3&#34; hoops, but because of the color, I decided to try them. They're just a little to small for me.  I plan to give them to a family member who wears smaller hoop earrings."
3.0,I bought this dress a size up then I usually dodge to other reviews. It was huge on me.i probably could have gotten a size down and been okay. Unfortunately they didn't have the size I needed after getting the one that was tonig so I had to return and look elsewhere. The product itself seemed nice besides the sizing issue
3.0,"I got these jogger pants to my go to pants for store trips and school pickup.  The color looks good, the fabric isnt the best, and the worst feature is that the legs at the bottom are so tight, so hard to take off and put on- around the ankle"
3.0,Material thinner than expected
3.0,"I dropped this in my watch list wish after watching a review video for the Starking AM0184 and being very surprised at what you get for the price, and my wife got it for me as a little surprise!<br /><br />This watch is very surprising for the price, like it seems several Starking watches are.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />** Build -- The external build quality is good.  It does appear that the case is 316L SS, but that's on looks alone, I'm not qualified to state it is for sure, but it is very heavy, not what I expected AT ALL for a unit in this price range.  The finish is really, really good.  No scuffs, scrapes or leftover tooling marks anywhere on the case.  The striping on the rotor and bridge elements is all very consistent and looks really sharp -- sharper than any of my other watches with NH35 movements for sure.<br /><br />** Feel -- the feel of the watch on the wrist is good.  It is a thick watch, definitely not the Orient Bambino on the wrist and sits tall, but overall, I like how it feels.  I like the heft of my Seiko Mini-Turtle way more than the feel of a Quartz lightweight, for example.  While this doesn't feel quite that hefty (due largely to the leather band instead of a bracelet) it is close.<br /><br />** Face design -- this face design is rather unique from others I've seen.  It is important to note that there is no seconds hand on this watch.  The smaller dial at the 6 position is a 24 hour dial, not the seconds as I thought it was.  The open heart balance wheels are what set this apart for me visually.  Skeletonization or open dials normally represent a serious premium, and while this is more expensive than many Starking watches, the premium here isn't huge.  If you look at the AM0184, for instance, it's roughly $50 for a date complication face that is simple, looks really nice and seems to be a good quality dial, but it's a simple dial.  This just looks neat to me to have the two little wheels constantly moving.<br /><br />** Timekeeping -- So far, in around 1.5 days of wear, it has kept time well.  I'm sure it's off by a few seconds but I don't have a timegrapher yet to measure how well it's really doing.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />** No seconds hand -- Almost every watch I own has a seconds hand and I like that.  It's not a show-stopper, but reduces the utility of the piece.<br /><br />** Only 50M water resistance.  With a screw down caseback it would seem all it really needs is a screw-down crown to improve this.  50M for a dressy watch isn't terrible, though.<br /><br />** Band -- I'm normally a bracelet or NATO/Z strap person, and not a huge fan of leather bands for look or feel.  This is labeled 'Genuine Leather' but it is not supple and is in truth rather stiff.  It looks okay so far, and for this price point, I'm not complaining.  I do see some Starkings with steel bracelets, though and this watch would IMO look much better on one of their butterfly clasp bracelets.<br /><br />** Lume -- I almost thought the claim of 'double luminous hands' was a false one as well, as I'd had the watch in the sun for awhile and in a completely dark room saw nothing, but after a few more hours of exposure the lume was visible.  This isn't Seiko or other top-notch lume.  For me it was barely visible.  But it is there.<br /><br />** Marketing -- it's a little tough to get what you can feel confident is accurate information on the specs.  There are various listings here and on ali that are all over the board on whether this is using Sapphire crystal (maybe?), whether it has two tourbillons (highly doubtful), the butterfly clasp on the leather band (nope), and other little details in how the piece is advertised just have you wondering what you're really getting.  That's unfortunate since it looks great and seems to run well (time will tell on this, however).<br /><br />On the two tourbillons, it just seems so highly unlikely that there is one actual tourbillon, much less two on the watch, and while the seller says it is a mistake in the marketing that has been corrected, the listing I'm commenting on still shows that is how they are advertising it.  I say unlikely rather than preposterous because the movement manufacturer Starking reportedly uses DOES manufacture a tourbillon-including movement.  It is preposterous that this would have two tourbillons -- the difficulty of that movement is not easily copied.  I've watched the purported 'left and right tourbillon' under magnification, and they aren't moving as a tourbillon should.  So that kind of false claim in the listing makes everything else (like the use of Sapphire at this price point) questionable.  That's why I drop it to 3 stars -- I'm not 100% sure what I'm actually getting beyond something I think looks cool.<br /><br />All in all, I really like this piece.  Even if it weren't a gift it's one I'd probably pick up at some point just because of that face and the double balance-wheel open heart design looking so different."
3.0,"I love this case, but it makes my phone over heat!"
3.0,I couldn't tell the difference with them on or off.
3.0,"The bathing suit fits as expected for a medium sized women. Great fabric against the body, quick dry when sitting in the sun and the pattern is very complimentary for any sized body."
3.0,I wear a size 14w. I ordered dress in XL(12-14) I love the way dress fit BUT this dress is VERY thin and see through.I was expecting this dress to be in T-shirt material but instead it's a thin spandex material.
3.0,Daughter ordered this in a 3xl. She wanted it to be slightly baggy since everything she wears is 2x. The jacket was way smaller than the fitting chart shows. The 3xl fits somewhere between a large and XL
3.0,Very thin... it is basically a long sleeve t-shirt with a hood.
3.0,"I usually wear between a 4 and a 6, so I bought this pair of pants in my own size (US4/6). The reviews I've seen have either stated that they fit as expected or a bit too large, so figured I would be fine. Well they wouldn't even button. So I returned that pair and bought a pair that was size 6-8, received it today and well...still too small! It says a size 32, but my waist is 29 so I'm not sure how it can truly be 32. These feel like they'll rip at any moment when I have them on!<br />I need a new pair of cargo pants for work and these would be perfect if they weren't so horrific at sizing. No idea what I'll do now. I'm worried if I go up another size it will still be snug, since the differences in size were minimal between 4/6 and 6/8. Saying I'm disappointed is an understatement"
3.0,Received the order earlier then I had thought it would come in! It doesn't feel bad all and will work as a perfect present and I m not disappointed at all.
3.0,"Loved the top, but tight across the chest and shoulders.  So disappointed, because it is so pretty!"
3.0,Size chart is not right as the size I selected was too big
3.0,They only go mid calf on me....
3.0,Perfect sewing and nice color but size is not correct.<br />I ordered large but size tab shows XXL. I returned it.
3.0,ok for the cost
3.0,They become painful to wear after a couple of hours.
3.0,"I love the way these look, but they don't stay in the ear very well. Seems to be a balancing issue since they are always sliding forward and eventually falling out. One of them even shattered on me after it fell out of my ear. I'll be replacing it with a different product."
3.0,"Made with very thin material, made cheap but fits awesome."
3.0,"Size up! These leggings are super compressive and hard to get on if you don't size up. The scrunch is unflattering from the the thickness of the seam. No matter how you adjust it, the seam sticks out and looks super unflattering. The waistband is thick and high waisted. Overall not a great pair of leggings."
3.0,These stink horribly! Not like leather but musty/moldy smelling. I bought them to use on customers custom pendants and I am unable to use them.
3.0,"it's okay, chain looks kinda cheap, but it's cute"
3.0,Great concept and graphics just to small for an adult
3.0,was a little too short but i am tall so..
3.0,"This is a great little slip, very pretty. The fabric, lace and the straps are of good quality. However, one of the plastic rings on the back of the strap snapped the first timeI it was worn.  I can repair it but I shouldn't have to. Very disappointing."
3.0,Very cute but cheaply made. Fit a bit smaller than other clothes the same size.
3.0,Too long. Deciding whether or not to return it.  At my waist it is on the ground and above my waste is too tight to look good.
3.0,"These masks are very cheaply made...but of course they don't cost much.  Very comfortable once you get it on, but the first 2 I tried, the ribbon came off immediately.  That's why I give it a 3 star overall rating.  However for a one time use and as long as you are very careful in putting it on.....it worked gerat."
3.0,Seems to run super small (short). I returned and went to Target. Nice looking though and looked durable.
3.0,Cute dress but would not buy again  . Runs super small and it is much different in person than in the picture.
3.0,Not for women with hips
3.0,"Be advised you can not take these to your optometrist to have your prescription placed in them.  Also if you have oily skin on forehead, can cause breakouts.  I had to adjust them so they wouldn't touch my forehead.  I had to wipe them down a couple of times due to smudging and fogging.  But I received a lot of compliments wearing them and is good sun protection or if you need to be incognito."
3.0,look good and comfortable
3.0,Clips on is not comfortable
3.0,Not as soft as I had hoped. Quality is a bit cheap.
3.0,"Its a ring from China. Probably the same ones out of the coin machines when I was a kid. My son saw this and wanted to get it for Mom for Christmas so after trying to talk him out of it I ordered it knowing what it was. Hopefully no one looking at this item thinks it's anything but inexpensive. Oh and you're not going to get it in a hurry, it literally comes from outside the country."
3.0,"Probably 2 out of the seven were fake. I gave most of them away to very good friends after charging them up with positive energy. They really liked them, I really like them too! Rose & red quartz were the ones I thought were fake. All other ones were real, really likes the opalite & blue gold stone! But for some being fake I'll have to take some stars off :)"
3.0,Comfortable fit. And cleans easily. Sadly it only lasted 4 months until the plastic broke….
3.0,"I ordered 2 pairs for nieces.  They cam in plastic, not the charming milk carton shown.  They are wide.  But the girls LOVED them."
3.0,"I like the glasses, but one of the lenses fell out."
3.0,Nice Hat.Protects well
3.0,"The style isn't quite as pictured. It fits like a regular tshirt. The zipper bunches up in the back, instead of laying smooth like it shows in the picture. I also overlooked when ordering that it ships from China, so plan for a very long wait. It's an adequate shirt, just not the style I was anticipating."
3.0,"These sweatpants are really soft, but no matter what the drawstring just wants to come out. I've tried tying knots in the strings to not move but to no avail, they drawstring always gets stuck into the sweatpants and tries to come out."
3.0,they are way to small
3.0,if you are the shape of the model then this dress will be ace on you. If you have a tummy or not much hips STAY FAR. The dress is think and stretchy and white when it stretches and the nice colour doesnt really stay like that once its on. It goes in every imperfection and fold so if you are not perfectly shaped DONT BOTHER.
3.0,"the pants look good only tucked in, don't even try to wear it untucked because then it just looks shapeless. The fabric itself is basically like chiffon, which if you're particular about the feel of the fabric you're wearing is no good as for me I hate the feel of chiffon. Also, because its chiffon it looks somewhat cheap especially if untucked, and especially because the shirt runs large. I wore it tucked in with black business pants and it looked pretty good but because of how harsh the fabric feels and the fact that there are so many clothes out there that are a decent price I don't feel inclined to compromise and buy a shirt like this again in the future, even for this price its just not worth it. But because it does serve its purpose aesthetically at least i give it 3 stars."
3.0,"The LED lights stopped working after about a week, but my son stills like them since they are very comfortable for him."
3.0,"I bought these to replace an amazing pair of earrings I wore nearly everyday for 15 years. I was pretty upset when I lost one and was just looking for a similar pair to get me by until I found a solid replacement. I wasn’t ready to fork over hundreds of dollars for the same quality (they were white gold with a single diamond on the front - very simple and classy and perfect for everyday wear), but I’m sure you can imagine how weird it was for me not to have earrings on after all those years. These fit the bill: same overall style and size, just different materials.<br /><br />I have a tendency to play with the clasp (bad habit) and, from my original pair, I knew what a good strong clasp felt like. When these arrived, I was happy with their appearance and size, but putting them on, I could feel how flimsy the clasp was on it. As I mentioned, earrings like this, I wear all day, everyday. I’ve woken up a couple of times without them on, finding them on my pillow or elsewhere in the bed, and it’s happened on a number of occasions where I reached up to “play” with my earring, only to find it already unclamped and hanging loosely from my ear.<br /><br />Bottom line is that these earrings are ok, but not they’re not long term, everyday wear kind of earrings."
3.0,Cute but the writing is very small.
3.0,This is a women's watch - quite small. Gave to my wife.
3.0,Looks good but the top is a little funny. It came kinda wrinkled and distorted. Tried to stream it and reshape it with an iron but had little luck. I got to wear working in the shop so it wasn't that big of a deal
3.0,"It's great if all you want to Cary is phone and cc's and license. I did fit my comb but to bring lipstick or much more not possible,  but works great"
3.0,It was a little tight when wearing but it was perfect fit.
3.0,"these slacks are ok...very nice material and construction, but they are cut a bit snug for me...i thing they should have more room for the larger sizes"
3.0,"I really wanted to love this pair of shoes. The style was what I was looking for and Vionic is a great brand with the arch support I need. However, the arch support in this show was very uncomfortable and almost painful. It felt like a bar going right across the middle of the insole. . I have very high arches, so  was quite surprised.  I ended up returning. The shoe looks great and sturdy, just not a good fit for me."
3.0,Looks cheap no sparkle to it.
3.0,"I am a 38G, 170lbs and am 5'4. This is a very cute dress, but I should have sized up to accommodate my chest. It does not unbutton and there is no stretch to the material. I have been losing weight, 6lbs so far, and intend to keep in hope that I can fit into it before to long. I can actually get it on, but it flattens my boobs so much it looks silly. Otherwise a great dress and a great length. Would look great on a variety of body types."
3.0,"I purchased this key charm for myself. Its very pretty but very small, almost like for a child. Somewhat disappointed."
3.0,Changed colors after a few months but looks nice even after it changed
3.0,"Item was presented much more bright in color than actual, much darker in reality...disappointed somewhat with the beauty in person...."
3.0,I normally wear a M and this was way too small.
3.0,"Biggest problem with these is where you have to position them in order for them to keep your knees warm.  They are very soft, and the &#34;padding&#34; is really plush.  BUT I have to pull them almost to my crotch to get the warming pad over my knees.  Which would be fine if I had small quads, but I don't.  I have big quads plus two metal knees.  Plus I am tall, with a 31 inch inseam (long for a woman), so my legs are long. There is elastic in the top, which at first I thought was good.  I don't use these for workouts, I use them around the house.  With metal knees, cold is really cold.  So I crawled into bed with my new warmers on, it was 22 degrees outside.  I woke up with swollen feet and ankles.  The elastic had been just enough to impede circulation.<br /><br />I cut the elastic out and now fold them down several times in order to have them in the correct location.  But I still have to reposition them so the warming pad is in the correct place.  Total pain.  And the weave is such that the rest of the leg isn't quite as warm as where the pads are.  Am waiting for my favorite ones to come back in stock. Until then am making do, but won't buy these again."
3.0,"if you know what I know you will look twice at the compass. But other than the small defect, it does look nice."
3.0,This is soft and cozy but was expecting it to be bigger. I bought a coupke of sizes up to be oversized and it fits like a normal sweatshirt. I still like it but not what I was imagining
3.0,Cute shoes but too narrow.<br />I tried my normal shoe size and it didn’t fit. I ordered a 1/2 size bigger and it was still too narrow and made my feet look huge (like a clown)<br />Returned!
3.0,zipper broke -_-
3.0,Very well made.  Larger than I thought - great.  Smooth delivery.
3.0,It looks nice never got around to actually using it for the simple fact that it's made for a fat wrist so you'll need to take links out to fit your own.
3.0,"I do love these, I just wish they where I more colors. Mine came almost all the same color"
3.0,Too small for size stated.
3.0,"Although the measurements of the skirt are accurate, the style was not right for me. Too flowy and long for me on the bottom and too tight at waist. If I had gone up in a size, then it would have been really extra flowy. This one was a return."
3.0,Wrong style for my body
3.0,Love the earrings but they are a little smaller than I expected.
3.0,"I could never get them to fit right. Luckily,  I only needed them for a one night party."
3.0,The dress was supposed to be an XL but turned out to be more of a medium.  Crosses around my waist but not around my bust.
3.0,it was good in the beginning but the clip broke in 5 monthsthat closes the wallet
3.0,They are cute but too small..
3.0,"It's very cheap, but I only paid a few dollars and no shipping so it's what I expected. Its very cute and looks like the picture. The clamp on the back hurts after awhile so I can only wear it for a few hours. The clamp is adjustable but I'm afraid it will break if you arent careful. I ordered it in silver but I got gold, not a huge deal. It arrived a week and a half early!"
3.0,The straps are flimsy.  Doesnt hold me well
3.0,It's a good bag the pouch that came with it ripped after about a month of use I heard the same on reviews before purchasing
3.0,"Dress material was fine,but I choose the xxl size and it couldn't even be zip.....it fits really small if your not a small or medium size person"
3.0,"Cool style and nice fabric, but not made well. Seams above the side zipper and under the arm started tearing just from trying it on the first time. I was so disappointed because the style is very unique and feminine. The gathering on the bodice portion is very flattering to the waist and tummy."
3.0,"Pretty color, soft material. A little more flimsy than it appeared in the picture. Was cropped very short; ended up getting to my seven-year-old."
3.0,Microscopic size. Pretty but hard to see.  I would not order again
3.0,Cheaply made but works fine
3.0,Really cute but do not dry in the dryer !!! I wore it once and washed it and now it’s way to short
3.0,The fit is small. I usually wear a 9.5-10 on my middle finger so I ordered a 10. It doesn’t fit my middle finger but it fits my ring finger that is usually a 8.5-9
3.0,"It's too small, but very durable"
3.0,"Cute hat. Way too big, returned."
3.0,"Stupid questions. This is a jar of grease, not a pair of boots."
3.0,"For a while the bag worked really well, it was a perfect size for what I needed.<br /><br />However, 3 stars because the inner lining ripped on a zipper so I had loose change and everything between the outer cover and inner lining I had to fish out.<br /><br />Plus there was a HORRIBLE fishy smell that I could not get rid of. I tried dryer sheets, spray, letting it air out, air freshener, everything. Didn't fix a thing. I wish I could buy it again, but I'm afraid I'll receive another flimsy dud."
3.0,The leather is a little shiny and looks like plastic.  But you get what you pay for.  It is roomy and holds all the required items.  My son is happy with it.
3.0,didnt really fit my 116710 GMT master II
3.0,"These are ok. I was surprised to get both the gold and silver pair. I thought I was only getting silver. However, these seem to be a slightly larger gauge than standard earrings. It took a bit to get them pushed through my ears but they did fit. They are also a little less huggy than I had hoped, but I also have very small lobes and low piercings. Over all I will still be wearing them and like the look! Just gotta wait for my ear holes to adjust!"
3.0,"These are good for splash pad / pool area for quick use . However , they aren’t meant for lots of running and playing by rocks , roads , etc and can easily get worn out and your kid will fall in them if they use them like tennis shoes. They have their place but they don’t belong on playground or when your kids are running in the yard they are not supportive enough ."
3.0,Its bigger than most but the blue fabric shed off the zig zag part all over the place.
3.0,"The size of the pants was just as expected, however, the legs were baggy. We returned these because of that. We were expecting the legs to fit like straight leg jeans and they fit more like cargo pants legs."
3.0,Runs WAY too small! I ordered two sizes up and the arms are super tight. Too annoyed to ship it back.
3.0,"Very showy, in that you can see the pockets thro the pants and any underwear. Returned."
3.0,"I picked this out as a gift for my daughters' birthday,it is a lovely piece with style and craftsmanship,only much smaller than I pictured it being."
3.0,Ok bag...makeup does not stay organized or in the pockets.
3.0,"The ad states that the watch and band measure 9.8&#34; and the band itself is stated to be 8.66&#34;:  It isn't.  Having a 7.6&#34; wrist size the watch should be loose on me.  I was barely able to close the clasp.  So don't go by the ad dimensions, this is a ladies size watchband.  The watch is attractive and appears well made but the dimensions stated in the ad are way off.  Returning it to Amazon and probably giving up on getting a wooden watch that fits."
3.0,"Not what I wanted, not as expected. Something is just not flattering."
3.0,Good plastic holder scratch up easily
3.0,It would have been better if it were the rose gold and not the regular gold. But I do still like it and considering it is just my commitment ring I decided to keep it.
3.0,"I ordered a large – typically a sm-med, 5'10"" 130lbs – because sometimes these yoga sets are so damn tight! The shorts fit well but the top didn't fit well at all (had gapping everywhere). Not sure if it's a quality issue or just because the fit is a bit large on the top.<br /><br />I also HATE the butt-scrunching trend! If I had noticed that I wouldn't have ordered it."
3.0,"The umbrella isn't waterproof, I am disappointed.  All our other umbrellas have been."
3.0,"Love the shirt, it was roomy with a bit of flow at the bottom. The pants that came with this set were way too tight, not even to be considered leggings. More like tights. So, we paired the shirt with another pair of pants. Definitely DO NOT purchase this if the pants included need to be part of the outfit."
3.0,"I read here that they run large. They do not. I ordered small and had to return them, they were too short. I would probably take a medium or even large. I am 5'9 with 33 waist.<br /><br />Also, the ones I received were not 100% cotton as the description says. It was a cotton / polyester blend. Still comfy though.."
3.0,"it shed white fuzzies all over, it was okay for a one time use."
3.0,"These run small and the stitching at the thumb was stressed, but they are cute.  I'll have to give mine away and I have average size hands."
3.0,Cool design. Thought they would be a little longer and softer.
3.0,Jacket fit perfect. Leggings are something you may get from wish.. baggy in the front and really thin
3.0,"Looks just as pictured, and it DOES has the 8 ""ribs"" they advertise, but it flipped inside out on the first day. So far the frame has held up (I've had it about 2 weeks and only use it for LA sunny days) but it flips inside out at the slightest breeze, which is plenty annoying when I'm carrying things with my other hand and can't stop every few feet to flip it back over again. Pro is that it is VERY compact and the coverage is large enough to block the sun."
3.0,"These are so pretty, but you've really got to have the confidence to pull them off!  Also they are not very dark at all- I didn't really feel like they blocked very much sunlight at all, kind of mostly for looks!"
3.0,"These are dress slacks material. I wanted more of a denim material. I'm almost 5'5"" and these were too long."
3.0,"Love the design, and the material of the shirt, but after a few washes the image faded and the neck got wrinkly and stretched out."
3.0,"Good, not great. The waist band to waist band seam in the back is also the junction of the waist band to shorts seam. Result is 4X material thickness at these seams in this one location which is right over my sacrum. Not comfortable, digs in when laying on my back, especially when pressuring my sacrum with leg lifts. The shorts fit great, but the inner mesh support is tight for me. Maybe I a have a big a**; but hopefully my excess size is in the front. Shorts material is great and super flexible. Needs a pocket."
3.0,The color it’s pretty. Same yellow as you see in the website.  But runs huge and the material will need ironing if you want to look nice.  It’s a return
3.0,"Beautiful product, Pockets needs to be reinforced as the threats pull apart from my 12 yr old keeping his hands in the pocket all day"
3.0,"It was okay.<br />I'm about 250 pounds with a bust of 49 inches<br />I ordered the xl. It fits fine.<br />It doesn't bind my chest as well as I hoped. I'm a big guy so I knew I'd have a little bit of a chest to go with my tum but I was hoping it would be more, as I still think it looks like I have boobs. I'm a trans guy so I was hoping it would help with dysphoria but it doesn't bind as well as I hoped.  This being said it is not painful or restricting, and it doesn't get too hot. Overall it's an okay product but to be honest I wouldn't buy it again or even recommend it. If you are going to buy a binder I think you should save up and get a nicer one. This just doesn't cut it for me and I'll be purchasing something else as soon as I get paid."
3.0,"Okay, not what I expected"
3.0,"This hoodie is great, but for some reason, mine did not include the tie string (for around the neck). Manufacturing issue?"
3.0,I purchased a few different pairs of  sandals for my vacation next month. I've tried wearing them all and I don't think it will work. But I'm going to try and bring my gym shoes Justi in case<br /><br />N
3.0,Only received 3 pairs...🤔
3.0,"I really liked these pants, but I had to return them, because they were just the wrong shape for my figure. Very tight on the upper thighs, which then made the fabric above sort of billow around the bottom of the waist. Prevented them from having that nice long, heavy, flowy hang that I was looking for."
3.0,This dress is super cute. Form fitting but professional looking. Sizing chart seems true to size. Fabric quality could be a little higher but its a good value buy. And is really cute on.
3.0,I absolutely love the way these earring look when they aren't  in my ears.  The part of the earring that goes through the ear is very wide and it hurts.  If your earring holes are stretched out then these earrings will be great for you.  I just can't wear them without pain unfortunately.
3.0,"This is sized for men but the zipper is on the wrong side...it is for women. The actual look of the item could be used for either gender but women should go a size down as this is sized for men but the zipper indicates it is for a woman. White with highlights and safety tape, ventilation holes and actually a nicely made wind-breaker. Unfortunately this was far too large for the wife and the annoying zipper means constant irritation for men...still a nice windbreaker for those willing to work with the sizing."
3.0,I bought this nightgown in the same size two years ago. That one is much better. This one that I just bought is a few inches shorter in hem length and 1- 2 inches shorter in sleeve length. It is too short and therefore a bit cold and less comfortable. I wanted the same sizing I got two years ago.
3.0,I bought a pair similar to these in Hawaii and lost them. I loved them! They were thin and light. I ordered these thinking I could replace them and I was wrong. These are big and thick and clunky. Guess I have to go back to Hawaii!!
3.0,"Great looking shirt, nice fabric, but too large.<br />Arms and body too long, as well."
3.0,Rose broke off after three days on the bracelet. The charm still looks wonderful with just the mask yhough
3.0,The Cain is not the greatest.
3.0,I ve al ready have one and i lo de it
3.0,the frame color.....just made them look to cheap....the style was nice and the lenses where perfect... but they just looked like toy Glasses... the color would be real popular with kids i'm sure.... its OK if the are a good price point...lets face it that is what made me go ahead with the purchase... So the fact is they are relatively inexpensive...but they didn't have to look like it....  the color was just to much like Dollar Tree....just say'n.... if i had it to do again i think i would have been happier with  different color choice....but i'll not waste another 20+ bucks to find out....
3.0,"No idea, was a gift."
3.0,Looks nice in person but arrived with hem out. Had to return.
3.0,"Color was different from the picture, more brown than red."
3.0,Quality is good but sizing was off
3.0,"This shirt is great for summer. The fabric is thin while not being see-through. I do not have to wear a layer underneath unless I chose to. Downside- it's VERY short! It sits at your natural waist and if you purchase your normal size, like I did, and raise an arm above your head, folks will see your tummy. It's loose fitting so if I purchased it again, I would go up a size."
3.0,The bracelet itself is nice but the tying mechanism is not optimum. It comes loose and you can’t really tie it in a knot. You could glue it but then you would have to cut it off to take it off.
3.0,I wouldn't buy these again for this price. I clicked purchase before really checking into the product. They are very thin. I was hoping for more of a sock like feel and these are more like a hose feel.
3.0,"I'm a female who needs these for work. I ordered a large since I wanted a little room. These, once washed, fit very snugly. So, definitely order a size up if you want them to be a little more forgiving. The pockets also ripped from me trying to stretch them out a bit after drying. Color has remained very vibrant though."
3.0,I bought it a size bigger than I wear and it’s huge but to late to get correct size
3.0,"I’m 5’7, 34B, and about a size 6 in women’s and orded a medium. I really wanted to keep this dress! The colors were bright, and the cut and length were perfect but the top area was just too big for my bust. I tried safety pining, tying the straps tighter, and contemplated sewing in the sides but didnt wanna ruin it. If you’re bustier, it’ll fit great!"
3.0,It's a very cute outfit I got a 3T but it fits like a 2 t
3.0,"The design of this swimsuit is very cute. I ordered a size up from what I normally would (ordered an XL) I have an athletic build of 150 lbs., 34DD. I would not feel safe wearing this suit in public. It fit everywhere in the waste and bottom, but was made very strange.  It is not as high cut as pictured. The neck line came below my collar bones and the non-mesh part way below where it should. I'm giving this 3 stars because it is very cute, and if my breasts were  considerably smaller, it would have been a winner."
3.0,"This is my third purchase of ScotteVest Travel vest.  The first and second vests were really good quality and fit me good, and NO tag &#34;Made in China&#34; inside the back of the vests which look classy.<br />However, this particular one is not that good.  It is somewhat small and tight. Texture is not as good as the first and second vests I purchased. And, there is big tag inside the back of the vest .... MADE IN CHINA. I am keeping it because I am too busy to return it back.<br />I trust that my next (fourth) purchase will be in better quality like my first and second vests."
3.0,too small but it's pretty and softer
3.0,The size chart was not exactly accurate. I ordered a size up based off of size chart and the shirt was still too small. Otherwise I have not washed the shirt yet to verify if it is durable.
3.0,Sandal is very wide.
3.0,"If you are a large person who feels like most masks look like a tiny postage stamp on your face, then these masks are for you.  As a woman on the smaller side, this mask envelopes my whole face.  It pokes me in the eye when I wear it, it rides up so high. I initially bought them for my tween son and it's not even close to fitting him.  But if you are a bigger person and are looking for a mask on the large side, these masks are good quality and do not shrink in the wash."
3.0,funky little pom poms around the neck and sleeves. They wouldn't lay flat. I returned it...too bad because it was cute.
3.0,"The martial is listed as leather but only the accents are.  The bag itself is vinyl or something.  Cute bag, lots of pockets arrived folded & the crease has stayed.  Thanks Amazon 😄"
3.0,"Bought these for my husband.  He thought they'd be more like the Russell Athletic Performance socks he used to buy at Costco, but he says they're not as soft or as easy to put on."
3.0,"I'm worried that the beadwork in this braided Ldurian Boho Long Fringe Tassel Necklaces for Women Femme Beaded Long Sweater Necklace Multi-Purpose Bohemian Jewelry Collar may not stand up to the rigors of the weight of swaying tassels.<br />I'm not sure the workmanship, especially in the beads, will contribute to making this a durable and long-lasting accessory."
3.0,I mostly use it to lounge around mornings and evening’s. I like it but one sleeve was just the right length the other one was a full 6 inches longer. I had to roll it up halfway to my elbow. I’m sending it back today and ordering a new one because otherwise I love it.<br />Wine32@icloud.com
3.0,"Very strong odor which still isn't gone almost 2 months after purchase, but they're cute and fit..."
3.0,Good quality but ran large
3.0,"In order for the bottom to fit as it should, you would have to buy a size larger than you normally wear.But the top will be too big.it is of an excellent quality."
3.0,"too small, too thin"
3.0,"Definitely need to have a large bust for this to fit correctly, but dress is cute and fits as expected otherwise."
3.0,The S/M size was just a bit too tight so I had to order the large size. This was too large so I had to remove links.  I read the instructions and also watched a YouTube tutorial. Still no luck.  Took it to a local jewler and he wanted no part of it.  Its sitting in a ziplock bag with random pieces out as I missed the return window.  This is actually a really nice band and looks great on an apple watch.  Its just way to hard to adjust the size.
3.0,"I have several different HW glasses at this point, all lazer face these are by far the smallest on my big ass head. Not sure what happened"
3.0,These are too wide and somewhat short
3.0,Maybe I liked it more in the pictures and reviews on others but not as much on me. I am 5'2&#34; and usually wear a small-medium. I wish I ordered a small.
3.0,Very snug fit. Not as expected in size and the color is not as vibrant
3.0,"I’m not sure how they managed to fit all 12 pairs into that little box...I’m impressed. Variety of colors that go with any outfit. Only downfall so far is that one pair arrived scratched, a few others appear bent. Not worth the hassle of returning/exchanging. Hopefully they’ll last a while, I love the style."
3.0,"I got this as my current raincoat is a little old and ratty. Unfortunately, this is more of an emergency raincoat/ casual option. Still, it works as something in a car in a pinch. Just keep that in mind."
3.0,I normally wear size L. I ordered L size. it's cute and very comfy dress but it's little too  bigger than I expected.
3.0,They're great but I got them at the size I am and they came in too small
3.0,The rose in the center is off center and took quite a while to get here.  But I'll just have fix that and it should be good.
3.0,"After a while (4 or so years) of winding up these watches, the main tension gear’s teeth grind down because the metal is soft. This makes winding the watch impossible and rendering it useless. With that being said, I get countless complements and these watches are fairly cheap. So I keep buying them.<br /><br />Side note: I recommend buying a different band for the watch as the tortoiseshell pattered “leather” is absolutely terrible."
3.0,Did not fit right despite sizing per their charts.
3.0,way too small actually - gave them to a granddaughter (A little granddaughter).
3.0,"I had high hopes for these, the fit was right but the knees bagged out just from trying them on, I returned them. Just to expensive to walk around with baggy knees."
3.0,"This may work for other folks, but it's too small for my hubby to use as a gym bag as he'd hoped. He takes, gym shoes, gym clothes, clean socks and undies, shower shoes, toiletries, shower towel, towel for wiping down gym equipment and a water bottle. He comes home with the same stuff, plus his wet/dirty clothes and towels. All normal gym stuff without any extras. This bag is not large enough. It's well made with several nice pockets, and might work well for others."
3.0,"Very pretty, but difficult to clasp."
3.0,"I was hoping that I could wear these pants without wearing leggings underneath but they are see-through. So, I wear leggings underneath, which isn't bad cause it makes it a bit warmer. But for the summer I might just wear spanx underneath and hopefully no one will notice the lines through the pants."
3.0,Just a bit snug but I'm wearing them to work out in not to wear out hanging out with friends so being snug is ok
3.0,Runs very small and tight on arms....and I'm skinny
3.0,"I asked for verification ahead of time as to how many bands were included.  I was told 7, but received 5.  I like the rose colored one the best.  They are a little stiff but I like the color."
3.0,"These are very cute, but lacking quality for everyday wear. Didn't last long for my teens."
3.0,"nice looking belt, but be careful, clasp can open up"
3.0,I'm not sure if each product is built the same as mine but these are a very nice sized product but my clicker (clamps) have a very hard time opening and closing.
3.0,This is a beautiful dress! Unfortunately it was too small and had to be returned. Seller was very helpful with the return and refund.
3.0,Very sparkly and pretty but the diamond pair got warped after a few weeks and they stopped closing properly.
3.0,the clips are fiddley and one broke after about 4 uses. they are a bit ackward. the product looks great and is spot on for cos -play
3.0,They are pretty but much bigger than they look. I had to give them away.
3.0,"This review is for  BAGVIO Compression Packing Cubes for Travel - Premium Luggage Organizer Set (Set of 2). In theory these cubes seem like they would be great for travel. I can see myself using these when I can travel again. The construction of them is decent and the zippers seem pretty heavy duty and not cheap. I can see these lasting a while. What I will say is the description does not say what the sizes are except for one small and one large. The small one measures 11' x 6.5"" and the large one measures 14"" x 9"". Both have a 1"" depth that can be expanded to 4"". Overall I think both of these are small if you are going on a trip. If you have a short weekend away and only using a carry-on then these would be find for that (or even for use in a backpack). I wish the set came with 4 and had a better range of sizes. Most sets of packing cubes come with 4 or more which I think would be a better option. There is no price listed so I don't know how good of a value they are either. If you are a solo traveler with short trips, then these may be a good option for you. If you travel with others and go for longer trips than just just a weekend, then I think there are better sets out there."
3.0,CHEAP & Mass Produced. Another COMPANY  Of SENDING The US HARD WORKED DOLLAR TO CHINA TO SUPPORT AGGRESSION  AGAINST US PUBLIC & KEEPING US LABOR OUT OF WORK.
3.0,"It doesn't have a hand made, delicateness to it.  It looks mass produced.  It's okay for the price."
3.0,I would definitely size up. These are very snug on the waist and sort of ride up in the front. Kind of an odd fit. Would probably have been ok in a larger size.
3.0,"It's not too thick, which is good for me, but the material is rather stiff. The waistband is particularly wide and stiff as well, which is not the most comfortable/cozy.<br /><br />Another reviewer said this could be dressed up, but it fits pretty sloppy on me and the brand name is intentionally put in glaring white letters, so, not feeling that option!"
3.0,It is somewhat small. I am 5foot 2 and about 140lbs and this fell about 2 inches from my knees. I ordered a large because I'm busty and usually that's where I have fit problems. The top was fine and I will prob wear this to the beach or resort or something. I will have to be mindful of when I sit or wear with short shorts or leggings with it. Overall it's a cute dress and I'm sure I can do a lot with it.
3.0,"Got this for my husband. He liked the fabric quality, but the belt placement and pockets were weirdly spaced and he didn't think he'd like using it for that reason. Will be returning."
3.0,Smaller than expected. Looks more child like. I'll be giving it to a grand daughter or niece
3.0,"heavy duty built bag, says water resistant the has these 2 holes on the bottom, palm to forehead"
3.0,Also made from a silky fabric (polyester?) not a more breathable cotton blend that I expected...not a big fan!
3.0,"Beware of shrinking sleeves. I ordered a medium in pink and washed it on cold and the sleeves are now just past my elbows. It’s more of a 3/4 length sleeve now. It still looks okay but I wish I would have saved my money on this one. It’s polyester and spandex so it’s pretty stiff material too, not as cozy as expected."
3.0,"i have posted three stars as some of the ruby stones have broken edges, I don't know if it was damaged while shipping or its a damaged product from start."
3.0,Slipper socks were stiff and the lining was not soft as I had hoped. Returning them.
3.0,"this is a nice dainty necklace, cushion cut peridot pendant looks very nice as well.<br /><br />my issue is the chain. it is a very short chain -- it barely touches my collar bone -- it sits just at the base of my neck -- it's not best look for me because i am not skinny, i don't have a long neck. this would be a great length for a little girl, but too short for grown-ups.<br /><br />i like the chain -- it is super dainty, BUT IT IS NOT the chain in the product display photo. it is far from it. the yellowness looks fake-ish. almost too yellow. i don't like the tone of it, it screams fake, especially if you wear it with other real yellow gold jewelry, it will stand out as fake."
3.0,"The cards are very cute, I took 2 stars out because 6 of the cards are cut from the left side they're useless , luckily the other pack is in perfect condition."
3.0,I have purchased these before and they are as expected. I like the clear bright vision  that they offer. I would have liked a choice of frames but can’t expect much at this price
3.0,it felt sticky
3.0,"Awesome sweatshirt, great fit and color… it smells like motor oil or something. I don’t know what it is, but it is strong to me, I have a very sensitive nose. I have washed it several times, and while it washed really well (inside out) smell has not gone away."
3.0,It was a gift. Not sure if she liked it.
3.0,The color is cool but these are made to be hip huggers. Sort of the type that you'd wear when you want to show your thong.  Or if you have a slight muffin top it will show. Order next size up if you're thicker in the hips. The legs are flattering though.
3.0,These earrings are really pretty but of course are missing stones. Not 1 but 4! I’m not going to bother sending them back but I am really bummed.  Not sure how they made it thru quality control.
3.0,I'm so disappointed in this purchase. I thought it would look cute with leggings but it's so big and also has the bat wing arms that just add to the overall frump look. (And I normally love my shirts loose and long). The fabric also feels as if it has some filmy coating on it... similar to kids' fire retardant pajamas).
3.0,I fits perfectly but the pants leg is way to short but it's cute with a lil cuff I guess
3.0,doesn't fit for the size ordered.
3.0,"much bigger than i thought, they are beautiful just wish dont so big"
3.0,"I have to admit, this dress is really cute but I don't really like the crinoline/tulle underneath because it makes the dress look a little poofy."
3.0,"It's not floppy like on the girls in the picture... I thought maybe I just have a big head and had my smaller roommate try it, same fit on her. I still like it but was wanting something that was floppier."
3.0,I find this belt to resemble plastic or tire material versus leather. No way my husband wants to wear this. Not his look.
3.0,I wanted to like these but they were just too small.
3.0,It’s way tiny.
3.0,The socks have come in raveled/unsewn at the top seam after the first wash. They fit comfortably on the foot but too tight at the top of the calf.
3.0,"Very pretty, holds hair ties well, but seems to be made for a very large wrist and is not bendable to adjust."
3.0,I needed two sizes less than mine because I'm immense
3.0,Didn't appreciate how thick it was..doesnt give off thag preferred  look and feel..
3.0,"Overall the outfit is passable. The shirt was short but the pants were long. The wording faded a bit after I washed it. The material was soft which is ideal for my son who has sensitive skin. It was only 2 piece for the ‘big boy’ outfit, there was no hat included."
3.0,The jacket arrived and was not the same color as pictured.  I ordered it because of it's mostly grey base but what showed up was almost a black base.  It is still soft and stylish but under the arms the fabric is bunched too thickly and almost uncomfortable.  Mine was true to size even after the first wash.
3.0,Nice.  Thank you.
3.0,"Love the cardigan, but ordered a large. I am typically a medium. The large fit as a small. I will be gifting it to someone else."
3.0,Rhis works best for ankle boots.
3.0,"I purchased a S knowing that it would probably be a little tight in the chest. What I didn't expect was the strange length. I am 5'1 and it hit me right between the knee and ankle. I wear a 34 C bra and the dress was snug but not too tight. The dress could probably be altered but I decided to return. The color is beautiful, the fabric was thick and good quality- just wish the length was not soo long."
3.0,Fits ok a bit to small
3.0,"It's a really cute hat, and at first it fit, but after a couple uses and no washes it stretched out and is now too loose to wear."
3.0,The material used for the chain makes the jewelry appear very cheap.. Not what I was expecting. The gold one looks better than the silver. The silver appears tarnished.
3.0,Super cute but I can't get the dress to stay on my shoulders like the picture shows the eleastic makes it ride up to my neck every time i move the material is definitely different then expected.
3.0,We received the tank tops in a timely manner but they are not like the ones in the picture. The cut of the shirt was different but the length was good. I bought these for my husband and he is 6'2&#34; so he definitely needs the length and the stretch that these provide. He still wears them so I'm guessing no other complaints. They held up very well in the wash and dry enough that the elasticity and length stayed the same.
3.0,Nice bracelet.Unfortunately the two ends are open and so it changes shape every time you wear it.
3.0,I ordered the teal one a few weeks ago and then this one because I loved it so much and it is. It the same shirt. Different fit and looks baggy on.
3.0,"Top was big, bottoms were a good fit for my 5yo"
3.0,"I like the concept and size of the bag For a small purse, it’s especially nice when caring a regular style purse is not conducive to the activity. This has two separate pockets that are easily accessible and the bag fits everything a small purse would. Problem is, the straps on the back are far from workable!! These “streamers” are way too distracting and keep me from loving the bag..<br /><br />What am I talking about or referring too..???<br />Issue: these adjustable Straps obviously have to have excess length to accommodate the different size users- But, these hang beyond too long once you adjust the length to an appropriate and proper shoulder length and I’m referring to the adjustments to fit an adult- on a small child, this issue would be worse!.. it’s like two long “tails” hanging down off each shoulder! Conundrum: when it arrives- each strap has been nicely sewn and finished so, they won’t fray or, run. Yet, if you were to cut off the excess strap .. and by excess, after an adult 5’7” adjusts the backpack to fit loosely on her shoulders- there are approx. 10” of excess strap on each side hanging down ... if I cut these, the ends will unravel- most likely causing more of an unsavory look to the bag.<br /><br />The material feels durable and the construction in other places seems quite adequate… Zipper is easily open/closed- and has small flap to cover keeping it from getting snagged. It just seems very basic no-frills straightforward I’m not disappointed in the bag itself.. just not really wowed either! And the straps Would deter me from future purchase."
3.0,"Bought this in hopes of fitting my but based on the size chart online I purchase a 12 and it didn't fit me, I'm size S/6 on bottoms and a size M/8 on top...I will try again after I've lost a few pounds.  I guess I expected to look like the model but that's a different issue..."
3.0,This product came with the wristlet attachment frayed.  I couldn't sew it together because of where it had come apart.  I cut the pieces of and will use it as long as I can.  The wallet itself was in tact so im overall happy with my purchase.
3.0,He loved it no complaints
3.0,Some come without a pair (like the split heart ones). I got a lot of emoji ones... which I will probably never use. Some have other language on them. But most of the rest were good. Make decent charms.
3.0,Dress fits nice. Not sure if it will hold up till next year. But it’s cute. Came with these mitten or foot things. Not sure what they are for.
3.0,These are just fine as regular summer tee shirts but NOT specifically sports related. I was much happier with the same patterned tees made by Amazon Essentials for only a few dollars more. Don’t market these as running shirts! They are just thin tees.
3.0,Nice top the only downfall is that the material smells funny. I washed it and the smell is still there
3.0,"Shipping was fast they arrived before the expected date. The rings look cheap though but l like them as they are not bad for the price, it fitting and looking good in my fingers.  I polished them with transparent nail polish and gonna see how long it gonna stay before tarnished. But l am disappointed as One of the small rings broken after wearing it one time:("
3.0,Couldn't really evaluate the item as it was too small to put on. It was a large so....
3.0,"the product is a good disposable mask.  It took weeks to ship, and when I finally received I got butterflies, not dragonflys."
3.0,"I love the style and fabric of this dress. It was, however, too short and the pockets hit me at the wrong place."
3.0,"I ordered my usual size (M) and the waistband is so tiny! It's elastic, so of course it's stretchy, but it squeezes me in an unflattering way. I have a pretty dang average body, and this is just an odd fit. Don't recommend. There's gotta better booty shorts out there. 3 stars because the fabric is super duper soft."
3.0,A few of the bracelets came discolored with rust-like/tarnishing spots. Was not able to use 6/24 bracelets
3.0,"Way too small, doesn't hold stickiness and I just didnt like it.<br /><br />Update: I was contacted by customer service and they were extremely nice and sent me a size bigger in the other material. However, its still small and I got a DD size and it still does not cover enough. For those with larger or heavier boobs, these are not that practical and wont hold up. Although its sticky, it doesn't long and the ends don't really stick at all. I washed and dried before applying to ensure a better stick, but they just didnt work for my breasts. I think think these would work great for those with smaller sized and less heavier busts. Due to their excellent customer service, I am giving them 3 stars instead of my original two."
3.0,"The necklace itself was great, the chain broke within a week of wearing it... not very tuff in my opinion."
3.0,"Really cheap construction, but ok for what you pay. I don't like the buckle closure; it would be better with nothing at all."
3.0,The colors are awesome. But the shoes aren't comfortable like Brooks are known to be.
3.0,It is good to have a mask that exemplifies my personality
3.0,Kinda thin but I would have kept it if it didn't have a slight defect in the stitching around the bottom
3.0,"These boots run big . If you wear a 7, you better get the 6 1/2"
3.0,I really did not like these earrings. They were just a little too big.
3.0,A little snug around the waist.
3.0,Super cheap but quality is cheap too.  Pockets can’t hold much
3.0,"I like this dress and plan on wearing it more. However, its a litte snug around the waist."
3.0,"It is too short to be a dress, so i guess you could wear it with leggins..."
3.0,It was really cute but even though I ordered bigger than my size it was still too small. I guess I should've gone two sizes bigger. So I'm really sad I can't wear it. I got a small and in comparison to American clothes think of it as the same size as a 14-16 in kids clothes.
3.0,"I need eyeglass holder straps, but so far I haven't found one that's comfortable. The little ball-type device used to adjust the strap length on these holders is just too big. I live in SE Tennessee and I wear t-shirts most of the year. I can't have this large black plastic ball sitting or hanging on the back of my neck! My hair is not quite shoulder length,  it's not long enough to cover the eyeglass holders. The eyeglass holder strap also gets caught in my hair. I get in my car and begin to drive and turn my head to check traffic--but my head won't turn because the eyeglass strap doesn't glide over the skin, it catches in the ends of my hair and  I can't turn my head without pulling my hair or pulling one side of my glasses down. The price is good, but it's not a good value if I can't use them."
3.0,Is very nice love the look!!!!!! But brakes easy
3.0,"Way too small, I usually wear XL in the sweatshirt, If that's the size of an XL than an XXL will not fit either. I like my sweatshirts roomy."
3.0,Not well made. Patch is photo copied
3.0,The price & the leather is reasonable but not superior. I like the design & quality of the buckle .
3.0,I like the style of the shirt but it’s just a little to short. Other than that good soft material!
3.0,"WXXM Women's Fashion Non Skid Low Cut Grip Yoga Socks 3 Pairs<br /><br />I loved the idea of these socks. They are advertised as skid-proof socks that can be worn for yoga or just around the house for foot warmth. The first part is true, they are skid-proof and can be worn for yoga, however the material is a bit thin for anything else. Plus, they made my feet sweat after a wearing them for a while because of they type of synthetic material used, which felt uncomfortable. After washing them once, I noticed they lost their shape a bit, and therefore, did not hold up as well as I expected."
3.0,"The costume is a little cheaply made as referenced in other reviews but it's still cute. Corset top fits a little odd. I had to wear a strapless bra. It was missing the red cape!!! Good thing I don't need it right away!! I did contact the seller and waiting to see what they say. I put off trying it on. But if I had somewhere to go this weekend and put it on out of the package as many people do, I would have been very upset. Hopefully they can send me a cape. I got 2 different versions and like this one much better."
3.0,Good item. As Described.
3.0,The only thing that I dont like is the pocket placement. Its on the back side... random.
3.0,"Cute earrings, but ghe ones I received were black and whit, not black and black."
3.0,"Took a long time to get to me, it's nice for the price"
3.0,"It's so inexpensive it's almost mean to be critical. But there is one glaring design problem. The buttons are too soft: the slightest pressure activates them. I mean, my sleeve fabric rubs a button and changes the dial. So many times I need to quickly glance at the time, and it's on a stopwatch setting or something else. Or it's on 2400 time, which isn't my preference.<br /><br />It looks good, it works, otherwise, and it seems to be sufficiently water resistant."
3.0,I sent it back.  The adjustment to make it smaller or larger is too big
3.0,It's gorgeous. Runs small though so I'd say go a size up. Luckily I'm tiny so I managed to squeeze myself in it and not have any wardrobe malfunctions such as nip slips or otherwise if you get what I mean lol.
3.0,Cute but 1st time wearing it has a rip in the seam.
3.0,The battery life is TERRIBLE (two weeks in one shoe) and unable to replace the battery as it is all glued in is NOT a good idea!
3.0,"Very smooth transaction,  shipped quickly,  fits good"
3.0,I love the color but there is no way you can do that head tie shown in the picture unless its longer then what is being sold. Otherwise I would have given a 5. I wanted to wear it to work but now I cant.
3.0,"I don't like making bad reviews on things that had a good amount of work put into it. The rune pieces themselves are definitely hand made or hand carved, the leather is machine cut and stamped/etched, but it's a bit sketchy and smells like it's going to give me some kind of cancer. Those things aside, my real issue is that half the reviews are giving credit to Amazon for replacing an item that the seller shouldn't have to replace. This set frequently comes with a duplicate for one rune while missing a different rune. My best guess is that none of it is handmade, it's just being hand guided through machines and then someone with no experience in runology or even basic understanding of Norse runes was told to sort the runes into sets. The pieces are beautiful and the rest are well done so rather than waste my time with Amazon, I'm going to take the time and reflect on why my gods made my set included 2 Nauthiz."
3.0,These earrings are super small and more like a child's size. They are pretty but I wish they were larger.
3.0,"Comfortable but not quite knee length (I'm 5'4&#34;), already have holes in one pair.....I don't wear these often."
3.0,"Wind stopper? More like wind... winder...er... seriously not insulating at all, breaths like crazy, not remotely wind or water proof.<br /><br />Good for summer, stupid for winter."
3.0,"I loved this dress, made of great material, but it ran way too large for me.  I am 5'2 and 110 pounds, got a small and it was definitely a medium.  Really had no way of telling if I was given the wrong size anyway since the package and the dress itself had no label of size on it."
3.0,"Cute shirts, better to order about two sizeslarger than actual size, they are very small."
3.0,Very pretty. Material was thicker than I thought it would be. Fit as expected I’m 5’6 and it was great even with flats
3.0,Looks cute but beware the size
3.0,Nobody’s going to mention the Star of David choker?
3.0,Compression is ok. Not very well made. The toe part is weirdly put together and made me feel a little lump in my shoes - very uncomfortable when running. (See picture)
3.0,"Could have been my favorite underwear ever - but despite their comfort and good looks, nearly every pair of Obviosly Naked brand underwear (and I've purchased 15+ pairs of trunks and 9&#34; boxer briefs over the last 3 years, hoping the manufacturing qualify would improve) has developed small holes in the crotch after only a handful of wash cycles. These underwear are FAR too expensive to be considered &#34;disposable&#34;, so I guess I'll have to keep looking."
3.0,My son loves the costume BUT:  very disappointed in the hat.  It was squished flat in the packaging and ruined.  Too late to return for another one.<br />Need to rethink the way you package the hat.
3.0,"The product could have been rated perfect, but the material is very thin! You have to wear another layer of clothing up under it to be warm."
3.0,"I love the dress, and the dress size was true to size,  but it has special cut outs of the off the shoulder sleeveless look. Those are really small and tight, so I could not comfortably keep the dress on for more than a minute. I would have loved to have kept it. I don't have any type of large biceps, but you may want to consider a medium."
3.0,"This bag is beautiful but I am returning because it is not as sturdy as I hoped.  Having experience with similarly made bags, I think if you put anything somewhat heavy in this bag, the bag will rip at the handle seams."
3.0,I dislike the shoes because the shoes are too big
3.0,Beautiful material but sadly just not right for a curvy woman. Pockets add bulk to hip area. If you look like the model does then this will be great for you.
3.0,This neckless looked amazing and was amazing for the 3 hours I had it for. I understand that it is only $9 and that you get what you pay for. But I definitely expected it to last longer than 3 hours. The neckless broke near the clasp and I didn’t even realize tell I found it on my bathroom floor. I am really disappointed because I was excited for this really cute necklace.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:c89a4ab819bdb8d8b7469f5450f31603]] These are cute as shown, but I've had my ears stretched to 00 for a month now and still can't get these in. The flare on the backside is also a bit sharp, the edges could've been rounded out more like the front of the Guage."
3.0,"These socks are comfortable enough and feel fine. I can't say there's anything particularly special about them that I've noticed, though. I don't mean to be bland in this review, but . . . they're pretty much just socks like any other. They work fine with sneakers when playing sports. Nothing stands out as being of special note."
3.0,"The day after I received them, I stepped in 2"" of water.  The boots are 6"" high...both feet were soaked.<br />It took 3 days for the lining to dry out. They should not list them as waterproof.<br />Other than that, very nice boot, fits well, very sturdy."
3.0,Material isn’t the best but it’s still super cute
3.0,I typically wear a 2XL. I was in a haste and did not read the reviews. When it came I tried it on immediately and it was very snug. Hoping I can stretch it out to wear a few times before Halloween is over. I would recommend sizing up.
3.0,I really don't like the material.
3.0,"The design was cute, but it was very short and not high waist. I'm 5'8&#34; Seller gave me  a full refund, no problems."
3.0,Top part not made for large breasts
3.0,Order a larger size than you anticipate
3.0,Corset is gorgeous but my suggestion is to know your measurements ... I just didn't work for me.
3.0,"Dang this shirt is huge. I'm a size 18 and got a 1x and it still came to my knees. However, it is so cute. I will wear it with leggings and a jean jacket or as a night shirt, because it is so unique. Material is very soft and the graphic on it isn't bad quality and doesn't seem in danger of peeling off. Overall pretty happy with it."
3.0,Dress was a little to big. But I can make it work.
3.0,Sorta thin but does the job. Fits nicely
3.0,The fabric is a very bright pink. I'm ok with the material but the ruffles on the sleeves were a surprise. I'll have to dress this up to make it cute (with a sweater or blazer) but it was nice for the price
3.0,Love the socks but there were 3 pair that had holes in them and one pair had a stain on them
3.0,"I was looking for a dress to wear for my Valentines Day. When I found this dress, I instantly fell in love with it. I read the reviews before purchasing this dress and the majority of the reviews said to order a size up because the dress ran small so I ordered it in a large (I normally wear a medium). When I tried on the dress, I struggled to get it on. This is a beautiful dress and I really wish I was able to wear it for Valentines Day."
3.0,slips. will not stay tight.
3.0,"The strap looked cheap when I got it compared to the way it looks in the picture.. Online it was also advertised that this package came with tools to replace the strap, which was the whole point of me buying this product. No such tools were in the package. I'm returning out for a refund."
3.0,It's a very pretty print but it is not leather.
3.0,"I thought the dress was ok, but my husband hated it for some reason he could not articulate. I have a long waist and the belt/bow sat a bit too high for comfort. Well made and the fabric was nice."
3.0,"I love the blouse.  I ordered a size up but it is too big, if you are ordering this blouse, order your normal size."
3.0,It was ok but it's too small for me through the shoulders and the eyelet lace around the neck was kind of irritating.
3.0,I like that the fabric is sheer... but the puffy shoulders and unflattering elastic waist make this look like my grandmother's nightgown. Maybe it would be more flattering on a taller or broader person. Added a star because I did not contact the seller and can't say they wouldnt have fixed it if I had done so.
3.0,"Nice thin material, Runs small"
3.0,Several months and it still smells terrible.
3.0,Pretty dress and fit nice at the top but had to unzip the side since it's very snug at the waist and you can't just pull it over or up easily.  I was disappointed to find the dress was far longer than I had expected so it' going back.
3.0,The jacket's fit was extremely tight (I ALWAYS wear a large). But the deal breaker for me was the placement of the two hand pockets. They went horizontally away from my sides towards the middle of my back. It was the weirdest configuration I have ever witnessed. I sent it back.
3.0,"they are very cute earrings! I really like them, but they are extremely heavy and way larger than I thought. My family reference them to like the sides of children's toys. I would definitely recommend getting these for the price of them, but just keep in mind they are very heavy and will probably stretch out your ear piercing."
3.0,This outfit fit tight. It is small for a large and will show every line of undergarments. The fabric is not see through because it was black. I liked the short sleeves for warmer days. It is very comfortable and the textured pattern is soft to the touch. The top has a full length zipper. I gave it a three star because it was smaller than other larges.
3.0,Fell apart after a year. Kinda expected a little more time out of it than that but I guess I can't expect too much. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
3.0,Shirt looks like the picture! Would have bought a size up though as it is not true to size.
3.0,I ordered a 1X and it fits but it's a little tighter than I expected bc of the stretchy material.
3.0,I look like I have scrubs on.
3.0,The color are different than they look on line
3.0,Cheap hat.  Didn't fit right.
3.0,"I look better in rectangular shape lenses, so I thought these might work. I refuse to pay big bucks for sunglasses, I don't want to freak out if I lose them or accidentally sit on them. Pro: Well made, sturdy, fits on the ears comfy and secure.<br />Cons: Much smaller lens than I anticipated. I looked at the measurements on a ruler compared to my broken long-lived sunglasses, and these lenses are a lot smaller than it seemed they would be.<br />I bought the tortoise, and the lenses also aren't as darkening as I would have liked.<br />So bottom line, cute and all, makes a good hair band if you're that girl. (I am) Driving into the screaming sun, glare leaks in front the bottom and the sides."
3.0,"These shoes are really nice especially when you're trying to impress someone. My only issue is the shoe becomes very narrow towards my toes and it has caused BLISTERS and BLEEDING every time I wear it. Slowly I'm starting to wear the shoes less and less. I only wear them if it is less than a hour and I'm willing to deal with the gruesome pain it brings. Overall, the shoes are nice."
3.0,"Weren't high enough for me. They hit just above the knee, I was hoping for further up my thigh. But I do have long legs, so maybe that's the issue."
3.0,These were larger than I expected and one of the earrings is missing the red nose.
3.0,This bathing suit has no support up top. Just an FYI for women who need support in their bathing suits. Find a different suit.
3.0,Looks full. Cap is comfortable doesn't show. Front part look like a doll head. Color and curls are cute.
3.0,"Socks are a lot heavier, thicker material than I expected.  Glad I bought the large, because according to the size chart I should take a medium, but I don't know if I'd be able to get those on.  They are a tight fit."
3.0,"The fabric is coarser than what I would like, but it IS cool to wear in the heat, which is what I wanted."
3.0,Not very happy. Fit was good but the under lining is shorter than the skirt and too see through
3.0,The reason I returning 2 packages instead of 3. Did not know when I ordered the socks. 1 package had 6 socks in it.  So I want to return 2 of the packages instead of the 3.  Please adjust my payment. Tkd
3.0,"I basically bought this for the top because I hate brief bottoms. (I so wish this came with a skirt bottom!).With that said, the top fit. I'm a size 26, but only a C cup and most of the time, anything in my size is made for bustier women, but the cups fit, however there's no support and I worry they will come out. There's something odd about the way the fit feels on your back/shoulder area, but again, it is flattering for my body type (large stomach). If that's what you're looking for, I'd recommend this. The top hangs to the waist, but don't expect it to cover much hip like the picture."
3.0,Just not what I was looking for but cute for the beach with a black swimsuit!
3.0,It is for my size but I am not satisfied for the pleather quality. It smells not good. But design and comfort is appropiate.
3.0,Lindo solo la cadena es súper delgadita
3.0,Too large and not what I expected.
3.0,Good quality. Just slightly too big in the sleeves. Empire waist line is a little high. I have to adjust often. Neckline needs a little more room as well.
3.0,"Fast shipping! When I got it I thought the bag was bigger, turns out to be smaller than I thought like the size of a crossbody bag"
3.0,If the shoes(s) you re buying these for are larger than men's 11 chose a different product. This shoe tree just fit my American made dress shoe size 10.5W.
3.0,It was cute enough but totally not what I thought I was buying based on the picture.
3.0,The first two<br />Pair I bought were great except for<br />Being a little too short but the next two I bought (same size ordered) were too tight. Will need to return them
3.0,More of a womens or childs size. With the strap all the way out it fits pretty snug on my size 7 head. The screen print is smaller than expected. Seems fair enough quality. Be aware it is made in and ships from China.
3.0,Fits fine however quality is not fine at all. After putting it on and getting to the beach I bent over to fix my towel and the small pieces of material holding the strap to the back of the top fell apart. There was literally 3 to 4 pieces of thread holding it together. Now I've got to take it somewhere to be repaired.
3.0,"Overall cute outfit, quality and fit were as expected, the wording however was not as described/advertised, it's borderline profanity/offensive...""ccck""..not sure what Halloween word that is supposed to be..."
3.0,"These seem to be of nice quality and they're comfortable. My back view is okay, but they cling to my stomach and pelvic area.  Not a pretty look.  I will have to wear a really long t-shirt with them."
3.0,"I ordered one size up, but it is still pretty tight. I would recommend ordering two sizes up."
3.0,I just didn't like the dress from the moment I got it. It was super wrinkeled. The top material is cheap. I didn't even wear it. I just put in the donation box for a local salvation army. I rate it 3 because I did try it on. It did fit right. Just really hated the material.
3.0,"Pros: good quality material, length is perfect for me (I'm 5'3""), pockets are deep enough to hold a phone or a wallet, zippered pockets are a plus<br />Cons: cannot tumble dry which is a deal breaker for me so I'm returning for this reason"
3.0,The slit is way too high for the office. I had to return it. NSFW
3.0,"The material feels nice but the sizing felt like a men's small, even though I understand it's supposed to be form fitting."
3.0,I bought it for inside my wellies.  Works well and keeps my feet warm.
3.0,Linda pero muy cortas
3.0,"cheaply made.  out of my order of 120 lights, 23 did not work (dead).  order extra if you need a certain amount to work.  price is great though, just remember these are a one time shot and last a couple of hours.  batteries cannot be replaced without destroying the light."
3.0,I have a very small foot. I am a size 5 in women and 3.5 in kids. I thought that these would be perfect but they are a bit small. A lot smaller than a size 6. They fit a bit tight. Other than that they do the job.
3.0,Regular quality
3.0,These are so small they are almost invisible. Not happy with these.
3.0,"I ordered a large,  which normally is a loose and comfortable fit.  When the dress arrived,  I was ecstatic!  The bird print was lovely,  the fabric felt luxurious. This would be my new go-to-church dress,  when church opened up again.  Then I tried it on.  Could not even get the zipper half-way up.  A larger size would have been too long as well as too wide in the hips and waist.  So,  much as I love the look of it,  if you are ""blessed""  topside,  take that into consideration when ordering."
3.0,I was not very happy with This maybe it's my fault I didn't checked the size and I just saw the picture ! And the material is very cheap and they are very very small !
3.0,Pearls were bigger than expected
3.0,"These were good for the price, but they are huge and limp and look more like bloodhound ears than a detective hat."
3.0,"It’s okay, ruffles aren’t that cute. Bottom of the dress isn’t as flattering as in the photos. Material is soft but for the type of dress material could be better. The dress I received had a tear on the top ruffle, it’s probably a return."
3.0,Hoping they were a little longer.
3.0,a little snug but otherwise an ok dress
3.0,the dress is beautiful but being that it is too late to find another dress for my sons wedding I had to pay a seamstress $60 for alterations.
3.0,"I first saw this tote on QVC, but Amazon had a much better price, so I ordered it.  I like the bag and it's compartments, but when I took it out of the packaging, it had a weird smell.  I had to hang it outside for well over a week, put dryer sheets in all the compartment, and spray it with Lysol.  It still has an odor.  I don't know what else to do with it.  I don't use it as much as I thought I would, due to the odor."
3.0,They’re a one size fits all set
3.0,"This bracelet is very cute and I love how wide it is. I only paid $1.86 for it which is amazing.  The only downside is that it is very hard to clasp.  The angle is awkward which makes it difficult.  Otherwise, great bracelet."
3.0,More for a teenager but they are nice. The price was good. So i will give them to someone
3.0,Would've gave it 5 stars but they arrived with 2 small scratches on the lense. Didn't want to go through the hassle of trying to send it back. They're ok for the price
3.0,"I bought this for my mother for my wedding. The dress is pretty. Fits true to size. The reason it gets 3 stars is because the slip that is sown into the inside was done so inside out, so the tag can be seen through the lace...and the tag is sown into the seem, so even with cutting most of it off, you cant cut all of it off without ruining the dress....so it looks tacky."
3.0,The band is very dressy and I loved the looks of it with my fit bit.  I found the clasp doesn't hold very well and it has dropped off my wrist.  I have gone back to my original band because I was afraid of losing it.
3.0,Fit perfectly but only lasted about a month with the Velcro strap!
3.0,Do not feel like cotton... very stiff
3.0,Did not stretch at all
3.0,Nice nose ring but when u have it in there is only one way you can leave it or else you will see the long part hanging in your nose while the heart is crooked while you have it in
3.0,"Ok so I was super happy when this arrived. I love it but there are numerous problems. First when I got it out of the package I noticed it had two left straps on the vest piece instead of a right and a left strap. That I could fix. Undo the seams realign the strap and sew it back up. Easy. Did that. Then I run into another problem. The buckles that connect to the belt are backwards. No clue how to fix that without ruining the straps, but I can work with it. It just wouldn't look as good. NOW I can't find the other strap to go over the hip.... Love the way it looks, love the material. If I can make it work without the piece and with all the problems great! If not I have no clue what to do. Also I can't contact the seller to try and get a replacement."
3.0,"Agree with others that the main zipper is defective.  Opens and exposes content to anyone who happens to be behind you.  The canvas material and design is great but without a main zipper to keep it closed, it is useless.  I saw complaints about this when I purchased it but the company had responded and said they fixed it with a sturdier part.  Not so in my experience.[[ASIN:B00ZZEWSM4 Zerlar Men's Chest Pack Crossbody Bag Vintage Canvas Shoulder Sling Bag Rucksack]]"
3.0,"Nice hat but definitely the color is different from the picture, the hat is greenish."
3.0,"I purchased an xlg of this pajama set. The pants are too short. The tank top fits like a small. I love the design, but the top is very uncomfortable to sleep in. If I had known about the size issue, I wouldn't have bought this set."
3.0,I purchased for my grandson to put his sunglasses in ... it's cute but cheaply made.
3.0,It’s cute and I get a lot of complements on it but but pineapple detached from stem pretty early on. I was able to super glue it back one with minimal issues
3.0,These are nice earrings; substantial and shiny with some sparkle.  I was sorry to return them but the wires were much larger than my earring holes would accept.  These are a great option if you can handle the larger wires.
3.0,"I wear a size 13 shoe and these are quite difficult to put on. Once on, they do their job well."
3.0,I’ll give 3 stars because the first one I bought was very sturdy for my 4 year old.  We both loved it.  My Rottweilers got it one night and ate it.<br />So I reordered as a gift for his stocking.  The strap came unglued or Unsewn and not wearable.<br /><br />I know this review is late but I honestly just saw this.  The band broke within a week.
3.0,Did not fit according to the size chart.
3.0,"It was too small, the material felt funny, kinda sticks to my skin, the seams we not neatly stitched. Just a rough looking dress"
3.0,Ordered a large. I'm 5'7 and 148 lbs. It was too tight.
3.0,Very boxy shape. Not impressed. Returning.
3.0,The product was decent material and made as shown.  Nothing special about it
3.0,"Full disclosure. I returned this suit because of the way it fit me.  I don't think it was the right style for me.  That said, it was exactly as pictured and seemed to be good quality."
3.0,"The colors are slightly different than appears in photo, but overall great price and fit!"
3.0,"They are too short to get the proper leverage on a tight fitting Running shoe.<br />They work but, the heel pocket struggle has been only slightly reduced in this application.<br />I will be getting a larger horn soon."
3.0,Gorgeous dress<br />The only reason it is getting 3 stars is because the right side of the dress at the top is slightly bigger than the left side. Made slightly incorrectly
3.0,"I sent this dress back. I loved the color and the material, it was just too....blah....if that’s a good word for it. Looked like I was wearing a bag. There just wasn’t any shape to it."
3.0,"I liked this product on and got many compliments. However some threads came undone simply from washing. I did not machine dry, only air dried. So the threads coming undone was only from washing on gentle. That was a bit disappointing."
3.0,"Love everything about it except it doesn't lock the load instead after a short while I get the secondary upper bumps and I made sure I bought the right size. Disappointing, can't wear it, thought maybe it would fit better after a while of wearing. But everything else is really nice."
3.0,"Cute dress, but should have gone a size up for the chest (38DD)"
3.0,The length of the shirt is 5 to 6 inches to long
3.0,"Cute outfit, but definitely cheaply made and it is NOT a dress."
3.0,bulk quality
3.0,"Pretty dress, good fit, and lovely colors, but too see-through"
3.0,"Not very elastic and thin material, but sure looks good. Very loud noise when walking through."
3.0,I tried a few high waisted bottoms and this one was my least favorite. The extra ruching fabric isn’t tight enough so it sags at the crotch. Not cute.
3.0,Very nice desgin however poorly made . I pair arrived broken and the others bent .
3.0,Absolutely beautiful choker but you must have a tiny neck to wear it.  I would need two of this. Sadly I have to return it.
3.0,Little disappointed in detail
3.0,Its was ok
3.0,I have purchased two of these in my lifetime. I lost one of them when I was riding my bike. I passed some people talking and I heard something hit the ground but I decided not to turn around and risk eye contact. When I got home I realized the sound had been this case falling out of my backpack. I still resent those people. If you've acquired one of these cases off the street it may mean you are one of those people and I demand you return my glasses. The second one I purchased hasn't held up very well. It's all torn up and cracked from opening it. Not super high quality. Protects my sunglasses pretty well. It also doesn't seem to mind that I don't put Ray-bans in it. I'm more of an $8 gas station kind of guy.
3.0,"It’s really pretty and I love the pattern. However, it’s made from some kind of hot scratchy material. It drove me nuts the whole time I had it on. Haven’t worn it since."
3.0,"This stool looks amazing! Great Pac-man design made with quality material. However it is not very comfortable for any extended period of time however. Don't sit on it directly for very long, your butt will start feeling sore pretty quick. You really have to just sort of lean on it in order to enjoy it."
3.0,Yellow is see through but nice feeling material
3.0,"I ordered a size small (5.98 - 8.74 inches). I was hesitant to order a small because I don’t have a very small wrist, but I trusted the size description. My wrist is 7.25 inches. This watch band fits quite snug at its largest setting. There is no way it fits up to 8.74 inches.<br /><br />The clasp is  difficult to put together with one hand. Being on the largest size setting makes it harder to pull the ends together and screw the pole in.<br /><br />Otherwise, it’s a very nice looking band. I just wish I ordered a medium; but there’s no way of knowing if that would fit either."
3.0,Very cute shirt but runs small
3.0,"Nice that the pants are thicker, but the fabric was a little weird and itchy. The pants were too tight in the stomach and too loose in the legs."
3.0,"All my other garments have the zipper handles on the right-hand side; that is to say, one uses one's right hand to engage and pull up the zipper.  I was surprised, and disappointed, to discover the main zipper handle on the left side of this garment.  I decided not to return it for what might seem a trifling matter, though I am going to have to learn to work this zipper backwards from the way all my other zippers work.<br /><br />I haven't used the garment yet, but it seems to meet my expectations in all other ways."
3.0,I loved the yellow colors and really hoped it would work.  The small size  fit was slimming. However the elastic waist did not fall on a good spot. The pics people sent made the dress look more flowing. I thought the waist on  medium size would fall a little lower and leave some excess fabric to cover the cheap looking waistband. It was barely different from the small.
3.0,I am simple and absolutely loved the necklace but it broke after 2 uses.  Didnt get stuck on anything either
3.0,"Good price, I like the style, as far as texture, it's like plastic, and little tight on wrist"
3.0,El producto es creativo pero la tela no es muy buena
3.0,It was quite small.
3.0,Only came in small. I’m not a small. I thought maybe but I was wrong.  I liked them. Let me know when you have med or lg available.
3.0,I got an XL. I guess they size them for tall kids not chubby adults? Sigh
3.0,Bought some of these for gifts. Recipients thought they were very small... Like for kids. They look nice though.
3.0,This dress runs very long and can easily trip someone.
3.0,Quality is good and looks good. I did buy a size up to allow for shrinkage and boy did it ever in the length! I would say it shrank a good 4-5&#34;. It now falls 2&#34; below my knees which leaves my legs cold. I'm thinking about buying add'l flannel to add to the bottom for more length.
3.0,"Okay, i really REALLY wanted to like these, but they are the most unflattering and uncomfortable pants I've ever bought. They are like a bulap material, but not a good soft burlap. More like a potato sack made into pants. Large & long in the groin area and too form fitting on the legs. I'm 5'4 and 105 lbs. Long legs, short torso. I really was hopeful, because the cost was great, but they missed the mark."
3.0,The stones were beautiful but only 3 out of the 14 would fit in a 30 x 20 mm cabochon setting.  It was a huge disappointment that they were so poorly calibrated.
3.0,I ordered this sweater for a trip to GA and NC.  I liked it but it did not fit.  I gave it to my daughter.  She said it was very warm.
3.0,"This visor is a good product overall, my issue is the piece that holds it to ones head is not flexible."
3.0,"I love the magnets, it weighs down the chain so it hides in my shirt but they both tarnished rather quickly."
3.0,"I am 5'5, 115 lbs, size 2 in pants and the xsmall was wayyyyyyy too tight, couldn't even pull it past my thighs! I ordered a small, and even that was too tight, dug in too much at my waist. I wish this was a higher waist design, this hit me mid waist. :("
3.0,Nice looking prop. Shipping cost almost as much as the oil can. If you're using this as a Wizard of Oz prop be aware the trigger doesn't make a sound the audience can hear.
3.0,It looks nice from a distance. But the purse smells of plastic/nylon. That cheaply material. It's not very thin material so that's good. The chain looks prett from far away but it's made of plastic. I'm still using it. Had to let it air out. And I can't make it too heavy because the link can open. It's ok.
3.0,I got what I paid for these.
3.0,"I bought these for a child to wear with a costume.  They were much too large.  However, they are very sturdy."
3.0,"[[ASIN:B003S835EO Safco Products 5212BL Onyx Mesh File Cart with 2 File Drawers, Letter Size, Black]]<br />There is not stop behind the file drawers.  The drawers can slide right out of the back, unless it is pressed up against the wall.  I can jury-rig something to create a stop for each drawer but so far that's the only drawback."
3.0,The material is good. I think it is not exactly like the pictures  shown. It's still okay though.
3.0,I thought the chain would be longer
3.0,"It is not a poncho or a pullover - it is a zippered jacket.  I was hoping for a poncho for my daughter's camping trips but this will work.<br /><br />The lining is a nylon mesh - a bit scratchy if you're wearing short sleeves.  I also dont know how durable it will be.  I can see finger nails, watches etc getting caught on it as it is being put on.  The material is also fairly thin - I doubt it will be especially durable but for the price, it is fine.<br /><br />Sizing seems to be a bit small.  She is a women's medium and this is a men's medium jacket.  It fits her perfectly where I would have expected it to be a bit large on her.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with this jacket.  I dont love it, I doubt it will be very durable, but if you're looking for an inexpensive rain jacket, this will work."
3.0,"Cute but it is snug at the Chest and I am not large cheated, I ended up just unbuttoning the top button and that helped but sitting down it pulls on the second button too, so maybe size up!"
3.0,It was a little bit small but still worked. I would order it again but in a slightly bigger size than what my daughter usually wears.
3.0,"In quality, it's a lot like the ones you can buy in many grocery stores, or even in some ""department"" type stores, for groceries etc. Thus, I think it's overpriced. I bought it to wrap a gift that fits well inside it (DVR player) for a ""Mama Bear"", so I'm more or less satisfied. With tissue paper and ribbons, I could make it work. Bear themed paper is more difficult to get than I had expected, and the person likes blue.<br />It's certainly not something to write home about at that price, though."
3.0,The material is VERY thin and flimsy. Not necessarily a bad thing....just seems cheap. The hat that comes with is is just as flimsy and i dont know how we will get it to stand up lol. The mask is very small and just as thin. This was for my daughter so it being smallish overall was ok. Im not mad at it just less than what i was expecting.
3.0,Galaxy  watch
3.0,Rather tight.
3.0,I like this style of Blouse but would like more in plain and more colors.  I would like to buy more if they have in different colors and plain colors
3.0,While the outfit is quite cute it is very lightweight fabric and looks to run very small.  have not tried on yet as it is a birthday gift
3.0,I knew the bracelet was hollow but it is too fragile and bent severely after the first week I wore it.  It is very nice looking.
3.0,"These are super cute, however they run too small. My daughter is a size 1 and these didn't fit her. I had to order her a size 3. I was also sent gold ones instead of the silver that I ordered...."
3.0,The fabric is very soft and comfortable
3.0,Very bummed as I have worn twice and the gripes are starting to peel off :( really needed these for yoga!<br />Contacted customer service and they were very quick to respond and great to work with!
3.0,That are so tiny and hard to open they are really uncomfortable and bad
3.0,The whole top is made to fit by cinching strings. Unfortunately the strings also make up the straps so u need to cinch less in order to even have straps. Very pretty gown otherwise
3.0,I like them but thought the colors would be more vibrant.  They are okay.
3.0,"Love the color and the cut hits right above the knee, but the elastic around the shoulders seems pretty tight for such a loose dress. It fits nice around the shoulders as long as you don't move your arms around too much."
3.0,Very cute but for a small wrist (which is great for me). I ordered two and one of them broke when I was opening the packaging. I was able to glue it back together.
3.0,The only issue I have is when I am wearing them the part with the brand plate on top will roll and be against my foot and rub always same foot not the other so I assume maybe just has a defect.
3.0,Lights lasted maybe a few weeks.
3.0,I ordered this shirt in a L (my daughter wears a 10/12) and in green in an XL for my son (who wears a 14/16). When the shirts came they have the correct sizes on the tag but were EXACTLY the same size. My daughter's shirt is HUGE for a large! I'm not sure if it was mistagged or what but I didn't have time to return the item before we needed it for our new baby's arrival.
3.0,So cute. So soft but about 4 sizes too big
3.0,The bottoms are small in my opinion the top fit fine.
3.0,I returned cuz it smells n i didn’t like the style.
3.0,"The romper looks nice, but it is really small.  I normally wear a size 16.  I bought a 3X.  The major issue I had was that it wasn't long enough for my torso.  It pulled really, really tight and flattened out my chest--which is hard to do!--and tugged at my shoulders.  I'm only 5 ft 5in, so I'm not tall or particularly long.  I hate it didn't work though, because it is really cute."
3.0,Cute dress but it was too small for me I’m 5’3 186lbs should’ve ordered a x large material thin a lil see through
3.0,"I’m only giving it a three stars because both times I have ordered this bracelet I did not receive the one I wanted, but the bracelet is still very nice"
3.0,had to return it gown was beautiful but too large
3.0,"The picture is deceiving. I'm not a tall person (5'4&#34; in shoes with a heel) and the jacket only goes down mid thigh.  Also, you'll need to order 2 sizes larger than normal if you want a fit like the picture shows."
3.0,it is very cute although awkwardly short in the front part other then that it is really cute.
3.0,Good fit. Light thin fabrics but my daughter will be wearing this in Florida so no big deal. Cheaper through other sellers. I haven’t washed it yet but honestly I don’t think it’ll wash well. Stay tuned. Cute pattern.
3.0,"So these fit okay but were very long and baggy at the bottom. Additionally; i'm not entirely certain if it was the fit that caused this, but I experiences inner thigh burns after wearing this to go jogging- I don't experience this with other pants so I'm not sure if it was the material or the fit that caused this. I'm combatting this issue by wearing tights underneath for the sole reason that I really like these pants. Otherwise they'd go in the garbage because those burns are no joke!"
3.0,"Cheap material, double side of mask which it doesn’t show  on the pictures."
3.0,Beautiful design but runs small
3.0,not bad for the money and arrived early
3.0,Way way to large def not one size fits all.  I had to return.  Other than that it was ok.
3.0,"Hi, first let me say the item was well constructed and very nice. I ordered the 3X and it was a very tight fit around the shoulder and arm area. I am a size 18 with broad shoulders."
3.0,Cute top fits ok. Shows sweat and doesn’t dry fast.
3.0,"I liked it, but the top back material bunched funny as if there was extra chiffon. The bra cups were also too high for my torso. Otherwise it seemed in good condition and layed on the shoulders nicely."
3.0,Backpack was damaged
3.0,"They are a well pair of Glasses but I saw no real improvement in my night time driving. There was still glare from oncoming car, it was just yellow not white in color. The Glasses did improve sight during cloudy day driving by making everything appear brighter."
3.0,"I did think this was a cute dress, but it wasn’t flattering on my body type. The middle seem (where the top part of the dress stops) hit me at a very awkward spot, which made it extremely unflattering on me. I’m not quite sure why. I’m 5’5” and I wear a size 14/16, so I ordered an XL. The dress was too tight, it just fell awkwardly. It did hit me at my knees, but that was the only thing I liked. I returned the item."
3.0,"Way too small.  I can’t even get them over my hips.  I normally wear a size 5 in Juniors, I ordered a size 28 and they are way too small.  Look like good material though"
3.0,Nice dress. Has pockets.
3.0,"i thought these would keep my feet warm but they do not. The sole is way low and the boot is not waterproof at all, my socks were wet each time i went to work walking on snow and my toes got very very cold. They are good to walk in and look nice etc. but not for very cold weather at all and not for wanting dry feet. I am sad about it but will keep them, buying another boot though"
3.0,"Runs wayyyyy small! I ordered an XL, runs more like a medium"
3.0,This runs extremely small.. maybe if you wore a small or medium it would fit. It's pretty colors but if your a plus size it will not fit..
3.0,"I love the way this hat looks. However, the adjustment buckle does not stay secure, so, it loosens and the hat is not snug."
3.0,"Runs small so go off size chart, not reviews that say it’s true to size or runs large. I’m a size 8/10, 36 B/C. I ordered a medium and couldn’t get it over my head. So, I’ll be returning and getting the XL. It is a cute tank top - ordered the tie-dye one. Not really a lot of stretch in the tie-dye version, but not sure if the others have more stretch?"
3.0,"Producto con buenos materiales, muy buenos accesorios, cuerpo del lente fata cubrir los espacio al lado de la cara para mayor proteccion de los ojos. Los materiales son muy buenos y calidad buena. Por temas de seguridad para actividades de shooting, hunter, bike, recomiendo cubrir mas espacio de los ojos."
3.0,Does not match the peacock outfit that it suggests.
3.0,It's ok not what I expected but doable
3.0,"I bought these binders to wear after my second c section. They fit wonderfully and work together nicely as well. The Velcro has held up really well and is strong.  They have been exactly what I needed right after the delivery and early recovery days. However I have only been wearing them for 2 weeks and they are wearing out. The fabric that comes around the front has started to fold and buckle right on top of my incision instead of holding flat like it did for the first week and a half. The binders are also not holding in place any more, instead they’re riding up so the pelvic one sits above half an inch-an inch above my incision instead staying nicely on top.  I was hoping to be able to wear this binder for 4-6 weeks post partum, but they have only lasted the 2 weeks. But again, other than that they have been fantastic."
3.0,Super cute ... good quality but size was huge. I usually wear an L or XL and the XL felt like 3XL. I hope the return process is easy.
3.0,"Runs a little big, but looks good. Beware leaves blue sparkles everywhere."
3.0,The fit is very fitted and I found it too snug.  I has not read the fabric description when I ordered it. I don't like polyester clothing in the warm weather.
3.0,Size not commensurate with a medium build female. Large designation closer to oriental physique. Recommend X-large for Americans.
3.0,"Cute, but sizing was small. Sent it back."
3.0,"Bought the brown top with white flowers. The fit is nice and the fabric is very soft. The color isn't as ""washed out"" as in the picture (I wish it was), and the flowers are almost sticky or tacky feeling."
3.0,The shirt is cute and would love to wear it but it is about 2 sizes too small.  I ordered size XXL and it fits like a large.
3.0,Nice looking watch . The watch band may look a little cheap . Overall great for the money
3.0,The color and texture is beautiful. It runs a little small but is still flattering.
3.0,"Had to return, didn't fit"
3.0,This would be a really cute summer dress with sandals for casual and can even be dressed up for work with a jacket however it is much shorter than the picture makes it look. I am 5'5&#34; and it was at the top of my thigh.  Cute for a younger or short person!
3.0,"I've gotten in the habit of wearing vests with these in fashion leggings that have no pockets.  It's light because it's fleece making it feel flimsy around the zipper.  I would want a little more thickness to hold the material in place better with a 3 inch seam to either side of the zipper. The way jackets used to be made. It was really inexpensive = I wonder how long it will last. That said, for the money, it's not bad."
3.0,A little larger than anticipated even after washing but ok. Purchased a smaller size initially but it was too tight
3.0,The dress was a lot longer than I thought it would be.
3.0,I like it but it already starting to peel
3.0,"This was exactly what i was looking for BUT i was completely disappointed in the color and had to return. I ordered this to wear under a light cream bodysuit and the color was very visible through the fabric. It is an orangy color and althoug it fits well and would work under a dark top, it is not appropriate for anything that is white, cream or light colored. I cannot imagine whose skin tone it possibly matches."
3.0,"Big size,I will fix it to fit. I like the hat style and it will work for me. Good delivery and timing."
3.0,"Fits as expected, if you do not use something for static, it clingsto itself and whatever you dried it with."
3.0,Returned item.  Too large and didn't like the color.  Pants were way too long and wide from hip to ankle.  The color gray was rather drab looking for the event I was planning to wear it for. (Grandson's wedding)
3.0,"Great product for fall, just runs on the thinner side"
3.0,My last 2 pairs lasted a little over a year a piece. This set a couple months in and they're scratched with no difference in handling and care. Also seem not to eliminate as much glare.
3.0,Pretty baggy in the arms.
3.0,"They were supposed to be plus size. They fit okay except the back is too short. They have to keep being pulled up.<br />I am on the smaller end of a plus size, so someone larger may not be able to wear them. The positive is, the fabric is really nice and soft."
3.0,order two sizes down 😩.<br /><br />I’m 5’0 200 lbs 38DD and a medium swallows me
3.0,"These aren't bad for the price, but the seems are huge and obvious under the mesh, and they dyed my fingers black."
3.0,"Imagine my luck when I came across this beauty while using the private bathroom off of my executive suite office at the hedge fund.  There I was, expunging last night's feast ($1,250 plus tip at Alinea) and scrolling through my product suggestions when this little gem popped-up.  It is like Amazon knew I was in need of a wrist ornament in order to better broadcast the wealth I have been amassing over the longest running Bull Market to date.  I wiped myself with my Egyption Cotton sanitary squares (1,200 thread count, $119 / roll) and hit order!  I waited anxiously until I received a notice that my $36,000 watch was delivered to my local Amazon Locker.  That's when my dissatisfaction began.  Unboxing was a delight, but when I attached my new IWC watch to my wrist, I thought ""That's it?"". Generally when I spend kind of money on conspicuous displays of wealth, I feel a stirring in my insides. (No, lower. A little lower.  That's where I usually feel the stirring.) With this watch, that wasn't the case.  I just cannot get excited about it.  I've talked to my therapist, my life coach, my spiritual advisor, and my spiritual advisor's spirit animal about this - and none of us can figure out why I am not feeling at least a little of smug satisfaction in owning this timepiece.  I am relegated this to my drawer of ""knock around watches"" in my custom oak closest ($285,000).  I believe I will wear this watch during my trekking vacation to Bhutan.  Perhaps high in the Himalayans, while visiting one of the most inaccessible and poorest countries in southern Asian, I will be able feel better when someone asks for the time and I respond, ""About 10 times what you'll earn in a year... I mean 9:54.  In the A.M."""
3.0,quality was great . Sizing was horrible
3.0,"This is not a slouch beanie. It fits like a regular beanie. Even when I slid the front of the beanie to the top of my forehead it didn't slouch. However, this beanie is gorgeous in the denim color, sturdy, soft, thick. I'd give it 5 stars if it hadn't been displayed as a slouch beanie. I'll be keeping it. Very flattering."
3.0,Very cute and very disappointed that it runs so very very small.  I ordered a 4xl and there is no way that i am ever going to fit into this suit.  please fix your size specifications so they are realistic.  3 stars are because it is a cute suit.  if i could rate the description of size i would give it a zero.
3.0,Nice light fabric and very comfortable. They do run very large. I'm 5-4 125 and the small is very big on me and very long. I make them work though. The drawstring is pretty worthless and does nothing. Just a shoe string around the waist.
3.0,"I prefer the actual apple bands but for the price of this it is good, I just wish the actual part to hold it tight was better quality"
3.0,"This dress for as expected, very light weight. The tie around waist definitely changes the shape of it and depending on body frame it can be appealing. However, the buttons are such a hassle!  Every single button is so hard to do and undo because the hole size is not even close to being large enough. I feel like I'm going to pop off the buttons or rip the hole in the dress trying to button up or down."
3.0,"Its fine, but the side clips that hold the big strap on broke pretty quickly within the first 3 months.  I just replaced it with a key ring carabiner type of thing and it's still working.  It's frustrating to have to jerry rig something that is brand new but not built well.  Other than that, it's fine"
3.0,This is not made for a small person...you'd have to be 5'6 for it to fit. I am a genuine small at 5'2 115lbs. It looks ridiculous on me. The silver is painted on the dress and looks like it will come off after wearing it.
3.0,"I really loved this romper, the only problem was I had to put pins on the top because it was too loose and I'm a busty gal do boobs werent the issue. Other than that fitted good from the shorts area."
3.0,Arrived with broken zipper.
3.0,Es bonito y buena tela pero tiene una in perfección  de corte en la parte delantera que se nota mucho y no se ve bien
3.0,Beautiful dress. Definitely true to size.  Looked great but I wasn’t fond of the sleeves so I returned it otherwise I would have kept it.
3.0,"The size and pockets. Roomy,  its good as a casual tote. Canvas will stay clean I think. May be able to wash in the machine."
3.0,The price was good and does tend to run a little big so size down. Overall I liked them and they we’re comfy it was just the material was pretty cheap.
3.0,"This purse is so small. Its really cute, but just a lot smaller than what I anticipated."
3.0,They seem to run a little big. Also they crease really easily.
3.0,Was gift for my daughter who just lost her cat. hoping to enclose a bit of fur. But we haven't been able to open it1
3.0,Well it's from China and I think they sewed it together quickly.<br />The top of the suit is made for a child.<br />You need to be very small chested .<br /> took forever to get the suit as well.<br /><br />I would not order this suit.
3.0,kind of cheap looking and not as long as the photo.
3.0,"These are way cheaper in person than they look in the photos. They’re perfectly passable if you need luggage, but you’ll find yourself upgrading in a year or two."
3.0,I like it just that is small than how I saw it on amazon. It looks bigger on amazon
3.0,Kinda thin fabric and no lining.
3.0,"This watch is beautiful and the perfect addition to make any outfit feel just a little bit classier. The watch face is large, and the leather band is very comfortable. I wear mine on a daily basis whenever I go out. It does an excellent job.<br />UPDATE: I've had my watch for a little over a year, now. The leather at some point acquired a bit of a smell, due to sweat no doubt. It's not a big deal given it's not very noticeable and leather tends to do that when exposed to moisture. The watch face has endured many tumbles and has not scratched once. That being said, the rose gold plating has started to rust a bit where the wrist band connects to the watch. A few times the watch has been behind on the time., not the date, but the actual watch has lagged behind by a few hours or so. Adjusting the time on the watch has corrected that. Just recently, though, the watch all together died. I'm not certain if it is a mechanical error or a dead battery, but it no longer functions. A good purchase, but didn't seem to have much longevity."
3.0,It was too big and the magnet keeps coming apart.
3.0,Good price and ok fit
3.0,My fiance ordered the size needed and they are a tad to short. A size bigger would have made the fit look unatural and loose.
3.0,Good sturdy watch. The problem I have with it is I expected the red would stand out more on the watch and in low light are very difficult to see the time. With brighter red color would be more helpful. Over all great watch.
3.0,My son loved it but it was so thin and fits weird… very long and very slim. My son bought a different mask because the one it came with wasn’t very good. Just fabric.
3.0,These didn't fit so am donating it to  anyone who has a smaller head..
3.0,"I brought this dress for my daughter as costume and it was a little big. But I figure it's ok it's for a costume anyways. I had to by a petticoat for the dress through, just to fill it out and make it look like the picture. After washing the dress the flowers did fall out but I just sewed it back on. If you're looking for something of good quality this isn't the dress for that. It's pretty but not ball gown quality."
3.0,It’s a good leggings but it a little see through
3.0,This run really big . I order a small still feel like I'm swimming in it
3.0,"Lasted a whole 24hrs, but I didn't expect it to last too long for the price."
3.0,"Me gustó pero no me duró mucho , se me rompió muy rápido"
3.0,This is just ok for me. I didn’t like that this seamless material is on the thicker side. Also the shorts are SUPER long even on me at 5’10” and a little too tight around the hem so it digs a little into the thigh -  not a cute look. I have average/toned thighs so I think this is a design flaw.
3.0,"Ordered the medium size based on supplier's size chart in order to have an oversized fit.  While I love the design I had to return it as the medium size was likely mislabeled as it conformed to the measurements of the small size (I'm a 32-34DD/38&#34; bust measurement and it clung to my chest).  Reordered in a size large and took photos to show the true measurements of the large size as opposed to what the supplier's size chart says they should be.  The large fits much better, but none of the measurements for the medium or large I had received seem to match, so I would order up a size to get the oversized look as shown.  The fabric is  also not the same as that which was specified: 95% cotton/5% polyester, but is really 65%/35% , for both the medium and large sizes I had received, so it feels more like slinky bathing suit fabric or a heavier gauge workout top material but without much stretch."
3.0,"The sizing and comfort of the footbed are good, but the top part of the boot almost dug into the front of my ankle when I took each step. These didn't work out for me. The dual zippers and extra-wide size options are great, though."
3.0,"This shirt is comfortable. It fits relatively well. My only concerns are as follows. The back is slightly loose, and the fabric causes the shirt to ride up. The plastic seams do not bother me but may irritate some wearers.<br /><br />3 stars"
3.0,Didn't last the entire trip. A few of the pieces started to come apart.
3.0,I wish I would ordered a size less. They fit a little big. They are very comfortable though
3.0,I think run a little small just where the split beginned
3.0,"quality not as good as there were stray threads here and there. Otherwise, cute outfit."
3.0,"The quality is so-so and it is odd to adhere to the solider. Since I could not find anything else, this worked."
3.0,Makes my breast look smaller instead of bigger.
3.0,"This is a pretty cool little mala. The size is a little small, but the measurements are right on the label, so I don't have any right to complain. I just thought I'd give a few quick pieces of info for potential buyers.<br /><br />-Not sure if the turquoise is fake or just coated in something odd. Whatever the case is, I'm not in love with the feel of the beads. It's subtle, and for the price it's really not a major complaint.<br />-Might not be the best choice for actual use during meditation. Like I said, the size is a bit small, and there are a handful of oddly shaped (three sided twists) little silver beads mixed in with the turquoise ones. Stylistically, it might be fine for a bracelet or something like that, but running into them every twenty-eight repetitions is a little annoying. A quick crunch with a pair of needle nose pliers removed them, but just thought I'd let you know.<br />-Some of the beads came sort of . . . bound together. It's what initially made me think the turquoise might be fake, but now I'm thinking it may be some sort of sealant. No clue, but it did take a little doing to get them unstuck in the five-seven places they had bound together.<br />-The cord in the middle is the stretch elastic kind. It does seem relatively sturdy, but who knows how it will survive over time.<br /><br />All told, these are a solid choice for the price. They feel about how one would expect for seven-ish bucks after shipping. For about the same cost as the sandalwood ones, I'd say go for it if you like the style"
3.0,this item is very cute but I had to return it. It was much bigger than the size indicated
3.0,"Fit kinda high on my face, but my forehead gets plenty of protection from the sun lol"
3.0,"It was too hard to get an accurate sizing chart, even from the manufacturer. I returned them as I didn't want to go multiple cycles of returns to find the right fit."
3.0,Cute but don’t ever wash it.
3.0,I wear a size 8 shoe. The size estimate was for a small. It is very tight. I'm returned it and they sent me the next size  The fit was much better. However after a few months there holes in the bottom even though I've only worn them on a Matt 2x/week.<br /><br />According to manufacturer:<br />Small:  6 to 7 US Foot Size<br />Medium:  8 to 9 US Foot Size<br />Large/XL  10 to 11/12 US Foot Size
3.0,Too sparkly for my taste.
3.0,I am not crazy about how big the print is
3.0,Very cheaply made and small to be over priced at over  $40.
3.0,The outer/main short shell was ok but the inner tights were loose and of poor quality. These are lightweight and comfortable. The inner tights aren't tight enough based on the size bought.
3.0,If the neckline was lower I would have kept it
3.0,These shoes ran too short and were a little wide. They felt like they had very good support but the shoes were too short so I had to return them. As for the look of the shoe the leather is nice and soft but they do make you're feet look enormous.
3.0,"The look of the dress when worn is not very flattering.  The sizing is a bit smaller, and the color is lighter than what's shown."
3.0,I returned this bag as it was too small for my purposes.  Nothing wrong with the way it was made. It was fine. It just did not work got me.
3.0,This bag has a rougher texture than the bags I've ordered from Envirosax before.  It seems like the material is cheaper.  But I will see how it holds up.  My old bag is still going strong and I just ordered this for a different color (variety).
3.0,Ordered Black one but was not from this manufacter. Material seems little different and the length was much longer.  It was a better looking dress on than this Red one.
3.0,Has no stretch whatsoever. Does not fit over my boobs and i usually wear a medium in tops. That is the size i got so i was surprised when it was too small for my chest. :( Cute top for smaller boobs i guess. Hopefully I can adjust it because i would like to wear it.
3.0,They're nice for the price. But I wish I just bought one nice one instead of 5 crappy ones. Personal option though. Really plasticy.
3.0,"I loved this dress in the picture. It fit a little small, but that was not a problem. The reason I sent it back was because the colors didn’t look as vibrant as they did in the picture. They weren’t the same - very muted and grayish."
3.0,Ordered these glasses a while back and it took three weeks before I got fed up and called the company back. Culprit was USPS but they fulfilled the order immediately afterward. Kudos in fixing a problem but was less excited receiving the glasses afterward.
3.0,Super tiny and not as good quality as i though...<br />Chain has to be replaced for sure.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:64bdd853c8ef8351673f832a8f9a930e]] The length I could fix by wearing heels.  The fit was good in the thighs and waist. And the wide flowing legs were comfortable and flsttering.<br /><br />But I have no idea what was going on with the lower belly material!  There was SO MUCH extra.  It wasn't needed for the ""wide leg"" purpose because it puckered at my hip crease.  Even with my hands in the pockets, there was enough extra material to pull out like I had small wings on my lower belly/hip.  It was just weird!"
3.0,"WAY too small like by two sizes. The quality of the product is good, just buy a much larger size than you normally wear. Pretty upset that I won't be able to wear it."
3.0,"These look great on, but the sticker left a weird discoloration on the thigh. I'm hoping it comes off in the wash."
3.0,Onesie too small but overall plaid skirt fit normal.
3.0,"Super cute boots, but very cheaply made. The heel started to come unattached after one wear.<br />Great for a night, but if you're looking to wear on a regular basis save your money."
3.0,"Well made dress, nice fabric, but runs too large.  I ordered the large as meassurement chart suggested and it so big, I had to take it to the taylor to have it fixed.  She cut it a full size down, and took out a lot of thr flair out of the skirt.  It turned out really nice, but spent an extra $30 to have it fixed."
3.0,"These are only meh. For the price, they're not too bad, but they're not fantastic either. I have sports bras bought for the same price which I prefer. These work well enough for medium impact exercise, but have a lot of bounce when running. The colors are as pictured and they fit the body nicely (not too much bunching or pinching, in general things are where they should be). The fabric is clingy, burlap-like and almost abrasive (I would not want to constantly rub up against it during a run). However, it does cozy up snugly against curves. My only wish was it was a little snugger.<br /><br />My biggest complaints are:<br />- A swishing noise when the pads are installed. I have never had a sports bra swish like a windbreaker before, so it's a little troubling. These pads are removable and the noise significantly reduces when removed.<br />- The seams on the shoulder of the bras dig in and the bra becomes uncomfortable with extended wear (about 30-45 min. for me).<br /><br />For those looking for sizing information: I have a 32 in. band measurement, though I wear 34C bras regularly. I ordered medium which was recommended. They fit, but I wish they were snugger due to bounce during medium/high impact exercise. A small may have fit better."
3.0,as pictured but not long enough.
3.0,Very stylish looking watch let down by an erratic self-winding mechanism and a manual winding stem that was so awkwardly placed and difficult to use that I bruised the tip of my thumb trying to do so!
3.0,"Loved the price & color combo, but the clasps are not fully closed & slip off of some masks."
3.0,This is an adult size mask that is far too big for a child.
3.0,"These headbands are great for holding my hair back while I'm putting on my make-up, brushing my teeth, or cooking dinner. My head is tiny and the headband tends to fall off and needs to be repositioned frequently, but I'm sure that's because my head is comparable to the size of a child's head. Because of this, I wouldn't necessarily wear them while working out."
3.0,"Fan of the design, but it’s pretty small. Length and width are about 10 in (I should’ve read the description). Water bottle for reference. It sadly does not fit any sort of bottle on the sides, pockets are way to small. Zippers and hardware are on the cheaper side as well. Returned"
3.0,I just received this item and inspected it well and found 2 holes in the front part of the shirt.
3.0,"I GIVE IT 3 STARS ONLY BECAUSE I HAD TO ORDER IT THREE TIMES TO GET A SIZE TO FIT ME, I AM A MEDIUM AND HAD TO ORDER XXL FOR THE BUTTONS TO CLOSE..."
3.0,This tag is worth the money I paid for it but isn't anything special. I had to use zip ties to attached it to my suitcase because the strap that came with it was too small.
3.0,"I love the way they looked, just too large on my face.  I returned them."
3.0,Shirt is very nice.  Fit through shoulders was fine but for an XL sleeves are long enough for a medium.  Very disappointing.
3.0,"Gorgeous watch. I paid about $110.00 for it; and bought it more as a bit of bling for fun. Because he needed so many things, I didn't get an expensive designer watch, I compromised with this one. There were a lot of great reviews, but some that warned me that it wouldn't keep accurate time. A few minutes here or there wouldn't have been a big deal. He would wear it for special occasions where there would be lots of photos. But this things is off by hours a day. It is actually the worst watch I've ever purchased, in that regard, and that includes dollar store watches I bought over the years for children.<br /><br />It is beautiful -- has a clear back so you can see the mechanisms -- it looks very expensive. Nothing about it would have made us part with this watch, except for the fact that it is really just a bracelet. You could or would never be able to use it as a timepiece."
3.0,Like the wheels but wish it was also a regular bag like some of the others
3.0,"Missing a couple sizes, 2 of which I will need later to get back where I was, but great set to get started"
3.0,"I don't know what I was thinking, I've probably bought this dress on 3 separate occasions and it still doesn't fit. This time I even sized up and it still didn't fit my chest (38D) and was no longer than a shirt. I'm tall, sure, but this dress was cut so short! The material and color were great (mine was a peach color) but the fit leaves a lot to be desired."
3.0,Pattern looks like pajamas - not a look my husband likes for work.
3.0,The sleeve was torn (See pictures) the seller was ok did refund me but the fit was ok wouldn’t buy again a little loose in chest area.
3.0,"I was expecting the same sound quality as my issued sordins, granted a fraction of the cost but I still choose my old beat up GI sordins over my new civilian pair"
3.0,It is very flimsy and doesn't look anything like the picture.
3.0,"This top is totally not flattering on me whatsoever. I am 5' 120lbs and it's like a burlap sack on me. I got a Small. I'm a little big-chested so I was afraid to get the XS. The fabric is not super soft but I kind of like that because it doesn't wrinkle easily and it looks crisp, almost shiny. I think this is a unisex top honestly but it doesn't say that in the description. I didn't pay much for it so I can't really complain."
3.0,Good ness
3.0,Arrived very quickly! Set is cute but has a heavy chemical smell and is cheaply made. I don't believe it will hold up very well if washed.
3.0,This mask looks cool but you can’t wear it for too long because it’s gets too hot and stifling. I wish I could because it looks awesome and it has a unique design. The colors really pop but it’s too hot and confining.
3.0,Not true size. Almost completely see through
3.0,Poor quality and fits way small
3.0,These were cute but do NOT have a drawstring like in the photos. They feel like a spandex material.
3.0,"quality wood bead necklace,  attractive, stylish , I also like the style of links and the method of fastening them, the necklace appeared to be very sturdy.<br />I agree with one of the reviewers mentioned ""A little bit of the wiring sticks out it's like this plastic thing it stabs me in the neck sometimes"" , (this is what I don't like the most).<br />Also the biggest bead in my necklace has multiple visible scratches  (I have attached the photos here too).  I thought the biggest bead supposed to be the most beautiful bead and polished with care."
3.0,I like the material. It’s very see through. The stripes were off on the V. One side navy and the other side white. I may try to order a smaller size since I’m wearing it over swim wear.
3.0,"Definitely a cute item, ordered as a birthday gift."
3.0,"the snaps come apart very easy when taking off, put J&B weld inside snap to stop it from coming apart."
3.0,I ordered two of these pins & the packaging was for only one AND that box was smashed and useless. While I have no problems with the product per se the sloppy packaging was a disappointment. I’d imagine this is easily remedied.
3.0,I love the look of the shoe but these are a tight fit. I had to reorder the shoe to get a larger size. Just as others have reviewed they are a tight fit; very stiff. I have purchased many coach shoes in the past and have never had this problem but they were purchased from Macy's. I kept them but not sure I'll purchase off Amazon again. 🤷🏽‍♀️
3.0,"To play it safe, I ordered it 3 sizes too large and it just barely fits my 11 yr old."
3.0,Ethel look nice but two of the black stones were unstick when I received them
3.0,"I liked the style, but wanted it to the all the way around to front, because I like to have towel hanging. Also, don't like the adjustment the at neck.<br />Liked material, stitching is great! Have not tried in washer, but have cleaned with wet towel and seems it will clean easy enough. Not white any more, but washing machine may fix that."
3.0,"On the 1st day I wore it, a stone fell out.  Pretty though"
3.0,Size good but the straps are hard plastic and hurt the top of my foot after walking in them for just an hour or two
3.0,"When I ordered these, the listing said they were athletic cushioned socks.  I would not consider these thick enough to be athletic style socks, or cushioned socks, at all.<br /><br />The fabric is comfortable but fairly thin.  They are also quite small.  After they were washed and became even smaller, I thought “Oh no! I’ll have to give these to the 8yr old now!”  I could get my size 7 shoe size foot in them, and I think maybe a size 8 shoe foot could squeeze into them, but they aren’t made for large feet, for sure.<br /><br />If they were marketed as thin, soft, bamboo socks for people with smaller feet, then they’d get more stars, but because they were supposed to be athletic sports cushioned socks and weren’t, I’m giving them lower stars.  I needed athletic thickness socks.  I'm bummed that these aren’t.<br /><br />Plus, there are a few thread ends coming out of the foot of the sock.  Maybe they won’t ever pull or unravel in the wash, but it’s a worrisome feature."
3.0,"Excellent product, eye catching and conversation piece..."
3.0,It was cute and has nice fabric. I wanted to yrade it for next size bigger but not available. Fits a lot smaller
3.0,"The skirt is cute. Its a nice shade of red. The fabric is polyester. It reminds me of something my grandmother would have worn. I like the style, though. It's perfect for my Halloween costume. I was hoping to add it to my regular wardrobe, but I just don't like the fabric."
3.0,"My daughter was not a fan of these while she was potty training. The front and back of these are very high and she's not comfortable when underwear/diapers cover her belly button. She also didn't like the feel of the plastic lining inside the underpants. For a kid who is less particular, these would probably work well in the initial stages of potty training. Overall, its best to just let them wear regular underpants and figure out how uncomfortable it is to be wet."
3.0,"The center front of any underwired bra should lie flat against the body. If it's not the bra is supposedly too small. I didn't feel like sending it back but I guess I should have. The bra is not comfortable to wear all day. The design is nice, fabric is breathable, doesn't show under my shirts. This is why I consider it okay. All my other bras are 32 G and fit nicely."
3.0,Decent pants. They run a little small but they worked pretty well for my Bane costume.
3.0,No real support for me.
3.0,They are cute shorts but run super small.
3.0,Needs to come with a chain though
3.0,They were great except my daughter grew out of them 2 weeks after I purchased them
3.0,"Really bright, runs huge. Made well, I should have gotten black."
3.0,"Our 10 year old daughter REALLY wanted this mini backpack, but was no longer available through Justice. It’s cute enough I suppose, a little flimsy, not as vibrant in color as the picture shows, and typical so, so quality of Justice, and way overpriced for what it is. I ordinarily wound NEVER have paid $50.00 for it, but sucked it up, since it was the most important thing she wanted on her very short Santa list. I don’t like how prices double at certain times, but I guess that’s the game of supply and demand. Merry Christmas :-)"
3.0,this looked to be around knee length or slightly above but it is not. it was at least 6 inches below the knee.
3.0,"The fit was fine, but the quality was lacking. It was super thin material. I wanted to wear it as a halloween costume, but it just wasn't as I had predicted. I am almost 6 feet tall and the length hit me in the middle of the knee."
3.0,Did like how thin the material was…
3.0,The length of the dress was a little longer than I thought it would be. Guess I should have measured twice. I will keep it on hand for a special themed event.
3.0,Nice enough dress...but I sent it back...I am 5&#34;10&#34; tall and many things do not fit me properly
3.0,"The design of these reminds me of something someone might wear to the beach or on a cruise. The material is nice and seems durable. The waist is the part that is odd to me. There isn’t elastic and the tie doesn’t seem to help with cinching the waist. Because of this, it is kind of awkward to wear."
3.0,"Its a very nice color and print, but it's cut as the most boring, typical tee-shirt. the neck is too small, sleeves are too wide and long, and long torso."
3.0,"Yes, you must size up. I wear large due to my bust glad I got the XL. The gown fits odd on my arms one side is loser than the other. I washed it on cold delicate and hung to dry."
3.0,I know the description said colors would vary but was disappointed. I assumed I would get one of each color. All in all not a terrible purchase.
3.0,"It's gorgeous but just don't sleep on it. Very painful. Also the length of the stem is too small for my  ear (might be different for other ears) and its hard to screw on the ball. Also, earring gets caught in your hair and can move around."
3.0,Good for the price but I left them in my car and the sun and/ or heat shrunk one down 3 sizes
3.0,"It is smaller capacity than I thought. Doesn’t hold a gallon of milk, it is too short.  Great for produce, eggs, cheese, butter which are smaller.  It also is great for heavy glass jars which tend to break through the grocery store plastic bags.  Easy to collapse and put together.  Zipper doesn’t seem sturdy,  the handles are great and seem well made."
3.0,"Product fit, but I didn't like it on me.  Gave it to my friend and she loved it."
3.0,Nice anklets but not made as well as we had hoped. My daughter bought them and a couple of them broke. Glad there was several in the pack though because of that.
3.0,There nice just too big
3.0,sleeve are too short and narrow
3.0,I liked the printed decoration. The size was smaller than I thought.
3.0,I liked the picture more than the actual outfit. The contrast in colors on the top didn't go with pants. I did like the pants with pockets.
3.0,"I didn't expect this to be the highest quality. But this hoodie is just not great. The fabric feels weird and the ribbons were frayed on the ends when I got them. I have sealed the ends with a lighter so they don't fray any more. But it doesn't have a nice clean end to it. Cheaply made. Not to mention it is rather small. I knew it was cropped, but I expected it to land maybe just above my belly button, but the bottom of it lands just under my bra line and the sleeves are too long to be considered 3/4 length sleeves, but too short to be considered full length on me"
3.0,"It looks like I shop at baby gap. Why is there such variation between mediums? Bugh, I'll wear it as an undershirt."
3.0,Thought hat was on the small side. But it’s cute
3.0,"PROS:<br /><br />-Solid construction.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-Items slide around way to easily on the inside pouches. Not a problem if you only have cash, but will be an issue if you're like me, and like to sneak in a plastic bottle opener and a key or 2.<br /><br />-At full capacity, a bit tough to close, especially if loose items in main pouch begin to slide around.<br /><br />-Not exactly cheap for such a minimalist wallet."
3.0,"Flattering head wraps, but they get too loose over time with regular wear.  I think they’re way overpriced for what they are."
3.0,Fits small I am 5'6 130 lb and its small on me. My 5'2 101 lb little girl took it so not a huge loss. Would buy again but up 2 sizes.
3.0,Cute rings but the four that are midi rings that sit above the knuckle fall off all the time and of course since they are cheap the rhinestones fall out but I'm not surprised.  I was wearing them almost every day though. Limiting the wear to only certain occasions would have made them last longer.
3.0,too small - gave to my mom and it fit her perfectly.<br />I normally wear a large with all outerwear and never have problems.<br />This product fit too small - felt more like a medium than a large
3.0,length is alot shorter then i expected.  covers most of what i needed
3.0,"Smaller than expected and not the same measurements as the other shirt of the same exact size and brand. But besides that it does look exactly as it should from the image, just smaller in size."
3.0,I bought this bracelet a year ago & for 6 months I loved it but then the clasp started coming open & I risk loosing not only the bracelet but my Fitbit as well. I still gave it 3 stars because I can’t find a Fitbit bracelet that I looks as great with my other bracelets. I cannot bring myself to buy another one & risk the clasp opening but I can’t buy a different bracelet because none look as nice. I wish I could fix the clasp of my favorite Fitbit bracelet ☹️
3.0,"Overall, I guess the belly padding itself was fine, but the strap around the back had the velcro on inside out, so it would not fasten.  Had to use safety pins to actually use the waist strap.  It just seemed like really rushed and really cheap manufacturing.  Once I had the pins in place, it worked well enough; I just expected a little more quality."
3.0,"While the dress is a flattering 1950s fit and flare (swing dress) it was poorly produced. The fabric is light weight and the seams in some areas are loose. The belt seams were unraveled and thread is hanging on the outside of the seam. I called Amazon customer service to see if the seller could send me a new belt, but the representative suggested I process a return. Unfortunately, I don't have the time. I have an event to attend on the weekend and this was my option. Luckily I know how to sew. However, the purpose of me buying something was so I wouldn't have to sew. I suggest that the manufacture invest in quality production. Just because its a ready to wear fashion doesn't mean it has to lack in quality."
3.0,"Washed, dyed, steamed and still can't manage to get the wrinkles out, which makes me sad because otherwise it would be exactly what I wanted."
3.0,I agree with the other reviewers that the quality is great. Thick and not see through but… why does it have a thin band inside of the waist band? 😩. That was such a deal breaker for me that I had to return in. It would be perfect if that was left out.
3.0,"Product arrived on time, it’s cute but material is thin. I don’t think it will last very long but it will be cute for photos!"
3.0,These shorts were not sized properly.
3.0,"This kimono smelled absolutely horrid upon opening and fit strangely. The body was flowy large, but the collar/yoke is double layered and heavier weight so it pulled backward off my shoulders giving the whole kimono an awkward feel. This had to go back."
3.0,Expected the size to fit an average sized person.  It doesn't.  Made for a very tiny person.  Color and printed design true to how it is shown in ad.
3.0,"Plastic, very cheap looking."
3.0,Runs small and very low cut
3.0,See through. Not very thick so your under wear shows through.
3.0,"I really wanted to like the dress, however, the sleeves are elastic band, not as the appear to be on the picture. The fabric seems a bit on the cheaper side and it is extremely thin.<br />Perhaps it's my body type, but it is very unflattering. Typically, I am a medium-large, so I went with medium."
3.0,The ring I purchased was a size 5. The ring I received was at least a size 8. Way to big but I'm not going to bother sending it back. Not worth my time. The ring is pretty and I can kind of get it to fit on my middle finger.
3.0,"The watch is very pretty,  just as pictured,  however it doesn't work,  very disappointed,  I gave it as a gift, and was a bit embarrassed when they tried it on and the battery was dead."
3.0,"The material is OK for the price paid. I have to say that I was pretty satisfied when I first saw the dress, it was as long as I wanted it and seemed like it would fit good too. I washed it before trying it on and the color did not fade but it did change a little, the white part of it."
3.0,Really like these bands however my Apple Watch is 42mm. I ordered the correct size (42-44) but when it came it was way too big. Returned and reordered in 38-40mm. Fits great!
3.0,"This is a soft, pretty wrap. The embroidery is very nice and the fabric is soft.<br />However, as other reviewers have noted, this item IS NOT made of fine wool, as the post has advertised.<br />I ordered it, because the post stated it was made of fine wool, so I'm very sad about this.<br />I do not expect that the material it is made of will last long like wool does, because it feels as though it is apt to pill and snag easily. I also do not expect that this wrap will launder well.<br />I hope you find this review helpful."
3.0,It was great then it started to break on its own after a month or two
3.0,Inside pocket smaller than I would like...but all in all great.
3.0,It was the wrong color it really  cheap
3.0,"The slit is extreme, I had to use fabric glue and a couple stitches to not show too much when sitting down. Other than that, I really love the style."
3.0,Did not provide any pain relief and caught on things
3.0,"Fabric is pretty itchy. Plastic boning on the sides has buckled and pooches out away from my body after my first wearing of the bra. Plastic boning under the cups pokes inwards and also does not lay flat, even when bra is hooked on a slightly-too-loose set of hooks."
3.0,"I returned this top. It is described as a sweatshirt, but the fabric isn’t fleece at all. It has a slick, weird texture that didn’t appeal to me at all.  I tried it on briefly and bagged it up for return."
3.0,very high waisted and very thin. They are more like a comfortable pair of tights than leggings. I could not imagine running in these.
3.0,"The toes are very wide, and the ankle strap is useless. These basically fell right off my daughters feet."
3.0,"This runs a little small, but is good if you aren’t too busty. Not sure I would order again because it looks tight."
3.0,Really small balls
3.0,"We bought this product for Halloween and when it arrived it was huge and had to be returned. I also didn’t care for the material, the white had pink in it."
3.0,"Too snug, will be returning for a larger size."
3.0,"Very small, they are ok"
3.0,"Very good sunglasses for the price. I bought these with the hopes of making them prescription sunglasses, but my optometrist couldn't remove the lenses without damaging the wire frames.  Looks like they are soldered in for good. Still, all in all, a good deal."
3.0,Love the quality they are a little thick remind me more of belly button rings but do have a variety in length.
3.0,Looks fine. They are very thin and the back pocket is annoyingly small. Can’t fit wallet. Comfy around the house but not great for leaving the house.
3.0,"Pretty but more off white in color. Also, very see thru"
3.0,"Really tight up top, but decided to keep it anyway."
3.0,"Not as soft as it was described, and the lettering is a little stiff feeling through the shirt, overall good shirt, tpok longer than 2 days to arrive like it was supposed to."
3.0,"Not a tight fit, kind of baggy. not worth returning, but will not wear as intended, only as sleep wear"
3.0,"The sunglasses are cute, but did not come with the elastic strap (or pouch) as it states in the item description.<br /><br />Disappointed since the strap is why i bought this pair."
3.0,"Material is very thin. It is a casual dress, nothing fancy."
3.0,It was cute but a little expensive for what it was.
3.0,"I got this as a replacement band for my CA-53W calculator watch, which I don't wear all the time, but use occasionally.  The original band developed a lengthwise tear between two of the notches after I'd had it for several years.  I'll make sure not to overtighten this one on my wrist and see if lasts better.<br /><br />Yes, it seems a bit flimsy, but that's how the bands on these low end Casios are.  If not abused, it should be okay.  That would only bring it down to four stars.  I'll make it three stars because it didn't include replacement spring bars for mounting on a watch.  Not a problem for me, as the old ones are still good, but I think that a lot o people who order a replacement band would expect these to be included, and might be missing one or both of the old ones.  You can order these separately, but I don't think you should need to."
3.0,Too big. Better for a big sunglasses!
3.0,Fit well and was comfortable but the gathered bottom does not hang free and tended to pouch out making it look like I had a bloated belly or was pregnant. Not the look I was aiming for.  Would not buy it again
3.0,"I've heard alot of concerns from black people thinking it'll show on their skin and it does but really isn't visible . IT WORKS FOR EYEBROWS, I also read alot of review's saying that this isn't flexible enough for eyebrow ring and for me it works just fine . It is curved and has no problem going in the only concern is that the small part or ""back"" for it is so tiny I can't get it on people said theirs fall off and I can't even get it on, so I have to be cautious when sleeping or washing my face . But all in all if you're like me and just wearing at work then you'll be fine . I'm glad I got these so I can stop hearing people's mouths.. it's not totally invisible but does the trick"
3.0,"These t-shirts were too small and tight fitting,  they don't stretch much."
3.0,"I Developed a rash. At first I thought it was my new watch band I put these on with, but it was these metal pieces touching my skin that caused the reaction. Also after the first wear they started to tarnish."
3.0,Very tiny for the most e.g..
3.0,Great product & good quality; the bottom of the shorts was tight around my quads and hamstrings. I wish I could just keep the top because it’s so cute!
3.0,It's a little on the small size for me. I'm 6 ft. 160 pds.
3.0,Cute fit but very thin ribbed material so I returned it<br />I got one similar in black (not ribbed material) and I love it.
3.0,"This is sized small, even considering the sizing measurements provided. There's also no stretch to the fabric. For better or worse, the fabric has millions of ""breathing holes"". It's pure polyester, so hopefully the holes will help prevent the funk."
3.0,I was not disappointed.  The shorts were cheap and in my opinion I got what was expected at this price. They fit and not too tight around the legs.  Thin material but worth the money.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:7b3e1e0e36496b144c3fec8653474ffe]] It’s definitely long and fits about 3 inches above my knee in height. I’m unfortunately not keeping it despite it looking cute because I do not like the material of this sweater/blazer/jacket thing. It’s kind of like a almost plastic me thin material. This is definitely one of those oversized but not TOO oversized types… but the arms do run small so the arms were tight on me despite ordering a medium when I am a medium.
3.0,"I wear size XXL in shirts. Every once in a while, the manufacturer sizes run small as is the case here. Too bad, I really liked the design."
3.0,This silver ring of course fades easily which is super upsetting but the over all quality is okay
3.0,"very disappointed...not like the pic shows with the glow.  I opened the locket and it looks like a dab of glue was put in the locket - not how its shown to be smooth and nice all over.  I'll keep because its nice and it was cheap, but that's it."
3.0,It is 3/4 sleeves! Not long sleeves! Fit somewhat small. If you want it to fit like the picture order a size bigger.
3.0,"They are not very firm and I don't actually notice any tummy control.  They are not fitted very well around the crotch area, so they always feel like panty-hose that you couldn't get pulled up all the way.  They are like a knit material and not 'slippery' as with other garments like this. If you were to wear these under your dresses or pants, your clothes would most likely stick to them, as they are not smooth. As just using them as bike shorts, I think they would climb up the leg. I kept pulling mine down at the knee as I was wearing them all day yesterday."
3.0,"I like the t-shirt, but because it's not of good quality, it runs small.  It's still a nice shirt overall."
3.0,Looks cheaply made.
3.0,"Should have ordered a larger size but didn't exchange cause the ol lady wanted to keep them. She says they're comfortable and makes good ""house shorts"""
3.0,Does not feel original. Big difference between the OEM and this one. It has not got the same touch/material as the OEM one.<br /><br />But it looks like it does the purpose.
3.0,It's ok. Tells time. No real complaints. But there's better looking watches on Amazon for the same price.
3.0,"These leggings are really comfortable, but they don’t really add support anywhere except the upper waist, which just accentuates the lower belly.  The support seems to be in the wrong place, and if you’re insecure about belly fat these might not be your favorite workout pants."
3.0,Sizing is way off. I ordered twice and still it’s too big. Other than that it’s fine.
3.0,The earth badge's colors aren't accurate. Nice quality and cool box though!
3.0,I liked the product however it was somewhat too large. I should have ordered one size smaller! Thanks anyway I will still wear them! Dina
3.0,"Too loose for younger kids, no ability to tighten. Cute designs."
3.0,These are very cute and they have a decent stretch to the them. They are however too small. I have a 31&#34; waist and a 40&#34; hip and normally wear a ladies size 10/medium. I bought the mediums and they are too tight. I will be returning them and trying out the large to see if that helps
3.0,I got a xl it's too tight at bottom kinda big at top  but kute
3.0,"These briefs run true to size and wash well. The problem is that the material is so thin that I can almost see through it.  I suppose this would be acceptable in the warmer seasons; however, they’re not great cold weather underwear."
3.0,These are very pretty but not the best on the ears. I LOVE mariell earrings I have a couple pairs but these are so large they stick out from the ears. I would pass on this one and go for a different style from mariell. You won’t be sad with the quality they just aren’t the best they have.
3.0,Great quality but a little bit large'_'
3.0,it fits pretty small but it got into it it fits snuggle you should order at least two size bigger but makes you sweat it's not that bad I had to get a x large n I'm a size 6 buy fits well an it don't rook up which is the beat
3.0,"These heels are slippery, my daughter slips all the time. Also the jewels on shoes fell off instantly, like 2 days in. They’re small, tight. My daughter wears a size 9 and has slim feet and they fit tight (she is 2yo)<br />I would not buy this again because of poor quality."
3.0,"Cheap.  Work well, but break easily.  Fun for a kids party or something!"
3.0,"Very high cut , little Coverage on the back side! Passing is nice and I love the design!"
3.0,"The shoes are a little disappointing. The concept is great and attractive, but the proportions and shape are a little odd. I'm not so sure about having that much of my dress socks exposed.<br /><br />Aside from that it's very soft and comfortable. What it lacks in aesthetic appeal in first-person, it makes up for in sheer comfort which makes it worth it for me."
3.0,"These are super cute. I'm super bummed that I did decide to size up due to reviews. Even when wearing thin socks, way too small. I wear a 8, ordered a 9, & should've ordered a 10. Ugh!"
3.0,"Frame is a little loose, which causes them to slip down a bit."
3.0,Buttons not sewn right and does not close properly
3.0,It's a nice ring but I ordered it a little too big and it's a little too wide for me.
3.0,These look nice for layering but the material feels very thin and cheap. It feels like it could tear easily if you’re not careful.
3.0,To small for bust
3.0,Stuck to my body.
3.0,"Too tight in the legs and bust area. I am a D cup and a U.S. size 14. I have purchased about 6 different rompers, all coming from overseas, and unfortunately, none have fit. Even after exchanging for larger sizes<br /> Won't purchase anymore. NOT for larger, curvier or bustier women. Might work for petite women"
3.0,"the boxers are nice, but they are not true to size based on the size chart."
3.0,one application hardly makes a difference.
3.0,"Very cute, but if your baby has pudgy feet, dont expect the elastic to fit."
3.0,It would have been nice for the hat to have been mailed in a box instead of a USPS bag. The hat has to be really worked since it arrived in a ball shape.
3.0,it rattles and bugs me when it does.
3.0,Fits great but the color is a lot lighter than pictured.
3.0,"Top fits small, you are able to adjust to band but the straps are too short"
3.0,"This glasses works well for preventing on coming night glare, especially from those individuals that refuse to turn-off their high beam lights..."
3.0,"So, I have a similar problem to reviewer X, these simply fit me like any old leggings, with absolutely no compression to them whatsoever. I have workout leggings that are tighter.<br />I'm 5'6"" and a 4 in most bottoms, sometimes a 6, so I ordered a small, and they don't work. Unfortunately there is no XS to size down to, so if you are anything around my size or smaller these are sadly not for you.<br />I gave them a 3 because if these are a size that works for you they are nice fabric. Its woven and very soft compared to other compression stocking. The ankles also felt very comfortable.<br />These did look opaque on me, but then again they were too loose."
3.0,"It’s a cool costume but needs a belt because it does not curve with the spine at all, which isn’t flattering on any body."
3.0,More of a bubblegum pink than a redwood. Top part (across chest) is also structured slightly different.<br />Fits ok but Will be returning.
3.0,This top was a lot longer then it looks in the photo & the trim around the top half of the top does not stay folded down n the back; I am thinking about sewing it so it stays down.
3.0,"They're stretchy and comfortable, but I am not impressed by the quality since my pair ripped after the first wash and I don't abuse them."
3.0,The only thing I dislike is how stiff they are. I really thought they would be more silky and they’re not. The color is super cute though!
3.0,"Cute very light, the cross can be easily bent chains easily tangles, but for the price I enjoyed it while it last."
3.0,"The dress fits as expected. Fabric is light, wear a slip because it is a thin fabric. Not too bad. I needed it for a wedding, the color is what is important. Will do for a night. It’s what you pay for."
3.0,"Es muy bonito pero , si quieres hacer una palabra con 2 sílabas iguales no puedes ya que es un solo abecedario"
3.0,"Item fits nicely but poorly stitched, sent it back for a refund will reorder in hopes of a better one."
3.0,Cute but short. Ok material. I’m 5’4/5’5 130 lbs and have 36D chest.
3.0,"Item came as described. I bought these to use the balls off of them as my bar that I got pierced with is titanium, but the balls that I had were not & turned green. Only one is able to be screwed of so I have 2 different balls on my bar, which isn’t the end of the wold but kind of annoying. That’s the reason I’m giving it 3 stars."
3.0,didn't like the chain I thought it would be more!!!
3.0,Didn't particularly care for this top. It had a weird fit.
3.0,Pretty suit but I would suggest sizing up. Two sizes if not three.
3.0,"If you are looking for actual shapewear and tummy control/smoothing, keep looking! Based on reviews on tons of other types of “bodysuits/shapewear” I decided to order a Medium in this.<br /><br />I range from Large to XXL in tops, Large-XL in bottoms. It does fit, however, there is no smoothing or tummy control. I wear a 40DD and although it fits over the girls, the thin straps can easily cut in and make all day wear annoying. I received this in the beige, it looks as expected and NOT a thong, although it’s mentioned in the title. The pictures included on the stock photos are mostly accurate: color, straps, brief bottom. Not bad for the price."
3.0,"I would say this round about one size small, and the zippers a little rough to use but overall for the price it’s OK"
3.0,"Nice material ,but man are they fight usually all my orders run to large and I wish that I had ordered smaller but not this. Stitching on front leg is frayed."
3.0,Nice dress but it’s way too long
3.0,"Material is scratchy, very tight at the bottom and too large on top.  Just an odd fit overall"
3.0,"It's a beautiful bracelet, but  it has to be returned. It must be made for a 10 yr old since I can not fit it over my fingers to put on. Either there is a trick to loosen or that is the way it is made. I really wanted to keep the bracelet when i first opened the box. But unfortunately I will be returning."
3.0,"This is a cute skirt however, the color was a little darker than I thought it would be and the waist just doesn't fit quite right. I ended up returning it."
3.0,Color was gold not rose gold as promised.
3.0,Side opening a bit difficult for me. I returned it.
3.0,Like them and are comfortable but like I said I wear a 9 and 1/2 size larger would have been better.
3.0,Nice design. I ordered smaller due to similar reviews but still too big.
3.0,"Liked the material and fit, but the design emphasizes the crotch in the front.  I don't feel comfortable to wear it in public ..."
3.0,Such a cute and sweet Keychain. Husband loved but as kinda predicted/expected with a hands on working man bobber fell off. Sadly sooner than expected less than 2 weeks.
3.0,"Looks super cute when you wear it and love the pocket factor. However, be careful while washing it, It bleeds color like no other!! It was smaller than expected in terms of tightness, it’s more of a 2.5 star rating"
3.0,Eh. It's not the worst thing I've ever bought online but I was definitely disappointed. Not the same colors as the picture and not the same fabric. I'll still wear it but i was over excited about this dress and it was kind of a let down. Won't be buying from this seller again.
3.0,"It was a lot more floppy than I thought,  not as structured so when you tried to put it on your shoulder it kind of flopped all over. Not as it appeared"
3.0,The top fit amazing. I'm mostly a size small and I read the comments saying so so I ordered a size bigger and the bottoms were really small and fit like a thong so I'm going to have to buy a different bottom.
3.0,I don;t like the fabric - it's not soft enough
3.0,It came missing the white shirt luckily I have one but was disappointed with that other sis e this is a great purchase
3.0,"They're cute and seem well made. The case was an added bonus. I ended up returning them though, because they are way too small for my face. Made for tiny faced people or kids/teens"
3.0,"Like other folks have said on here, the post are way too long. I can only wear them to my full time job since we hardly ever use the phones. Otherwise, they look nice."
3.0,It's too big. Bigger than the photo. Disappointed
3.0,I like the pocket because I use it all the time. I dont like the way the sleeves fit at the wrist  I'm a petite but even the mall was too short.
3.0,Light transparent fabric
3.0,Does not look like a good quality.
3.0,Ordered 8-9 women's/7-8 men's. Received something comparable to men's 10-11<br />But it was comfy though. too bad the sizing was way off
3.0,"Kind of tight for a 3X, but if meets my needs."
3.0,"Got these guys, loved em for a few weeks hard like. Never really took them out too often other than to clean. But after a while the luster wore off and now is very very dull. Embarrassed to wear them now. I may try to polish them again with a Dremel but I doubt it's worth it."
3.0,"OK for the price, but cheap looking close up"
3.0,Shorts are OK but  the description was slightly misleading. It said material was cotton. The description should have been 60% polyester and 40% cotton.
3.0,Great fabric but runs small
3.0,Leaks from the filler hole. This product needs a nylon washer around the inside of the filler cap to properly seal the water bladder. Other construction seems strong. Comfortable fit on your back.I notified seller of the issues and they gave me a full refund.
3.0,It should have wrapped more around my body. It was narrower than I wanted
3.0,The slits in the shorts are kinda high and you can see through the side so I advise.wearing them with panties or just at night. Unless you dont care bout that sort of thing. Other than that the set is fab.
3.0,"These are well what I thought decent pajamas for the wife. They are warm and actually very soft and look cute on her but the fabric is of subpar quality.  Already had to stitch the seams on both sleeves and now the pocket is starting to come undone. Quite disappointing, but I guess you definitely get what you pay for."
3.0,It fit a bit too slim for what I like. I got an XL and it fits great for length and roomy arms.  Wish it was not so narrow in the chest area.
3.0,"The zipper on the jacket was broken! I chose not to believe the previous reviews. Keep that in mind, unless you don’t care to zip up your top while wearing it."
3.0,More see through than advertised. I used it for a costume and it worked fine but I'm not sure if I'll get more use out of it.
3.0,"I knew this would be cheaply made but wow, it’s beyond cheap. Very awkward fit also the arms have no shoulder space."
3.0,It was difficult to open due to tightness of hinge.  No clasp to help open it.  Larger than what I had expected.
3.0,These run small for a 4X.  Would say the 4X size is equivalent between a standard 1X-2X.
3.0,"hate to pay for them to be hemmed after they costs so much, but if you are a petite these will definitely need to be hemmed!"
3.0,"No complaints about the watch, everything works great and looks nice. I love wearing it every day. Though mine came with some scratching on the screen"
3.0,The length of the sweater (short) disappointed me for what I payed for it. I can use it as a gift for someone else rather than return it.
3.0,"I purchased this for my 2nd grader she likes it, but the lights in it has fallen out"
3.0,the material its too thing...but its ok for the price
3.0,"I have no idea how these people got a license from Disney. The design is cute, but poorly applied. The fit want NEARLY as advertised. Given what arrived, I'd guess they put an XL on a girl that wears a size 2-4. Good thing I'm only wearing this around the house, but I'm afraid to wash it lest the decal peel off."
3.0,This scarf is nice n warm n the color is great too. My only problem was that I only wore it once n had to put it away as it has alot of thread like furs that triggered my sinuses. Love it n wish I could wear it as planned.
3.0,They fog don’t kid us.
3.0,Belt is too short for the listed waist size. I suggest getting the next size up.
3.0,Soo so so cute but way too small even though I followed the size chart
3.0,"What shows up is not anything like the images shown. The images look like a thick, soft pant. The product is super thin. Also, the zipper pockets don’t fit more than a set of keys and the cargo pockets don’t have a closure. You’ll have a tough time taking your wallet or iPhone with you, unless you leave them in your open, flap-covered-only, cargo pockets.<br />Just a heads up. The images you see are not what you’ll get. I was so excited to have found these but I am super let down."
3.0,No me vino la talla q solicite. Pedí talla 8 y me llegó en talla 9. No puedo devolver porque estoy en Ecuador
3.0,Like them but one of the CG decals is missing on the side
3.0,It could’ve been a little bigger but it was last minute.
3.0,"Bought this for a neighbor as a birthday gift; it seems to run small/short, but will look cute with some leggings under it."
3.0,"I bought a large sized brown hat from this maker with a different stitched design and I loved it. It fit so well, I decided to buy a green one in the same size only a few days later. This one is much looser and will blow off my head with a slight breeze. I might ask a local seamstress to sew a sweat strip in front so it helps with the loose fit and also helps in the summer months with moisture. The hat LOOKS amazing. It's so nice. It's the sizing that's the issue."
3.0,Love the color very big and clunky but I don’t like the back of them
3.0,"This bracelet is pretty and I like it a lot but unfortunately it is not entirely fair to the solar system. It has the Earth's Moon on it but it does not include all of the other moons of the solar system. Also, the stone representing Mercury is larger than the stone representing Mars. However, in real life Mars is larger than Mercury. The other three gas planets, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune also have rings, not just Saturn. They are not as well known but they are there. Another major feature, though not strictly needed in this bracelet, is the Astroid Belt, a group of asteroids and dearf planets between Mars and Jupiter. Overall, this bracelet is nice and works as a representation of the solar system but could use improvement. One change I would definitely make is to get rid of the Earth's Moon if you are not going to include the other moons in the solar system."
3.0,It's lovely and it's fun to wear especially if the weather is hot
3.0,"I would have like a little bigger, the shirt is a little tight"
3.0,"My son lkes the style, though was disappointed it as not as slim as expected.  He ordered a medium as he heard it ran small.  He's tall and slim.  It fits a lot looser than the picture.  However, he really doesn't mind since he plans to layer with a tshirt underneath.  Also, there were some loose threads and both pockets needed to be re-stitched.  However, the seller was very kind and issued a $5 credit and that makes up for the defect."
3.0,The bras are very nice and look great on. They fit very nice Except the straps are way to long. Tighten them all the way and still need to be tighten more
3.0,They run smaller then normal. So order a size larger. I can wear them but they are tight and make me feel like I'm wearing a girdle. Other wise the material is great. I loved the feel of it.
3.0,"If you are looking for a dress, this is probably not a good idea...it is super thin and the center part is right at the goods lol. I am 5'8&#34; and 130 lbs and purchased a small. I plan on keeping it to wear with skinny jeans...as a top it is adorable:)"
3.0,This shirt was a nice quality for the price point but not flattering on a large chest. I felt like it just hung off my body and didn’t do anything for me.
3.0,"After reading several other reviews, I bought the size XXXL even though I would normally wear a woman's size 18.  The tag on the swimsuit actually says that it's size 18, and it did fit well.<br /><br />I read several other reviews that mentioned something weird about the &#34;bra&#34; insert, and I have to agree that it seems to be too low.  The way that it is sewn into place makes it impossible to &#34;re-situate&#34; it, but I am a short person, so it kind of worked out for me.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it is a pain to get into the swimsuit since you're basically putting your entire body through what ends up being the neck opening at the top.<br /><br />I bought the one with plans to buy more in other colors if I liked it, but did not like it enough to purchase any others."
3.0,"Material is thin and shiny which is ok, but there are lines in the material and the floral is sparse. The cut and style are cute, just the print and material are less than appealing."
3.0,"I was so excited to receive this dress when I ordered it. The color is beautiful, the fabric feels good, and the skirt lays nicely. The straps are not adjustable though and were too short for me, this resulted in the back of the dress creeping up too high for my taste (I am 5'8 for reference). I'm not particularly skinny, but I do have a small waist, and the waist on this dress just wasn't fitted enough for my liking. There was easily 3+ inches of extra fabric there. It didn't look bad per-say, but it wasn't how I wanted it to fit. I will probably order a size down in a brand that has the same style dress but with adjustable straps."
3.0,They are definitely NOT child size but the look was perfect for the old lady costume. We had to add a strap to make them stay on our 20 month old.
3.0,"Ordered a large but it was way too short and tight. Never got a chance to wear, but probably would only wear the top."
3.0,"Yes they keep your hands warm, but you still need to take them off to text or open your smart phone with your fingers, bummer..."
3.0,Very pretty but way smaller than what expected.
3.0,"This is definitely not what I expected. I thought this tank would be t-shirt material, but it’s not. It’s a waffle weave material, it’s pretty weighty, & it hangs super weird. I really wanted to like it, but I just can’t. Oh well, you live & you learn!🤠"
3.0,Does not offer a lot of support. Fits well and is comfortable
3.0,They are nice enough. The label says yellow gold which is what I ordered. Looks more rose.
3.0,I like the charms but the necklace broke the same night at a housewarming dinner. Thankfully I had an old necklace in my jewelry box.
3.0,Got a large for my skinny 10 year old. Very tight.
3.0,I really like this shirt but there’s one issue. The left sleeve is shorter than the right. Not by a little either. The right one goes up to my hand and the left one is like a whole cuff shorter.<br />Other wise the fit is good. I did have to size up to a large since it seems to run a little small.
3.0,"I have big fingers and the buttons are small so it is difficult to button, One pocket is not enough."
3.0,"Does it's job, but cheap quality."
3.0,"I ordered a Large thinking I would rather have my seamstress take it in than have it too tight. According to the on site measurement chart and my measurements, it should have fit. It fit everywhere except across the hips. My sweetie and I are ballroom dancers. He has a pair of trousers in the exact same pattern so I wanted to match with a dress. Although he loved the way it looked, it would not have provided the freedom I needed to move on the dance floor. I returned the dress and am considering an XL knowing I will have to have it tailored."
3.0,Good material but very snug. Hard to move in. Would recommend this dress for pictures but not for any kind of dance or event where you move around a lot. The color is also a very dark red-- almost brown. Not my favorite.
3.0,"I tried them on yesterday and found them to be to tight. I 'do' have a very wide foot [11.5 3x wide] from bunyons, so it doesn't surprise me. My feet get cold all the time in winter months, so I was hoping for a product like this. If we have a shoe stretcher, that might help.... I'm interested in the design concept though. I think the product has merit. I wish you the best in future development."
3.0,The actual bathing suit fit but the skirt could barely wrap around
3.0,"Gave me wrong color, picture shows silver I received rose or copper color."
3.0,"The pants are kind of water resistant but not waterproof. I hiked behind a waterfall and I got pretty soaked. The water soaked through these pants and also soaked the fleece leggings I wore underneath, however it does dry very fast."
3.0,I bought this for my son and he seems to be happy with it. I wish I bought the darker color bag as the green stains easily.
3.0,"I love the color, the length, the feel . . . but the velcro? It's the most bizarre velcro I've ever seen - more like sandpaper - wide, rough, and if it gets near the material, it's very difficult to unhook it. Don't think I would buy it again because of that."
3.0,"I bought this watch after I had a good experience purchasing jedir's pilot style watch. That watch was great. Is watch... it's okay... not great. I like the strap quite a bit, it seems of better quality than most at this price point. The watch itself, the metal feels a bit cheap, and the secondary Chronograph function knobs are really hard to the push. You almost don't know if they will break or work. But the watch does look like and is proportioned well. Nice coin edge style bezel."
3.0,"Great product, but price is easy to high."
3.0,The jewel on top of the purse snap is off. Going to have to Super Glue it back into the hole.
3.0,It’s fitted on my 15 month old. Definitely needs more accurate sizing.
3.0,Pros: It doesn't feel fake and it's super soft. It was package well too.<br />Cons: The net is VISIBLE which is kind of a bummer. And yes the curls gets tangled very easily.
3.0,"Small fit, I expected for it to be a little bigger"
3.0,"Arrived on time, Nice packaging.<br />But it is too big on my neck even though I am a big person.<br />It is not comfortable.<br />I like it by the way.<br />I am keeping it."
3.0,I bought these in hopes the lenses wouldn't be Too large for my small face but unfortunately they're too big. The search continues. You get what you pay for definitely.  Loved the color choice.
3.0,Very cute! The material is not high quality but for the price it's okay and still wearable.
3.0,They're cute but they are very lightweight and the gold finish in some areas is not even/peeling. They're a cute costume piece but I would not get my prescription lenses put in them.
3.0,"Cute, but be sure on the size. My daughter wears a medium in street clothes so she just ordered a medium. Suit runs a bit small."
3.0,Most of the reviews said to order a larger size but this was huge. I would say it’s true to size.
3.0,Runs small and the strap doesn't stay attached very well
3.0,Fabric and color nice. Right length on my 51 frame. Tight around stomach will need shape wear.
3.0,I'm busty and will have to wear with a tank . Does not wrap around if you are on the bigger side . I am a size large and ordered XL and still fits small . Will keep it and work with it. It is really cute and I love the colors.
3.0,"I liked that this bracelet had true Fleur-de-lis rather than imitations. My issue, however, is with the length of the strap. It could use at least one more length to be comfortable on a man's wrist. The current length has to be pulled snug against the wrist in order to properly buckle it to keep it from coming unbuckled and falling off. And quite honestly, the leather doesn't feel very durable. My current expectation is that it wont last long."
3.0,"this shirt is very cute but it was obviously cheaply made, its see-through... I think you could've gotten a better quality shirt from 5 below"
3.0,It is kind of too small
3.0,Looked really nice and didn't fate too quick
3.0,I tried both the Large and Extra Large.  I have a high instep and was unable to get either on.  They were too tight from the top of my foot to my heel.  Otherwise they seemed to be very good quality but I had to return both pairs.
3.0,I bought this to replace my tangerine band on my fitbit surge because it started cracking. It was harder to take the old one off then it was to put the new one on. It took me about 10 minutes to get the old one off.  I bought a teal one this time. The only difference is that it's not very pliable. It feels very stiff almost like its made of a hard plastic but for the price hopefully it will get more comfortable as I wear it. I had to put it on a bigger notch then what my old one was because it was too tight.
3.0,I bought this for my 8 year old granddaughter. The charm is cute but the chain broke after wearing for just a few hours. The chain is quite fragile for a child.
3.0,"Fabric and color are nice - as presented in pic. Kimono has a nice slip and weight.<br /><br />However, model is NOT plus size & her height?<br /><br />For plus size of average height, kimono is much shorter and does not meet in the middle. Fringe, which I love, is not knee length - front or back<br /><br />No time to return - use as light cover for sundress"
3.0,Awkward clip and was a bit heavy and clunky trying to wear so gave them to my sisters
3.0,"It's cute, but not a good quality dress by any means. Still...it's nice to throw in for a vacation. It's a bit shorter than expected  (I'm 5'6"") but again...good for a vacation dress!"
3.0,Shirt is too short in length but cute.
3.0,"The material was very very thin, and the quality is not what it said it was."
3.0,Nice dress but need to return
3.0,"Nice earrings, it took a very long time for delivery"
3.0,Ended up returning the shirt because it came with a ripped pocket but it was too small.
3.0,"I've been using this bag for months now, and I must say it has held up well... almost too well. It does what I want it to: carries all my cards and phone and change and cash. It's big enough to carry both my phone and my checkbook and the strap hooks are strong enough to attach my heavy key ring to. It does everything I ask it to with aplomb.<br /><br />And, yet... I've tried to convince myself that it's leather, but it's just not. It's vinyl backed with fabric. Very sturdy vinyl -- which I can't complain about. It just is a little *too shiny -- a little *too slick. The longer I have it the more embarrassed I am of it because it looks really cheap. Saying that makes me feel as if I'm betraying the poor thing which has been working so diligently for me, but there it is. It does everything I want, but I'm in the market for something a less plastic-y looking."
3.0,very small charms...useless to say the least...not happy
3.0,"The bag is spacious, nicely built, good material for the money just wish the color was more peachy. Otherwise nice purchase. I would buy from them again."
3.0,"Nice slacks, just a little smaller than I thought."
3.0,"I love the ear climber style, but I have had a real hard time finding ones that don't irritate my ears. I am allergic to nickel, and I thought hat 18kt gold plating would do the trick, but even these I can't wear for a whole day without my earlobes becoming inflamed. I am not very confident of the material that is under the plating, and I wonder if the plating is just not thick enough to prevent this from happening. It's a shame because these are simple, elegant and lovely rose gold earrings that are versatile and would be great to dress up or down - but I just can't wear them for a long time!"
3.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; and it was a little long, but I expect that from most clothes. I got it in white and was disappointed in two things. 1) The white cotton wrinkles immediately and is see through. 2) The sides aren't attached. So it's really a parka that you just slip over your head. However, other people might not be bothered by those features. If I got it again, I would get it in a color other than white."
3.0,Was nice and good quality till i put on and had no noise wire in them in the miss fit draw now should have returned them my bag
3.0,Im going to wash them to see if they fit better
3.0,It's ok quality. Looks exactly like picture. Better fit if you have more curves.
3.0,"Runs small, needed to return. No problems with returning.  Thanks"
3.0,"UPDATE......***** I still think this ring is very cute but I felt I should update this review to let you know that it did turn my finger green.*****<br /> I was pleasantly surprised when I received this ring.  It is so cute!  A really nice size, colorful and nicely made.  It is even nicer looking than the picture showed.  I am very pleased with purchase. 😇"
3.0,To see through even when wearing a bra.
3.0,The ring is mostly as described but just not very impressive. But what can you expect from so cheap of a ring.
3.0,"These headbands are soft and lightweight. But I find they do not stay on well when working out, or even just walking around normal. There is no grip to the headbands so they easily slide off smooth hair. Their absorbency is OK when sweating."
3.0,"This, and others I saw online, are quite beautiful--in my opinion.<br />However, it is very, very snug--tight--particularly in the bodice and bra line, and the body in general.<br />IF  you have ANY bulges, they will show.<br />I typically wear a size 14 or Large, and this dress fits... except as noted above.<br />I wear a 38B bra, sometimes 38C. This dress feels molded onto me.<br />Oh, yes, the fit on the arms is even tighter. Loose a few pounds, and firm up what left, and I am good to go.<br />All that said, this is quite a striking design and color :-)"
3.0,This tank fits shorter than I expected. It’s also very see through.
3.0,They’re okay for the price great sleeping. I do not recommend these for any high-impact sports or workouts.
3.0,"See through, needs lining."
3.0,"Had to return,  it was too small."
3.0,These earrings tarnish extremely fast
3.0,"The body, length looks great but the upper strap is really lose so side boob is ugly."
3.0,"Good material, but ran a bit small"
3.0,"It runs huge, had a bit of funny smell  to it"
3.0,I was disappointed as it’s a very thin shirt. I ordered the blue one and was really bummed that my bra was easily visible through the shirt. It’s a beautiful color but too thin for me. I’ll be returning it ☹️
3.0,"I liked it. But, I couldn't fit it. It was too small."
3.0,"They did what I needed them to do. They aren't the classiest, the most elegant, but their simple design is timeless, and they have held up pretty well given the price."
3.0,I bought these leggings to wear for errands etc. they were great! Flattering and comfortable. Definitely a dupe for my lulu lemon time to sweat crop leggings. Unfortunately I started working out and wearing them for less leisurely activity and they didn’t last. After a month of working out (rotating with other leggings) washing about once a week. They’re now splitting at the seam in the butt and they’re not staying up as well. The staying up could be because I’ve lost weight though. Overall I’m trying to decide if it’s worth purchasing another pair of these or coughing up the cash for the Lululemon counterpart.
3.0,"While these gloves seemed well made and were very soft, I had to return them. I ordered a small and the fit of the hand seemed right, however the fingers were too long. There was 1/4”-1/2” of extra length in each fingertip."
3.0,satisfied overall
3.0,"I think they fit very well, they’re very soft, but there is a problem with the crotch area. Regardless of the waistband being tied and pulled up as high as it’ll go, it tends to droop pretty often."
3.0,"Watch the sizing! Go larger than you think you need. Otherwise, the product was well made and very pretty."
3.0,"You get what you pay for with this.  The necklace will look nice for a wear or two, but will quickly tarnish/discolor."
3.0,"The reviews made this seem like it was big! Sadly this is long long enough for me. I don’t love it, wish it was longer, but will be super comfortable for the early days of fall."
3.0,Loved the wooden natural feel of it. But it was so confusing on how to set & maintain.
3.0,"Love the look of the bag, but zipper broke after 2 days use."
3.0,too see through for me
3.0,Everything looks fine
3.0,Fit well and looked cute. I wore it several times before washing. Washed it cold and hung to dry one time. it’s starting pill and have that cloudy white look to it with this material.
3.0,"Following their sizing chart, I ordered a large even though I am 5-4 and 110 pounds. (Waist 26.5""; hips 34"") These things are way, way too big especially if you are wanting the compression effect they advertise. I ordered maroon and they are far closer to brown with just a hit of a purplish hue. Definitely not maroon. I will be returning these. Not sure I will exchange because the sizing chart is so far off I'm not sure what size I should order."
3.0,"I absolutely loved this coat when I first got it. Comfy, cute style, nice length, roomy pockets, just the right weight. But after I started wearing it for awhile, small white balls of fuzz started to form all over it. I finally realized that it’s fibers from between the layers working their way out and balling up. Now I have to defuzz it at least once a week."
3.0,Eh..
3.0,A little tight on face
3.0,"I should have sized up. The material hugs every curve, including the curves I don't want to highlight. its very soft though."
3.0,Dress stretches after washing and looses it's shape and the sharpness of color.
3.0,I absolutely loved these boots unfortunately they were too snug on my calf. Which surprised me because I’ve never had that issue before with any shoe or boot
3.0,"Cute outfit, but you have to make your own bow for the head."
3.0,"My kids constantly lose socks so I'm always buying in larger quantities.  As far as price goes this was a great deal on 20 pairs.  I will say a few pairs were way too small.  (I had a younger child, so it wasn't a big deal.)  I will also say some of the prints were a little on the ""girly"" side.  I ordered a ""boy"" pack and a few pairs had hearts and stars on them.  I didn't care but I know some people are picky so there is a chance that some of the pairs won't work for you.  If I were to reorder I would probably order up a size."
3.0,"Nice item, but needs to be a little bigger"
3.0,"The earrings look fine, and are of ok quality. The reason I marked them for 3 stars is the back side of the earring doesn't click closed or have any real way to secure it shut other than the fact that the hinge isn't floppy. I don't trust that these will last more than a couple of months before one gets a tiny bump to the earlobe and falls out and is lost."
3.0,see through. runs a little big.
3.0,It was to small... I gave it to my young niece to wear!!
3.0,Daughter loved it. Lil short for my taste personally
3.0,...it probably won't last very long as the construction is not the best. I removed this from the packaging and one of the little metal o rings fell off - from where I don't know - and I've found a couple of loose crystals that obviously fell off during shipping. the necklace itself is beautiful and vibrant. I would've given 5 stars had it not been for the previously mentioned issues. I haven't worn it yet but will update this review when I do.
3.0,Bought these on sale for my daughter next summer. They are much chunkier and bulky than other similar brands. They are less visually appealing in my option too for a little girl. I think the look would be better for a boy.
3.0,Cute but the sleeves are super long but not long enough making it awkward looking.
3.0,The large was more of an extra large but its cute to have around for game night.
3.0,The dress was ordered for a class event. The material was much thinner than it looked in the picture and the color is not deep green but a bright lighter green. The 4-5 was small and so short you can almost see her undergarments. Exchanging it for a larger size.
3.0,"Smaller than I thought.  Appears to keep good time so far.  Packaged well, as a mens watch, just much much smaller than I thought."
3.0,Would have preferred a crossover back fastener. With just ties they didn’t offer a nice tight closure. There was a gap and the ties came undone a couple of times. Will modify with Velcro.
3.0,Was a little disappointed. Bag has no inside pockets
3.0,"For reference, I am 5’8”, 230lbs, 44D and usually wear a size 20 or 2x. I bought the XXXL dress in white. It fit mostly ok and is really cute by design, but the armpit holes were very droopy. It was also very short for me. The biggest issue was that it was see-through. In our dimly lit living room, I paraded out to show my husband and daughter the dress and they both said they could easily see my undergarments. I ended up sending it back. Bummer."
3.0,I made the mistake of not paying attention to the detentions of this item. It is very<br /> Small but still cute.
3.0,"The neck could be longer so wind doesn't blow down your neck, I have to either cover my nose or cove my neck but I can't do both."
3.0,so i read all the reviews and decided to order a large because i’m normally a medium... the large was too big and not flattering at all. For reference i’m a 5s in hollister jeans and wear a size 6 in lululemon. I am short at 5’2 (130ish lbs) but normally skirts end up being a good length on me bc i can pull it up... this was way to long unfortunately:( I really wanted to like this skirt but it just didn’t work
3.0,"I ordered an XL, and it was entirely too big. Returned for a smaller size"
3.0,its like a costume and the neckline is far from drapey<br />ugh
3.0,"I had problems trimming, as well as sticking properly."
3.0,"This scarf isn't as full at it appears, it's quite thing and looses its shape fast. If you want a limp red scarf, buy it. If you want something to keep you warm, keep shopping."
3.0,These would have worked if the material had a more snug fit. Overall they look nice but would not stay on.
3.0,"I really liked this coverup, but all of the stitching is very poorly done. I've only worn it a handful of times and not for long periods and a 4 inch area of stitching has come undone. The material and design is great, just very poorly executed unfortunately."
3.0,"This item was supposed to:<br />""Come with beautiful GIFT BOX, perfect gift for your female friend; 180 Days warranty & Free replacement"" My bracelet came in ziplock bag with barcode on top. This is supposed to be for a gift but now I have to go try to find a box for tomorrow. Geez. If I would have known, I just would have ordered somewhere else. The quality overall of the bracelet is excellent upon first inspection."
3.0,Not quite what I expected but well made.
3.0,"I like style & shape of this dress, it is very pretty & classy.  The only problem I have is that the color is very different from what is noted on the picture.  I purchased the 'watermelon/pink' color which appears like the color salmon.  Be forewarned, the color is orange.  It hurt my eyes when I opened the package because the color was traffic-cone-orange rather than watermelon/pink color.  I planned to wear this to a party but will not because I will end up looking like a traffic guard signaling which way to go rather than a guest."
3.0,The stones fall out after about 2 weeks of constant wear
3.0,"Like the style and look of this skirt.<br /><br />I'm usually a small for bottoms. 5'3&#34; and 120 lbs for reference. Despite the reviews on how it's too small, I ordered my usual small and it fits more like a medium. I like it a lot so I may end up tailoring it to fit me. There isn't any stretch to it."
3.0,"This is not a sweatshirt at all, very strange material. Fit is fine and glad I had a great discount code or it would have been returned."
3.0,"The color is more similar to opaque hospital scrubs than what's pictured, the neckline is not deed at all, and it ended up fitting me like a very unflattering shirt rather than a coverup. I'm 5'7 and currently a little fat, but normally still within the range of things that fit all one size. If you were very short and looking for a lot of neckline coverage, this might be a good buy for you."
3.0,"I am 5'7&#34; and 110 pounds, ordered a small, and this dress was at my ankles. I would have preferred it to be at my feet as it is pictured so I returned it."
3.0,"The pants are beautiful - exactly what I wanted - but...  I wear a 14, even in slim fit.  This XL is the same as my old size 8s."
3.0,broke it on day 2running around the track.
3.0,"It's what we expected.  However,  shipping took way too long.  This was a gift for my brother going through cancer."
3.0,"Ordered 2 pairs; 1 arrived in 2 days, 2 arrived 6 days after I ordered.  Would have appreciated a heads up when ordering as I was out of town when it arrived.  Slippers are ok, seem a little flimsy, will not order this style again."
3.0,"It’s very Jocelyn, but the color is not a light blue as photo depicts. The color is purple."
3.0,"Its ok , not aa sparkly as in the picture"
3.0,"Nice leather wallet. It is great if you only carry cash and credit cards. Unfortunately I have to carry some business cards and papers too. It is not set up for those additional items. That is why I gave it the three stars. I should have researched it better, my fault. It is tight now on the cards but hopefully it will loosen up over time."
3.0,"This romper is very cute, however it is NOT AS PICTURED....again... IT IS NOT AS PICTURED. It’s made of a very cheap material."
3.0,The shorts portion was a bit tight on my thighs.
3.0,They are large headbands. Will have to make them smaller
3.0,"Nice material and well made but HUGE. I ordered a medium, and the sleeves came down to my thumbs,supposed to be a 3/4 cut sleeve."
3.0,Sleeves are awful
3.0,"This sweater is beautiful, exactly what I was looking for; however is runs very very small."
3.0,I love it but the gap is too big
3.0,Buckle is strong enough for the pull test I did.  Having a difficult time getting a spark.  Any help on how to make it easier would be greatly appreciate.
3.0,This blouse is yellow- NOT gold:(
3.0,Not quite as roomy as I thought it would be --for a plus size. Colors are washed out--not true  and vibrant. Style is nice.
3.0,The frabic is cheap.
3.0,"Very nice double watch winder but don't buy  if you have a Rolex watch. I tried every wind setting and none worked for my Rolex Submariner. My last automatic watch winder broke and was nowhere as nice as this one. This is a beautifully put together watch winder. The box is sturdy, the controls are firm, I like having an on/off button on the back and a small key to lock the box. I just wished it work with Rolex watches. Unfortunately, it doesn't work for me. I just had my Submariner factory cleaned and serviced so I know it's not my watch."
3.0,"I have especially long arms, so I may not be a good guide. But I'm going to try a different brand next time. I've ad more luck with Champion and Santee."
3.0,Overpriced everything else is great
3.0,"This hand muff is very nice.  It's elegant looking however, it took over thirty minutes for my hands to warm indoors.  So, I don't know how long it would take outside in the elements.  I'm considering returning."
3.0,"This dress is beautiful,l but was much too small in the bust area. Returned."
3.0,The bags look as expected. I like them but the zippers are not well made.
3.0,"This is cute, but it doesn't really fit a checkbook and register without the cover staying open."
3.0,"Nice bag I really wanted to like use it and stuff, but it came with no strap.  So it's pretty much useless for my vaca lol"
3.0,Very pretty and easy to wear. Can slightly bend your earlobe a bit. I have noticed that the color is starting to fade after having a little over one month.
3.0,"I don't  wear hats as a rule, as this is for a party."
3.0,"I bought a green dress and it was perfect, than I went and ordered red and blue, both of them are so thin material and they don’t look good on me as green."
3.0,"Came with a bead missing, but I was able to displace a bead from underneath and it wasn't even noticeable. It's a cute necklace, but looks a bit cheap."
3.0,"Really wanted this to work but the small/medium was too big. I’m small on top but if you were larger up top, it may work for you."
3.0,Too tight.  Hubby normally wears XL but this was snug XL.
3.0,"This shirt was so very thin. It was a cute design, but it is just too thin for me. I felt like you could see the outline of everything underneath. It was soft and the color was pretty. It had the right design and was stretchy. The sizing was okay. The quality seemed okay too. So if you want a really light shirt, it could work for you, but for me it is just too thin."
3.0,"I really liked this at first, but the bust area has really stretched out after just a few wears."
3.0,This Sleep Mask comes in a one size fits all and that is ok providing you have a small head.  It is soft enough and will work but not for all users.  I gave this to my daughter to use and it fits her fine.  This really needs an adjustable band instead of just the elastic one.  Without this I can only moderately recommend.
3.0,Sort of weak material.  I'm afraid I'll break it on some high-tops.
3.0,"The problem is they are TOO soft but if I gave this 5 stars for that category then you would all go out and buy this but it's SO soft that it's just kinda 'on' your head, but without purpose. Listen, I know no one wants a tight one that gives you a headache, but this one being so soft makes it feel like it's not really doing much.  They are totally cute cute print and nice they were a covid purchase to make me happy during this time.  I'm disappointed because they have tons of prints and sizes and I thought yay I'm finally done searching for headbands. I'm a runner so I've tried Halo top and sweaty bands and under armour everything!!! My best are when I take fabric and make a strip myself!"
3.0,the stone is nothing like the picture and i was really looking forward to it looking like the picture.  it looks more like a jade stone than jasper.  it does take a long time to receive it after you order it.  but it is good quality and it feels good on your finger.
3.0,"The quality looks fine, but I ordered these for my baby. They are huge, definitely not something my 15 month old can wear. Disappointing."
3.0,It ran very small for the size it was supposed to be and really has no stretch too it.
3.0,"I ordered dark grey and they sent me light grey, there looser then expected too"
3.0,"I loved this dress in the pictures but was a bit underwhelmed when it arrived. It wasn't flattering on me, but I won't fault it for that since each body is different. I'm 5'3"" and 115lbs and the small was a comfortable fit, although an XS would probably have been just slightly better. It just hit me in all the wrong places. Again, not the dress's fault but if you carry all your extra weight in your mom belly and hips then this dress may not be for you either. What I wasn't a fan of quality wise, was the fact that this dress is made out of very thin cotton. You know... The type that wrinkles if you so much as look at it. As the busy mom of two little kids, this material looks way too high maintenance for me. I don't have time to iron my dress every time I sit down. Also, if you're planning on ordering this for a vacation or cruise, please save yourself some time and don't even dream of putting this in a suitcase unless you want to spend your precious vacation ironing. I don't know about you, but that isn't really my idea of a good time. The dress really is cute in person, it's just very thin material, and wrinkles if you look at it wrong."
3.0,The color starts to chip off the rose and its kind of cluncky. Doesnt hang down my belly like I expected it to.
3.0,"Not as good quality as I thought it would be, but still pretty."
3.0,This could be cute and much more comfy if it was a better fabric. It's weird poly blend that attracts static and doghair like crazy. Not worth the price.
3.0,"The wrist band is a replacement, and this is noticeably a little tighter than my older one. Still looks pretty good though, so not too many complaints"
3.0,Cute. Reviews are accurate
3.0,"The plaid looked so cool in the pictures, but made me look VERY pregnant. Watch out for the stripes. Otherwise the dress was great. Comfy and well fitting."
3.0,Feel very flimsy.  Quality is just OK.
3.0,Smaller than I thought photo was not very clear inside cuff link
3.0,Nice quality but too small & larger size not available so I returned item
3.0,Decent.  Most of the 2exist models out today and not very good.  Years ago they had some great ones.  This particular item is acceptable but barely.  Rises too low and barely enough for gluts.
3.0,"This broke after a few weeks , I feel figured it would last longer"
3.0,"Quality isn’t the greatest, a lot of the charms are too small so they’re loose. Cute and fun though"
3.0,"I am 5'11&#34; and have the large hands (18 cm from the bottom of the heel of my palm to the end of my middle finger; 8.5 cm length of my middle finger) to go with my height. These gloves do fit on the small side, even though they do stretch. The fingers of the gloves aren't as long as my fingers, but the fact that the material is slippery, despite the grippy bumps on the palms of the gloves, means that the gloves aren't sloppy as I'm trying to grip the steering wheel of my car. These gloves would be better for driving is they did have grip all along the fingers too. I did buy them for the sun protection, but haven't consistently worn them simply because of the lack of grip - and my hands sweat in them when the weather is warmer. Cute design though, and other people have commented they think that glove wearing is a rather elegant but lost fashion. If more gloves came out in a larger range of sizes, I bet more would be sold and worn to practical and fashionable effect! ;-)"
3.0,They fit her foot pretty well but the decretive cutouts around the strap were cut deep exposing a lot of the toe I didn’t like that.
3.0,"Need 15s not 16s for my 2004 Camry.  Rims look great, just too big.  Trying to exchange now."
3.0,"The dress is beautiful but wasn't well made.  At the center, the hem was coming off.  Anyways, it did the job for the event."
3.0,"I'm not very dissatisfied but these are kind of cheapish, so I consider these emergency shades. The heart shape saved them from being given away."
3.0,I bought my regular size of large and found these too be too tight.  The legs are also too short and kept riding up.  Would be nice if they were mid thigh instead.  I am keeping them though as I am working on losing weight so I think once I lose about 10 pounds they should fit but still concerned the legs will be too short.
3.0,"They are too thin for me. I was looking for a much thicker, sturdier head scarf. I had a coach scarf that I got as a gift with purchase and this scarf is no where as think as that. I gave this to my sister she loves it."
3.0,I returned my original size and re-ordered a size up.  It fit but the finish was rough and uncomfortable.  I tried wearing it around the house and could only keep it on for about half an hour I could no longer dear the discomfort.  It's hard on the bottom and at the very top where the material id joined rubs against my foot.<br /><br />But its very attractive but I have to return it
3.0,"Nice set and quality, but only received 4 pairs.  Red pair was MIA."
3.0,"It took forever to ship, it arrived 4 days late. >> Tardó más en llegar de lo que en principio dijeron.<br /><br />The color doesn’t match the picture describing the product. >> El color no es como el de la foto de amazon.<br /><br />The fabric is soft but I think It isn’t very good quality and it’s going to show up some balls after washing and drying. >>> La tela es suave y fresca pero creo que se le harán bolitas después de lavar y secar.<br /><br />In the description the shirt looks less casual than it really is. >> La camisa es más casual de lo que esperaba, para llevarla con pantalones jeans y poco más.<br /><br />I usually wear an L for tops (5’9”, 180 lb, size 12) but I’m glad that I went for an XL after looking at the size chart. >> Mido 1.75 m, peso 85 kilos y uso la talla 12 US, por norma compro la talla L de camisa pero después de leer la descripción pedí la XL y me alegro de haberlo hecho.<br /><br />It is a little sort in the front so I’m going to wear it with high waisted jeans. >> Al ser corta por la cintura la usaré con jeans de cintura alta."
3.0,Good for price I like it
3.0,Not a vibrant color like the photo and the setting sits off at an angle not what I expected
3.0,Really like the shirt and the design beside it was somehow bigger than expected
3.0,"These Jean's are a nice quality and color, however I did have to return these. The fit is to tight and narrow for a curvy thigh and backside. If you are curvy I reccomend this brand in the wonder Jean. I am 5'3"" and 130 if that helps."
3.0,"Waistband too stiff, not comfy"
3.0,The brush quality and quality of the Polish is low. You get what you pay for. I would recommend spending a little more for quality polish and brushes.
3.0,"Super soft and super cute but the ""capris"" come down to the top of my foot making them pajama pants not capris! I really wanted capris but these will be perfect for fall and winter so I will keep them. I am 5'5"" so they aren't capris that just hang low because I am short. They are pants..."
3.0,Cute but cheap. More for kids .
3.0,I bought the fascinator to wear to a wedding.  I paid for two day delivery and it did come in on time. I was very nice but was unglued from the head band. I had to borrow a hot glue gun and repair myself.
3.0,like weight and design.  Size very small.
3.0,It's really cute but is not meant for women with large bust size.  Loved the bottoms though.
3.0,Irritated my ear and I had to take them out. Pretty tho
3.0,I really like this ring and how it looks. The ring fits perfect. Only bad thing is that it seems it scratches easily.
3.0,They don’t stay on your feet for long.
3.0,They'OK.
3.0,"These were the most promising straps we purchased,  unfortunately they LIKE ALL OTHERS (we've purchased many) do not float with a pair of normal weight sun glasses attached.  They are absolutely perfect for walking, hiking, biking."
3.0,They are actually smaller than I thought.
3.0,"I ordered the burgundy color and I absolutely love the color. The only reason I’m giving this three  stars is because it is a little shorter than I expected. I normally wear a size M and that’s what I ordered. However, I wish I would’ve gotten a large just so it was a little longer."
3.0,shines
3.0,"I was surprised that this shirt fit as well as it did, considering it's essentially &#34;one size fits all&#34;.  I'm on the curvy side and it lays just right; perfect with jeans.  However, HUGE issue with the material: I wore it once and there tons of little pulls all over the front of it.  I seems as though just coming in close proximity to something created a pull.  Tried wearing it for a second time today but it's only getting worse.  Will likely not be able to wear again as it is so noticeable.  Sad because it's cute and looks good otherwise!"
3.0,"Dress looks like a school marm on me...lots of fabric, color is not very vivid,  seems scratchy to me....not much to say about it. Functional dress, but nothing that I feel matches the usual cuteness and sassiness of Patty Boutique clothes. Found the dress drab and boring.Not stylish. It would need lots of accessories, a busty body with a thin waist probably would look better. I returned."
3.0,"Pros: nice colors, sturdy, well constructed. Washes well, with no shrinkage.<br /><br />Cons: heavier and stiffer fabric than I wanted, making it less comfortable than cheaper nightgowns. Only one small chest pocket."
3.0,"I believe these would work 4 someone else just fine. Good seller.. arrived quickly, as described, and refunded quickly when i returned. In fact they even SENT UPS to come pick them up as I'm dissabled & dont leave e house. Tmy only issue eith these was that they roll up.. and as that's my pet peeve, i didn't keep them."
3.0,It came in broken. I fixed it eaily until it broken again and the fixed it... again. But now it seems to be fine and very elegant.
3.0,This runs a little small
3.0,"They are nice glasses, but from the description I thought they'd be well... large.  They are normal size glasses; nice, but not what I was looking for."
3.0,"It nice but the charm are to heavy, they won't stay even."
3.0,Muy grandes me quedaron
3.0,They are cute but do not work on bigger necks.
3.0,"My wife referred to these as hospital shorts -- they appeared very large for their size, and well, when the wife steps in and says no, the answer is no. Do not recommend."
3.0,"Not as easy to tie the back! Took some time to adjust the dress/ back so the boobs don’t fall out. May need tape to hold in place or a nip slip is. Sry likely. Other than that, I like the dress"
3.0,"Great looking glasses, but sadly I have a slim face and they lack those little pads that rest on the bridge of the nose which means they kept sliding off of my face. I have them to my cousin who had the same issue with them but not as bad since her face is not as tiny as mine. But they really are good looking glasses, if only I could wear them..."
3.0,You should have sent instructions on how to open the buckle. Good thing I didn't have to pee.
3.0,Too large for
3.0,"Great shirt, just order a size bigger. Very cute, but is also see-through...the white one."
3.0,"The belt was too small and the width was on the small side waiting for a response for a larger width belt, had to return"
3.0,"Bought for husband and thought it work for Halloween costume as Gru (Despicable Me) .  Trimmed off the wart and tried to sand off some of the nose, but just did not work out.  Hey, for the price, it was not a great loss......I guess."
3.0,"Agree with the other reviews that the rest of the pants are quite roomy, but the waistband is super tight for the size. I didn't think it would be a big deal since some compression isn't bad, however the waistband has a seam up top that is not stretchy and digs in if you don't size properly. I'm 5'5"", 140lb, size 28 in Levi's, size 6 lululemon, and the small fit everywhere except the top seam which was way too tight. Returned for a Medium and will update how that goes. The measurements they provide in the size chart are accurate, it's across the waist so x2 and add an inch for stretch to get your jean size. &lt;edit: tried the size M, they are definitely a better fit but the top seam still digs in and chafes. going to keep these since I like the tie dye print, but sad they're not the super comfy pants I wanted>"
3.0,"this was kind of a disappointment, mainly because I can't read the dates from farther than a foot away. easy to hang on the wall though."
3.0,"I wear a 34 in everything..  this product was just a bit smaller than other 34's and too tight for a relaxed fit short.  I returned for a 36 and that is just too big. So I will need to return those as well.  It seems like I would need a 35 in this product, which they don't offer.  So it cost me 15 bucks in return shipping to find out I can't wear this product.  Which is too bad, since this was exactly the lightweight casual cargo short I was looking for."
3.0,Not very high quality. Only lasted about two days with a 3 & 5 year old.
3.0,It was really pretty but one of the pieces broke off within a few days.
3.0,"This dress was a very small large. I gave it to another family member.  Very disappointed, it’s so cute. So I would suggest if your size 14 in woman, buy 1x. ?"
3.0,"Somewhat disappointed. This top is listed as a sweater but it's actually made with a thermal type fabric. Even more casual than how it looks in the picture. However, it does seem to be well made and it fits according to the size listed."
3.0,"I ordered these shoes for my 6-year-old son.  I was a bit surprised by how sparkly the shoelaces are.  There is a really sparkly silver thread in them and a glitter star on the side which I think makes the shoes look girly.  Also, the fact that there are very long shoelaces was surprising as none of the product photos or the video show the laces.  It is nice that the shoes have a zipper so the child does not need to untie the laces, however, you know the laces are going to end up getting untied frequently and need to be retied (especially with how long they are).  The shoes do seem well made.  They are soft on the inside with an appropriate cushion and have a non-slip tread on the bottom.  I would like them, but they seem to be more for a girl and the laces are way too long."
3.0,I didn't like the material all that much. It does not have as much stretch as I would have liked. And the waist on the large is pretty small for a large. I ended up cutting a little slit inside the waistband and pulling the elastic out and just use the drawstring for holding them up. They look pretty cute though. I just wanted a softer way more stretchy knit type material.
3.0,"Weird uncomfortable fabric, almost rubbery."
3.0,i do not like the quality.
3.0,Beautiful but hard to breathe through
3.0,"I did Not like the lining in the dress. It was too short and it should had been longer to match the dress. It was extremely too short which took away from the dress. It was quite embarrassing finding out that the lining/ slip was  too short and as you walk , sit, or move the slip ride up even more. The dress was worn to a Tea for a Bridal Party."
3.0,The material looked super cheap. Nothing like I expected and the dress was a few inches shorter than I expected. Don’t think I’ll be wearing it.
3.0,"Love the feel and stlye of this. However it is not a Plus Size. This is the 2xl pictured on a 125 pound 15 year old. I had bought this for myself but it will never fit, not sure how they came up with the sizing measurements."
3.0,Cute but much smaller than I thought.
3.0,Nice and good quality but too big on me. I feel I have safety lab glasses lol
3.0,They aren’t as pearlescent as I hoped. I have had another mermaid glass bracelet and it really “glows” a lot... this one does not
3.0,Dress was cute but was way to small. And very see through.
3.0,The side seam ripped after two or three uses.
3.0,Bought for someone else.  It is more for large-wristed women. Cute for the price.
3.0,"I purchased these cycling underwear in hopes they wouldn't look like I was wearing a diaper underneath my regular yoga/workout pants. I wish they had worked out because I really don't like my Baleaf cycling pants because of the same reason. These underwear probably would've done the trick as far as saving my rear end from pain, but they looked awful under pants and shorts. I guess I'll just have to keep looking.<br />Purchased L and XL, the L fit me better and wasn't super saggy (5ft 4in, 170lbs)."
3.0,It's not as long as I expected. It's almost square-shaped. It's wide and short.
3.0,It's perfect for short women but if ur over 5'6 like me it's super short. It stopped at the base of my rib cage so I ended up not using it. Just for reference im not fat or anything just built wide. My stomach is flat and my bones stick out.
3.0,I bought the shirt in another color and it fit this one was way off. I ordered a 2x it was not a 2x it didn't even fit my daughter . But it is a really cute shirt
3.0,Cute. Not as big as it looked in the pictures. Beautiful color. Kind of disappointed.
3.0,They aren’t made as good as it looks in the picture- will provide pictures and take a close look- but I still think their cute. I bought my youngest daughters some where else and they were made like the picture but this one for my two older daughters wasn’t. Didn’t have the zipper cover up thing and much thinner then looks.
3.0,"Ordered a 3T for my son who is two.  Shirt fits great but the pants are short. I would suggest ordering a size up and maybe rolling the sleeves.  The pants shrunk after 1 wash to the point of them sitting below his waist like ""low riders."""
3.0,"My fiance loves Rick and Morty. I found the hat to be pretty small on him and I thought that was a patch on the front, but it's a piece of fabric sown on each side, not on the top or bottom."
3.0,"Glasses are large for a small framed face. Even though I read a review that said they are great for a small face?! Umm not. Also as with the other reviews, they did send me the wrong glasses. I ordered (as you can see) the smoke- blue lense. I received the black lenses. With the cost of the glasses and the cost to ship them back I just decided to keep them.<br />Not a fan of these frames/model."
3.0,"Bags are smaller than I expected, theres no measurements in the description that I could find"
3.0,Good quality just way too big. It made me look like I had no shape. Maybe I should’ve gotten a smaller size!
3.0,I hated how it got around my hips and butt. I’m a small girl 5’4 and 115 lbs got my size and it just wasn’t cut right. I could also be picky bc I was a swimmer my whole life and my mom used to make my suits so I tend to like things a bit higher cut. The Lycra is solid quality especially for price. And the top fits great.
3.0,Run pretty small
3.0,"Made this purchase because this color scheme is 100% me, grey with black and some lime green in a Nordic type style. Hat looks great but the fit leaves a bit to be desired. Not very stretchy so I'm unable to pull it over my ears. In fact, while wearing it if the wind blows this hat feels like its going to slip off. I'm a very average size by the way, and yes I have a normal sized head :) Perhaps it will stretch out a bit with time."
3.0,"I was really excited to try these since I heard so many YouTubers rave about these leggings. However, I was really disappointed with the way they fit. I got an XL since many said they run small,  the tag actually says L/XL, they fit really loose since I am in between sizes and they are not very supportive. THEY ARE NOT SHORT GIRL FRIENDLY. They fit really loose around the ankles as well. It is not because they are too long as I have other AMAZON leggings that are too long and size XL that fit really well even though they are long.<br /><br />Also, these leggings are NOT squat proof! As I previously stated, these leggings were loose yet you could see my undies through them. I wore black and nude undies and you could still see them. (they are the VS no seam ones that don't show with pants with no pockets- if you know what I mean)<br /><br />I don't know if going commando would help. I did not try this as it is not my thing…but to each their own. I hope this helps anyone that has a bit of curves and is on the shorter side."
3.0,"This raincoat is just ok.  If you want to pack it up into a very small ball for traveling, or stuff it into a backpack it's great, but if you are getting it as your actual raincoat, it's too thin and flimsy (and wrinkled!).  I have it for hiking now, but not for everyday wear."
3.0,"Arrived broken in two, probably because it was shipped in a barely padded envelope. But I needed it for a party, so I super glued it back together. The glue held all night and it was fairly comfortable. So besides shipping breakage problem, a good mask."
3.0,Dislike bulky look
3.0,I’m 36dd 5’2” 160 Wear a m or L I chose large It fit and looks good on me
3.0,I wasn't a fan of these. They were extremely stiff and once I got them put together they were super uncomfortable. I couldn't imagine wearing it 8-10 hours a day at work. So I ordered ones from Adidas instead that have a mesh lining inside so can use activated charcoal filters if you want.
3.0,"There's a couple of defects on this necklace, the coins aren't all the way even and all the the loops of chains don't start the same way on the necklace and the gold looks a little faded (not sure if that's what they were going for), me being a little OCD and also paying over $15 it needs to be better made, but when you have the necklace on and moving, no one can really notice, so"
3.0,Work well a cleaning and polishing but something needs to be done about the edging shedding. I postpone using it for quick jobs because I will have to vacuum afterwards.
3.0,It's OK.  Not great.  Too big.  Too thin.
3.0,Looks very cheaply made . Came in bad packaging . Looks low quality .
3.0,"Runs a little small even compared to gas station sunglasses, but they look good."
3.0,Lights didn't work!
3.0,Plan on paying $10 for a cleaner to steam out wrinkles.
3.0,Straps break easily
3.0,"It didn't look exactly like the pictures as far as the details,  but it served its purpose.  My daughter loved it."
3.0,"These glasses are fine, with clear lens, good magnification, & flexible hinges. They're quite narrow, however, so they don't fit a wide (pun intended) range of faces. They're also fairly tall, so you can't see over them - not everyone's taste in reading glasses. There's a faint yellow tint to the lens; I'm not convinced they block much bluelight."
3.0,Colors were not swirled real well. Ok the black and white one there is a large black area
3.0,Wanted to give this a 4.5 star rating but it needs adjustable ear loops.
3.0,"Runs too small, so I've to return it to exchange for bigger size. Besides the size being too small I like the rest, is high waist and seamless, good and strong quality fabric. I'll leave an other review once I get the exchange."
3.0,I like it. I like the style & it's flattering. But the fit is a tad too large so I'll be exchanging it.
3.0,"Shirt is adorable, and seems quality made.  However it runs very small.  My XL fit my friend who usually wears a M."
3.0,"Nice color and feel but ran much to big. If your a girl this maybe a good thing since it can accommodate a lot of hair, but for the average guy this will have to be excessively rolled up which just looks bad."
3.0,"El material y elasticidad del producto son aceptables, aunque quizás no cumple con las expectativas en cuanto a que se esperaba una faja con mayor presión en los costados y abdomen, esto para apoyar las rutinas de ejercicios o ajustar vestimenta.  No obstante el producto es un tipo de camisetas ajustadas (stretch) que se sienten y lucen bien."
3.0,"The dress is almost the right size, but the sleeves on the over-wrap are child-sized ... no where near proportionate to the size of the dress."
3.0,"I was so excited to received this swim suit, but had very mixed reviews when I received it.  I was so sad because it looks so cool in the pictures. First of all, the quality is just OK.  The swim suit seems like it will stay together just fine, but the quality is not seamless.  You can see the elastic from the inside of the straps on the ends and where fabric was cut and hemmed on the top half.  It is not very noticeable when wearing the swim suit, but it is still there and that is not something that you would typically see in a swimsuit purchased from a department store.<br /><br />The fit would definitely not fit just any body type.  I feel that this swim suit would better fit someone who is small on the top and larger on the bottom.  I ordered a size small. I typically wear a size small, chest size is 34 A and typically a size 2-4 in clothing.  The top is quite tight when it is fastened and there is really not much room for the cups to stretch or conform for any difference in sizes.  I will definitely not be able to wear the top, as it just looks silly on me.  This top will also not likely fit someone who has larger breasts.  The bottoms look awesome from the front and were exactly what I expected and fit great.  The problem with the bottoms is that the back provides much more coverage than I need and goes up significantly higher than the front.  If I were to wear the bottoms, I would have to roll them down.<br /><br />Overall, this swimsuit looks great on the model in the picture, and will look great with someone who has that exact body.  This suit is made smaller on the top and larger on the bottom, so please keep that in mind when ordering.  The colors are great and it is cute, but I will unfortunately not be able to wear it."
3.0,I wanted to love these but for some reason they weren’t easy to slide on or off. It’d a shame because they LOOK very cute. I had to return them.
3.0,"I just received these a hour ago. Beautiful color, extremely soft...but even though it is stamped size 7/8 on the bottom, these are clearly more like a size 10. PLEASE READ SIZING CAREFULLY - evidently I ordered the Euro size and not the US size. Bummer"
3.0,"It was a gift for my husband. The quality is decent but could be a little better. I would of given it a better rating if it wasn't for the sizing. It does run about a whole size to small with not much stretching to it. So it fit my husband's head tight, which wasn't what he was looking for. Good for someone with a small head like a younger teenager."
3.0,Not a real red. Thin fabric but fits well.
3.0,"The colors are great, same as shown in the picture. they fit well. The lace is really pretty. However, I only wore them for about a month before both of my black pair of socks got holes in them and had to be thrown away."
3.0,"Nice wood watch, but it definitely isn't green like pictures. It's natural wood color. I checked product number and its correct."
3.0,look really cute and feel comfortable. great gift at a good price.
3.0,"My husband just ordered a pair for himself and they were too small for his head so he gave them to me. I was baffled by the quality! They feel so cheap that I would be afraid to actually wear them and they came super dirty, coverd in some sort of powdery lint. I could understand if they were $5 but not $50+. I took them out of the case (which is the only thing of quality) and there is a section that’s not even painted black! I really wanted to like them especially since we are going on a trip, I thought they would be nice but I am returning them and will stick with my dollar store shades."
3.0,The crown broke within seconds of opening the packaging
3.0,They are pretty fantastic. However one of the swtiches takes two hard presses to turn on the lights 2 days after arriving.
3.0,It's a see thru .
3.0,"For some reason, these leggings didn't shape my bootie well & even kind of showed my cellulite underneath, so I had to return them.  I DO like the LeggingsQueen Black Faux Leather Leggings. My dimensions: 5'6.25"", 120lb, 35.5"" hips (more pear-shaped body type)."
3.0,The material is almost like swimsuit materia. It fits really tight but with little stretch. Go up a size.
3.0,It’s looks exactly as it was advertised.
3.0,"Great product, sizing is difficult to determine."
3.0,The color is just a true blue not periwinkle. Also the material is like a jersey poly blend. It works so I’m keeping it but it doesn’t lay as elegantly as I would have wanted it to or go with formal attire.
3.0,Not that I expect a lot for the price but most of the bracelets were cheap looking.  There were a couple of cute ones but you get what you pay for and I'm not mad about it.
3.0,"1. Do you look like the model wearing the clothes?<br />2. Come on. She's 20 and fit. Are you 20 and fit?<br />If not, keep your expectations realistic."
3.0,"This jacket was too small thru chest and shoulders.  I'm 5""4 and usual size is small.  I returned it"
3.0,"Color was a bit off, but the dress is still really cute. The skirt is heavy, top area is stretchy."
3.0,"Nice looking band, but it's kinda pain in the butt to switch between bands"
3.0,"Product is good quality but the fit is way too tight and small, I highly suggest going up at least one size if not two"
3.0,Had the item for almost about 5 hours and the magnet already fell off and i can't find it anywhere. I would like a refund.
3.0,Didn't care for the fit or quality
3.0,It a pretty dress just runs really small
3.0,Returned. Did not fit over glasses.  Too small.
3.0,Does not close no matter what you have in it
3.0,Las medidas (sizes) publicadas no coinciden con la realidad
3.0,Perfect small size.<br />I had to send back the first purse because the black strap made black marks on the clear plastic inside the purse. The second purse I purchased also had marks but not as bad. I thin piece of paper was inside the purse to prevent this from happening. It did help some.
3.0,Comfy but too small
3.0,Very pretty and feminine. The underwire is not comfortable.
3.0,"I usually wear M, but this dress M size is quite large for me. So I ordered S. Still so wide at my waist area. If they had XS size I could have ordered it."
3.0,Design is beautiful. I’m a 32D so I ordered small. Big mistake. Way too small but the medium size started at 34A.
3.0,No dislike it's a house coat.
3.0,"I just received this purse. Only has one strap, not two. Doesn't have a zippered pocket on the left side, and has no instructions on what to do with a small, black Velcro piece that came with the holster."
3.0,"This is the second time I’ve ordered these tights. The first set I ordered for my daughter when she was a little over 12 months was the size 12-24 months. They worked perfectly for her and I thought they were adorable. I love that they have the nonslip grips on the bottom, the colors, and the warmth they provide. She was able to wear them for two falls and winters since she is on the smaller side.<br /><br />The second time I ordered them I ordered her the 2T-4T size since she’s 3 and still on the smaller size for height and weight. I was excited to get them since I loved them before. I do still love the color and the warmth they provide, but for some reason this size is short."
3.0,"Pretty loose, you will loose after a while but a wonderful finish."
3.0,"I love how these fit out of the package. I am 5'8&#34; 135lbs, purchased a medium and AT THAT TIME they felt great. 3 stars bc I feel they stretched out quite a bit after the first wear and weren't &#34;tight&#34; any more around the legs, see pic. I will order another in a small next time and see how they fit. I hope the waist won't be too tight. Warmth-wise they are great, wore them under snow gear while snowboarding in 30 degree weather."
3.0,The band across squeezed....it is not flexible
3.0,Too big in some areas.  Good fit otherwise.
3.0,The set of LED lights on one shoe stopped working after two days:(.  Other then that they are impressive when they work.
3.0,I liked it. Use it from time to time.
3.0,material is too thin
3.0,She really Always goes with the color hot and 🥶 cold happy or 😢 sad
3.0,Tight fit and there is not a lot of material to cover your chest. Bigger chested girls beware! You're getting what you pay for here.
3.0,I am a size 2 in lululemon. These leggings were way too big and it doesn’t fit well in the crotch area. Shows camel toe but then it’s like baggy at the same time. Will upload pics shorty. Disappointed. Top was a little tight.
3.0,The body fits great. The opening at the top of the arms near the shoulders is a little small. Women that have thicker arms in that area may not find it comfortable. The seam at that part is not elastic so it won't stretch to fit large arms.
3.0,"The material is a weird roughy polyester. The bottom of the shirt has an elastic band, so the shirt itself is short and you can’t tuck it in. I couldn’t figure out how to tie the sleeves like they are shown in the photo"
3.0,"havent worn yet, sleeves lay so you can see the inside"
3.0,Hard to figure out how to put on
3.0,The dress was ordered for a floral themed party. It is perfect for the occasion. BEWARE! It runs VERY small! I am 5'2 and 117lbs and I ordered a medium. I can barely get it zipped up and it smashes my 34 B's flat.I usually wear a size 2-4. I am going to try and exchange it for a large and see if that works.
3.0,I bought this for my Clueless halloween costume in the red color. It's longer than expected (I am 5'-1&#34;) and the quality is that of the store bought halloween costumes. Don't expect anything amazing!
3.0,Bought this for my yoga instructor but it’s TINY.. so I gave it to my 12 year old cousin ;) still cute so I guess I just need to up the size
3.0,"Super cute but isn't true to size, in fact runs small"
3.0,"Cute style, alittle too thin. I decided to go ahead and keep it that i may wear it and feel dressed up while doing things around the house....like an updated June Cleaver."
3.0,Had to make a few adjustments... Not all watches are exactly the same... But the quality and service were great
3.0,Great house shoes.  However Marshall's head fell off within a month so I had to see it back on which was easy enough to do. They don't have much support but most house shoes don't. They sell these same ones at Walmart for the same price fyi.
3.0,Too big and stretchy.  I gave it to my sister in law who loves it.
3.0,"This outfit is okay, it wasn't the best or the worse. It'll do. It's very thin and has a weird feel to it. But, I'm still going to wear it."
3.0,"This band is very pretty. I received many compliments. After wearing it daily, for less than 2 months, the clasp won't stay locked. Very disappointed with the clasp. Too late to return"
3.0,"The pockets are a bit odd on this. It doesn't lay as flat as I had hoped. Still cute, but shapely ladies with hips, the pockets become a little bit in the way of having it look as flattering as it could be."
3.0,it runs huge but it's sooo comfty
3.0,The pockets make the sides stick out
3.0,It’s a nice looking hat but it runs a little big. Not good for jeep rides because at it’s tightest it’s still too big.
3.0,"These are way bigger in the legs than shown!<br />I am fluffier than my normal; due to holidays, so I am not being extreme. I still love the concept and quality of fabric. The sewing was awesome too.<br />I am shorter than 5” heels too. So I cut washed again and again and added a reinforced hem at bottom to control fraying. As the original hem.<br /><br />Nice product. Nice idea but way wider than shown. Really."
3.0,"The fabric is soft, pure white and THIN.  I have another Land's End shirt of extremely similar style that I purchased about 15 years ago (I was wearing it up until a couple of months ago - the dryer belt broke and the barrel edges caught some of the clothing and caused damage to this shirt) and the fabric was just as soft and it was almost twice the thickness (so a camisole was unnecessary).  I will have to wear a camisole under it.<br /><br />There is a 3/4"" gap (measured from the body to the edge of the armhole) at the armhole about 2/3 of the way down from the shoulder.<br /><br />I will keep this and wear it because it meets a need."
3.0,"This cap was made very well, but way too big for my head.  But I am a small woman, so I guess my head is smaller.  If you have bigger head, this is a great product.  Linda"
3.0,It is not very good fabric
3.0,It’s pretty when it arrived but was much smaller then I expected.  Picture is deceiving.
3.0,Hair constantly fell out in clumps!! Surprised by the end of the night there was hair left on the mask.
3.0,"very short and clingy I would have been able to wear this 20 years ago not now, I had to return it."
3.0,too small for girls ??
3.0,"Found these were a tight around the ankle, especially the pattern styled ones. Struggled to get the zebra ones on my foot, felt a bit like one of Cinderellas' step sisters trying to get it on. Cute styles though, color matches the image. My shoe size is a Womans 9."
3.0,The jeans are cute and made well.
3.0,These shoes are adorable. They are as sparkly as pictured. My only complaint is that my daughter found them to be uncomfortable. She has narrow feet and the sides and top of the shoe gave her blisters. I would recommend some sort of half sock and a insole cushion.
3.0,Too many small pouches.
3.0,Akward and doesn't look quite like pictured... somewhat odd to put on...
3.0,"I can see the stretch in the material. When stretched, the darker areas (black) looks grey because the underlying color of the material is white."
3.0,"Ok so the chain broke the first time I wore it, which was on the way to LAX at 4am.  Not a great way to start a trip, but I rigged up a fix on the fly (see what I did there -- I'm charming) and I get compliments every time I wear it!  Looks 👍 but lining is kinda lame."
3.0,"It is a comfy dress,BUT.... for the house only,completly see thru,runs large untill washed(in cold water)then shrinks.had i just wanted to have a house dress,this would have been fine,the company was very fast at shipping and were even better about making things right with my purchace,therefor on the wonderful customer service alone i would shop with them again."
3.0,"Lenses popped out after a few days. OK, but I’d rather just purchase tinted readers."
3.0,Loved the look and feel of this costume! But after following the instructions to wash I’m super upset by how all of the red coloring came out of the skirt and cape. Spent the money for a quality costume that I only got to wear once. Was really hoping to keep this one for years to come but I guess not.
3.0,"My son wear's a 3T which was WAY too small. I ordered a size 5, and it fits him just fine, but probably won't get as much wear out of it!"
3.0,"The shorts are a perfect fit and really cute. The top didn’t fit as expected and I can’t adjust the straps to cover her boobies yet. It fits like a crop top so maybe once she’s bigger it will fit. If not, at least we got cute shorts out of it."
3.0,"I like it, although I might prefer more feminum in future and I had to change to a stronger and longer chain."
3.0,"This is exactly as advertised, except for the arms.  I ordered an extra large it fits beautifully but I believe they use the same pattern for the arms no matter the size ordered. Stuffed sausages is my description. I haven't worn it out of the house. So sad"
3.0,It is very cute but I bought a bigger size so I would have it not as tight but that wasn’t the case. It was snug and the pockets sit weird  Maybe it fits better on a thinner person?
3.0,"nice earrings but were smaller than I wanted, returned"
3.0,Definitely order a size up.<br />Super soft!!
3.0,Fit great but the bottoms tore with in the first hour I wore them.
3.0,"Well.... Bought this for my 49 y/o hubby on his birthday so he could look like he was somewhat in style. I know his size so purchased this for him. Now picture this..... Our family sitting on the couch as he goes to try on all his new clothes. He hollers from the hallway and says “Ummm, did you shop in the teenage section? I don’t think it’s supposed to look like this” I say “Just  get out here babe!  And here comes my poor hubby looking like a sausage ready to explode! One sneeze and he would’ve looked like the “Incredible Hulk” after his shirt was shredded! I fell on the floor laughing and the rest of the family couldn’t stop laughing either! I pretty much peeled it off of him and wonder how did he even get it on??? Thank goodness we can laugh and not get offended! Needless to say that shirt was stored for anyone who could fit into it (it’s still stored lol). The material was nice and the pattern was pretty kewl. Although we haven’t used the shirt it was worth the money because we laughed ourselves silly! FYI: Be smart and order larger lol"
3.0,I found it difficult to reproduce the the uses in the illustration.
3.0,I like the color of these pants but i have to constantly pull them up while working out. The fabric isn’t really breathable and I feel extra sweaty by my lady parts which is uncomfortable. I order this in a medium and I should have sized down. I do enjoy the pocket just wish it didn’t slip so much
3.0,"Not what I expected. Looks good on model, but looked like a nighty on me."
3.0,Beautiful but a little smaller than I expected.
3.0,They're cute but that's about it the padding on your feet at first it feels like they're comfortable but within 2 weeks the padding flattens out I would not buy them again they're cheap
3.0,"Ok, but disappointed in the style."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Cool style but my nose pieces were made uneven. I debated just exchanging them but figured Id just get new defected ones. I adjusted them to fit better, but you can obviously tell I adjusted them."
3.0,Giving it 3 stars because I'm nice...cheap made fabric is not soft...almost too small
3.0,"Very nice slippers, but thought I was ordering a size 12. It's European sizing, so they are too small."
3.0,"I Ordered this coat for my wife because it looked nice in the picture and she needed a winter coat. It arrived and we were disappointed. The coat we ordered was a size small yet the fit of the coat itself was much closer to that of a large. The style was outdated and did not look like the one in the picture. The material is nice and the coat is comfortable but again nothing to write home about. If this was a $25 coat I would be a lot more forgiving but once you are pushing over $70 I expect a whole new game. I expect it to feel great, the quality to be top notch, and the fit to be correct.<br />Its not a bad coat but i would certainly not recommend it"
3.0,"It’s very pretty, but the fabric liner sheds. There are always little flecks of fabric on the lenses when I take them out, so I have to wrap them in a lens wipe before putting them in the case. The fabric isn’t rough, but it’s not quite soft either, and I wouldn’t put it past scratching my lenses if jostled around a bit. I’ve also used the case for contacts. It’s the perfect size to fit an average size contact lens case, a smaller sized bottle of lense cleaner, and one of the flat shaped style bottle of eye drops."
3.0,"Small, it’s good for kids 3 and under."
3.0,"A gift for my daughter and her charm bracelet. She's pleased and I am too. Took way too long to arrive, however."
3.0,"Outside the glove gets very wet and saturated so touch screen functions aren't the best, but your hand does stay dry inside."
3.0,This shirt has very very long sleeves.  I got a pink shirt and the material is thin but not too clingy. It is long enough to wear with leggings. I am 5'6 and 180 lbs. It hit the bottom of my hips. I think I will have to cut off the sleeves and sew up a new hem to my wrist. It hangs way past my fingers.  I got the XL size ( my bust size is 45)  and it fits perfectly except for the length of the sleeves.
3.0,Old looking .. doesn’t stay “gold” long
3.0,The ends don't snap in properly so you really can't wear them unless you tape them. I really love them tho they seem nice other  then then not staying in  to each other.
3.0,Nice but more like a training bra
3.0,Would like a new one
3.0,"I really love the color, the top is a little short."
3.0,"This was part of an order for 2 Polo shirts. They arrived on time, but I quickly realized I needed size XL instead of the large. Returned both shirts and ordered the larger size. Amazon made it easy to return them and get the size I needed."
3.0,Fun look but very much made on the cheap.
3.0,They are a good size but smell a bit odd. May try to show them and see if that helps
3.0,"UPDATE: (this review is for the orange color) bumped from 4 stars to 1. Wore once in the lake, washed cold and air dried, and it seemed fine despite some initial watermarks that came out in the wash. Wore to the pool and beach yesterday and the color bled ALL OVER my beach towel and the suit has gone from neon traffic cone orange (i literally bought it because i wanted a neon orange bikini) to patchy, bled-out coral. It's ruined. Also the seams twist really bad after just 2 wears. I'm so disappointed. Brand new, this was exactly what I wanted and it's trashed after literally wearing it twice. I wish i could get my money back.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: changing to a 3 star review because the seller gave me a full refund. :)<br /><br />Original 4 star review:<br />Pros: Fits great (5'4, 135 lbs, 32d, curvy/athletic) I got a medium based on the size chart and other reviewers. The material is so soft, the color is vibrant, and I was concerned about the hi cut/cheeky look on me, but it's honestly so cute.<br /><br />Cons: The material is pretty thin and probably won't hold up long, and I wore this to swim in the lake yesterday and it wound up with some water stains? I'm curious to see if it'll get back to normal in the wash or if it's permanently messed up after one swim. lol I'll update my review after the wash."
3.0,still wearing these today
3.0,Fabric is lined which is good. Quality is average. Fabric is a bit heavier than expected. I purchased the yellow and it is much brighter in person.
3.0,it fit my 11 year old tightly on XL
3.0,"It's okay.  It's a little utilitarian.  The clips are like office clips.  I bought it along with one that has pearls to use to pull my tank dress straps closer together in the back so they stop falling off my shoulder when I'm at work.  They do the job, but the pearl one I bought is better.  I wish they looked less like office clips.  I had been using office clips before and wanted something that at least looked more stylish.  I guess for price I can't complain."
3.0,I love my case but the wrist strap broke within a week and the credit card slots are starting to come apart.
3.0,"The back pack itself is adorable and sturdy product... it is a bit small, but my daughter is only in kindergarten so it’ll work fine for her."
3.0,Amazon sent wrong size.  But the shirt looks very nice.
3.0,the second ring shown breaks very easily but the biggest ring is very nice and sturdy the smallest one is alright it doesnt break as easy but it is very thin. also only the two small rings are adjustable. i wouldnt buy this item if i were you. the only one i get use out of is the large one.
3.0,Definitely size up. Shrunk in dryer
3.0,The front of the socks are great but the backside is just plain white.  Nowhere does it say that so I was a little disappointed.  The socks are also thin.
3.0,I like this skirt but the waist was just a little too small.  But will keep it.
3.0,after couple washes doesn't look so great
3.0,I love the style but the quality of the fabric is lacking. I guess for the price it is a good buy. I would go a size up if I bought again.
3.0,"This sports bra is fine for working out but it's just nothing special. It's your standard racer-back bra with those triangular pad inserts that you can buy anywhere for a lot less than $20. In fact, you can get a sports bra that is more stylish with multiple straps or a more unique design. Unlike other reviewers, I found that it fit as expected. I'm a 36B and usually wear size medium and this fit like all my other medium sports bras."
3.0,"Love these pants. Not thin and hang well. I ordered a black, navy blue and charcoal. I would give it 5 stars but the black and blue look the same color. Very disappointed in that difference or being sent the wrong color. Black is the more important color in a dress wardrobe"
3.0,Is To small
3.0,"This item runs big - I usually get a big and this was a tent.  Drawstring is on the inside, didn't like the way the jacket laid on the outside.  Returned it."
3.0,They are just as described but run super big. I will be keeping the larger size because my son's feet grow eventually
3.0,"I am returning these because they are not comfortable. I love the way they look, but I wouldn’t be able to wear them even for a short while."
3.0,"Like the title says, “it’s not worth it, but I kept it.” The reviews are mostly true….lacking quality, fit is weird, fabric is horrible, etc etc. this item could possibly be purchased off of eBay for $5 from China. With that being said, I would prefer to purchase this on sale for $14 from Amazon, knowing that I could return this easily if I wanted to. The fabric quality is horrible, but the stitching seems ok. The sizing is definitely off. Some people say that it’s too wide, but for me, it was too small. I’m a 36DDD and I was barely able to fit the girls in the size L (I’m normally a size L). This is probably due to the fact that this shirt is 100% polyester. There is ZERO stretch in the fabric here, ladies. So if you teeter totter between two sizes, size up. Arm size hole, however, was not an issue for me. Some ladies have complained about this. Again, no stretch here, so I wouldn’t go around doing yoga in this shirt. Lastly, the shirt is a bit short for me. Probably because the large shelf up North takes up most of the fabric use. With all of that being said, I’m still keeping it because it follows a stupid theme I need to follow for a party. It’s super cute if no one touches this shirt, doesn’t look up close and see that this is a horrible fabric, and if you’re not trying to do crazy dance moves in it. Style is 100% as pictured and you’ll definitely look cute at a party at night."
3.0,The patterns and colors are nothing like depicted on this page. That's fine because the pattern and color didn't really matter. But the frustrating part is that it claims to have a covered waistband when in reality only the outside elastic is covered. On the inside it is completely exposed and uncomfortable.
3.0,Give good support and protection for feet.
3.0,Nice enough chain. Much thinner than I expected and I find the clasp very hard to get open. Maybe a little pricey for what it is.
3.0,I wanted the watch  for my self but when I opened the package the band screw was out band to small but over all I like the watch
3.0,It looked liked it had been washed a few times
3.0,too big of a piece
3.0,"I bought this item for my 10 year old son. Although I ordered the size he usually wears, this item was much too big, both in the waist and length. The fabric was thin and it didn't appear that it would wear well on an active boy."
3.0,Great shirt unfortunately slim fit in arms & waist. Only if you're in shape!
3.0,It's alright for what it is. It's low quality and not as displayed but what do you expect from a 3 dollar ring
3.0,"I chose a Large due to it being a US M. Im typically a medium\small. I should have chosen a M to get a US small. Having to return this item. Otherwise, its very cute :)"
3.0,"It is made of cheap looking material which is okay since it did not cost that much; however, there are not enough links in the chain so it does not fit tight enough around my neck."
3.0,Dress is very pretty and fits true to size.  What the pictures don't show is that the liner stops at the knee and you can see where it stops since it's see through.
3.0,Not good quality. They developed alot of pulls in the stocking after just one use.
3.0,"I ordered the patterned scarf. The pattern did not match the display. The color scheme was similar but the pattern was not quite right. In fact, I thought the pattern on the scarf I received looked chintzy,  I also found the scarf to be to short and stiff to work with. I was expecting more of tshirt stretch but this particular scarf was more like a stiff jersey blend.  I did like that the borders are all hemmed but overall it just did not meet my expectations."
3.0,While the quality is great & it arrived quickly-- the sizing runs big
3.0,"It looks exactly like the picture. However, the jewels were not attached properly and are starting to peel off."
3.0,"Didn't look the way I expected when I tried it on, so I ended up returning it. The material was thinner than expected as well."
3.0,The necklace is beautiful but the green is not the same as the pictured one. It is more of a hunter green. I like it but the picture is misleading and it was a gift so I probably would have gotten a different color had I known.
3.0,Be aware that the first day of the week on this calendar instead of the usual Sunday.
3.0,"These look more like a thicker jersey material in the pics, but they aren't. They are more like a stiff cotten or polyester material. There is no care tag, material, or made in tag anywhere on the shorts, just a size tag.<br />They arent a bad pair of shorts but don't  lay the they are pictured, pretty sure the pic is not the short I received."
3.0,"These are super trendy and have lasted me a while. I went back and bought a second pair when I thought I lost my first ones. I found my original pair but do not regret getting a second. For this price point, they are amazing."
3.0,"The actual ring was nice; it looked slightly tarnished in one spot, but I was able to clean it up.  I guess my only complaint, and it may seem trivial to some, is that they advertise that it comes in a gift wrap box. Other people who left feedback even posted pictures of their boxes. Mine came in a little plastic bag. Wouldn't be a big deal except I got it as a Valentine's Day gift for my 14 year old and it was delivered on Valentine's Day, so when it came in a little bag, I didn't have a gift box on hand to put it in to give it to her.  Slightly disappointing, although not a deal breaker since I obviously made the purchase for the actual ring. She's only had the ring for less than a week, so I'll update my review if anything goes wrong with it. They did include two extra 'gifts', but I have no idea what they are (bracelets? anklets?), but they are cheaply made and wouldn't even stay closed."
3.0,Large was huge!
3.0,Nice shirt. Perfect to size. But it just seems to go off centered after awhile and seems like a irregular.
3.0,very large lenses. not what i was looking for.
3.0,"Good price, but it smells."
3.0,"This sweater is a crop top and is see through. It's cute, but be aware of this before purchasing."
3.0,The dress pattern is very pretty but it is definitely not a size medium. I'm 5'2 150 pounds and usually a medium this is more like a small size. the length is fine but it is much more clingy than I thought it would be. Hopefully i can loose some weight and it will fit fine.
3.0,"This belt is good, but very short!"
3.0,Overall the dress is okay but feels cheap. The fabric reminds me of a type of plastic and for over $30 I was hoping for something better. The zipper is nice. It looks like the image so if you don't care about how it feels then it's fine.
3.0,I got these today and didn't think they worked but I messed with them  a bit and found that you have to feel around the paws for crinkly plastic and pull to separate  it from the battery.. They're cute and only fit small heads but they stink like someone held it under their arms and sweat on them.
3.0,Not enough length. I order the 3X and it was still to short. I love everything else about it though.
3.0,Too big for my wrist. I wear it as an ankle bracelet. Quality and price is good
3.0,I'm 5'6 at 215lbs. Ordered 3XL. Fits well everywhere except my arms (too small).
3.0,"The overall fit was good. What I'm having a problem with is the overall quality of the controller prints. On the product page it shows a vibrant black background with crisp controllers. The product I received isn't does not look as dark as in the picture, the controllers look like they were blown up to look bigger and lost some of the overall quality. I'm going to keep it, but I'm not fully satisfied with the overall print quality of the product."
3.0,"Shirt is great material and fits just right. The pants are super thin and almost didn't fit. Needless to say, it fits just right. Other than that, I would have given it a 5 star. Super fast shipping!"
3.0,Cute dress. Fabric is very thing VERY.
3.0,Ordered two of these cabochons and neither one has even a tiny bit of white running through it. The pictures are deceiving. Still pretty though.
3.0,The product was cute and all but it comes wide and big. My baby sister is usually a size four or five but when she tried it on it was way to big I recommend getting one size smaller so it can fit
3.0,"This looks like a maternity shirt, honestly. The top part of it fits great but the flair out on the bottom makes it seem like it’s a maternity top. That may be great for some people’s style but just wasn’t for me. Will be returning."
3.0,"So I own a pair of Stoggles, wanted to see if there were any other brands that worked just as well. I will say I like the shielding of this style better, but there is like NO anti-fog whatsoever. So that's a huge con for me."
3.0,The shiny black stones are very pretty but I have extra small wrists and the bracelet was uncomfortable for me to wear. I returned the item since I did not care for the looks as much in person as I did in the picture. I one blue bead was not what I expected.
3.0,This band is very pretty but I am not sure of the durability. It feels a bit flimsy in both the material and hardware.
3.0,"Adorable. But, ordered 2 sets & within 2 hrs being outside in the sun, 4 out of 6 hats fell off the  headbands. Just a small dash of glue was seen. It was easily repairable but not that day. Hopefully they will hold up with my glue next year."
3.0,"I got a large.The bottom was still too small. The top fit well, though. I am 129 lbs with a large behind and C cup breasts. So maybe if you aren't as curvy it will fit perfect."
3.0,"Looks great! Size is way too big for my wife and the size is not adjustable. Other than that, great product!"
3.0,"Like other reviewers, I also received one cufflink that worked and one that didn't.  The design is absolutely wonderful but I wish they both worked.  I will update my review after talking to the company."
3.0,"The coat piece was just a little too small. My preferred bra band size is 34 (for comfort) but I always get measured at 32. When I do it myself, my bust usually measures to about 32.5 - 33 so I assume Extra Small would be the right size, but I couldn't even get it close to shutting. And I wear an A cup, so it's not like breast size was an issue. Returning and getting a size Small instead and will update my review.<br />Update: the Small is too big on me. Even with a Victoria's Secret Miraculous bra (super padded, increase by 2 cup sizes) it's too loose. I'm going to take in the waist on the coat, but taking in the sleeves would require a lot of work that I'm not willing to do. So I have very baggy sleeves. They're also slightly too long for me. The skirt is also a little bit loose, but not terribly. Plus, it comes with suspenders to hold it up, but I have a feeling they would chafe me.<br />Be aware that the coat is lined with a synthetic material and you should expect to get hot in it.<br />The chain is made of cheapy tinsel-y cording that has been braided. The dragon pin is cool, though."
3.0,I love these pants but they're a little to small on me...do u have them in a 3x?? If so can we please do an exchange as soon as possible?? Thank you
3.0,"Very comfortable, perfect size. My only issue is that the bottoms are very see through. I got the peach colored ones so that could be it. Still won’t be wearing the bottoms out in public"
3.0,My husband loves these socks. He is a huge halo fan. The detail was nice on the socks but they were thin making the quality poor.
3.0,Very thin.  Wasn't what it appeared to be.  Runs small.
3.0,I received this for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest review. These pants look great but they run smaller than they say. I wear a medium but what I got was more of a small and didn't fit.
3.0,"Really wanted to like these jelly shoes because they're a cute, glittery, updated version of the pair I had as a child. The &#34;cage&#34; is very narrow and made it impossible to get my foot in. I don't have wide feet, but I know they're not the most narrow either. Would have probably been able to make these work if I sized up."
3.0,"I love this romper, unfortunately I'll have to spend some time altering this so it fits. I'm 5'6&#34; & about 100 lbs. I usually wear a size 0/XS so I was expecting this item to be slightly loose on me but with the cinch waist I wasn't overly concerned.... The size small was actually so large that it fit my friend who normally wears  a size large! It's a shame that it fits so poorly, it is a REALLY CUTE romper. The keyhole back and the pockets are adorable!"
3.0,Too expensive. Cheap metal.
3.0,I like it but the charm is really small
3.0,"It was a great coat, looks really good on him. But the zipper broke really quick."
3.0,I ordered it because of the color of the picture but it was not the color I was expect it was much lighter which sucks because I needed the color it was supposed to be
3.0,Dress is very wrinkled. Tried to steam it in the dryer but it only helped slightly.<br /><br />Dress is also very sheer and made of a cheap material.<br /><br />However I do like the look and fit.
3.0,"Shoes look hot, just are not very sturdy. Would not be good to wear out in public or for long periods of time, but good for role-play."
3.0,Band stretched out after 1 week.
3.0,"It works okay, but it's flimsier that I expected. The bill part collapses more than it should."
3.0,"I normally wear a size large/ extra large....after reading the reviews, I ordered a 2 X and it fits fine.  The color of the shirt is beautiful. It is very wrinkly though.  I like it and will wear it when I feel like ironing!!"
3.0,"This is an ok umbrella weight for using on the beach or if you have a table with a hole in it for support, but it's really not good for using without a table since there's not enough stability. It holds enough weight if you're at the beach and can sink it a few inches into the sand also, but won't hold if you're on solid ground."
3.0,"Over-sized and shapeless, but will work in a pinch for a rain storm."
3.0,Don't like the material and runs small.
3.0,"The purse itself is nice, but the zipper is not good quality - it's starting to jam any time the purse is pretty full, which is disappointing."
3.0,"Super cute, warm and comfy, but they are very short and not real stretchy."
3.0,"Ok, but thought I was getting the 3 pair pack. So pay attention"
3.0,"I absolutely loved this watch, its beautiful and sleek.  Only problem I had was than the band kept twisting around my wrist and it would not hold the time consistently.  Almost every morning I had to set the time, but once I got home after work and took it off I guess it decided to stop.  Anyway the seller was understandable and gave me a refund."
3.0,"32/33 was more like a 35!<br /><br />Also, note that the water spout is pink! Like it was a white washed with reds.  Yeah, not the color scheme I was going for."
3.0,"After using it for several weeks the band is already fraying. I take it off about twice per day, once to shower and once to fix the tension because it comes loose. I still like it better than the normal band, but I expect I’ll need to replace this within a couple months, so don’t expect a long life from this.<br /><br />For context, I work at a desk all day. The extent of my rigorous use is purely from CrossFit, so I’m not actively straining the band doing construction or anything."
3.0,"These are basic board-length swim trunks, true to size in the Large.  They’re very lightweight—so lightweight I worried that they’d be see-through, but they’re not.<br /><br />I like the pattern; it looks very summer-y.  But because the fabric is so lightweight, these trunks cling a lot when you come out of the water."
3.0,I like the look of the dress but the sleeves are some what tight.
3.0,"I like the fit of these, and the clarity, but honestly, the amount they darken in bright sunlight is so subtle you barely notice it.  Pretty much straight-up false advertising, if you go by the photos they're showing on Amazon.  Probably I'll return these."
3.0,"Nice design and very interesting, although there are too many details missing and I wasn't given what was shown and depicted."
3.0,"This is a pretty suit. I love the blue color, but I'd prefer some sort of pattern to distract from my imperfections. The skirt starts just below my stomach, accentuating my pot belly, which is obviously not what I'm going for. The bottom half fits ok, not too large and not too small, but if you're looking to hide your mid section, this suit is not for you. The top half would probably support my large bust if I tied it tightly around my neck, but there is not enough material for sufficient coverage in the chest area, so I end up falling out the sides. I like the design and it looks good on the model, but this suit is not for me, so I will be returning it for a refund.<br />This item was provided at a discounted price, or for free, in return for an honest and unbiased review."
3.0,"little deceiving, but well made, I am keeping and lining it with some faux fur I have, and it will be just right"
3.0,color is not a true burgundy but still works I guess.
3.0,"Good construction, a little hard to work with by yourself though.<br /><br />I wasn't able to wear it because my wrists are too large but my friend was, and it worked well."
3.0,The floral print is cute and my daughter really likes it but you can not put a standard #2 pencil in the pencil pouch. It will hold mechanical pencils and some pens but not a #2 pencil.
3.0,It's a beautiful dress. My youngest was very happy. But it was very snug getting it on bc there's no elastic when you pull it on. She will be unable to play with it long. I got the bigger size but she's only 3. Her Father wouldn't even try to help her with it bc it has no give. It did it's job for Halloween and she was beautiful but I wouldn't buy it again if I could go back.
3.0,A bit smaller than expected. Color is horrid. Otherwise it's OK. XL is actually a M.
3.0,Product shows it comes with 3 pcs but only arrived with one
3.0,"Nice blouse, to small. It didn't fit to size though. I gave away right away."
3.0,Pocket too small.
3.0,Didn't fall nice at all.  Had to get it adjusted
3.0,"Size too small,not comfortable"
3.0,"It’s a cute fine dress but I’m disappointed the color is nothing like the picture at all, it’s a much more faded muted blue than what is shown"
3.0,Good design but very thinly woven it states paper woven and they meant it i feel like it will tear any moment if not careful its so thin
3.0,"Disappointed, cap looks very cheap"
3.0,"When people says the color bleeds, listen.<br />Here I am currently trying to clean this shirt for the 5th time but it’s only getting worse.<br />Once you wear it once, don’t wash it smh.<br />It’s amazing to do my morning cardio in, in the cold weather but please don’t purchase unless you have money to blow."
3.0,The blue is more of a mixed blue with white
3.0,These were great but in 6 months time they have started to separate and I’ve had to glue them back together. I don’t wear these a lot so there’s not a bunch of wear and tear which is why I’m so surprised.
3.0,These are super cute on but they scuff really easy and you have to scrub to get the marring off. I’m not crazy about the comfort or material as it’s not flexible and the chunky platform feels like you strapped on a few bricks. Other than that they are just okay.
3.0,"The print is pretty, but the top of the dress is bulky and doesn’t lay properly."
3.0,Pretty but pee size chart runs small. I have to return.
3.0,"These were cute, but seriously muffled our voices. We had to pull them down to understand each other. Ended up switching to paper masks our next day in Disneyland."
3.0,I bought the same size as I normally do generally and also in this brand of jacket but this one is really tight in the shoulders and arms. I'm also not a fan of how the print looks it looks sort of dumpy.
3.0,"It’s ok ,, I just don’t like the material"
3.0,Much larger than I thought it would be
3.0,"Fit is very awkward, very low cut as well. I have full size breast and was uncomfortable wearing this dress. The only time I was fun to wear it, is when we went to FL and I had swimsuit underneath. Size wise: run big. I normally wear size S/M and I ordered this in S,  it was way too big."
3.0,"This jacket is very cute. For me, personally somewhat small.  I would recommend to go up a size. This material does attract a lot of lint."
3.0,"Nice hat, but packaged poorly. The top of the cap had been pushed down to fit it into the box. It has taken quite a bit of work to steam the hat back into it's proper shape."
3.0,Like the style but way too big
3.0,I thought it would be more plushy/softer than it was.
3.0,"Very clingy, thin and revealing."
3.0,"The article received does not bring the mask shown in the publication, if I do not get a response I will proceed to return it."
3.0,"BEAUTIFUL dress, great quality, runs SMALL.  I wear a 14/16 in US sizes, a XXL is usually the right Asian size for me.  This particular dress, however, runs small."
3.0,Love the fit. Buy the darker color or get a cami. The white is see through.
3.0,The two standard pockets are tiny.  Can't even fit my whole hand inside them.  I guess you'll need the cargo pockets because the standard ones are pretty much useless.
3.0,This isn't true to size at all so the small was too large for me. It's a good quality and would be able to be adjusted
3.0,The material is way too thin. Cute dress but poor quality. Fits as expected. If you are skinny it’s loose fitting. Perfect length for shorter person
3.0,Purchased the toddler size 5 and they are at least 2 sizes too big for my daughter. They are cute but she won't be able to wear them any time soon. Hoping to love them more once she grows into them.
3.0,"The shirts were made of nice stretchy go back To Shape fabric, but sooo short. Really disappointed in that."
3.0,It's a nice dress just size down I got a large and it's pretty big could have gotten a medium.
3.0,"Just got them today! Ao far its okay, however I'm missing a pair so, 3 stars for that."
3.0,Looks and feels much better than expected.  Doesn't feel like sapphire glass as mentioned- sounds like plastic.
3.0,"The glasses are cute but I did not receive 6 pairs, I received 5 pairs and they did not provide the protective pouches for all pairs. It came with 3 drawstring pouches."
3.0,"Good quality, but arms are too short to reach ears. Ended up fitting my son and he loves them."
3.0,I'm not that tall (approx. 5'3) and my torso is average ....this was an XL (I usually wear a 4/S/M) and it was a little too short and the bust was being pulled down by the fabric that connects it to the bottom.  Quality is OK
3.0,It's rather big and awkward built it's okay but I would not reorder.
3.0,Zipper was broken 😕
3.0,"Good product, but needs more lift on top of the arch area."
3.0,Son okay pero no los volvería a comprar la corea se corre no se queda a la medida de tu mano eso es muy incomodo tener que arreglarla en cada momento pero la cálida es buena
3.0,"Product came late Bc of Covid even Amazon said it was lost and I started a return of puchase even though I didn’t even receive it at the time. And the next day or two it came. Some of the masks seem to be smaller in the ear loops more tight than others couldn’t fit my face but fit my kids. I bought it for the whole family anyways. Second the stitching on the ear loop didn’t stitch all the way and some material sticks out. When I didn’t get the masks at the original time I contacted seller and the next day they responded they were good at communicating what was going on and at one point even they thought it was lost. But after I received the product and cancel the return and asked maybe for a discount Bc they were not all the same and the stiching, I didn’t here from them again. It’s a good value for the amount of masks. But quality is so so half are stretchy and the others are good for a teenager and young child. If you don’t mind a perfect stitch and different size then it will be good for you and it’s thick quilting material on the inside so u will sweat if u do fast walking/running"
3.0,Cheap quality but my son enjoys using it you think it’s real gold but it works
3.0,"If you have large boobs do NOT buy!! Once I tried it on, it didn't look the way I expected and my boobs were too big. I have 36DD-36DDD boobs for reference."
3.0,Two pairs had tiny holes in them which ripped the moment I put them on.
3.0,"I’m 6’ and 150lbs. I ordered a medium. It was nice and long and I loved the top half. The area around my butt and upper thighs was oddly snug, and I’m not big in that area. I returned it since it looks weird with it randomly snug in one spot."
3.0,"Does not fit tightly on my 2"" receiver.  Feels like it will fall out when driving."
3.0,The shirt doesn't exactly fit how I expected it to. The off shoulder side with the ruffle doesn't look the same in person.
3.0,Needed to be bigger holes for my mask
3.0,"I am 5’5”, 130 pounds, size Medium.<br />These overalls are light weight and comfortable. They are not made out of denim, which I like. Originally, I bought a large (all attached pictures are of the Medium) because I wanted a baggy fit... they were huge. Don’t size up. I exchanged them for a medium and they fit much better. They are still pretty wide in the waist but they are supposed to be baggy. The legs are baggy enough that I can wear leggings under them comfortably. Other reviews mentioned that the hardware on them is cheap- I would agree with that, but I am thinking of just replacing it myself. The bib does not cover the bust (and I don’t think it is supposed to), so if you want them to cover the bust, don’t buy. And, no, the bib would not cover my bust if I adjusted the straps... it would just cause them to ride up into my crotch. The pockets are nice and deep! 5 pockets: one on the bib, two in front and two in back. My iPhone 6 fits in the pockets with the otter box on. The length is longer on me than on the model, but I am glad for that. I can even turn them up once and they are still a good length. The green is a great color! Overall, I’m happy with my purchase and will be keeping them."
3.0,"It's cute, works reasonably well, but won't last long.  Really cheap guts on this one.  That's too bad, because it's a cool looking watch...."
3.0,"Nice, but not a lot of stretch"
3.0,"Daughter only tried on the skirt then had to return as it was too small in the waist. We used the provided size chart provided and it was just a little too snug. Perhaps order a size up. This is a high waisted style so don't think you will be able to pull it down or adjust at all<br /> The fabric also seemed a little thin and didn't seem to have the fullness of the picture but again, we only tried it on then sent it back."
3.0,"Not the greatest, there are several gaps around my eyes"
3.0,Looks nice but I thought it was going to be more like a letterman jacket but it's all cloth it feels cheaply made. I will give a updat once my daughter has worn it a couple times.
3.0,"I think that this item generally looks cuter in the picture than it actually is. The colors are about the same, even though they look a little faded in person. The fit is okay but might be more of a maternity shirt because it has the tendency to make you look pregnant. Quality is good enough for the price. I just wasn't a big fan...makes me feel a little frumpy and fat instead of cute and summery."
3.0,Good stone but the metal prongs are made from a cheap metal that turns orange and made my skin green.
3.0,make sure you measure from the outer edges of the 2 hooks not between the hooks. otherwise its comfortable fabric and works exactly as needed.
3.0,Not exactly a beanie
3.0,"Comes in a cute gift box and the photos are great quality some are smooshed together but still okay.<br />I'm just really disappointed that they are all in backwards order. I wanted them to be cute to sexy as a surprise for my boe. But, they're not. Note, you do have to wind them back up by hand"
3.0,Cute but slip off easily
3.0,This looks just as advertised but be warned It gave me a hell of a rash now i didnt just one star it because it may just be something that affected me but be warned
3.0,"These are super comfy and cute, BUT I bought a couple months ago and it has pulled like crazy! It looks like I’ve owned it for years instead. Super disappointed by that."
3.0,"First of all, I paid $10 more just a week ago, so I feel I was cheated a bit. It really is worth less than that, more like what they're charging now. Aside from that, it is a charming little bracelet. I had hoped to buy another for my daughter, however it runs small and I think it will be too tight. Wish it had a little more stretch."
3.0,The medium is too big and the small is too small.  I was at brunch with friends wearing this and the zipper busted right open.  I'm 5'2&#34; and 110 lbs
3.0,Super cheap product. The features are poorly created.
3.0,"I was really excited for this dress, but I returned it because I just didn't like the fabric (it reminds me a lot of a graduation gown) and I couldn't get the collar to sit right."
3.0,It is a good bag but having identical pockets in back and front makes it Difficult to find your stuff
3.0,They’re very nice sunglasses but wearing them on the top glass of the car it looks like a rainbow in a fog so the polarization is not back out on the sunglasses
3.0,love the top but arm little tight and i had buy 5xl but am a 4xl and even top in the arm area are to big. this one is opposite of that. the back of the neck part rubs a little thank expected.
3.0,"The bow accent is definitely nice, but description should be added that it's shorty short."
3.0,"i want for humid NYC summers & there's too much material here, makes it bulky & too warm. Cute detail at the waist. Make cooler skirts with pockets!"
3.0,"The quality isn't that great to wear for formal occasions, but it will be fun for a Christmas party."
3.0,"These work well, but they're way smaller than I thought they would. I wish these would come in a medium size....a size between these and the other ones."
3.0,My bands were not all small. So I can not use them. I have petite wrist. I live them just can't keep them in place if I use them
3.0,"This layered necklace would be ideal for someone with a dainty, slim neck.  I can usually wear a 16” chain comfortably; however the jeweled necklace felt like a choker even though I adjusted it as much as I could. The longer necklace was very simple to adjust with just a tug on the chain. By midday, the two got tangled together and became uncomfortable (see picture). I was bummed because at work, I received compliments on what a pretty necklace it was."
3.0,"Pretty, but not quite what I was looking for."
3.0,A little snug in the breast area.
3.0,"It think its a great idea, but they are very difficult to put on."
3.0,Nice looking hat. Fits a little small. Not sure why the green color hat more expensive. They all should be the same price.
3.0,Looks nice but the pictures makes the web look longer than it really is. Not as expected.
3.0,"THese socks seem to be good quality, but they are not comfortable.  Very disappointing since I bout 4 pairs."
3.0,No pompom - which is fine just misleading - not thick at all- ok more for chilly weather certainly not for cold
3.0,"Bought 2 XL sweatshirts.  Compared to my least shrunk, largest Russell XL (also a 50/50 cotton/polyester, so it shouldn't have shrank much), the new sweatshirts are perhaps a whole size larger.<br /><br />I can't imagine these sweatsheats shrink 3/23= 13%, but perhaps they do.  The new one measures 3&#34; longer in torso length than the old one, and 4&#34; longer in sleeves.  The circumference of torso and sleeves is proportionally larger as well.<br /><br />I'm returning the XLs and ordering replacement Ls.  Good thing I'm trialing Prime right now.<br /><br />The quality seems as good as the old shirts, maybe better."
3.0,Nice with very stretchy material.but to small. I have to give it away unfortunately.
3.0,"Really tight around the rib cage, is very smooth though but does need some breaking in."
3.0,"After washing, this shrinks...  worse than other colors purchased previously from Lands' End."
3.0,It popped 2seconds after putting on
3.0,"Great lining, very warm, but fit much smaller than I expected."
3.0,It's exactly what you'd expect from China. It looks good on the internet but what you get is usually something else. These shirts just happen to look great on me. When you're thin you can wear anything! But these are super tight. I don't think they even make the size that they advertised on the model. Other than the size being predictably too small and the visual on the internet being incredibly inaccurate again I liked the shirts and will keep them.
3.0,A bit tight on the tummy. Super soft
3.0,Pretty but it just doesn’t fit right
3.0,Like tent fabric. Makes crinkly noise. Not like the other sun shirts I bought.
3.0,"So let me first say, I really like this wallet. The money clip part is nice, it has rubber under it to keep the bill secure. The way that credit cards fan out when you open it is very cool and easy to find the card you are looking for. It feels solid and well-built, and the clasp feels solid. However, it's not even a little waterproof. I tried it out this weekend, and after just 20 seconds in a foot of water, it was completely full of water. Luckily, credit cards dont care, and money is linen so it dries. But still, if it is advertised that way, it should at least be a LITTLE water resistant.<br /><br />That being said, if I lost it, I would buy it again. Waterproof is not that big of a deal when it comes to a wallet for me."
3.0,I’m not a fan of the material it’s a little to thin for me. If you don’t have any imperfections this might be ok for you. They do run pretty true to size.  I’m returning mine because of the material.
3.0,Just an ok shoe.  not what I was expecting. I think they'd be more comfortable and look sexier if they had a platform : - )
3.0,"Good looking and very warm snow hat. Comes with a face mask that covers nose and mouth which clips on to ears.<br />The fabric itself is good in the rain and snow as it repels water well. The front flap looks nice and useful on dry days to tuck things like paper or the face mask. The chip strap is easy to use and it can also be used to keep the side flaps up.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It has a strong sweet-like smell. Maybe that is how rabbit fur smells? Your nose gets insensitive to it after a while until you put it on again. Also, others notice it as well. I do not like it. I am hoping the smell dissipates.<br /><br />Hearing sound is muffled so much that it is dangerous not being able to hear your surroundings. There is no hole for the ear underneath the ear flap! The buttons are to keep the ear flaps down, but there are no buttons to keep the flaps up. Crazy.<br /><br />Maybe a production error, but it looks silly having ""J&A"" brand name tag sewn upside-down.<br /><br />Considering the price as well, this hat would not be my first choice. It will keep your head warm, though."
3.0,"The batteries in this package are great, just like the ones my Hubsan H502e came with. No problem whatsoever after several charge cycles. The charger however, died after only 2 - 3 uses. It will keep the LED on as if it were charging the batteries, but it does not charge them at all. Complete garbage charger."
3.0,looks great but didn't buy.
3.0,"Strap seems to work okay, I haven't had a chance to actually wear it all day. It does look good on my arm. I find that with these like to remove the understrap. This allows me to move the watch around a bit so that it sets properly on my wrist."
3.0,Runs a little big.  You pay for what you get.  Could be a cute beach cover-up or something.  I returned it because I also wasn't a huge have of the way the flowers were printed.  All in all you pay for what you get and its a perfectly fine dress for the price.
3.0,"It’s really cute. I am 5’6 150lbs and got the large and it was nice and fitted. Not too tight though.  Also, I liked that is has long sleeves because I have really long arms and reached nicely. The reason I am giving it 3 stars though is because it feels very thin and low quality. I am not sure how well it will wash. It feels like it will rip easily."
3.0,"I have another MK  like it that I wore out, however was disappointed that this new one needs to be shined up. There is like a waxy residue on the mirror material that will have to be wiped down in order to see the shine. For this price I expected it to be ready for carry... but it HAS to be shined up... bummer. Will update review after I try a soft cloth on it. Hopefully it is not scratched up under this dull residue.  Not an exciting first look. Praying all is good... because this style and mirror gold is my fav."
3.0,Too small. Made more for a child.
3.0,"Unfortunately this fit was very small and tight in the waist and thighs.  Otherwise the quality and feel were excellent.<br /><br />Buy 2 sizes up in my opinion to be sure that you get a fitting pair.<br /><br />As a 20 year member of Amazon I rely on independent reviews when shopping and I will always try to be as honest and impartial as I can and will try to provide helpful insight into the product. I am reviewing this product as it relates to how it works for me in my intended use. I tend to review products that I really like, or that let me down in some manner.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, then please click the ""YES"" link below! Thank you, and HAPPY SHOPPING!"
3.0,So I bought. These in white I didn't get white I got grey. I contacted seller  didn't really get anywhere i was unable to return  i needed them for work asap to hide tattoos. They fit kind of weird. Kind of tight on upper arm . They do keep your arms fairly cool. But every little thing shows up on these.  Would i buy again more than likely not.
3.0,"I gave three stars because the colour is not the same has seen online, colour is dull"
3.0,It’s a cute night shirt. Soft and comfortable but it stays wrinkled. Which is absolutely annoying
3.0,Going off of the reviews I ordered a Large. I'm 5'7 and around 150. I have a long torso. The large was too tight in all the wrong places. I think an XL might work but who knows. The material is stretchy so it would be comfortable if it just fit! Hope this helps someone else out there
3.0,"dress is as described, got a small but it runs very big."
3.0,Cute shoe but extremely wide.
3.0,"The fit around the waist is as expected, but didn't realize it was so long! I'll have to cut mine so that I can wear knee-length skirts with it. It seems to be well-made,though."
3.0,Not a bad product for the cost
3.0,I kept smelling a strange chemical smell in the plastic. so I pitched them
3.0,"I received this item as a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  So I bought a XXL in this top because based on the size chart and the reviews, it was sized like most Asian clothing and ran a couple sizes too small.  OH MAN.  I should have bought a M or possibly a L instead.  The top I received is a tent! I literally can't even wear it to sleep in because I would be just letting my girls hang out the top of it.  It's definitely plus sized, regardless of what the size chart says.  Just for reference, I am 5'4, 153lbs, and I wear a 36D bra.  I am not a tiny girl.  I'm a size 12 in most pants/dresses, so a XXL in Asian sizing is normal for me.<br /><br />Now for the good things.  It's actually very pretty.  It's quite vivid, and the top is very similar to the picture (something that rarely occurs when you purchase patterned clothing from China).  Now, the top appears to be a light cotton material from the picture, but it's not.  It's actually a heavy stretchy type fabric.  It's not bad, but it feels more like you'd wear it to the gym than to dinner.  With that material, I feel like it should fit tight, not loosely as in the photo.<br /><br />All in all, had I gotten a size that I could actually wear, I would have been quite happy with the top.  The fabric is admittedly not what I was hoping for, but it still feels nice and would be quite comfortable.  I would have definitely kept the tank and worn it all over if it had fit me! So 3 stars because overall it really is a fairly nice top, even if it's huge and not exactly what I was expecting."
3.0,The bathing suit is pretty. The only complaint I have is you'd better have someone around to help you hook the straps as your putting on the suit the straps become unhooked  and there is no way to hook it yourself with the suit on.
3.0,Needed something very thin to fit over my compression stockings to wear in public and these  fit the bill.
3.0,They are really pretty and looks durable
3.0,"Cheaply made, as can be expected from the price. However unlike many of the reviews, this hat did not come to us bent, smashed or deformed beyond straightening. Actually just the opposite...it won't loose its shape no matter how hard I try."
3.0,I liked the fit and the colors. It is thin enough to provide an extra layer without being to hot or bulky. However the texture of the fabric is rough. I wear them under my scrubs during the colder months but they are not my favorite ones to wear.
3.0,Print is very pretty. Material is super thin. I ordered an XL it fits like a small. Length is super long. I am 6 ft and it hits me at my ankles.
3.0,Too tall.
3.0,"The fit was disappointing, felt warped.  Would not reorder from this vendor."
3.0,"It’s cute and comfortable but not for me, not for casual clothes."
3.0,Fits as expected but it is really long.  I'm 5'3 and it's dragging the ground.  I like it so I kept it and had it altered.
3.0,Returned this. Was not flattering on me. Maybe cute on someone else.
3.0,A little loose around the arch and close around the toes but no way to go to a smaller or larger size . Size 13 fits long
3.0,"I got it on time, even earlier than I expected. But after I transferred my cards to my new wallet from my old one and zipped it up the zipper broke off. I was so disappointed. 😔"
3.0,Cute but I had that knot taken off by my alterations lady. It was annoying because of the placement being right in front. It would’ve been better on the side.
3.0,it works as expected. There are three down sides.<br />1- not easy to wear with many wires to handle<br />2- one of the grips is opening every 10 mins of walk<br />3- the screw is not good quality<br />and the good side is that it is very comfortable after you wear and divide the weight very nice on your shoulder
3.0,"Nothing fancy, but fits well and basic dark colors."
3.0,Es más talla pero corre muy pequeño y no me quedo
3.0,"Nice fabric but too small, Dickie pullover runs true to size"
3.0,These are good but just don't get them wet they got really rusty over time and stained some of my jeans.
3.0,"I like this robe a lot.  The color is great, the weight of the fabric is not bulky and it keeps me warm while looking stylish. The only thing I don't like is that the sleeves are 3/4 length and I prefer full length sleeves."
3.0,Expected a better corduroy.  They are just ok
3.0,This fit suuuuuper tight and they were a tad yellowish and didn’t match my skin tone. Returned.
3.0,The colors are dull and the fabric Quality isn't nice ☹️
3.0,Look good. Comfortable
3.0,I would have liked the earrings to be larger.  They'll be hard to see as part of a Halloween costume.
3.0,This broke the first time I wore it.  It is pretty though
3.0,Nice product but they run waaaaaayyyy too small. I got a XXL and XXXL and they were basically belly shirts
3.0,This is my second pair and it's already worn out. This is definitely a good quality for women but not for men. I only wore it at home. Good price but not so great quality. I feel this is good for guest that stays one to two nights but cannot wear it every day.
3.0,"Great on the control, but my things were just a little too big for the control top. The fabric does not give at all in that area. They were very uncomfortable to wear for me. The length and overall fit was fine except for my upper thighs."
3.0,Odd fabric.
3.0,These were very nice although they were still too big for my daughter so she can’t wear them. If they had adjustable ear loops they would be so much better
3.0,"This coat looks real cute in pictures. It is just okay. Runs a bit small and the burgundy I ordered is really red. The picture is deceiving. Not sure it is worth the money, but I do get compliments when I wear it."
3.0,Purchased the broach for the 2nd time.<br />The item unhooked itself from my dress while I was standing. The gem flower design on the top right corner fell off once the item hit the floor. I was unable to locate the missing piece. The package does comes with additional rhinestones if needed. The size is perfect and it's true to it's design shown above.
3.0,"This is soft and comfortable, but I have a shorter torso so it droops very low in the back."
3.0,"Wish they had an easier and more comfortable way of putting this on, maybe add a side zipper? Unfortunately it didn't look as flattering on as I imagined, might work better if you have a bigger chest for more support."
3.0,Picture is misleading because they are hip-huggers and not as comfortable as they look.
3.0,The pendant is too thin.  It will bend easily.
3.0,I thought the outside fabric would be thicker.
3.0,One of the zippers broke the first time using it while on the trip.
3.0,"lower price but i highly recommended [[ASIN:B00BBYGW2Y Accoutrements Pigeon Mask]] and [[ASIN:B00K7YRXWW Gmasking Natural Latex Green Pigeon Mask Costume]],i have ever bought from this botn seller."
3.0,Much longer than pictured - I wanted something that lay at the base of my throat like the picture but it was way longer and was hidden under my shirt. Also broken within the first week. Very flimsy chain. Three stars only because it arrived quickly and the packaging was nice. Wouldn’t buy again.
3.0,"Very comfortable so far but as seen in the pic, it is not genuine cowhide"
3.0,it's tight by the ankles
3.0,"They are thin and the ear loops are on the smaller side. I wear a disposable mask underneath. It looks good and I put it around my neck in the morning like a scarf. If I'm caught off guard without a mask, I know I can quickly pull it up."
3.0,I like it and wear it but it's not fitted well. It is comfy if you want frumpy - its cute.
3.0,"Seriously? I wear a 6-8 in pants and maybe a 12 in blouses, because of my chest, but this XL is so tight I look like a burgundy sausage.... So either I send it back (hassle) and get even a bigger size (but will that one look enormous on top?) or, what? Lose weight? I have so many leggings and I really need some reasonably priced tunics..."
3.0,Look and feel great! Just did not last 3 months normal wear.
3.0,"This is a nice looking watch, but after 3 days of wear had noticeable scratches on it. I work in medicine with patients so not the kind of job where the watch is banging around or being worn during lots of physical work. I was disappointed in the quality. It still looks nice enough, keeps time and is comfortable but the quality isn't outstanding."
3.0,"I really liked this watch, but the band is much too short for my wrist. I will give it to my granddaughter. Won't buy again."
3.0,This is weird the shirt are like men’s swim suit material. The bottoms where tight and the top was huge. I’m small chested and pear shaped.
3.0,"To be honest, the Sides of the belt is starting to peel as it goes into the buckle but it smells like leather....so it’s a good deal in that aspect..."
3.0,They aren't the same.  The middle of one is completely black and smashed in.
3.0,"it was fragile, so if you needed to adjust it, slow and carefully .<br />for a costume piece it worked well and was fun.<br />for the price, you can not expect much."
3.0,"This purse is super cute, great fabric, and cute size, but one of the zippers broke during the first week of use.  Very disappointing..."
3.0,"The fabric has changed since I first purchased this shirt. It used to be a polyester/cotton blend, which I loved. Now it is cotton/spandex, so a little clingy for my taste but still okay. What is puzzling is that the buttons fell off the day I unpacked both this shirt and the black one I purchased. I would love to see these made a little longer and more color options, like pastels."
3.0,"Snapped my 3rd day of having it because it's very cheap, but that's why it's 7 bucks. Pretty good buy though"
3.0,Nice but doesn’t stay on keeps falling off
3.0,"Very nice dress but way too small. Even following their measurement chart, it was way too small"
3.0,"Don't buy. Terrible material, too small"
3.0,"I bought 5 different shorts on Amazon for my husband who wanted soft, comfortable, cargo shorts. This pair was his least favorite. He liked that it came with a belt, but “not a particularly nice belt”. It doesn’t have elastic so it’s tighter At the waist and groin area compared to the other pairs. So definitely planning on returning this pair."
3.0,My husband loved these socks as a gift however they already have a hole in them after the third or fourth wear. Wish the quality was better
3.0,Don't get it wrt. It stretches out
3.0,"It's ok. Not terribly flattering, but I guess it covers up the belly/problem area."
3.0,Get a size up on this item. Runs very small and there are not free returns on it if you're prime.
3.0,More of a medium than a large. They are stretching. I wish they had each size as it’s own category. I normally wear a size large/8/9 in jeans.
3.0,Legs are to short
3.0,"Chose a large, being short-waisted.<br />Unfortunately the material causes the pants to slide down some on me.<br />I have stretched them different ways<br />to feel like they fit and do not slide much."
3.0,"Not bad,  it was a little long for me and the prongs on the flower get caught on everything!"
3.0,So very cute and sweet but the bear's arm came off and the skirt started to unravel after the first time my daughter wore it.
3.0,Clingy material if you like your clothes to hug every possible area
3.0,Size up! Not stretchy
3.0,Why so cheap with the material? Length is good however!
3.0,The romper is cute but the top part is very open and the button on the back is hard to button. Returned it
3.0,Nice colours I must say but looks bigger than in the picture and more suitable girls or toddlers with full hair
3.0,It’s cute if you like the clingy material.  Silky Material. Clings to body.
3.0,They are not a bad looking boot. They may be waterproof to rain.. but definitely not work site waterproof or puddle proof. The soles seem to be a very soft rubber. I did not wear them so I can not say much about the durability...
3.0,"I really like the look of these sunglasses, but unfortunately, one piece is scratching the right inside lens whenever they get folded up."
3.0,nice hat just a little too big.
3.0,Pretty dress but ran small. If you do business with this company beware of not receiving your refund!
3.0,"Break easily, too bulky for many clasps."
3.0,"Cheap quality very disappointing. The material is cheap the stitching is cheap. My niece looks cheap in it. If you’re looking for something that looks classy, quality, and cute look elsewhere"
3.0,"Has 2 elastic areas, one at midriff and another higher up. Not expected by the picture."
3.0,Silly look.
3.0,It's cute but I don't wear it
3.0,"Just fit off. Super thin, looks weird."
3.0,"i expected more of a sock feel, not so much<br />but they are extremely cute  and can always compensate with a trouser sock, maybe that how it was intended to be worn??"
3.0,"I like how I received the item within 3 days of my placing the order. However, the cap was too small for my head. I wish it came in various sizes because one size do not fit all heads."
3.0,ok....
3.0,I ordered the size that I was just measured for in a jewelry store and the ring came too small.
3.0,It was definitely smaller then I expected.
3.0,Even though I purchased this item 3 sizes larger than usual it was snug. The other item I purchased from the same company in the same size did fit. So sizes by LUNIWEI are very inconsistent
3.0,Lil small for the size
3.0,I odered this for my son and it was HUGE! It goes down past his knees and I had to roll up the sleeves a ton. The print is cute and it is super light weight. At least he will be able to use it for a while.
3.0,"This dress will shrink about a size when washed.  The fabric is thin.  The style is great though. I suggest ordering a large size. If you like a bagging fit, maybe 2 sizes larger."
3.0,"So far the vest works well but I have only used it once. I feel like they come small because if it isn't a little tight on your torso the heating pads don't touch your skin. I am a pretty small guy (5'10"", 135lbs) and I bought the XL. It seems small length wise but not tight on my chest/stomach. I put a shirt over it and it builds up heat inside so it doesn't necessarily need to be tight. My only issue is that it was advertised as being machine washable which was nice because you are bound to sweat in it it at some point but the directions it comes with specify not to machine wash it. I am not looking forward to hand washing it and then air drying it. The Federal Trade Commission Act, section 5, says that “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce” are declared illegal. A big selling point for me was that it was advertised as machine washable. I guess since it's made in China they can get away with false advertising."
3.0,Design and material are good. A little smaller towards the calf and ankle than I expected. Perfect for around the house or a jog or leisurely activities.
3.0,There is something scratchy about the material they are made of. I have many pairs of Vionics and these are not as comfortable as the others.
3.0,"This dress was too large for me, despite ordering the smallest size they offered. I will be returning the dress."
3.0,"The texture is really nice in the pajamas themselves very comfortable but the shorts are somewhat long and a little tight. I would’ve preferred a baggier, shorter short. That being said, the shirt is super comfortable and fits well I had the material is soft"
3.0,Very cheaply made.  It gaps right in the middle where the hole is.  I'm sorry I waited so late to try it on.  I wasn't able to return it.
3.0,Fits a little small and material is very thin. Works good over a tank or light t-shirt.
3.0,Cute<br />Not a friendly material for washing machine.<br />After so many wear the stretch of suit shifts to worn out type
3.0,Love them but they are very small and one won't stay closed. Can't wear them and I'm sad about that. These are really pretty. Just to small for ladies size.
3.0,I really like this product! It is so helpful to have the claws on one hand especially for putting pots together...<br />But one claw fell off which means broke off first hour of use so that was disappointing
3.0,They look cute but aren’t practical. Fit big and caused my baby to fall often
3.0,Pretty cute. Wish they were a bit bigger... I'm an adult. LOL
3.0,Wife 5ft 1 in bottoms almost too short
3.0,Love the watch but the battery was dead when I received it. The bracelet is hard to put on by yourself and elastic section or snap would have been better and I plan on modifying mine with some elastic.
3.0,Fit is good but the colors are not as pictured.  Needed 2 dresses for a wedding and the 6 came with flowers falling apart and pink sequins not purple the smaller dress is fine other then the flowers.  They do not look as pictured
3.0,U was not a fan of this outfit. I wanted to wear it out to a party but that didn't happen. It's all one piece  which I knew before hand but it was like putting on a race car drivers jumpsuit. Actually with the material it was more like a wetsuit. It was not flattering on me at all. I don't think it would be on anyone unless u have amazing curves. I have already started the return process
3.0,I like the bracelet however the first one broke and I had to have it replaced. We think it is really cute however we have not opened the new one to see if it will work okay. I bought this for my little girl. Not sure if it is worth the money.
3.0,Got two pair of grey and no black stockings.
3.0,"This shirt is so cute, but just too big. I know its a loose fitting shirt, but still way too big. I wish they had an extra small."
3.0,Sized up based on reviews. It's huge! Go with your typical size.
3.0,Needed more compression
3.0,Beautiful but zipper stripped out and bag cannot close properly
3.0,"Me gustó pero se descosió rápidamente, era para la fiesta de mi hija y no le duró ni tres horas. Se descosió de la cintura. No es muy confiable"
3.0,"It ""fits"" fine, its jut not a tunic like the picture makes it seem.  I'll still wear it, just bummed it won't be with leggings or skinny jeans."
3.0,I'm always usually an L and as recommended it links you to an XL since it runs small. Not suited for my body type so I return it
3.0,"Seems like every store and gas station these days have their own rewards or frequent shopper card. My wallet is stuffed full of them. Naturally, I thought this leather card case would be a wonderful solution to my “problem”. Unfortunately, you can’t really fit more than 3 cards inside this case. While the leather is buttery soft, the case doesn’t have much give to it. Maybe after a while, as the leather softens up a bit more, I might be able squeeze one or two more cards inside, but as of now, three’s the limit. For a man who may only want to carry his drivers license/ID and a credit card, this could work, but how many men only carry those two things and nothing else?<br /><br />I was also very surprised to see the price of this case. For $24 I would have expected either a slightly larger case or a case made from more quality leather. This case is basically three pieces of leather stitched together on three sides. Its not lined. The inside is just the backside of the leather skin. There are much nicer cases available that serve the same purpose and they’re either made from nicer leather or are a little bit bigger.  Sorry to say that I can’t really recommend this one."
3.0,"Everything about the belt is what I wanted except that it won't fit through most of my pants and shorts belt loops; so its use is limited.  Although the belt itself is 1 1/2"" wide as specified, the plastic buckle is 1 7/8"" and will not go through the belt loops making its use very limited - sending back."
3.0,So far their simply beautiful! Very delicate looking but at the same time feel very well made. We shall see how they hold up! So far their great!<br /><br />Update!<br />The metal has started to tarnish. I keep my jewelry away from moisture I don’t get products on them. I don’t sleep or shower in them. And it’s been only a few weeks. So I knocked two stars off. I understand wear and tear happens but I’d hoped these would last longer than a few weeks. The stone is beautiful tho and I love how dainty the earring is.
3.0,This dress is a little on the long side for a size small and falls about 3 inches below the knee on my 5’0” daughter. It also looks a little more causal/less expensive than the picture. The skirt part is a Jersey knit which I think made it look a little bit cheaper than the top which was a pretty lace look.
3.0,"I like the overall feel of this product, but the band part pushes some of the skin at the top and no, its not too small because it fist right everywhere else..  Ill still wear it but is didnt work with the tight dress i wanted to wear it with in the first place."
3.0,Nice ring but can have more detail to separate back ground more clearly and the word North should be a bit darker around lettering.
3.0,"Got this to carry glass bottle of medicine instead of glasses. It is the perfect size and I do like it, it just is not made very well. I would buy a second one if I needed to."
3.0,"I got the three pack- white, black and red... they are an awesome fit and great material but my white has a bleed from the red in the entire section it was touching the red so it's tinted tan in that area. Okay if you're wearing it to layer under something but definitely not to wear alone."
3.0,"Slippers looked GIGANTIC when I took them out of the box. I couldn't believe they were a size 11 (felt like a 12 or 13). They do have good arch support. Had to return them, though."
3.0,"My daughter loves the earrings, but the first time she tried to wear the rose gold pair the clasp broke."
3.0,They fit well but the lenses pop out sometimes. I can fit them back in but it’s annoying.
3.0,Smaller than expected the opening is quite narrow
3.0,These are a lot tighter than I expected and I only wore them once.  I was hoping for something stretchier that I could use while driving or outside when I'm wearing a short sleeve shirt.  I tried them but they were too tight.
3.0,"The sleeve holes are strange, it should not even have any. It would have been better without the cowl too, but didnt lose too much on it so..."
3.0,Material not to my liking
3.0,"The earrings were as expected, however, they did not include the velvet carrying case which is displayed in photos. This is very misleading as I was under the impression I could deliver the gift in something stylish instead of a simple plastic bag."
3.0,"The fabric is a bright red and doesn't look good at all. I was hoping for the dark red and Christmas looking tartan.  The waist is sewn funny and doesn't sit correctly, the plaid doesn't match up at the seems and I thought about bringing it to the tailor to try and sew it up to match but it could screw it up.  I wore it Saturday night and got compliments but not sure if I will even wear it again.  I might if it was like the image that pops up and what I had envisioned."
3.0,Just okay....beads are of nice color but they are not even in shape....some holes drilled in the jade are larger than others.  Not the prettiest jade bracelet I own.  Also this bracelet took awhile to come in so if you need it quickly you may want to purchase something that comes from the states.
3.0,"Ok glasses, but the metal was a bit warped and the glasses were then crooked on my face. Easy fix though, just bent the metal."
3.0,This product would better suit a child rather than an adult.  The wings are fairly small and the string is tight around the skin.  This is most likely a one time use product.
3.0,Very pretty but sooo tiny! I don't remember seeing anything that gave measurements of the earrings. These are so tiny you can't see the cz hardly at all.
3.0,Too small and too tight.
3.0,The filter insert is very difficult to install
3.0,It feels great and looks ok on.
3.0,Runs small. Snug top then flows - soft but not sheer or like pic . Cute tho
3.0,The gray is closer to beige.  Doesn’t really look gray.
3.0,"Don't stretch seams stop the material from stretching. Usually fit into a med not with these one pair fits out of 3 kinda weird. Update fit better after washing so I'll be able to wear them. Suggest larger size....next time I'll get large. Black pair still snug around my legs but eh, still can wear them after washing them."
3.0,Love the shirt. Love the color. Just the wrong sixe for X Large
3.0,These are pretty but they are pictured with compression backs. Mine came with no backs. I am trying to find earring backs but I don't want to use ones from other earrings I own.
3.0,"Quality of bags were great, however qty was no accurate. We were missing 1 piece"
3.0,It got tangled to my clothing and it ended up breaking although I was able to put it back together. The material is very fragile but looks really nice overall
3.0,Runs a little large and needs more compression. Bought for wife to help with her back. Had to return.
3.0,"They work well with touch devices, but they're not very warm.<br /><br />They're a bit slippery for driving.<br /><br />Expensive."
3.0,These socks ran large for my size 8 W shoe size. And they did not have the compression I had hoped for!  My post op ankle swells in this sock.
3.0,Although the earrings pictured are correct it does NOT come with Pandora packaging. Everything came in a flat envelope. Upon opening said envelope I found the earrings in a baggie and a little white box that I had to put together. There was also a little sticker that says Pandora on it. I'm assuming that this is to go on the box. Looks like something I would have gotten from K-Mart. I'm not even sure it's actually Pandora earrings.
3.0,Super cute but fell apart after wearing it a few times.
3.0,"Love jacket style, but only room for long-sleeved tee shirt. Body & inner elbow too tight for sweatshirts. Left side (European style?) zipper. Suggest order larger size than usual."
3.0,I like my dress
3.0,"drapes nicely, cheap fabric that pills easily"
3.0,"Short, skimpy. Not thrilled - haven't worn it-- might not.  :("
3.0,"Pros: Fugly cute! Comfortable on the bottom of my feet. Feels sturdy. Initially loved walking around my house with these.<br />Con: I bought my normal size. I don't think I have wide feet but after wearing for a couple hours, the widest parts of my feet at the pinky and big toe were red and irritated. Beats the purpose of wearing them as house shoes, which I planned to wear all day."
3.0,"Even buying a medium (normally wear a 6) this one is much too tight, otherwise, it launders nicely and is pretty - good quality!"
3.0,I liked the image but there is a lot of ink bleeding that will ruin your shoes
3.0,The leggings are nice and material is good. The only problem i have is the elastic around the waist is very tight.
3.0,i bought it for my granddaughter but it was too small and short
3.0,"these worked well - prevented calf cramps while mountain biking and doing a 5k.<br />However, they were.hard to get on and i ripped 2 holes in one immediately.  I think the larger size would be too big, but I might try them at some point."
3.0,toooo bigbut ok
3.0,Cute purse and great size. Also price is ok BUT it stinks to high heavens. I will leave in garage for few days and if stink still too strong will try to return
3.0,Cheap feelint
3.0,"I ordered these socks to wear with my jeans.  They are just a little bit thin and my feet get cold pretty easy in them.  They come up to just below mid-calf and I would rather they come up a couple inches higher.  With being thin, I am a little worried about how well they will wear.  Next time I need socks I will probably look elsewhere."
3.0,Love it but it arrived with a broken glass
3.0,Runs somewhat small and you can see your bra through it. Love the print tho
3.0,"While the necklace was like the one shown, the color of the glass was so pale in relation to the bright purple that was shown on the photo."
3.0,"These are good but not trunk cut, once washed they are almost a brief. The legs are high cut, not the same as the older cut trunks from this company."
3.0,"Even buying a size larger as suggested, they still fit snug, and that's out of the packaging before washing."
3.0,"First, I LOVE yellow box sandals and own many pairs.  These flip flops are beautiful!!! However, I have a wider foot, which usually works well with Yellow Box, but not with this shoe, unfortunately. It was very uncomfortable around the toe area. Perhaps someone with a narrower foot would find them more comfortable. They are certainly attractive and worth the price!"
3.0,Zipper broke after 2nd time wearing it
3.0,looks cheap :(
3.0,"I love this print, but the 2T and the 3T were too small for my 16 month old.  It’s so frustrating, and there aren’t any bigger sizes with snaps for diaper changes!"
3.0,It is not pair earing
3.0,It’s great this company gives you a 5 pack. Wish the ratio was more cotton as they are made up of 70% polyester and 30% cotton. Not as smooth silky thin as other boxer briefs I had tried. The length from waist band to crouch seem like an inch or two too long. Item did not feet me like a glove. No tags or annoying stitching on item though. Middle of the line boxers.
3.0,This look exactly as the pic but it came with a hole on the right leg. I was really anxious to receive my jumpsuit but was disappointed when  it arrived. So I have to fix that. Material is good
3.0,"I wear a size 36D bra and figured the large would be okay. Sadly, it is not the right size. The band part is fine, it's the cup size that's off. What's worse is, because there's no actual support, the overflow doesn't spill up top in the form of cleavage, but rather on the bottom. Not a good look. I don't think it's the actual product's fault, it's simply a matter of size: once you're at a D, more support is necessary. Too bad, I really liked the look ..."
3.0,"I was disappointed in this dress as the pattern is nothing like the image. The seller’s image shows a crisp multi tile print. The dress itself has a similar print but it is scaled way bigger and is much less defined. If you zoom in you can see that the print on the dress has a blurry look to it. That would be fine if that was what was shown, but it is a completely different look. It makes the print a lot more casual and isn’t what I wanted. The fit and fabric of the dress is fine but I’m returning as it is not what was advertised."
3.0,didn't help
3.0,"Bought an all black one before and LOVED it, but honestly stay away from the prints. Bought this snake print style and its pixelated and not at all cute in person. No thanks"
3.0,To big not for short people took forever to come in
3.0,I’m sure the watch was perfectly fine. The face of the watch was too small for me!
3.0,Too small. ORDER 2 sizes up!!!! I’m a 36C and the large doesn’t come close to fitting.
3.0,Comfortable but the pads get wrinkly and show through the shirt.
3.0,"I love them, but two of my rocks were very small and broken. I felt like I only got 6 rocks. I kept them though, because I felt it was still a good deal."
3.0,"The quality is mediocre, don't get your hopes up. I would not recommend this item."
3.0,It was too &#34;squishy&#34; soft for what I wanted.  Went with one of the RF bags.
3.0,very heavy
3.0,I really didn't see any improvement for my husband. He says its tight and itchy and a little uncomfortable. He wore it a few times but I can't blame him if it was uncomfortable for him at night. I like the color though and the fabric feels soft too. Received at a cheaper price for a review.
3.0,"I am normally a small, I ordered a medium in case I got pregnant when I had to wear it. I am 5'6 and the dress bearly comes to the ground and the waist fit perfect. The gold chain around the neck is also a stretchy metal so when you move in anyway it pinches your skin. I ended up removing this and putting In a ribbon instead. I wouldn't buy another one but it did its job for the 1 time I had to wear it"
3.0,"Very cute and I like the material, but if you normally wear a medium athletic legging(8-10), order a small. The medium we’re falling down the entire run this morning. Quite disappointed. Now o know to only wear them around the house."
3.0,"I got these because of the zipper pocket that was pictured on the side of the pants , but it’s not fictional, there is no pocket, just a zipper that goes up and down for no reason or purpose, I like the pants and will still keep them but was disappointed in the zipper pocket"
3.0,Bought for my 9 year old and the were too big for her. :-(
3.0,"They are cute, but the noses fell off the red dogs within the first 15 minutes my 2 yr old son wore them."
3.0,This is a nice dress but it runs very small. Even though it stretches it wasn’t good. I had to return it.
3.0,"The product itself is nice, very comfy and all that. My issue was mostly that they wouldn't really stick/ stay in place for a long period of time. For reference I'm a size 34D."
3.0,"Seems to be nicely constructed but I had to return them due to the sizing. I have Ugg boots in a size 9, saw the other reviews about sizing being smaller so I ordered a size 10 and they were still to small."
3.0,"These boots are super cute and fit as expected. There are a few things that I didn’t like about them and felt shouldn’t have been an issue being that they cost so much. The first issue I had was with how tight the material was the further up the leg it went. It’s going to be real hard for me to try to wear these with jeans so I think it’s safe to say that these boots aren’t meant for ladies with bigger calves. The second issue I had was that the left shoe seemed to lean a bit to the side. I thought it was just due to my size so I had my 12 yr old try them on and they leaned on her feet, too. Lastly, the heel seems to be a little shorter than what I was expecting.  For as much as these boots cost I don’t think that it’s acceptable for them to have as many flaws as they do. For that I only have 3 stars."
3.0,"I purchased these beautiful earrings for myself.  I am sorry to say that short, dangly CZ was put on backwards (on both earrings) so you see the backside and not the CZ when you're wearing them.  The ear cuff part is 3/4 inch long.  The dangles are 1 inch and 2 inch.  There is only one post for those who have only one piercing in their ear.  They are very pretty.  I am so disappointed in the flaw."
3.0,Pretty but the back lacing is fussy and hard to make look right.
3.0,ultimately I returned this watchband.<br />I found that the retaining straps that hold the end of the strap after the buckle were very thin and flimsy thus I was expecting them to break after initial stretching.<br />the finish had a high sheen as unto plastic and rubber.
3.0,Eautifil dress
3.0,I THOUGHT THE COLOR WOULD BE MORE YELLOW THAN THEY WERE
3.0,"After buying the first top, in charcoal Grey i decided to buy another 3 more in different colours. I was very disappointed to find that i received a completely different brand and style. The Navy top was similar to the first one i bought but the Grey top wasn't even batwing as advertised and fitted smaller. So disappointed. i cant return because i took the tags off and placed it straight in the wash. Learnt my lesson. Always check before removing tags and not buying from this seller again especially if there is no consistency in your products."
3.0,"They are okay for the price. Beyond that, not much else to say. They are kind of big... more like goggles."
3.0,"The waistband was all twisted after first wash. Fine for lounging around, but could not wear them out of the house after that."
3.0,Fabric is fantastic and looks great. The buttons as someone else stated are barely sewn on which is a bit of a turn-off. The fit is nowhere near as expected. I'm a 6' 165lb male and the medium fits like an XL. Since there is no small size avaliable I will be returning this one and I guess trying an X-small since that is the only size available. Will update review once exchange is made.
3.0,Cute for a kids train party 🥳<br />The silverware was miss counted there was more spoons than forks instead of equal thankfully we purchased extra silverware and plates for everyone else this was just for the little kids.
3.0,Totally see through... 🤦🏻‍♀️
3.0,More red than wine....but pretty still
3.0,"Super cute, but not functional. The watch part falls to the underside of your wrist. The scrunchy is very soft, pretty and comfortable however due to the weight of the watch face, it will not stay on top of your wrist. I wore it like that for a while, since it’s pretty to look at, but then I started bumping my watch when reaching for things. This would work if you have a large wrist to keep the scrunchy pulled taut."
3.0,"The length and legs of these pants are great. I ordered a size up so they would be more comfortable, however, they are so tight! I have over pants that brag about tummy control and such that are nothing like these. I ended up making two small holes in the waistband and cutting the elastic band. Perfect. Now they are still more than tight enough to stay in place, but not choking my waist anymore.<br /><br />I love the color, and they are quite thick. Not see through at all. They are even warmer than most of my yoga pants, which is a nice change for me. The pockets look adorable, however, they don't actually hold much. I wear these mostly around the house so it is nice to be able to put my phone (partially) in the pocket when carrying laundry. They feel very smooth and soft. If they made these without the elastic in the waist they would be almost perfect."
3.0,"I didn't buy there for comfort as much as trying to salvage my favorite pair of shoes. I used these in a 15-year old pair of Made-In-England Doc oxfords... so where the insoles may not be the most comfortable, they are an improvement over the worn down insides. I only write this because i didn't see it in many other reviews: a size smaller is what fit. Originally bought size 11 insole for size 11 Docs, and they were nowhere close to fitting. (Coincidentally, those fit into a size 12 pair of biker boots.) Size 10 insole for size 11 shoe fit just right with a little prodding. Overall, they do the job, but even in a VERY worn down inside, they definitely make the shoe a little tighter. As far as the seller, it took 15 days to ship from NJ to NY, nine days to get a shipping confirmation.<br /><br />I'd probably try another insole before buying these again, and will certainly not buy from this seller again."
3.0,"Bought two pairs. The grey/smoke color came exactly as expected, that soft rubberized plastic that flexes a little. Seemed like it would hold up to toddler abuse. Fit my two year old with some room to grow. Five stars.<br /><br />Second pair was the black with blue/green lenses. Came without the felt case, adult size, cheap thin brittle plastic...<br /><br />What gives??"
3.0,I like the necklace but it was smaller than pictured.
3.0,The earrings are even prettier than I thought...also larger
3.0,"I really like them, really like the blue pair but unfortunately the black pair came with 2 holes in the backside. Was worried that they would be too thin but I find them comfy to wear and the material is soft"
3.0,"The Diamond cross is beautiful and what I expected, but the chain is very cheap and disappointing not only in looks but in quality!<br />Keith"
3.0,"There was what seemed like a decent picture of the product size in relation to a silhouette of a woman's head included in the listing. Still, the earrings are much smaller than I expected. The silver is stamped cut and almost foil thin. Expected a bit more weight. My wife liked them though, and the price is acceptable despite my expectations."
3.0,It's nice but runs just a bit small for a large.
3.0,It came super fast and I fell in love with it. The amulet is just like deans and is about the same size but the chain is pretty bad. Its hard to lock on and off and kinda uncomfortable. But the amulet its self is amazing and I think I'll just find a different chane to hand it on
3.0,These are great fitting leggings but they don’t stay up when working out.
3.0,"The fabric was decent and they look was great. Unfortunately, they were sized weird. They were really long and small through the thighs so I had to send them back"
3.0,Update: This watch started peeling about 1 month after use. It's a big disappointment. I noticed several silver spots now where the rose gold costing had flaked off
3.0,Pretty colors but way too small for my big feet: size 10
3.0,Very soft but was about two sizes smaller than what I ordered
3.0,Ordered a small and they fit like larges.
3.0,"I do like the pearl set, looks nice and is a perfect size, however, after only 1 month, 2 of the 6 necklaces that I ordered have broke and it is too late for me to do an exchange or return through Amazon."
3.0,"They look great and were a perfect cheap option for my spring break, but broke very easily a few weeks after. None of my other sunglasses broke this easily in the same conditions. I wouldn't waste your money on these unless you want them for a specific event or short amount of time."
3.0,"i was hoping the chain would be longer like it was in the movie, but its really really short."
3.0,Sad part is Vera had a sale this weekend where I could have saved 50%!
3.0,ok not great
3.0,"Paint job isn't very clean. The item I received DOES NOT glow in the dark. Sizes on this weren't clear because the options shown are 16"" and 10"". I selected the item that's listed as 16 inches. The description does say it's 12 inches, and the blade I received is indeed 12 inches, and so it shouldn't be advertised as 16"". That said, it's still pretty neat. It's metal, and the sculpt itself is nice. I just wish better care was taken with the paint. There are places where the paint job is incomplete. The hilt should also have been painted where the ""rubix cube"" buttons are. As a fan of the game, it's not terrible, but for the price, it could be better quality."
3.0,It was a gift but material was not to good.
3.0,"Loved it, but the top was too big"
3.0,"It's nice, I got it for my birthday and it was really nice, but the necklace clasp keeps getting undone a lot, even when I'm not moving a lot."
3.0,I ordered a size 10 too small fit like a size 9 the shoe is beautiful
3.0,I gave it to my daughter
3.0,"The top fits just fine but the bottoms were slightly on the small size. I ordered a medium, I'm a size 6, normally I fit into mediums but these are snug especially on the leg opening side."
3.0,I did not like the fit of these shirts in the sleeves. I suggest buying a size smaller.
3.0,"It’s a very good travel belt, but be aware of a couple things:<br />1.  The belt is wide. It takes work to get it threaded through my belt loops, so check the dimensions before you buy.<br />2.  The excess strap has an elastic loop that holds it the belt. That’s fine, but it also makes the belt thicker at that point, which also makes it hard to thread through my belt loops.  It also tends to bunch up there.<br /><br />So while it’s a very nice belt, it’s a pain to actually thread through belt loops. It takes me a few minutes to get it threaded or unthreaded, unlike a leather belt which just slips right through."
3.0,"Funny fit.  Too large around the waist, but good fit around the hips."
3.0,Its a pretty set & would have been perfect if bottoms crotch rise was longer.
3.0,"It’s a very cute top but if you are busty, I wouldn’t recommend. I am a size 32 DDD and I purchased a medium. It does not hug sound the rib cage and I had a nip slip when trying to pull it down"
3.0,Kind of small but pretty
3.0,"I personally think this dress would look better on a taller person. I'm 5'2"" and it just doesn't look good on me."
3.0,"I like it, for the price given it's not that bad."
3.0,This shirt has a boxy fit. It isn’t tapered like the picture. The material is thicker than regular t shirt material so it doesn’t flow. The v neck is short also not as pictured. I’m 5’5” 135 and got a medium that is too big and boxy. I’m keeping as a wear around the house tee.
3.0,it came too big but it worked well for airsoft since i wanted to wear a sweatshirt underneath
3.0,I like the leather look. It’s really soft. It fits like a glove... only down fall for me is that it is maaaaad noisy like you will hear me walking up the block but it’s still a nice skirt. N I was cute for my bday.
3.0,Poor stitching around headband
3.0,Bought this in dark green for my engagement shoot. Actual product was definitely not as dark green like the photo shows but more of a lighter color.
3.0,"The size was about what one would expect but I do not like it. While the fabric could not be said to be thin, it has a pebbly texture that reminds me of an old woman's dress, and the fit/cut is shoddy. The armscey is too narrow on the sides so the sleeves extend too far onto the chest and at the back too. Looked like something I could wear out to a nice evening, but now that I've gotten it, nope. and it wasn't worth the price."
3.0,"love the design, however, if you have a larger wrist don’t chance it. it is literally 1/4” too short for me"
3.0,"I love the way they feel.True to size.It says with pocket.Well its big enough for keys, thats it.I was expecting a big pocket on the side or something bigger for my phone."
3.0,This was ok for what it is. But it is not a high quality item. More of a novelty gift. My son had fun wearing it during the holidays. Would be better if you could alternate the color of the lights.
3.0,I got a large and the top was to small. I’m 38C.
3.0,I love the product and looks great. Company forgot to send me the u shape belt clip thingy.
3.0,They are cute and comfy and they fit good.. But they are have really thick padding in them and i know it says padded but you should call them super padded and they become miss shapened after the first wash..
3.0,"I like the size of this little hanging wallet. Zipper is getting stuck though so trying to work that out. It is cute and a good size for basic cards, license etc."
3.0,This was advertised as rose gold but it isn’t. It is in fact gold colored gold. It’s pretty just not truly rose gold.
3.0,"I received my order in only 2 days. The earrings are a good weight and quality but not smooth like the photo. What I received looks more like vintage hand crafted silver, which I also happen to like. They're still a nice style but I ordered them to match a ring I have. 3 star rating because I didn't get the pictured item."
3.0,Didn't stick very well.
3.0,"I bought a 4T and it runs pretty big, almost reaches my 4 year old’s ankles, and the anchor is Huuuge!  Material is very soft though."
3.0,The dress is beautiful  but completely see through.
3.0,"Good quality, but paint started to chip off after a few weeks."
3.0,"This product definitely runs big. The size of a 0-3 is the size of a 3-6 month. Don’t expect to wear it home from the hospital. The onsie’s writing had bled, so I’m not impressed at all with it. But the hat and pants are worth the money."
3.0,"I got this a few days ago and its super cute, fits true to size..... but.... it really smells.  I've been just letting it sit for a few days to see if it can off-gas enough to wear.  Still stinky so I've decided to wash it rather than send it back.  Hoping it helps."
3.0,overall impression horrible looking the lenses needed to be darker then that and just awful
3.0,"Great quality and fit, but not nearly as &#34;blue&#34; as the photos suggest.  Not as mirrored/tinted as I thought they would be, so I can see my eyes through the lenses when looking at a mirror."
3.0,"Cute pendant. Looks and feels solid; does not feel as if it would bend or dent. I have only had it for four days and the plating is already coming off just by wearing it through the day. Will continue to wear it as it’s not the end of the world, but I wanted a silver colored pendant and not a copper colored one."
3.0,"I like the bracelet, but I have a big wrist so it could be bigger.  Also, the beads look bigger in the picture on Amazon."
3.0,they are cute but poor quality
3.0,"It’s really hard to get the fitbit into it, especially because the fitbit3 doesnt turn off so you can’t do it without making the screen go haywire"
3.0,I am 32 B and bought a medium.  It was a little tight.  The cotton is alright but not super soft.  They work well under work out shirts but I wouldn't wear them alone.
3.0,Wore in November in New York over sweaters. Loved but zipper broke within first month.
3.0,These work well but are not easy to get on or take off.  The ear phones pop off quite easily too.  For ease of use I don't like them but for noise cancellation for a young kiddo they work well.
3.0,"very high waisted, little short in length. they work okay as a work pant but definitely not a fashion statement."
3.0,My husband always wears a med and it's a tad big. But no too much so I'll keep it. Order one size down.
3.0,"Once I finally wrangled myself into it, I can see that is an excellent high-impact bra.  However, I was exhausted from the battle to get it on and found myself napping on the couch......"
3.0,Love the product but it did not fit as expected. I would definitely size up!
3.0,"It's a very functional wallet.  That part of it I like.  Yea, there was a very distinct smell that lasted for a few months.  I did not find the smell offensive, just noticeable.  The negative is the finish.  New, it has a great look and great texture.  Unfortunately, the finish begins wearing off in the first week.  Have had it for several months now and it does not look all that good anymore.  But it's still very functional - the design doesn't change."
3.0,Looks a little cheap!
3.0,"I thought this was really cute. But, when I tried it on my ear the octopus look way too big and hung down. I was hoping it actually curved around the a little. I think the octopus could actually be a bit smaller. Other than that it is a nice product."
3.0,"Cute dress that I used through my pregnancy. It didn't wash very well, and showed a lot of where even after a couple washes. Thankfully it was cheap enough that I didn't care, and only used it temporarily during my second and third trimester pregnancy. Cute with leggings!"
3.0,not excellent quality but is solid and works good. finish is great
3.0,It's much longer than expected. I'm 5'5&#34; and it was just below my knees. Not flattering at all.
3.0,"Doesn't look right. Its very stiff, and doesn't sit well on my neck. It's pretty, but I wish it had some flexibility."
3.0,Cute dress but wayyyyy too Polyester.
3.0,I  liked the pants but they did not fit  around  my stomach.
3.0,Slips off head constantly
3.0,Should have went for the small. High waist too high. Waist tie came out in the wash.
3.0,Sending back to get a bigger size. The look is good but the jean itself is a bit thin. They need to use a thicker material.
3.0,"I bought these boots for my almost 4 year old. The fit well and look great. They are well made and the quality is good. However, they were not good for my daughter because after  she took them off after a long day of wear we noticed bruising on the back of both of her legs. I believe the outer edge of the boots were digging into her skin and even though she was wearing long thick socks, it still caused bruising."
3.0,You can smell the cheap material. It's overwhelming.  Need to have it cleaned right away.
3.0,They are really cute but heavy. Hard to keep on
3.0,"Like it, don't  love it, will keep it, it's cute and sparkly stones are a little small so you see more silver than stone color. Also doesn't look cheap but does not look expensive. I don't recommend as a surprise gift unless for a young teen."
3.0,Didn’t care for material
3.0,The gold color is very dull. Magnetic clasp isn't very strong.
3.0,"Awesome print, weird cheap bill on hat"
3.0,Love the earring but way to big for daith piercing
3.0,"The material is thin and silky. It is not flannel, but printed to look at though it is. I do not believe it is of great quality."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this, but it's just ok.  The fabric is very thin and shows a lot of bumps that don't otherwise show.  It's soft, and feels nice,  but I don't feel comfortable wearing it as a dress in public."
3.0,These are nice undies except for the fact that they stretch out as the day wears on and start to sag. I should've looked for something with more spandex in the material for better hold of shape.
3.0,"It rides up quite a bit, and I have a nickel allergy so I have to wear an under shirt because the zipper irritates my skin. Gave three starts because it really does make me sweat!"
3.0,"La impresión está bien hecha y ya ha aguantado alguna que otra lavada y no se notan cambios en la misma. Lo malo con esta camisa es que tiene el logo de Gildan, no se dignaron en al menos ocultarlo, lo cual me resultó decepcionante."
3.0,"Keep in mind, these are not made with strong material. Usually silicone tunnels are my go to for a comfortable sleep, but every time I wake up, one or both of them collapse in my ear.<br />But the price was great, shipping was generally fast, and both pieces match unlike what a lot of the other buyers received.<br />If you was genuinely great tunnels, I'd go for a different product"
3.0,"Work in a warehouse.  Needed hi-viz, but wanted to be different.  Highlighter pink!!!  Shrunk after washing.  I’d order up a size if I bought again."
3.0,Looks beautiful but I do wish it was longer like shown in the picture.
3.0,I like the product but I unfortunately only received 2 out of the 3 shirts in the pack.
3.0,"If you're heavy, overweight as I am, 2X this is just not going to look good on you the cut is weird instead of gradually going towards the back it literally cuts and goes down the front of your leg. It probably looks great on a thin person but it's just not created for those who are plus size"
3.0,It looks nice..but the string is connected to the hook ....so there is no way to get the necklace on and off your child(unless your childs head is the size of a doll head)..i had to cut it so i cld tie it myself...honestly not WORTH the money!! Maybe $2-$3... But almost $9?? Wld not recommend..
3.0,"Not true to size, order a size up. Good quality, just too small."
3.0,I like the color. True as shown. Feels like nylon. Not the best quality but pretty.
3.0,"Love the colors!  Love that its longer in back!  However, the material is very thin (almost see-through) and with the pockets, makes hips look huge!"
3.0,"So I bought this item thinking it would be ok for my Monroe piercing because some inner conch piercing work but it did not fit right. The size was too small and it will be too tight on the lip. Although it does look cute, and pretty well made i think this wasn't the right product for me."
3.0,Not exactly what I expected but still pretty
3.0,Wish it was a bit wider if worn with keggings
3.0,"They came and looked as pictured but they kept sliding down and the top of my rear kept showing. No matter how high I hiked them whenever I walked or especially on stairs or a ramp, they would slide down."
3.0,"The set is cute but I had a few issues.<br />1. On the card with the gold set, it came with 4 pairs of diamond studs instead of 3, and the gold triangle stud was not included. Which means that the triangle stud was replaced with an extra pair of diamond studs. So the gold triangle stud was missing.<br />2. The gold heart stud was missing, period. So I only received 23 pairs of earrings and not 24.<br />3. The large pair of pearls on the card with the gold set was mixed- 1 side was white and 1 side was cream-coloured."
3.0,"It's very tiny, pictures are misleading, it's not even that deep of a black, and you would need a magnifying glass to see the ""diamond"" on top of the Pearl"
3.0,Seemed a little flimsy easy to break.  The first time I dropped it it broke.
3.0,"They are thick, warm for summer use.  The zipper catches on itself.  Cuts my ankle in front on extra swollen times."
3.0,"Socks are comfortable and soft, but they shed black fuzz terribly."
3.0,Beautiful purse. Not very sturdy. Shoulder strap broke in 3 weeks of use.
3.0,It's pretty but I cant figure out how to make the band smaller so I have never worn it
3.0,"Quality dress, but was very matronly. I did not care for the length so I returned it."
3.0,Found another brand on Amazon that like liked much better.
3.0,"The style & fit are great.  However, the polyknit material is garbage"
3.0,They’re good for the price. Definitely didn’t expect them to be so large though. Was hoping to wear them on my wedding day with other earrings but it’s not gonna work.
3.0,Nice item for a gift. Length could have been more so it can be wrapped differently instead of just one time around average size neck. Serves purpose of being able to carry items without needing a purse
3.0,"I really like the look and more importantly the feel. It keeps you warm.  The two drawbacks are the pockets are small and more importantly, the zipper is a disaster.  I purchased two of these and on both of them the zipper is an issue.  That is the only reason I can't give it 5 stars."
3.0,3 stars because they slide down a bit are not made for wide calves.
3.0,"Far too small, and I typically wear a size small in US clothing. That said, I'm 5'6&#34; and 130-135 lbs. I wear a 36-C or B cup, but this shirt was more than snug. I'm guessing it would be perfect for someone much thinner and around a 32-B or C cup."
3.0,Size is good. Outer material is very stiff and has very little padding inside. I added a gel soul pad.
3.0,"cute, but just kinda big and loose and there is no way to shorten it"
3.0,"These fit so well and snug, but in a good way.  My only issue is that they are really sheer and see through, as I embarrassingly discovered in Yoga class, when you bend over, which pretty much defeats the purpose of wearing them for yoga. Basically you can only wear these for lounging and activities where bending is not involved. Definitely not a yoga legging."
3.0,No to the true fit
3.0,They are nice but I think I get a defensive part. The one ear ring's post is a lot longer then the others. This makes it lose and hang weird compared to the other when on.
3.0,"The threads on the medicine cup are real short. In essence you are just clicking the top onto the bottom. I tried using one and while doing so I moved. The cup came apart spilling the medication. I ended up just throwing both of them away. I do like the inverted cone design as it delivers a finer mist of the medication. However, the design of these is inadequate in the  threads. Won't buy these again."
3.0,three because the size was not true to a Large but the fabric nice and had good stretch
3.0,"Gloves are warm, are windproof, and very water resistant, however- the stitches around the fingers and the lining are not secure and will need repair"
3.0,"Me quedan como a 2""  por debajo de la rodilla cuando se suponía eran sobre la rodilla. Al lavarlos salieron con hilos brotados como si se encajaran en algo, pero no había nada que los dañara en la lavadora."
3.0,Runs large a got a small I'm 5'4 and 120 lbs
3.0,"Cute, and seems well made but not the right fit for my body type"
3.0,Pattern not as vibrant as shown. Cheap quality. Ok for a laid back setting but not if you want something nicer to wear.
3.0,"Dress delivered today. Tried it on, but it has a hole. Disappointing, didn’t get a chance to wear it :(<br /><br />Seems warm and very comfortable. I would order another but the promotion is no longer valid."
3.0,"I love this dress, but it is completely see through. It's very flattering and pretty, but I honestly don't know what to do to make it more than a cover-up.  Not sure if I'm returning or not."
3.0,"The purse is ok. The zippers tend to stick quite a bit. The one thing I really dislike aside from the zippers sticking is that they are BRIGHT GOLD! They didn't seem very noticeable in the picture, but in person they REALLY stand out and make the whole purse look super cheap."
3.0,for a 36 it's a bit close
3.0,"I love the way this dress looks on, and have received many compliments when I wore it. The only problem is the fabric wears hot. I live in AZ, so I'll just need to avoid wearing this when it's over 100 degrees. If you live somewhere more mild I doubt you would experience this issue."
3.0,The plastic adjustment hook could be thinner/less bulky. It may show if wearing pants made out of thinner fabrics.
3.0,"These fit my 7 year old son pretty well. They're just big enough that he'll be able to wear them for a while and small enough that they don't hang on him like he's wearing an adult's shirt. He thinks they're a little long, but he's been wearing clothes that are getting too small for him so I don't think they're really too long. He's about 4'4"" tall and 66 lbs. According to the doctor he's about the size of an average 9 year old...<br /><br />The main reason behind taking off 2 stars is the construction of the shirts. There's lots of strings/threads hanging off these and some of the seams are either not quite sewn right or are already coming apart. It's hard to give a shirt a great review when it doesn't seem like they're going to last very long."
3.0,"This was a nice dress but didn't fit me the way I was hoping so I sent it back.  My only complaints, other than that it didn't fit me, were that the liner was a little clingy and made shadows that highlighted any underlying flaws, and the break at the neck wanted to flop forward so the inside showed.  It was also a little longer than I expected, falling past my knees, but I'm short.  On an average sized person it would probably be knee-length."
3.0,It was so cute but the was it was meant for short girls. I'm 5.7 and this swimming suit was just not long enough to fully cover me
3.0,"The size and style are good, but stitching is poor and falling apart before we even use it....hopefully my poor sewing will get it to hold for our event coming up"
3.0,Dress fits amazing but the sleeves are too tight to be 3/4 so I ended up rolling them up to be above my elbow so I could bend it without having the fabric almost rip
3.0,This product is smaller then i thought it would be & I don't like that it came with no chain..
3.0,"These are see through, too short, and they do not stay up. I bought these according to other leggings sizes and the size chart. They fit, however, even the slightest squat makes them see through. If you are tall or have curves, spend your money elsewhere."
3.0,"I really like these tank tops. They are cute and comfortable. Can be worn with a lot of different looks. They also aren’t too long like a lot of other tank tops. However, I bought these 1.5 years ago and some look very worn - holes, thinning threads, weird stretch marks, etc. I haven’t been digging ditches in these. Just normal use like going to work or staying at home. That is why I am giving them a 3. They are nice but you’ll have to buy new ones every 1-2 years. I remember a time when that wasn’t the case with clothes."
3.0,"The spinner is kinda loose, so it’s a little jingly whenever I move my hand. The edge isn’t sharp, per se, but it does scratch my center console when I buckle my seatbelt, I had to switch the ring to the other hand. Overall really cute though. Size is a true fit."
3.0,Three of the four Fit just great one pair was missed labeled
3.0,"Bought it in green. The color and cut are pretty but the material is super wrinkly, bought it for a weekend trip but decided not to take w me because of this. ok for home"
3.0,It was very cute but for someone with a larger breast. It was not loooking / fitting right. I'm a 34 DD.
3.0,Not what I expected. Just fair. Kind of thin material
3.0,It's great! Perfect for my watch.
3.0,The barbell part is great but the actual skull isn't stainless steel so it tarnishes.
3.0,Love the color just a little bigger than expected and the 2mm was smaller than expected.
3.0,I liked the soft pink color. Quality is good with the exception of<br /><br />the stitching on the bows.  The third time she wore them both bows fell off and one was lost.  She had only wore them to church probably a
3.0,Still not big enough. Second pair this summer form Amazon and I cant say you can depend on the &#34;over-sized&#34; descriptions...
3.0,"I really like this dress, BUT the material is kinda of cheap which was extremely dissapointing because the cut and design is very cute and complimenting."
3.0,"For me the fit was off, I got a medium, I'm 32, 27, 38. The top part was way to big and the bottom by the hips was too small."
3.0,Beautiful coat but way to small. Ordered regular size. Has a waist that is small.
3.0,Sleeve is different than expected.
3.0,The bag arrived as expected and is great quality. However the excessive number of emails asking for a review were quite frustrating (2-5 in a single day?!) and i don't know that i would order from this store again.
3.0,The material is a little cheap but it works if you are using it for costumes.
3.0,Love this lanyard. The only bad thing is that after several months is started to change color.
3.0,"Not really grey in color, has a hint of purple."
3.0,Are they better at clothes manufacturing than Photoshop?? Good grief!! I sure hope so!!!
3.0,"I ordered this belt in red - and while the elastic part is a true red, the &#34;leather&#34; front portion is actually an orange color. Doesn't match what I wanted it for - but it is comfortable so I am sure I will find another use for it. If you are looking for a true allover red - this is not the belt for you."
3.0,I have previously bought sunglasses like these within the last month. I loved the ones I had bought before and decided to buy another pair. Unfortunately the nose piece was missing and the frame was scratched all over. Pretty disappointed in this buy.
3.0,The tongue on one of the black mask is black instead of pink
3.0,Very cute but doesn't work! No lights! Was excited to use for Christmas party.
3.0,"The coin scarf that was delivered to me was much darker than shown in the picture, and came a little dirty."
3.0,"5'4&#34;, 27 Waist, 37 Hip, 120 lbs. I bought size 29 in blue based on chart and reviews, answered questions. Some reviewers say these pants stretch and some say they don't. I found out that they really DON'T. According the the sizing chart for the blue color I needed less than one inch of stretch in the hip area and just couldn't get it comfortably. Definitely view the numbers on the chart as the max measurement possible.<br /><br />Size 30 or 31 would likely fit me better, but the product was heavier duty than I was looking for anyways. I was looking for stretchy legging jean material with a little fuzz on the inside for warmth and what I got was regular jean material with a fleece blanket inside. Great if you're living in below zero temps, but too much for where I'm at! Plus the fabric was very stiff and uncomfortable in my view, so I won't be exchanging.<br /><br />On the upside, the quality is phenomenal and they flatter like crazy! I did love the stretchy waistband too, it fit perfectly and didn't leave any gaping at all which is very rare for me to find. If you have a less curvy backside, average sized thighs and you're looking for SUPER heavy duty warm jeans then these are definitely the way to go!"
3.0,It's adorable but too small. I would recommend it for a young teen. I had the returned it.
3.0,Fits perfect but the material could've been better but it's still cute
3.0,"Graphic is nice, 5XL feels like 4XL and material is thin and stretchy."
3.0,The frames are kind of flimsy compared with others that I have purchased.
3.0,It's a very nice coat but too bad it's a bit too big for my 5'2&#34; frame. The material is thick so it'll good nice with leggings and boots in the winter!
3.0,"It's O'K sunglasses, frame has acceptable quality for the price, however lens quality is not good at all.  The best part about them is case, packaging and seller's return policy.  I had to return them to get something better."
3.0,"This is an amazing swim parka for keeping you toasty and dry after a swim, but honestly, how could they have gone so wrong with the zipper on such an expensive and otherwise wonderful product? Others have mentioned this to in their reviews. I almost returned this, because the first time I zipped it, it took me more than 10 minutes.  Such an obviously important component of staying warm, and yet the company has failed badly in this area. Otherwise, it's a wonderful parka."
3.0,"This lace headband is alright for the price, however it looked a lot rattier then it did in the pictures. There was a bunch of random strings poking out, I had to end up trimming the extra threads off."
3.0,"The backs of the earrings seem to have the 925 stamp on them. The ""pearl"" is plastic, but what can you expect for the price? They are cute and I should get a lot of wear out of them."
3.0,"A little small but cute. Though the front was a bit different and it wasnt pleated, just wrinkled. Very cute with a petticoat"
3.0,"It is nice that I can wear earings without them bothering me as bad.  They seem to work well for post earings, but when wearing hoop earings they still seemed to hurt some.  They are very chintzy, but better than nothing.  They don't hold up well.  I already split a few open and they are very easy to lose as they fall out of your ear.  I think it is great that I can at least wear earings, where before I couldn't even wear them at all.  I would like to find a product like this that is just a little stronger and less flimsly."
3.0,inexpensive and cute. love the bike.
3.0,Changed color fast without using in the water
3.0,"Product collects lint and feels cheap. They’re very cute, but with two boys I’m sure they won’t hold up. I didn’t fault the company for this, but the items are hand wash only which is oh so much fun when you have a child wearing them. I didn’t know that when I put it in the wash and it came out half disintegrated. The black is made with a material that attracts any other particle to it."
3.0,Somewhat small for size 9.5. The nice thing is that it does not fell off like others.
3.0,"Good enough faux leather, but the metal broke!!"
3.0,These are really well made but sized too small for me to wear.<br />I'm a size small in every brand that I own but I will need a medium in this brand in order to wear them.<br />It makes me very sad as these appear to be really nice. I think they would have been awesome.
3.0,Did not remain on my head all night
3.0,Cute but small. Great price
3.0,Looks good but quite ridged
3.0,"I bought this necklace as part of a gift for my sister since she loves the Divergent series. The item came in about 45 days. It is somewhat as pictured, it looks nicer in the picture than in real life. Also, it smells HORRIBLY of cigarette smoke. For the $2.50 I paid for it I can't complain but I thought I'd leave a review so others would know before they order."
3.0,"As long as they're not hitting my face as I try to run this weight off, I'll accept it.  But if you're looking for cuteness fit? This item is NOT for you."
3.0,Was cool for months then 2nd snap stopped working.very hard to get on.wont buy with snap fasteners again
3.0,"Followed the size chart and comments and ordered an XL, but it was gigantic. I will return and order my usual size, either small or medium."
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but unfortunately I don't love the look on me. I got a large and I normally wear a size US 12, measurements 40""/30""/40"". I think it does fit as well as it can, so that's not the issue for me. I think part of the problem for me is the tie doesn't hit me at my waist, so cinching it up doesn't give me anymore shape than if it wasn't tied. It could just be personal preference, but I felt that this dress made me look top heavy.<br />I did like the length of the dress, I'm 5'4"" and it hits a few inches above the knee. The dress is lightweight, so it would be good for summer. The color is exactly like I expected, it's a nice olive green."
3.0,I like the hat.  It fits my large head (nearing 8 if it's been a while between haircuts).  Only reason for 3 stars?  The brim seems disproportionately large to me.
3.0,"Ok, they are very stretchy  the roll up my thighs a bit. No real tummy controll though."
3.0,Love these but the rubber comes off all the time. Doesn't stay on. Otherwise good buy.
3.0,good design though the bra does not support the big breasts.
3.0,"When I read large I was like ""Nah its fine, it can't be that bad."" I'm not the biggest dude (6'0 ft and 140ish lbs) but this hangs off me. You probably want fit a XL to make this work. Also one thing I didn't know was the cuff area is sewn together at the bottom (see last pic), it was a little weird at first to put on be after putting it on once or twice to learn to raise your arm as you put it on."
3.0,"So I love the design of the actual pendant, it's pretty and modern and interesting looking. However, the chain is heavy and very very long. I'm currently using it, but will be replacing it for a shorter, lighter weight one soon that doesn't feel so cheap. I'm also not 100% certain if wearing my Fitbit Flex2 in the pendant reads all my steps as I've had days where I know i walked a lot and my total is a lot lower than expected. I will have to do a test and walk somewhere I know exactly the distance and see what the reading is that I get. This may not be an issue for pedometer pendants in general, not specific to this design though. All in all, I feel like this is overpriced, but it's alright."
3.0,You have to be six feet for this dress to work. I’m 5’1’ and I have at least six inches on the floor with heels.
3.0,Too tight in the arm area.
3.0,"Very comfortable. However, it could be quite hard to breathe if you’re around a very hot place."
3.0,"I'm size 0-2 , this dress way too big for me ."
3.0,I have gone through three paid of these because they are so cheap and keep breaking but they are so cute on..
3.0,My order just arrive in the mail and it is missing the cross straps
3.0,"Received this today. The product information clearly states it is 100% cotton. It is actually 95% cotton/5% spandex, which is not what I was looking for or promised. I am very irritated. Back it goes."
3.0,"Really thin and scratchy. Mine hit at my ankle, not above as in the phto."
3.0,"It is what it is for the price. It is sturdy, and fits my big head well. It is just a costume hat. Don't have any other expectations than that. Spend the $50+ and get a nice one if you are planning on wearing it beyond part of a costume."
3.0,"I really like this kimono, it's just like the picture. Very nice, thin, breathable material. The only complaint that I have is that when I received it already had a tear on the back where the arm is stitched to the back. I sewed it back up, but of course it looks a bit tacky because you can see frays."
3.0,It's pretty but it doesn't fit my 15 year old daughter's ear. It was too big. :(
3.0,"These pants were ordered to use as part of a 70s costume for a music program. For the price charged, they are cheaply made, thin fabric, and they run small. I gave three stars because they served the purpose I needed them for. If you need them for more than a few wearings get something else."
3.0,"The hoops were good quality and the right size, however, I bought these for my tragus piercing and they were a nightmare! It is virtually impossible to put the ball back into the hoop while the ring is in your ear. I had four different people try with no success. I'm sure this product would work as a nose, lip, or cartilage hoop, but I do not recommend it for a tragus piercing."
3.0,"Not exactly what i expected.  You can't fit more than two ties and even with two, it's difficult to keep them organized without pulling them out wrinkled.  If you add in the cuff links and/or tie clips, it bulks it up and even leaves an indentation on the ties themselves.  Not worth the money."
3.0,Well I guess I didn't pay attention to what fitnit this fits.  I gave it three stars because I had to send it back.  It does not fit my Fitbit.  Otherwise it probably would have got 5 stars
3.0,"Fabric is definitely that of what you pay for.  Arm holes are extremely long and reveal a lot for me, who is 5ft. 4 in."
3.0,"These are cute shorts, I paid less than $10 for them and the quality is pretty good. The reason I can’t give them 5 stars is they run pretty small I got an xl and I am pretty sure they will fit my daughter who is a 3/4."
3.0,Cute but not great quality
3.0,"I got these shorts to use while running. Unfortunately, they don't work for me for running. They are thin and don't hold my phone well. They also don't have anything on this inside of the leg bottoms to keep them from creeping up while I run.<br /><br />Another problem with these is that they have a ton of loose threads inside on the seams which tells me they aren't especially well made. I want to like these but they are better for wearing around the house or running quick errands on a hot day. They aren't as good for working. out."
3.0,"I was looking for a pajama set and this one looked cute.  I wanted a pajama set with food and I love pizza.  I ordered a large even though I am medium since I didn't know about the fit.  I usually like to wear baggier pajamas since I want to be comfortable.  However, when it arrived, it had the strangest fit.  The shorts fit well but the top was like a crop top and very small for a large size.  Also, the material for the top was thin so it very see through.  I didn't bother returning it since I liked the shorts.  I would not recommend this pajama set."
3.0,"Its kinda cool looking but the material feels like cheap crafting felt.  The fur isn't much better. I was hoping to wear these inside my hunters and if you're envisioning the same, just turn away.  they don't really fit well over the top of my hunter rain boots."
3.0,"lightweight, kind of feels chinzy"
3.0,It is uncomfortable but it does the job on short trips if you don’t carry it more than 30 minutes. Great as man-purse for flights and other travel
3.0,"I bought the dress for my daughter. It arrived quickly and we love it.  Other reviewers are right, go up two sizes. I went up one size to 8/10 and it doesn't zip past lower back. I'm going to see if I can swap out zipper and add a panel of fabric but that's a lot of work."
3.0,nice shirt somewhat large I had to take it to the tailor
3.0,"Dress was nice but it is for an adult, not a junior, for sure, it did not fit my daughter at all.  Had to return it for a fitting reason only."
3.0,Not really for curvy women 🤷🏻‍♀️ Oh well I guess. It just didn’t fit right for me and my curvy body.
3.0,Did not like the fit .. it looked as if I need to change my diaper! Not complimentary… I would like this to be in a fabric with stretch.<br />Not a happy purchase.
3.0,I like it! nice large scar but it is one sided.
3.0,"Great handbag, I own one in black and in camel. However, both bags seem to have a faulty outside pocket zipper. I do not overfill this pocket and I am not hard on handbags. I receive MANY compliments on this bag."
3.0,Love this dress😍
3.0,Its not contrablein your neck
3.0,Didn't like fabric & arrived with broken zipper
3.0,They're cute and the length is just right but wow are they crazy wide. My kid has average width feet and she can't even wear these with socks they're so wide. They're just as precious as they can be too.
3.0,I LOVED this sweet dress... it was simple but it was too big and I ordered a M. It kept slipping off! I wanted to replace BUT to go a size down it was going to charge me more including shipping when I have prime... just disappointed 😔
3.0,"I received this shirt yesterday and it is beautiful but its very sheer and it doesn't look like it is in the picture so I was disappointed in that because I wasn't expecting to have to wear another shirt under this. So, make sure you are aware, they are sheer and not solid as the picture appears."
3.0,"Really like the Winks Santa Hat, the fabric part of the hat seems well made, and the blinking lights are very cool and festive. Unfortunately, the wires are thin and cheap and apparently there is a loose connection somewhere, so it is difficult to get the lights to blink. I end up playing with it for 4 or 5 minutes to get the lights to start blinking and then have to very carefully set the control box down inside the brim of the hat sot that it doesn't turn off again. Wish the wiring were better, then it would warrant a better rating, disappointed."
3.0,"I read every review and decided to go ahead and get this dress. For the price I'd say it's worth it! The color is rose gold (very pretty), not bronze as some others stated.. I got the Large. I wear an 8 to 10, typically. I wear a medium (usually) and all reviewers stated that I should go up a size and I did. The fit is not bad, it's some what loose around the middle and hips for me and fits everywhere else just fine. It's not as tight on me as on the model. The slit at the bottom middle is actually pretty and does stay a little close together. It's not super high on me. It stops half way up the thigh. The bottom hem hits the knee. The model seems to have the dress tighter around her middle, so i expected the dress to be more snug in the mid section. I'm very curvy and wanted this dress to show that off. My measurements are 36 DD, 29 inch waist and 39 inch hips, very hour glass. I like my shape and was hoping this dress would show it off. I still like the dress and am planning to keep it. I might have the middle section altered. As for the itchy sequins, they are indeed itchy. There is a soft lining, but the sequins poke through every so often. but not enough to not wear the dress. the short sleeves are not super tight, but the sequins do scratch the under arm. I might try to figure something out for that. For a dress I may need to alter all over, I like the dress enough to keep it and fix it to my body shape."
3.0,"Body of the jacket was okay; however, the sleeves fit too snuggly when wearing a long sleeve shirt."
3.0,Product is pretty but slides off and ive dropped it before
3.0,Cute shirt but runs way small and can only be dry cleaned. Spot cleaned and it's already started falling apart. Cheap material.
3.0,With constant use it stretches terribly. Quite baggy in the crutch area.
3.0,bottoms were paper thin fabric so I never even tried them on just returned- doesnt look as cute as the photo
3.0,I ordered a junior size for my 5yr old son. It was so small like baby size. Had to return it. Looks like a good quality glasses.
3.0,"For the price, this was an acceptable product. The design is cute, but the sizing is a bit too baggy at the hips. The material is average. If you need something at a reasonable price point, this is not a bad choice."
3.0,Color not really gold
3.0,Fits small. I read reviews and sized up. Normally wear a medium and large fit good. Only problem is color. It is actually a magenta pink not a darker cranberry red like I thought
3.0,Runs pretty small for a plus sized item.
3.0,Not comfortable for the wrist as I hoped. The magneto is in the way of charging most of the time. Looks nice though.
3.0,Doesn't fit in the chest area like I would like it too. Otherwise love the color and print.
3.0,"I like the dress, however they sent the wrong color, so bummed! Really liked the black flowered pattern the best."
3.0,"The shirt looks like a fancier t-shirt on the model. It is not!<br /><br />It was way too large, the coloring was off, and it’s nothing more than a cheap sleeveless shirt. I was disappointed because in the pictures it appeared to be a lot nicer.<br /><br />I was hoping that it would shrink in the wash so it would fit a bit better, it did not....<br /><br />3 stars max"
3.0,"The wallet looks nice and is the size that I expected.  It easily holds my Samsung Galaxy S7 with a CaseMate cover.  I used it this weekend to go out on the town (instead of using a purse) but I was disappointed that the zipper broke and now I have to use the wrist strap just to open / shut the zipper.  I guess it's not really made to really use the wrist strap which is disappointing.  I do not know how to check the RFID blocking aspect of the wallet so I cannot speak to that.  Overall, I wish that the manufacturer would make the zipper and the attachments for the wrist strap stronger, but I am fairly satisfied with the product."
3.0,"I liked how quickly this item arrived, and that the neck size fit perfectly. I wish I could've ordered just one, as that is all I need for my Halloween costume. I would have paid the same amount to have one that had a longer front part, with lower straps on the side. Reviews were pretty accurate, so I wasn't surprised. Just went with these because I needed an XL and couldn't find that size elsewhere. For one night it will work fine, but it is definitely going to be very wrinkled and the front doesn't lay flat under my sweater because it is too short to fully cover my chest. At least I won't be as hot as I would be with a full button down shirt under my sweater."
3.0,"If you are looking for a nice enough looking pair of earrings, but don't care about the quality, than these are perfect for you."
3.0,I purchased these for my mother and they were too small for her.
3.0,"This is a cute dress, but the color of the dress is like NEON pink and really bright and out there. Wish the color was a little bit more softer."
3.0,Slippers ran very wide and shape of front of slippers was not the same ( one seemed square and the other more normal). Otherwise seemed comfortable.
3.0,Might be a good size for a lot of people but I was looking for something more subtle.  Nice quality though.
3.0,"Good in a pinch. However, very, very thin material. Hold it up to the light and you can see all the spaces.<br /><br />The metal zipper tabs are seriously sharp. I wound up getting a pretty nasty gouge up my arm when wrestling with clothes.<br />Buttons came off after the second wash.<br /><br />Definitely signs of cheap labor and material. Which is sad, cause it's the only shorts I found that go past my knees.<br /><br />So, if you're desperate for pants, I'd buy a pair...just one."
3.0,Nice but the color will change on you after a few wears. Outside of that it’s nice.
3.0,The fit was nice but it felt too large as there was an excess of material near my inner thighs. I did end up returning them. I'm debating if I try a smaller size they will fit better.
3.0,Was disappointed that size chart was wrong. It was tight in all the wrong placed
3.0,"It will work for my wedding, but I think I overpaid. It's pretty but you can tell it's cheaply made."
3.0,"These are really, really pinkish/white. They stayed on pretty well without adhesive. They are suitable for only the most white skin tones. Disappointed that they don't have more diverse skin tones at the same price point."
3.0,"Don’t like material. Also, too large for me."
3.0,These pants are light and comfortable.
3.0,Definitely order 1 size up from your normal size. They don't have the same look as in the picture. It's a lot skinnier.  however they still fit nicely.
3.0,short for me
3.0,"They are true to size, and the fabric feels nice. However, they are short... and I don't even have a long abdomen!"
3.0,Somewhat cheap material but good fit. True to size.
3.0,The boots are warm but not waterproof. The soles are non skid but the insoles keep coming out. I bought them to walk my dog but they get wet in the grass. They are not waterproof as stated. They may be okay for city sidewalk use if you avoid puddles.
3.0,Was everything I expected it to be! Love it
3.0,"Love the tint, but the lens scratched the first day I got them. No idea how,  because I'm extremely careful to put them in a soft case."
3.0,Love that it actually is low cut so it’s hidden from view. Not liking the fact that the band at the heel cuts into my heel after a long work day. It makes an impression on my feet. I’m a size 6.
3.0,These are small
3.0,WAY to long and orange top does not match orange in bottom print
3.0,Cute but not like picture.
3.0,"This was a decent dress, but not for it. It would be a good dress for a College party or halloween, but not for actually going out. I'm usually a solid medium in sizes. This fit VERY loose on me so as to not be flattering at all. It also didn't appear to be made very well, so I didn't attempt to buy other sizes to check the fit. Would not repurchase."
3.0,I received my small running belt light and all is good except the usb cord that came with it. It's very obviously defective. Quality control fell down on the job on this one. The belt is a small and still very large. Thankful I have another USB cord to fit it but disappointed in the quality control.
3.0,Nice sweater but sleeves are way to short! It's more like 3/4 sleeves. Could be a factory glitch or just a bad one. I did order 1 size up.
3.0,"Good shoes, they fit well, but the sole of the shoes wear out. I got my first pair 4 months ago and now they leak in water when it rains, I bought a second pair to see if it was just a fluke pair that I bought,"
3.0,I would give it more stars if it  was constructed better and was made of a better material.<br />The main reason I bought this dress was for the wings on the back.<br />The dress is a good foundation for something else that I can make.<br /> I am 5.1 and 105 pounds a bit curvy.<br /> The dress is about 2 inches above my knees and fits right in my waist I'm lucky I'm so small.<br />FYI: I ordered an extra large can you believe it?!
3.0,This product has no softness period so don't buy these if your looking for that ..but they are pretty designs and they have a lightweight silky feeling..not for cold seasons but overall not bad
3.0,"I love the shirt and everything about it, but I would size up one."
3.0,Easy to add to mask and does what it promised. However sweat makes the silicone stick to your skin. It also felt hotter under the mask than usual.
3.0,"This shirt is incredibly soft. It is very stretchy and the fabric feels great on my skin. The ruffles around the buttons seem to be attached sturdily and presumably  won’t come off when washed.  My only dislike is that due to the thin, white material; any of my bras (and multiple tattoos) show through the fabric if worn without a white tank top underneath. This is a fairly easy problem to fix, but it may deter others. Overall, this shirt is very soft and comes with sturdy ruffles around the collar."
3.0,"I got this as a Christmas gift. The band is pretty comfortable, it's a nice color, and it goes well with the face. The main problem with it is the fact that it's not very durable. I could see wear on it about a month after I got it and it broke by month two. Maybe buy a sturdier band in case? The face is excellent. I kept the face and was able to make a make-shift band out of some ribbon and it's held up beautifully. Looks almost like new."
3.0,Pretty dress but puckers a little weird and it squishes the tatas. I was able to squeeze myself into it but didn't fit as expected
3.0,Zippers broke before I even packed anything. Holes throughout in less than a day. Doesn't even make it through a day hike. Only positive are the straps on outside of pack which I used to keep it together.<br />Update.... company was understanding and taking into consideration of zipper problem. We're upfront and concerned about producy
3.0,"Not bad for the price, but the fabric is way thinner than I expected.  I will be keeping it because I needed to use it right after I received it.  But a little more padding or maybe higher quality of fabric where it feels nice to the touch would make it much better.  It does support me very well though!"
3.0,"I thought the colors would be more diverse - I think that I got a miss-packaged group because I'm pretty sure that I didn't get every color. Oh well, they are still pretty."
3.0,Customer services were good but the product was only satisfactory as it broke in the mail.
3.0,"Fogs easily,good visibility and protection"
3.0,cute but runs very small..
3.0,"its o.k. but it did not fit, which i found odd because I've order other products from Allegra K and they have fit perfectly but not this one?"
3.0,Wrist ban to small should be bigger to match face  of the watch
3.0,"too skinny for my ear lobe, didn't look right but i could see how it would look great on other people"
3.0,"Qualitywise , seems flimsy and i wonder if it can last 6 months... other than that, looks OK"
3.0,"I want to love this dress, is super soft, fits well, and I love the color (nile blue), it should be the perfect afternoon dress, BUT it's see through in the sun.  I did decide to keep it and just wear it around the house and as a night gown.  It serves that purpose wonderfully!"
3.0,"Size in length of the two were 5"" different. Ordered a set Navy/Black in Medium size and the black belt was 5"" (inches) longer than the navy.  I decided to void my warranty and take matters into my tailoring hands. I've done this before with second hand belts and the leather tip removal/replacement is no biggy.<br /><br />Pics if you need a blow by blow."
3.0,The quality for the price is reasonable. Nothing fancy but worth the $10 price. Unfortunately the 250mm length is far too short for an average sized wrist. 260mm length would be more reasonable.
3.0,These ran a bit too big so hard to keep on my feet.
3.0,"Hard to put on as the straps are not as stretchy as the need to be for this type of suit. But fits well once you are in it. The modesty cups are inadequate and not attached, they just &#34;float&#34; in the top. You have to adjust them once the suit is on."
3.0,It’s a beautiful dress but I wear a 10 in jeans and a med/large top and the 10 was too small. I feel like the 12 would fit but be super tight so I think I should have sized up 2 sizes. Returning for a bigger size
3.0,"It's sharp at every corner, don't wear if you have young children. It's beautiful but I'm obsessed with sharks not dolphins and it looks not even close to a shark in person"
3.0,"feels a little cheep, but okay for the price"
3.0,Came with some weird glue stuck on it
3.0,"I love the color, I love the material I love the pockets,  it is more of a medium than and XXLarge.  sorry"
3.0,like this
3.0,"These masks fit great and aren’t as heavy as some masks so I will probably wear them more often than I wear my others.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I searched “Masks Made in USA” when these popped up, I bought them.  The package says “Made in Vietnam” on it.  That was quite a shock, considering the way I searched for these.  If you’re looking to buy American, skip these."
3.0,"I loved the color of the shoe, the price and look of the shoe on my feet but the shoe clearly runs small. I've owned several pairs of Puma's over the years and they've always ran true to size but this particular style runs about a half size smaller. My daughter has the exact same pair and had the same issue. I hate that I have to return the shoe and then re-purchase it, as opposed to simply sending them back for and exchange of the size needed."
3.0,"Nice but very uncomfortable, I am going to send them back..."
3.0,Great looking strap but not worth the cost.  Save your money and get an off brand strap.  $65.00 for a small strip of nylon webbing with 3 small metal parts is crazy.
3.0,This dress fit but the fabric is pretty thin. You might have to wear a slip or something underneath. It's supposedly a winter dress but the quality isn't the best. Returned.
3.0,Hats seem decent. Disappointed we didn’t get the best man hat in the set.
3.0,Not sure how I feel about this. The size was cut off and so was the panties size. The bra fits like my old larger bras when I ordered a small size.
3.0,"Great suit, and quality, just didn't like how it looked on me."
3.0,You get what you pay for? However for $12 dollars it works if you're looking for a simple totem that isn't too flashy. I've had mine for a few weeks now and it hasn't shown signs of breaking or corrosion. I will say plan on getting a different rope or chain as mine came attached to what I can only assume was old electrical wire. 3 out of 5 overall
3.0,These glasses are too big for my face.  They do not rest on the bridge of my nose (sometimes a problem I have because of face shape) - will use at home - but not in public (or on Zoom)
3.0,Item as described. Fast ship.
3.0,Spent a little bit more thinking they would be a little bit better but they are actually equal to the cheaper ones
3.0,Beautiful bra but the strap are super short without room for adjustment. My boobs look amazing but my shoulder have marks for days. Too bad the look is absolutely beautiful.
3.0,It was good while it lasted. It fell apart after several months.
3.0,My daughter has a narrow foot.  I ordered a half size up.  She had horrible foot pain within an hour of having these on.  They are really pretty.  Just not comfortable.
3.0,"Not a bad dress.  The quality of the fabric was fine and it looked ok on but it was loose at the waist and tight at the arms, to where I could only lift my arms to the point in the picture.  Might just because of my curvy body type but I ended up returning it because I need to be able to move my arms."
3.0,I expected it to look better. Its v wrinkled upon arrival n when u put it on its more baggy than i thought  I havenot decided yet if i should return it or not
3.0,"The shirt is great material and fairly durable, the problem is the shirt size large is not for people with bulky arms and shoulders, and the XL is to long length wise...."
3.0,Needs trimming and a little thin under nose.
3.0,The rings are cute you have to take really good care of them so that they do not turn.I definitely don't wear them everyday however I was displeased with the shipping it took way too long
3.0,"Lenses are not as big as advertised.  That was the main reason I bought these glasses, so I'm disappointed.  The carved wood is kind of cool, but not to die for.  I'm not feeling good about spending $40 bucks on these glasses."
3.0,"I'll start with the good and make my way to the bad. First, I bought this hoodie (dark green) for work as that's the colors of my employer. I work outside year-round so I needed something to keep myself warm during the cold season. For that part, it definitely fits the bill and helps to keep me warm when the cold hits. It's somewhat thick and is warmer than the hoodie that was given to me by my employer so it gets quite a bit of use. The XL fits me perfectly, no complaints as I prefer my shirts to be a bit more loose fitting to allow for flexibility when on the move.<br /><br />The bad? Well, this hoodie was purchased at the end of November and it already has a hole where the wrist cuff meets the sleeve. It's not a hole from abuse, the thread is simply coming undone already. I can likely repair it by sewing it back together but I'm not too impressed with the quality of workmanship after only a month and a half of use. I have other hoodies that I've owned for years that have been through far more abuse and other than typical degradation from years of washing and wearing, are still in decent shape.<br /><br />Second and even more annoying is the string for the hoodie. It's not secured in place like you'd see in others where there's a channel sewn in to keep it from moving around inside the hood. Every time it's washed, I have to fish the string from somewhere inside the hood back to the edge where it belongs. If it weren't for the knots tied to prevent the string from getting pulled out entirely, it would have already. Again, it's pretty easily fixable by hand sewing but this is another example of shoddy workmanship. I guess you get what you pay for and fortunately, I caught this hoodie when the price was low. It makes me wonder if it's a reject.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent hoodie and does the job I need it to which is keep me warm when it gets cold. Had I known about these problems previous to purchase, I probably would have looked elsewhere though."
3.0,"Way too big. My daughter has to wait until she fits into them. The dissing is off so be careful on this purchase. Other than that, they are cute shoes for toddlers who go through them quickly."
3.0,The 'chain' it came on isn't what is pictured...it's a ceiling fan chain....not exactly 'stylish'......I'll need to replace it if I want to give as a gift.
3.0,Earring were so pretty! But packaging was horrible they were pretty bent
3.0,One clip had a week hinge and the chain didn't hold as well as hoped.
3.0,slides down past toes
3.0,"March 13/2019 A month ago I bought the grey cotton zutano booties and they look great on my baby, until the fabric started tearing. This booties are expensive so  it is not worthy to buy them if they only last for a month. See picture. I am waiting for customer service to responde.  I am hoping there is some kind od warranty. I did not want to buy a cheap bootie beacsue I was afraid of the quality, and then I bought the expensive zutano brand  and the quality  is not what I expected.<br />Uodated review March 14. I initially gave 1 star tothis booties because of the quality problems of the booties. I increased the rating to 3 stars because Zutano's customer services send me label to return the ripped booties and will send me a new ones. I hope these last more."
3.0,Thet graphics was good but the material of the t shirt itself was not good quality.
3.0,"Lightweight shirt that is definitely on the looser side of things. If you want a more snug fit or are between sizes, I would recommend going down a size.<br /><br />Since the top is lightweight material, it is something that will need additional care to maintain its integrity. Unfortunately, this isn't one that you can toss in the washer and dryer.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about this top is the pocket. I don't know if the placement is off, or if the pocket rips throw off the look, but it looks weird."
3.0,"The length of the shoe is as expected, but the top piece is too big and loose. Its like its made for someone with really really fat feet?"
3.0,I would give this a 5 star but the color is not as shown.  I ordered the wine color and it is more of a rose color.
3.0,"Other than being extremely short waisted, this was beautiful. But my wife couldn't wear it as it cuts deep down there and there's no adjustment. She's 5'6"". May be fine for a petite woman 5' or shorter. It's a shame there's no way to adjust it."
3.0,"These are a very good addition to my Tesla but man they rattle a lot when driving around. If that doesn’t bother you then these are a good deal. But if constant rattles bother you, pass on these."
3.0,Cheap fabric but okay for the price.
3.0,Too small -- picture deceiving -- my fault!
3.0,It's a nice dress but the style did not fit my body type.
3.0,"I was on the fence when I received this blouse.  I really liked the print but wasn't sure if I would like the pullover, button in the back style. I also wasn't sure about the fabric as it felt like it might be scratchy.  I decided to return it and did not try it on, so I can't comment on the fit."
3.0,🤓
3.0,Well made but didn’t fit over my 3 year old’s miraflex so we had to return.
3.0,The face is much darker in the watch I received. Hands are very difficult to see in low light. Case back is stainless steel not the exhibition case back shown in the ad. The band is rubber with no cross weave fabric as shown in the ad. Overall not a close representation of the ad but I kept the watch anyway.
3.0,Cute! but the top is wayyy too small and low.
3.0,Looks good and fit well. Material is cheap and flimsy but expected. Jacket smelled faintly like raw fish after getting it though
3.0,"Not as thick as I would have preferred, but the design is great!"
3.0,"The quality is good, but the small size socks I ordered for my NB baby, maybe will fit her when she's 2 years old."
3.0,I just received this sleeper and I am disappointed.  The image they show has the pattern lined up correctly across the zipper. It is not. I think the image should represent the product correctly.  Especially for a 40 dollar sleeper.
3.0,"Black is in the title, so I thought it was black, not navy. The waist is just a little too small with gaps appearing when I sit down. I wear it for work and fortunately have a jacket the same color. I did not see a keyhole lower on the back just above the waist. However, I only bought it to show my upper back tattoo. I will now have to wait until I lose another 5 pounds or so. Unless there is enough seam allowance to let the sides out. I will most likely also shorten the hem a little to make it more like I want it."
3.0,Too many strings that get in the way.
3.0,Very thin.  Runs small
3.0,"This bag is not quite what I expected.  It smells like plastic (think how shower curtain lining smells).  The smell does not go away, either.  It does not have as much space as I expected as it is pretty rigid on the inside.  The zipper end hangs out, again not what I expected. I was thinking that if I like the bag in black, I would buy a second one in a different color.  The bag is okay, but I don't think I would buy another one."
3.0,"Quality wise, this shirt seems to be decent.  There were a few lines of stitching with the excess string hanging loose that needed to be cut off.  But my biggest complaint would have to be the size.  When I buy a shirt from a local retailer I wear a large/x-large.  I know from past experience that most clothing that is ordered from China comes smaller than usual, so I ordered an XXL.  What I received was labeled XXL but in reality it is closer to a medium/large at best.  The sleeve length and the overall length of the shirt are fine, but the waist and chest are far too small.  I would suggest buying this and adding 2 sizes if you want it to fit properly."
3.0,"Dress was wayyyy longer than pictured on the model (I’m 5’4 125lb). It also was pretty big, although I suppose it’s meant to be a flowy dress. Just not for me so I returned."
3.0,The color is spot on. I got a army green canvas bag. The reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the front pockets are a little too baggy. I’m a wound care nurse and need for my tools to stay put. Also the top opening is a tad small for my folders and clipboard to fit easily. Other than those issues it’s a sturdy industrial sort of bag.
3.0,"Larger than expected, but okay because they’re just to sleep in"
3.0,"Great product when it works.  The fan stopped working in manual mode after about thirty minutes of riding the first time out in heavy snow and low visibility at 30 degrees F.  Next time out after a full charge a week later the fan wouldn't work in manual mode but it did work in auto mode for about 2 hours in flat lighting at -15 degrees F.  I ride with the goggles over my glasses ands have struggled with various setups and I thought this be quality solution I was hoping it could be but I'm out $300 plus for another ""gimmick"" system that doesn't work.  I should go back to buying snake oil.  UPDATE:  after 3 months of dealing with 509 customer service, I got sent a new pair of googles and returned the bad ones to them.  They appeared to work out of the box but now that winter is almost over (4-6-2023), I will only get limited chances to test the googles out."
3.0,"It's a cute top and comfortable, but after just two washes there was a hole in it. I bought it to wear around the house while working from home so it's not the end of the world, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for wardrobe staples."
3.0,"These earrings are great except very difficult, at least for me, to get off the balls don't unscrew easily:/"
3.0,"I like the casual bohemian look of it. It was just shorter than i expected. It doesn't fall at or below the ankle. I ordered an xsmall, so maybe the small was a better choice. I am 5'1/2"" about 145 lbs. I will keep it though. The material is a cotton knit."
3.0,"Material where you line up the zipper gets in the way, the zipper itself is also a bit chinsey. One of the sleeve ends had a small hole, rather than sending it back it was simpler to just sew it myself. It wasn't put together very well, but you get what you pay for.<br />It fits well, looks good, but could have been put together better."
3.0,"I bought these leggings specifically because they were recommended on a fitness forum as not being see through, even when bent over. Unfortunately, this is not accurate. I purchased the medium and these fit perfectly but you can definitely see my panties through these when I bend over. It's subtle enough that I would wager a guess that if I purchased a size larger this would possibly eliminate the problem. But like I said, they fit perfectly as is.<br /><br />I am giving these 3 stars, almost gave them four because despite being a little see through, these are really great quality and fit awesome. I got the blue ones and I will definitely be wearing them, just with some skin toned panties.<br /><br />I might even try buying a size up next time I need a new pair and see how much that helps with the see through aspect."
3.0,"I washed it before I put it on, the colors got all splotchy, and I washed in cold water with Woolight and hung it up right away..."
3.0,These will be only  worn on game days now. I wore them one time to the gym. They do not stand up to squats. They are indeed super cute tho and show my Packer fan side :) but to claim them as work out pants I had to give 3 stars
3.0,The bottom is not as A-line as it appears in pictures.
3.0,Very pretty pair of earrings! I adore them especially for the price. They are very small and would look great on a child but I'm a grown woman who normally just wears studs and they fit me nicely as a simple sparkly accent which is what I prefer. Unfortunately one of my earrings did arrive slightly bent but you can't tell and it doesn't hinder using them. For the price I'll enjoy them 😀 They were shipped in a very small thin plastic envelope...I'm thankful the post workers have such great eyes and didn't lose it.
3.0,Fabric is thinner than it looks.  Definitely made for a very tall person.  I’m 5’10 and the torso area is almost too long for me. But beautiful and has a pretty look and is super comfy
3.0,"Soft, color seems solid and doesn't appear see-through but the cut definitely seems smaller. I don't love the elastic waist and they aren't as high waisted as other brands."
3.0,"well built, good looking, shorts but the crotch area is a little too tight"
3.0,The front clips keep popping off because they are not tightly assembled. Takes a bit of plier work to tighten the hardware and make it work. Otherwise these are ok. You get what you pay for.
3.0,"Pearls around waistline we're already falling off and I had to hot glue back on. Beautiful dress otherwise, but was not expecting to do any maintenance considering price paid."
3.0,"nice shirt, fades pretty fast in the wash."
3.0,Very fragile.
3.0,"Its okay, kind of kiddie looking! i'll give to my neice."
3.0,It fit but it was a little snug!
3.0,they are too slippery to wear as a head band or head covering. Could probably use as a sweat band but not much else.
3.0,"Reall nice for my daughter but the straps are too long.  The front exposes way too much, so she wears a black sports bra with better coverage under it.  If I shorten the straps enought there is no place for her to put it on.<br />She uses it for gymnastics .<br />The legs are great."
3.0,"I'm a big Fitover fan, and these fit well and have the quality this line is known for...<br /><br />However the Ivory tusk color is TERRIBLE! It looks cheap, and this colored frame GLOWS in the sunlight. It's like having a halo around your sunglasses...!  These looked great on Fitover's website in publicity stils and in their Youtube videos, but were to me very disappointing in person. Not to mention that any frame that becomes Day-Glo, around my eyes, in sunlight is a deal breaker for me...!"
3.0,"It’s just a ring.<br /><br />I mean, it’s cute, and it didn’t turn my finger green, but beyond that, it’s just a ring. It seems very cheap, but at the same time, I think it was only $13.99?<br /><br />I’m not sure if this qualifies as “costume jewelry” but it didn’t really do anything for me."
3.0,The earring backs fall off. I lost my earring due to the back falling off.
3.0,Can’t get them again I like these and I like the the trink that I got but there’s no way to put them on anything everything I have bought doesn’t work so I spent like $100 and I can’t even use the things and I can’t send them back because it’s been too long so I’m stuck with them
3.0,Its definitely cute...but didnt realize how BIG it is. I thought it was like a wristlet wallet....this thing is huge...barley fits it the matching bag.
3.0,"Cheap. Smells bad, pretty sure its not chiffon."
3.0,Good concept. Not terribly comfy. Doesn't stay on very well. Definitely needs to be washed before wearing. Very strong smell new.
3.0,I was really on the fence about this dress but it's way too long for me and not quite tight enough to be flattering so it just looks like I'm wearing rag doll clothes. I'm 5'4 125 lbs and there was about 6 inches of material hanging on the ground. The dress seems like it is supposed to be worn inside out? But even the shoulders
3.0,"I gave this three stars because of the fit and the stitching. I read comments on many American flag dresses, including this one. I thought getting a large would fit due to other reviews. In my case, large was wayyy to big. Also, the stitching was poorly done. There was long loose tread hanging from the back of the neck."
3.0,Inside lining fell apart after 4 months of regular use.
3.0,"They are all really pretty, but I didn’t realize just the back ball screwed off, making it impossible to get on for a tragus piercing"
3.0,"Too small, uncomfortable.  I threw it away."
3.0,"Only comes with one. Looks nice, not too flashy. Simple but cute. Feels good on my foot. It was very light."
3.0,Nice dress….just not for my niece. It didn’t fit her well. Love the color.
3.0,For the price the product was fine. The shoe was really wide.
3.0,"I don't have a particularly large head, but I do have a lot of hair which is why I wanted such a silly hat in the first place.  I'm a professional gardener and need the coverage but can't stand my hair not being up while I'm working.  It's pretty small and a bit tight to wear all day.  It has an adjustable band to tighten in that I will never use except to hold my ponytail in place, but certainly not to reduce it in size.  It needs to be made bigger to accommodate more sizes, or be sold in different sizes. Otherwise, seems durable but I honestly only wear it on the longest sunniest days because it gets uncomfortable, so when I'm doing a shorter shift in the sun, I opt for something else that's more comfortable with less coverage.  My dermatologist would not approve as I need the sun protection all the time, but it's just not comfy enough."
3.0,Cheap material but was nice for a little bit
3.0,I ordered 3 different sizes and the 12 was the only one that was a bit wide in the chest and the back would not lay as it should to present the beautiful ribbon crossing in the back
3.0,Does not fit the way shown on model. It’s a bit short. Still not a bad top though. I recommend a size larger than your normal size.
3.0,Did not wash up as well as I would expect
3.0,Bought it becoz of good reviews.  Did not do a stellar job on my jewerly.
3.0,"Very pretty, but seems to run small."
3.0,Nice enough but the script is so small and kind of off. I wouldn't recommend it.. I about never wear mine.
3.0,thickness
3.0,"His crazy, size 8, women's ring for her doesn't change colors. Very unhappy with it."
3.0,"These are ok, no big standouts, and the clasps are really hard to open, they're stiff.  Also, I did not receive the flattened ones that I ordered, instead I received the rounded tube hoops which I already have too many of."
3.0,Shrunk in the wash a little
3.0,"Nice print, but way too big. I'm 5'4&#34;, 115lbs and I was swimming in the small."
3.0,Didn't know where or how to return it...
3.0,"It was fine, but after 3 weeks the metal fastener came off. Could not locate it to put it back. So it is not wearable until I locate the little bar fastener."
3.0,They're best for a child or small adult. If stretched too much they break. Colors are nice. Bands stay true to size.
3.0,"If you sell a band it should be complete.  This band came without a clasp or the inserts the pit into the band,  Useless without the other parts."
3.0,These r nice but the fall apart to easy
3.0,Useful but not quite classy enough
3.0,"This jacket works fine as a layer, but is extremely thin, and features no functional pockets whatsoever. The zipper quality is also extremely poor, and seems like it would rust easily. Having said that, it fits well for a men's large, and it is effective as a rain proof layer which dries quickly."
3.0,"Bought two of these as gifts (both size L) for women in my family. The material and quality of the dress were great, very soft and comfortable but not translucent. The dresses technically fit, but the hem is much higher than in the picture, more like 'mid thigh' not 'just above knee.'  And the neckline scoops a bit lower than on the girl in the picture. For reference, both women are roughly 5'8&#34; and normally wear a large in US women's sizes."
3.0,Nice hat. Will serve its purpose of sun protection.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:62576d267c27de53b2214e418ce8430c]] When I first opened the package I was a little taken back at how poor the fabric quality is. Maybe after the first wash it will soften up. The lining on the inside is white which makes it appear cheap as well, since the main color is black. The tie in the front has the same pattern on both sides so when you tie it it doesn’t show the white lining, which is a huge plus. I purchased the black w/skull & crossbones  size Medium for my flight on Halloween to Hawaii. If you plan to use this top for a specific Holiday then I would say sure. However 25 bucks is a bit steep.<br />For Reference: I’m 34B, 27in waist, 5’10, slim build."
3.0,Nice but not as nice as pictured
3.0,"They are beautiful, but the chains are dark in a few days of use."
3.0,I like the blouse. Fits a little big and the elastic came off after one use. Had it fixed and it fits better. Not a bad blouse for the price.
3.0,"The bar is short, so I tried taking off both sides and putting it on a different bar but only the “me” side comes off so I ant do that. Also when you tighten it the words don’t exactly line up, it’s a little crooked"
3.0,"Looks prettier in the picture than in person. It's okay, but not great.<br />I don't like how the sides stick out. You can't see that in the picture, but they do.<br />It's plain, but sturdy and heavy-duty. Feels like it will definitely last long.<br />The only attractive thing about it, is the bow and key chain ornamentation on the front.<br />Honestly, I'm not in love, but it was inexpensive, and it'll do the job.<br />It's not as if it's ugly, just not as pretty as pictured."
3.0,"Thinner thank unexpected. Would'nt really consider high waisted and sizing is definitely small, size up. Works for the one event I need it for"
3.0,"I was really excited when I received them. They were packaged in sets and I was so excited to style them. However, after the second time I wore them they started turning green. I was so bummed because they were really cute. I even wanted to order some as a gift but I realized that they didnt last very long."
3.0,not adjustable
3.0,"The print has nothing to do with the picture , or color."
3.0,The waist in this dress hits high (and I have a short waist) and the pattern changes right under chest- Not as flattering as I wished.
3.0,im a 36F and wish it was a little smaller
3.0,Pro: it’s what I was looking for!<br />Con: it’s a little scratchy. I’m hoping it’ll soften in the wash.
3.0,"One tiny pull on the ear and it can off half way. But other then that, it's adorable. Do get me wrong, but I like this product."
3.0,Literally love the style of this bag. Only thing is that one of the gem things came off and I had to super glue it back on which was pretty disappointing but what can you expect from amazon.
3.0,Dress fits great! only thing is it isn't as blue as the picture. I was expecting royal blue it's more like a navy blue.
3.0,"This looked so cute in the picture and since I bought something similar from amazon, I gave this a shot. Sadly it was oddly bagging in weird places. I did not find it to be flattering on my body shape and size at all. The arms were baggy but the chest was super tight. It just did not fit me at all. I felt like I might pop seams in places and needed tailoring in others. At least for me this was a no go."
3.0,"Of the 4 I’ve ordered from this seller, OURS, with the 51% of discount code, all 4 did not arrive as pictured. The fabric is SHINY. However, they serve their purpose in this 105 degree weather. They are lightweight with a stretchy waistband. I’ll keep them since they were all 51% off."
3.0,For smaller women for sure great color though
3.0,"I was looking for a sun shirt for a trip to Belize, and this was definitely not it. The fabric is fleecy on one side. It would be better in a cooler place."
3.0,"Returned because they didn’t look good with the dress I bought them for. The bow, leaves, etc., are larger than expected"
3.0,Shoes look exactly like picture however Right shoe Does not fit well because the the straps of the right shoe is longer than the left shoe.
3.0,The blouse is wonderful but bigger than needed.  Had to give it to my niece!
3.0,This watch was too big for my wrist.  I will us it as a gift.  I love the looks of it.
3.0,Gave away wasn't excited about this
3.0,Basic .... bland.  Could find better
3.0,The main rose piece in the center fell off but I sewed it back on and it was a great gift for my best friend.
3.0,"I purchased these for work and I was expecting them to be as pictured: a nose bone with a small ball at the end to prevent it from falling out. It was just a clear nose stud with a really long stem. When inserted into my nose, the stem touched the bottom of the inside of my nostril which was uncomfortable. I had to cut it down with some scissors."
3.0,Arrived much later than intended but cute bracelet. Definitely not for anything long term wearing.
3.0,I did not use it looked like kids jewelry.
3.0,Nice earings took forever to get but worth the wait
3.0,To right around the ankles
3.0,"I really like these socks, they fit as expected and look good!  I'm giving it 3 stars as of today because one of the socks came snagged.  I would not expect this for being brand new product."
3.0,too small so I returned
3.0,I bought a medium- am 5’7” 135 lbs and am usually a size small in everything else but wanted them to fit baggy. These were so tight around the booty and thigh area that I assuredly would have ripped them. I returned. The color was also a little more mossy green than expected which was a negative for me- could be cool for someone else.
3.0,I loved the product other than the stitching at the edge was coming undone when recieved.
3.0,Not as I was expecting but is good quality. I was expecting something more of a compression garment. This item is more like a tank/t-shirt. I'd reccomend it as long as they are aware of what they are getting.
3.0,Not so happy.. looks different than the picture.
3.0,"This necklace is very large and looks quite fake, the chain is slightly a darker silver than normal silver would be, so it doesn't match much of my other jewelry. But, it's cute if you can pair it correctly I guess."
3.0,"It's ok- no directions in how to hook up charge port, difficult to stack on another suitcase and smoothly roll, needs more inside organization- items easily fall out of pockets."
3.0,"I got the size 2-4t for my 2 year old who wears a size 8 (normally) in sneakers. They fit my daughter fine, but not tons of room to grow. I would say if in between sizes, size up. Basically what I can say is they are just ok socks. They are pretty thin, so keep that in mind. For the winter these may not be the best choice. Here in Texas these will work fine. They are overall ok quality. You get what you pay for. They’re fine and get the job done. For the price I didn’t expect much at all. I would give them 3.5 stars if I could because the price was so good. The things I will say that are pros are they are nice and soft and also they stay on well. The length is a little bit of an in between length. It’s a little odd. Not really tall enough to be tall but not short enough to be short. I am able to fold them down and cuff them to wear like that."
3.0,"I like the pattern and cut of the dress. However, due to the material, it felt heavy when I tried it on. I ordered a large, which was too big in the chest area. I'm 5'8 160 lbs and a size 36B. The length was nice and it fit nicely in the waist."
3.0,So far a couple pairs have a small hole up on the side of the heel.  Pretty bummed about it since I really like the socks and they are comfortable. One pair on the inside of the heel had tons of excess string.
3.0,It fit fine (I bought a medium) except that the backside of it was way more revealing than the pictures showed. I ended up having to switch out the bottoms because it was a little too much for me. But I loved the top.
3.0,"This cuff is very pretty.  I am giving it only 3 stars because I ordered this piece on two separate occasions.  The first one I ordered, two of the &#34;feathers&#34; popped off when touched.  The second one came with three feather stones already loose in the box.  I used modge podge to glue them back and it looks perfect but they should do a better job of gluing the stones on in the first place."
3.0,"My first review was scathing because the earrings don't close at all, but then I realized I have to bend the arch up and the backing down so they catch more together.  The rigidity of these earrings are very weak so on the down side they probably won't last long but you can probably mold it into an acceptable shape to wear for awhile"
3.0,"It is a ok product, don’t like the back on the earrings. Heavy earring"
3.0,The color is much brighter than depicted in the photo.  Stitching has some missed spots in a seam.  The fabric is sheeny and doesn't lay as nicely as I had hoped.
3.0,sewing quality is not (in my opinion) NFL quality
3.0,"I loved the material and fit of the dress. However, the slit was too high on me. Even if I wore a mini slip under you would still see the mini slip."
3.0,They are larger than the picture depicts except for the leaves. Those are the only ones I can wear
3.0,"They are ADORABLE and seem like they’d be comfortable but I usually wear a 6.5/7 in shoes like this, got a 6.5, I need a 5 at the minimum. There is a chance they sent me the wrong size but it’s not marked anywhere on the box or shoe. Anyway, bummed they don’t have in a smaller size to try."
3.0,The fit is fine but the bottom skirt portion fabric is so stiff.  I felt like it made me look two sizes bigger than I am.
3.0,I normally wear the size I ordered but it is so big I wear it like a sleep shirt.
3.0,It is a little small and chain length is not to long but it is beautiful.
3.0,The product is really nice and a cute thing for the magic band. BUT we all lost ours within the first day. Pops off way to easily.
3.0,"Decent band, but the design is destined to fail.  The excess band goes through a slot and sits under the band.  the thin strap on either side of the slot will eventually break.  I will not order a replacement silicone band from this seller, but I am going to keep it and use it until it does.  Will try to edit this post to update how long it lasted.  9-18-2020."
3.0,"Wore this dress to my baby shower. Gorgeous detail. Perfect dress to wear if you want something flowy and not fitted. I’m 5’3 & weighed 170 at the time of my shower and I purchased a medium. Size fit ok, probably could have gone with a small. Only complaint about the dress is, it was see through!!! Got to the shower only to find out that you could see my panties & padding (couldn’t wear a bra with the dress)"
3.0,It's small in the chest. But the rest is nice.
3.0,Very cute style. Shimmery fabric is super cute and kind of thick. Has stretch but not too stretchy. Straps not adjustable. I wear a medium and this felt too tight. Fit in the chest area well but wouldn’t be good for a long torso. I will probably reorder in a large. The belt is very flattering.
3.0,"True to pattern and color but was very big and made me took very square shaped. Disappointing plastic strap adjuster tabs, they had sharp edges from the mold they were made."
3.0,I returned because the crystals were sparse. Beautiful frame. The company was so gracious to deal with in returning them.
3.0,"Cute, but it gets water spots very easily. Was tough to get the wrinkles out."
3.0,Lining not attached to end of fingers
3.0,much bigger than expected
3.0,"Bought for my wife.  She liked that it was made well and liked the lace applique.  However, what had appeared to be beads in the photo were not beads, but were sequins.  She doesn't like sequins because they tend to make the garment look cheap.  Then, cannot afford to return the garment because shipping the dress back to China on our dime would eat up any refund we might get in return.<br />Buyers beware.  Garments direct shipped from China have to be returned directly to China, which is very pricy."
3.0,"Too big to be believable, and they were so large I hesitated even to put them in my ears. I usually love my Bonlavie jewelry--this was a rare exception. Bonlavie, please make these smaller so they are wearable and believable.!!!"
3.0,Very beautiful but small chain
3.0,I hoped that the bucket hat would have more coverage from rain on my glasses--but did not.  I usually wear bucket hats to keep rain and snow off of my glasses.  The hat is &#34;okay&#34; but if you are looking for a rain hat to keep your glasses from getting wet--I would not recommend it.
3.0,It runs short. Came just about to my belly button. Picture made it appear longer.
3.0,"It doesn't sparkle like that, but its cute."
3.0,Not all that but cheap price
3.0,"My previous watch was a Casio from Amazon. So I felt good about buying this. But this is small, cheap but does the job I guess. Can’t recommend but it works. The buttons are a challenge to press and use. Ok once time is set. The wristband - not good."
3.0,No complaints with the exception that the logo won't wear well.
3.0,"Had to return these shoes. Just did not fit my foot well, but a beautiful shoe."
3.0,it wasnt a soft cup. soft cup depicts tricot. light lining. this was just one layer of fabric
3.0,The product looks just like it does in the pictures! It fits very well and is very comfortable
3.0,One of them went missing during my recent trip abroad
3.0,not what I was expecting but it will work for what I need it for
3.0,"The top is super loose and the rainbow bandage part at the bottom does not tighten, making the top really loose<br />Material Has no stretch"
3.0,I ordered this dress to wear out on the town when I went to Miami May 2019. Was very upset to find that the arms on this dress are super tight. So I cannot accurately give a review for the other areas because I could not get this over my arms so the chest waist and length is unknown. I wanted a bigger size but never heard back from anyone…… Maybe I will try for Miami 2020??
3.0,We brought it to multiple jewellers and nobody would work on it.  Needed 3 links removed so tried to do it ourselves and it broke.  Returned.
3.0,"I'm somewhat satisfied. They're definitely a cross-point between jeans and sweatpants, but I find them a bit too roomy in the crotch (reminiscent of the &#34;drop-crotch/low-crotch&#34; sweats fad... ugh). I also wish that they had belt loops, as the drawstring is a bit inefficient. And if you're trying to hide the fact that they're pajama-jeans, tightening and tucking the drawstring can get a bit annoying. The latter complaint is really my problem, but figured it was worth mentioning. I still enjoy throwing these on when I need to run out quick."
3.0,Not what I expected. Think it comes from China so runs small and wrinkled.
3.0,A size too small.
3.0,These are cheap products. I think you can use them for a couple years then bottles be worn out that is  worth money.
3.0,"Great feel and wonderfully comfortable. BUT, after their second washing they started to slide down They were purchased to help with swelling to my right leg They were supposed to handle a large calf. Too bad because they are extremely comfortable."
3.0,Daughter loves it. Wish I could adjust it more to fit her wrist. She is 9 years old. Doesn't matter. She loves it anyways
3.0,"I used these as &#34;necklaces&#34; for garden memorial cat statues - they never did glow in the dark, but that's ok with me, they would look eerie if they did"
3.0,weird orange color
3.0,About the same as other brands I have purchased.  Can't really evaluate until I see how long they last and how they perform.  So far I've only worn these for 2 days.
3.0,"While the masks are visually appealing, moisture builds up if worn for more than 10 minutes.  The filter is not very breathable.  I'm slightly disappointed in this item."
3.0,"Didn't have all patches on jacket and barely fit, was disappointing."
3.0,"If you have big boobs, order at least two sizes up. I'm a 34D, and ordered a large. The shirt barely covers my bra. Probably going to have to wear it around the house."
3.0,Pretty long In the back and that's not what I was expecting but I tuck it in back
3.0,"Was too big for my head, cute hat, definitely pink!!"
3.0,Didn't fit. Too tight on chest
3.0,"I've had it for about a week now.  At first it didn't come with instructions, so I tried to figure it out myself and I think that I bent one of the ends. I contacted seller and they emailed me the instructions right away, but I tried it once and couldn't get the charm on the bracelet. I maybe doing something wrong. I'll need to wait till I have a lot of time to try it again."
3.0,Make sure to wash it separate as it gives off alot of fuzz. Wish there was a headphone hole in the pocket.
3.0,"Loved the vintage design, fit as expected, a little thin"
3.0,Beautiful bag but this is not hot pink it is a dark raspberry. It has black in it. For those of you that are picky like me. I wanted hot pink so I returned it. The quality was Exactly what you would expect from Kate Spade. A beautiful bag just not the right color for me.
3.0,It’s cute but it’s to short for my taste.
3.0,Belt leather is nice. Buckle is smaller than it appears in the pictures. Doesn't have a belt loop after the buckle.
3.0,"The band that comes with it broke about a week after I got it, but I just put it on my keychain after that. The case itself is what I wanted and works. It's nothing special."
3.0,"Over all good product, good price however gloves are not the same as mentioned in the picture they are solid navy blue color not the one mentioned in its picture"
3.0,I’ll fitting and too long for torso.
3.0,"I am very disappointed. My husband has a groove ring and I kept seeing ads for this one so I bought it solely because it shows a bit of sparkle in the picture on the listing. These rings are not even the slightest bit metallic or sparkly. The coral/rose gold color isn’t even close to the picture either... $30+ for these to come not as pictured. I did size up and they are still snug but that’s ok because silicone rings loosen over time. Still disappointed, though. I though the “tire track” looking design was cool with the sparkles but I don’t really care for it because they’re bland and the color is not the same."
3.0,"Shirt is nice, but pants are tight at the top."
3.0,"Kids weren't really into it so I took one. I wore it in Washington, DC. Boy, did it come in handy. I guess we don't really need something like this in San Diego, but it sure is great for back East."
3.0,I have yet to use them yet but they tend to be larger than the size indicated.  The Description says waterproof but the material looks not to be.  Nice looking boot though and soles really make the boot.
3.0,I had to return this item as I couldn't even get it around my head (I have a big one so it may be my issue). The seller was great though and the item was just as described.
3.0,"When I first put it on I was really excited because it fit well and really provided support.<br />BUT, the seems on the back are really scratchy :( I was super bummed because I rarely find a bra that fits this well."
3.0,"I ordered an XL which is what I normally wear, this is large in the waist,no tummy control whatsoever,  very short length! I am 5'3&#34; and it fell to just below my knees, maybe ok for a summer skirt with sandals, but it does flare out, reminds me of a short poodle skirt."
3.0,Had to send these back because theyre too tight on my thighs.  Everything else fit well but my 23” thigh lol.  Its happened before with other leggins so I dont think its a default but just the way these particular leggins are designed.
3.0,"Look very stylish. I have had many compliments. The reason for three stars is because it has three different length options to wear it with. I prefer for the post holes not to show below my ear lobes. To achieve this look I had to wear it on the shortest setting, but the top two post holes poked my ear and caused quite a bit of discomfort. I was able to take a pliers and cut off the top two post holes which made them significantly more comfortable. Also, after wearing the earrings for 5 days they started turning my skin black/green. $20 earrings should not discolor your skin. Cute- but not worth the money."
3.0,"Nice quality of jewelry and design, but the earrings are too heavy."
3.0,"I loved it, but it was just too small for my big head! it so sad because i didnt even get to try it on properly. oh well"
3.0,"The pendant is very nice, but the chain is junk.  They imply that the chain is sterling with Rhodium plating which is fairly standard to reduce tarnish.  The chain is actually just trash base metal and if the wearer is sensitive to metals then it will break them out.  Best advice is to throw the chain in the trash where it belongs and get a nice sterling silver chain for the pendant."
3.0,the front is connected a lot farther up than pictured so I don't even get to use the tie in the front or it would be all the way up to my neck.
3.0,The bottoms are a little big but other than that it fits good
3.0,"I use 3-4 in a 90 minute hot yoga class.  I COULD wring them out, but they fill up fairly quickly when they are damp.  I wish they were wider."
3.0,Dress is nice but is not the measurements that are posted so it dosent fit. Very disappointing
3.0,"Love this shirt but it has started collecting holes in the fabric after a couple washes. Really cute, just way too thin."
3.0,Not what I expected it to be.
3.0,You can see  through the very thin fabric all your skin
3.0,"Headline description says waterproof. It's not. I wanted to wash dishes without my clothes getting wet, this one didn't do the job. Water went through the thickest section where the pockets are. The colors are vibrant and lovely and it's still usable, just not to protect my clothes from dishwater."
3.0,These shoes are almost perfect BUT there are weird “extenders”on the sides so that when you walk there is too much “give” and the show allows you foot to go farther than it should. If it was just a regular slide - it would be perfect. Needs a redesign to eliminate the elastic “extenders” that “give.”
3.0,product as described. perfect fit for wallet I purchased
3.0,To short!
3.0,"Stays in place, kinda big. It’s also uncomfortable so if you’re going to wear it a lot then I don’t recommend but if you’re buying it for fun then I do recommend"
3.0,I bought it as a replacement for a sweater I lost. It's fine as a replacement but I liked the old softer one better.
3.0,I liked it but it was hard to find a bra that works with it and the collar sits in a wierd spot. The fabric is thick but has a slightly wierd texture.
3.0,I would really like this bra if the cups were  lined with a silicone or something to help prevent slippage butt it falls right off you really without the clear strap attached therefore not really making this strapless
3.0,"These ran extremely small. I'm a size 8 so bought the medium and they were extremely tight. I would need an extra large, I believe. I'm returning them."
3.0,"The hoodie is very nice, I like it.  My complaint is that it came packaged in a clear zip lock plastic bag.  No big envelope, no box, shipping label slapped on the clear plastic bag.  It was clear what the product was as it was exposed to plain sight.  Someone just did not think it was important enough to protect the order.  I guess I am lucky that it did not get ""diverted""."
3.0,"Very cool masks and gloves.  The blue mask wouldn't turn off, but decided to keep them anyway. Just have to remove batteries to return off."
3.0,"The textured sole has too much grip on the exterior artificial turf where I play. So, I had to cut the texture a bit. Might be better for a harder-surfaced indoor court."
3.0,"I can’t quite put my finger on it, but this set isn’t as flattering as I’d hoped it would be.  The material is good and warm.  The color is nice, but just doesn’t give like it was supposed to."
3.0,A little disappointed for the price I paid.
3.0,I liked these but wish all manufacturers would make longer their protective  crotch panels.
3.0,Very thick. Not soft and comfortable like other leggings. 90 degree are the best amazon has to offer. Band kinda digs into your stomach and I sized up...
3.0,cowberry has the second one - bad choice for a blind date
3.0,I have 3 of these dresses already and I love them!  This one is thinner than the ones I ordered directly from their website.  I will wear a slip under it so it's fine.  Be aware though that these dresses pill pretty badly.  I take a sweater shaver to them and they're good as new though!  They also stain very easily.
3.0,The Logo doesn’t looks like the pictures…
3.0,"Support was ok, but not what I typically expect from Asics."
3.0,"Upon receiving these, they look like a child’s pair of pants. Amazingly, they do stretch to fit 5 ft 5 inch me. I had ordered these to wear underneath my skirts. They will work well for that, though with the high spandex they give my legs a bit of a cold feeling.<br /><br />They are ribbed...they do have the “shredded leg” feature none of which matters to me as I didn’t purchase these as outerwear. I did want to point that out. I missed the shredding upon originally requesting.<br /><br />I’m so very glad I didn’t get my size. I cannot imagine how I would have put them on. My daughter is a medium, and she gave up on them. These will work great for my purpose...I’d never wear them without something over them...and be sure to order about two sizes too big. That’s really the biggest problem."
3.0,I like how these look  on me. They are kinda flimsy and not very dark.I hope they hold up through summer.
3.0,The zipper on the jacket is not good quality it’s kind of hard to zip up and down but the jacket itself is very warm and soft and cozy
3.0,Does the job for me. Color is off from the picture described though
3.0,I found these shoes to be stiff and kind of clunky.  I returned them.
3.0,This dress is adorable but no way would it fit a 5 year old.  This thing was huge.  WE brought it to the beach for family pictures with my grand daughter.  We had to bunch up and tie the back up to even fit for pictures.
3.0,"So cute, I love this! Tge issue is the chest rus SMALL."
3.0,Hi folks this is a cropped sweater. It is beautiful and the Pearl's are awesome but I'm not sure I will keep it. It would look great with high waisted Jean's but I'm not sure it would look good on me lol. They should say its cropped in the in the description.
3.0,These are pretty well-made. The only thing I did not like was that they are smaller than regular plastic grocery bags. So even though they are quite durable you’re not able to pack the volume that you would in a normal grocery bag. Oh and the pouch doesn’t really make much sense.  Would’ve been more useful if they had been attached to the back themselves. Otherwise they’re great.
3.0,"Fits smoothly, however, the crotch area looks weird. If you are covering the bottom with a look shirt it is fine. If you wear a short shirt you will have bunching by the crotch."
3.0,Was cheap and looks cheap
3.0,I love this outfit but the sleeves are very small. The top was nice and shorts. Very lovely color and satin yet sleeves cut was weird and very narrow.
3.0,"Cute hat, decent quality. Worth the price."
3.0,"These are cute. They have reindeer and the colors are bright. I didn't realize they need to be hand-washed, but they didn't shrink the in the laundry.<br /><br />Despite those pros, they are VERY thin. I have Raynaud's syndrome, and these socks fall into the category of ""for display purposes only."" They just don't keep my feet warm. On top of that, most of my boots are sized up to accommodate thicker socks, so with these pairs, my boots feel too big.<br /><br />If you are looking for thin socks with a debatable amount of wool and warmth, these might be for you.  I received free pairs in exchange for this honest review, but I would not buy them in the future."
3.0,The seams on the sleeves are not very straight and the sleeves seem a little short - but the quality is good for the price and the v-neck sits nicely.
3.0,super pretty and overall happy with the purchase due to the price but isn’t the best queality and one of the beads came off
3.0,"These are okay.  They work good in the 30 minutes or so just after sunset ( I think they work best at the time).  They help some during night driving with only minimal glare reduction and helped during the rain at night with being able to see the road easier.  The glasses seem well made with good case and sturdy frame.  Not sure i would buy them again, due to they really barely help at night.  However, i have not used them during the day in rainy conditions."
3.0,"Edit: I gave this to a friend and it looks amazing on her. She's a tad thick, but in the good way. If you're curvy, buy this. If you're little like me, don't.<br />Original review: Way too big. Fits like a garbage bag. Absolutely dissatisfied with this purchase and shipping took 20 days. Will never buy from this company again. Can't believe I wasted my money on this."
3.0,"I have been looking for a dress this style for ages, and when I saw this one for only $10 I jumped on it. The material is quite thin, but not see through. Good for a hot beach day. But, the dress runs very small. There is a lot of stretch, but it is SKIN TIGHT. I mean, it shows every lump and bump. The material is probably too thin to wear with any shape wear underneath, too. I would order at least two sizes up. For reference, I’m 5’4, 123lbs, 32c. I bought a small, and it was way too small."
3.0,Filter will not stay put. Constantly sliding out. Had to add snaps. It won’t stay up at all. Doesn’t matter how we position it. Not a chance. I am going to add ear loops to it.
3.0,If you buy large I'd go up cause large looks like a medium to a small in my opinion.<br />I asked for a XL and I got a large. Now I'm gonna have to get another so then the size is bigger. Looks cooler on online than it does in person. I guess you'll find out 👍
3.0,Cool love the design
3.0,The color on the photo is very different from the actual one
3.0,Loved this bra. The only reason I returned it was because the sides gapped a little. That may be my body not the bra.
3.0,"I am not sure if these were irregulars or not, but two out of the 7 had holes around the waist band, they were not swen together correctly."
3.0,Cheaply made. Elastic is very uncomfortable around stomach. Would not suggest.
3.0,"I have narrow feet and wear size 9.5 shoes. These make good water shoes for crossing creeks, canoeing, wading, etc. For me, these are not comfortable enough for extended walking. They're slightly big to wear without socks. Maybe order a half size smaller (??). The fold-down heel is a nice feature: the shoe is made to slip on easily (like a slipper) with the option of having the heel folded down."
3.0,I gave them a three out of five. The earrings themselves were nice Definitely handmade which is a plus. Only issue the studs were not glued to the back of the kitty head which caused for some difficulty in wearing them. A little glue help the situation but still appreciate the effort the makers put in making these cute little earrings
3.0,the dress material is really stretchy. i can’t remember if i got a large or X large but it’s way to big. honestly i could’ve ordered a medium. i’m 5’2 170 pounds so i’m a little thick. i didn’t want it to be super tight i wanted room but not this much. it’s pretty but it’s just so large. I can pull it off but ehhh
3.0,It's nice. A bit large for my small hand.
3.0,"Have you been looking for no shows that dont scrunch up your toes, are made of cotton, but most importantly stay on your feet? These are tgose socks youve always hoped you'd find one day. But they have their problems. The fabric is terribly thin. I'm down one pair from huge holes developing in completely random places. At first i thought it was from new shoes or rubbing against a toe nail but then holes began appearing on the sides or other places where they really wouldnt normally. Im only anticipting these last one spring/summer season, but they've been great the short time they've lasted."
3.0,I loved the design however it began fading a couple weeks after wear.
3.0,"The fit is way to small, buy 1 or 2 sizes up"
3.0,The sleeves weren't long enough. I'm 5'9&#34; and the sleeves are maybe 2 to 3 inches to short. Other than that it looks perfect.
3.0,I borrowed this dress from a friend in a medium in blue and it was loose but manageable. But when I bought my own in red I ordered a small. When I tried it on it felt like something was maybe sown wrong. I felt it was much shorter and tighter but again more because of stitching. Wasn’t as happy with my own as I was with the one I borrowed. And I got compliments on the blue one all night
3.0,The bags made of good quality materials however the outer pouch zipper constantly gets stuck and I’m always fighting to get it open or closed. Very annoying and frustrating.
3.0,"Too short to be a dress although it has built in bloomers. Had to add pants, but beautiful design"
3.0,"I like the skull cap because it looks good, protects my bald head and absorbs sweat, but it's developed a small hole where the stitching is. Not a very high quality product, or the stitching isn't, at least."
3.0,"These fit my flex 2 pebble perfectly. I would give five stars but I found the band a little bit too hard. They tend to rub my skin a bit, but I think they’ll have some give in time."
3.0,Dress is not made from the strongest materials and will require some fixing after just trying it on. Package arrived in only the clear bag (no protection) that was unzipped. I am lucky there were no stains from delivery.
3.0,Ordered a M . Fits very small on the waste area . I’m not skinny at the waste so can’t zip ....
3.0,I really liked this watch band but sadly it lasted less than 6 months before one of the plastic pieces that attach to the watch snapped. I’ll be looking for a similar style with better build quality.
3.0,"This is a cute sweater but the color definitely has more yellow in it than I'd prefer. May try dying it with a super diluted lavender, to cancel out the yellow."
3.0,"As another reviewer has noted, these glasses are most definitely NOT polarized, despite being advertised as such. Also, the pair I was shipped were SILVER, not Black . . . but that's of minor concern to me. All in all, they are wider than &#34;normal&#34; sunglasses, which is what I most need, they are comfortable and of somewhat better quality than than stuff I see on the rack at various retail locations."
3.0,"I found it a bit tight around the collar. I was also really disappointed that the material is really thin and see-through. Don't wear red underwear! Seriously you can only wear beige or light grey underneath. In the pix, it looks like it has pockets. It does not."
3.0,En mi caso particular me quedaron grandes y no pude manejarlas bien.
3.0,"I've grown quite attached to these ""comfort bras,"" especially since the pandemic. They're so easy to put on and take off, and you don't have to worry if you change sizes a bit.  This one looked great, and I do like that the straps are wide enough that they don't cut into my shoulders. It's not uncomfortable. However, you should know that the band isn't very stretchy and tends to roll up, so if you're between sizes, I'd order up. I washed it the way I normally wash lingerie - in cold water in a lingerie bag, and as often happens, the cup insert got folded. Usually this isn't a problem - you just pull it out, straighten it up, and put it back in. You can't do that here because it's SEWN IN, and the access opening is in an awkward place and quite small. I eventually fixed it, but it took way longer than it should and definitely more time than I'd be willing to spend on a busy morning when I'm trying to leave for work or the school run."
3.0,It's literally an Otto cap with a patch kinda ironed on. The patch fell off after a month and my wife had to fix it. The patch is good quality but that's really the only thing I can say that about here.
3.0,not enough diming
3.0,The shirt design was awesome. The shirt was a bit large. I purchased for my four year old son and the shirt fit our 7 year old daughter instead
3.0,"This top was very shapeless. It didn’t fit me very well. It’s a little short and wide and the neck is really big. The color was exactly as pictured. And the texture was a waffle pattern which was what I was looking for. However, I returned it."
3.0,"These pants are stupid long! The material is pretty thin, they’d be nice though if I wasn’t for the extreme length."
3.0,I didn't like that fact it did not comw with the shoe lace in the front i would like the lace cause that's what i ordered thanks
3.0,the metal chain is flimsy and my daughter already broke it and has to use the black one
3.0,The quality of the shoe seems like it isn't really the name brand like a copy . But for my 16 month old she can't tell.
3.0,"I bought this dress because I needed something comfortable when I'm nursing. It runs rather big especially in the breast area. That works for me for easy access but I doubt that if you're not nursing you would want it to be so loose. Also, the fabric doesn't seem like is very strong."
3.0,"It's cheap in all ways, not a very nice looking either. Better of spending little more money on a more solid product give it a  3 star for effort."
3.0,Rovos womens half finger cycling gloves are a bit snug and needs more padding. I have small wide hands and purchased a small which are a bit too tight but not bad for a max 40 mile ride. Highly recommend measuring your hand width and go a size up if you prefer not so snug of a fit. Needs better gel padding.
3.0,The hooks are cheaply stone into place. It runs extremely small in size. It would be better if it had no hooks and only a zipper
3.0,They are short and the fabric is too thin
3.0,I loved the look and colors of the beads. Only disappointment was that it broke after wearing it only once. Maybe use threading wire instead of fishing line.
3.0,It's really pretty.  My only problem is it is nearly impossible to keep the pretty side of the bead facing up.  It's top heavy and constantly flips over. But I still love it.
3.0,"Being as this product ships from China, YOU MUST CHECK THE MEASUREMENTS! I am of average build and it is a bit snug but paired with a waist belt it is the perfect poolside getup. The fabric is wonderful and flowing. The shorts have deep pockets. Great, very CASUAL outfit."
3.0,"I like the watch, but the colors shown on the picture are not the actual ones. The blue part is light blue and the red is not that bright."
3.0,It is poorly made.  Okay for young girls who change up everyday.  Presentation is everything and this item<br />was a  -10.
3.0,Look good. But cheap material. Ok for the price though!
3.0,"Oh, this is such a beautiful dress, but I’m returning it because it’s just a little too short for my liking. I’m 5’7”, yet the skirt hit about mid-thigh, and I was looking for something I can wear to work. I’m so sad it didn’t work out."
3.0,The item was exactly what I needed at the time but poorly made.  Had to take it to a seamstress and found that it bulged in the back.
3.0,The hat is smaller than expected but of good quality.
3.0,"Love color, feel,  but 2 sizes too big.  Label says one size; thought I ordered large.  Should have gone for small."
3.0,I really like the t-shirt. Okay quality. I just wish it wasn't so boxy. It fits more like a man's t-shirt.
3.0,"Very comfortable.<br />Bottoms run small, top runs large"
3.0,"This is my second ratchet belt.  The other was almost perfect, but overall, while this belt is quite nice, the buckle leaves a lot to be desired.  I bought the mahogany with the gold buckle.  Although the best is a ""sandwich"" of very thin leather with some kind of plastic in the middle, it is flexible, comfortable, and the size markings on the back make it very easy to cut to the proper length (at least two inches larger than your waist size).  My problem with the buckle is that, while it looks great, it is hard to adjust as the belt and ratchet mechanism are hard to snug together.  It's also sometimes difficult to unlatch and move up or down a spot or two without simply coming completely undone.  This belt would be ideal for those minor ""after meal"" adjustments if it weren't for this difficulty.  I have a feeling the buckle is going to break one of these days and I'll have to buy another."
3.0,It was tight around the midsection and it looks loose in the picture. I sent this back. It didn't look right.
3.0,Too heavy but got lots of compliments
3.0,Gems fell out within a couple of weeks
3.0,"The colors are exactly like posted in the picture, but the size is HUGE!!  I get the one size, but if you are under 5'9 and under 140lbs you will drown in this.  There is a crazy amount of extra fabric, but on the plus side it shipped right away and received within 4 days of ordering."
3.0,"I ordered this dress as a bridesmaid dress for a wedding. It is not a Prime item, but still came a couple of weeks earlier than it was due.<br /><br />I ordered one size up, and it was still too small.<br /><br />The fabric was stretchy, but it is not flattering for fuller figured ladies unless you are wearing some serious shapewear underneath. The fabric would also be VERY hot, so perhaps only for indoor events or winter/early spring.<br /><br />It is a cute dress; I'm sad I couldn't make it work for me.<br /><br />The company was very good about making things right for me, which is very much appreciated."
3.0,"I really like how it looks on, how it drapes...but, it is good for one wear - then it started pilling where my chair rubbed the back of the jacket.  I like the weight, the shape, the style, but the material isn't going to last.  Good for one season, maybe."
3.0,Good for clubfoot children in casts and boots and bar. The only drawback is the strings on the inside of the design ones.
3.0,"Let's be honest, the real reason why most of us buy this item is because of it's unique design and also mainly for that blue/purple face. The image on the website shows a bright color but in reality it hardly shows. Maybe it will pop out in the dark? Haven't tried it as yet but in the ligh it's dull."
3.0,Very comfy but has a weird smell that does not come out no matter how many times i wash with downy
3.0,Material is extremely soft and it’s squat proof but it’s not flattering. Doesn’t hug the curves right. It’s a pass for me
3.0,"Leggings are soft but run large and long. Also not very flattering. I’m 5’6 and around 155lbs, carry most of my weight in my butt/thighs and have a smaller waist. Leg compression around the thighs is basically non existent and the waist band reaches way too high, basically to my bra. Will most likely try to return. Shame too because they look like they’d be really cute and I love the color."
3.0,"This necklace is very pretty and was delivered quickly.  I am however, a little upset that the ""moonstone"" is a piece of irradecent plastic."
3.0,"The sun glasses are nice and comfortable, likewise are smaller than they appear in the photo... it’s a little disappointed 😔"
3.0,The pendants are nice. Cute his and hers set. Both chains broke almost immediately so plan on having to get other chains when purchasing this.
3.0,"The material feels high quality and the dress is heavy. I did not expect the back to be a lace-up corset, but that’s fine. I am 5’8, 195lbs and ordered my normal size 12. Since it was a corset back it technically “fit” but took a lot of cinching to get the corset panel fully hidden. A size 14 would have been better. I had to adjust the shoulder straps to their full length, and even then it felt just a touch high on my 38C chest. This created quite a bit of chubbiness at my armpits that I was not particularly fond of. Perhaps the most disappointing part of this dress for me was that the slit is NOT visible when wearing, because the dress panels cross over each other in the front entirely from left to right. For comfort sake the slit is there, but I was wanting a sexy visible slit so the stock photo is quite misleading. The pocket feature is cool! I returned and am continuing my search."
3.0,"I purchased these to wear as high waisted vintage/pinup style undergarments, and they fit the bill, style-wise. Unfortunately my package came one pair short, it was missing the black pair. :( I ordered per the measurements, and they are definitely tight. These won’t ever hit the dryer, hopefully they stretch a just a tad with some wear. I love them but wish I had gotten as many as were advertised! As far as being cute pin-up style underwear, paired with a lacy bra, these hit the mark!"
3.0,The product is cute and just what I wanted but I ordered it partly because of the resizing option.  I saw someone else said the same thing but I never got anything in the package other than the pin.
3.0,I thought this product was so cute and fashionable on the other reviewers pictures. When I received the order I wasnt a fan of the polyester sleeves.
3.0,"Loved it upon arrival, but the fabric pilled quickly"
3.0,Pros: very cute dress; looked well made; a great deal.<br />Cons: I'm 5'1 and it was a little too short to be appropriate for a 34 yr old at a office holiday party (probably 2-3 inches above my knee) .<br /><br />I would size up when ordering.  I wear a med/large in most things and the XL fit in this dress... and expect it to be short.  The color on the website is the same as what was delivered.  It is a great bargain if you are younger or don't mind it being short.
3.0,"Fit was somewhat large. It's made of broad cloth which is an inexpensive material. It has no stretch to it, however the painted on detailing is fabulous. A great addition to any wardrobe. Airy and light weight. I received this item at a special discount so that I may share my opinion with you."
3.0,Would have liked it a little bit larger.
3.0,Unfortunately ☹️ product was broken on delivery.
3.0,"Color was super cute but too small. I’m usually between a size 2-4, but lately a 4 after having a baby and body is a little more wider I feel."
3.0,"Disappointed in the grey metallic dress. I had previously ordered the purple dress and love it. Good, flattering fit, but this fabric is much sheerer than the purple dress and shows off too much skin for my liking. Will probably keep and have to wear with a slip."
3.0,Beautiful but runs very small so need to order at-least 1 if not 2 sizes up especially if you’re curvy.
3.0,"These are adorable but not quite as comfy as most of the orthaheels. The plastic toe post is slighty uncomfortable due to it being plastic, and the straps make my foot sweat underneath. For this reason I could not give them 5 stars. The footbed is very comfortable."
3.0,I thought I would like this watch more than I do. I can't find the just woman's style of this now online. BUT I did receive this watch for women.  And have to say was shock by it's presentation.  It came in a box that was all messed up and the labels with product number etc. to identify the item was was not there.  Inside box was an instruction  manual for a mesh watch not the leather watch I ordered lol!  SO no instructions to my leather watch was enclosed.  The date is tiny can't read it. The box and insides looked like it has been chewed on!!  I did like the wrist band having a super small wrist the watch fits perfectly.  The dial is bigger than stated. i wanted tiny small dial as it stated it was. Sorry I don't normally write bad reviews. I hope this watch will holds up.  I set the time when I got it and hope it will last a while.  Amazon depends on our reviews to know what kind of business they are dealing with hence I am doing this review. And since I just got it I have no idea how it will work out or how long it will last.
3.0,I've worn the same Speidel Twist-O-Flex band for over 20 years and when it broke I had to have another.  The new band is OK but does not compare in quality to the old one I had.  I'm sure the new band won't last 20 years.
3.0,Great product except for the logo coming off... Makes me question the quality of manufacturing
3.0,"Beach suit, not swimming suit."
3.0,The bikini is very short. I would think it should come up higher
3.0,"After washing the socks, the fabric falls apart, and gets fuzz on the socks that are difficult to remove."
3.0,"Color (green) is true, fabric is soft but a tad thin.  Could clearly see my black bra underneath.  Kinda gives a boxy look if you have no curves like me!  Decent for the price, have gotten my money's worth."
3.0,Very soft bu too tight on ears
3.0,"It's ok, for the price. The colors aren't what are advertised..close but they're different. The fabric is a bit stiff compared to other shift dresses I've purchased on amazon. Maybe after I wash it it will soften a bit."
3.0,They bring 10 hair ties of the same color. So really you only get 5 different colors.
3.0,"The dress came as describe, the material is a bit thin. The material is tight on the body so its not too forgiving."
3.0,"The rear support needs to be modified because although my dog is able to go #2, it catches on the back because of how it juts out. I am going to try sewing the back to adjust for it. Overall, it's not a bad product, just not necessarily suited for all dogs."
3.0,"Not very comfortable, but get the job done."
3.0,"This robe is ok but not like I was hoping it would be. It fits a man (up to large) better. Which is good but it does say fits all, and on my lady clients it's huge. This material is good and washes good, but the size is not so good. I would by again but only for LARGER size clients."
3.0,It's made of very thin fabric and way too small for my 5 yr old that it fits on my 3 year old..cute outfit though
3.0,"Very cute design. My 3 year old loved the 3D pictures on the strap. My only complaint is that the numbers on the bottom half of the dial are upside down. The 6 looks just like a 9, which is very confusing for a little child trying to associate numbers with time. Returning it for this reason."
3.0,"This winder does as it described where it wound my automatic watches and it is quiet. The only problem is that the nice looking case is scratched up because my watches on ""periodic"" rotations seems to drop down enough where my watch dials scratched the case!!  At first, I thought this was damage I did not notice when I received the item. However, today, I decided to watch it and within a few minutes, my Omega Seamaster watch crown started rubbing against the case.<br /><br />The only way I could stop this was to arrange my watches so that the crowns are facing inside instead of outside. This is the reason I am putting 3 stars because I am not happy that the case is scratched up and that my watches were grinding against the case periodically without my knowledge.<br /><br />As you can see in the picture where I show both spinners, you can see that I now have to face the crowns of all my watches inside. Otherwise, if the crowns are facing outside, they will periodically get stuck on the clear window, which you can see the horizontal scratches on the other two images where it will forever bother me that the case is now scratched up. :("
3.0,"Originally, I bought it as a gift for my friend. When I received it, I found that the work was relatively rough and the cover was not very comfortable. I gave up as a gift. A little disappointed."
3.0,"I does look cheap. But, you get what you pay for. At least it was the right product."
3.0,Like the product and the pack came nicely but after applying slight pull to the closed cables all of them slipped from one side  or another someone mentioned it may be an issue with their crimping either way I applied some gorrila glue to the insides of the metal ends that came loose and reattached them wiped away excess and let them sit for a day they are holding up fine but I would advise you test your cables before using them to avoid having keys lost or spilled somewhere as it could create issues
3.0,"These are nicely made with good quality.  The sizing is accurate, I normally wear a Medium and these Medium fit fine.  My primary issue which dropped these to a 3 star was that they don't breathe and I feel hotter than the normal cotton briefs that I wear.  I did not experience this with other Polyester based wicking briefs. (Hanes FreshIQ X-Temp and FX AeroCool)"
3.0,Socks are thin like standard dress socks
3.0,like just a little short
3.0,"I love the look of this dress, its comfortable and very flattering. I had worn the dress once, washed it and hung it up to dry and when I went to wear it again it had shrunk a reasonable amount, it went from being around my kneecap to middle thigh. I suggest sizing up if you plan to ever wash this dress."
3.0,"It was TINY!!! I have a small head and it still didn’t fit, this is for toddlers not adults. You can’t even change the size when you buy it!!"
3.0,Warm hat. Not the best quality. The inner warm layer was only lightly stitched and was easy unstitched with wear and tear.
3.0,I ordered a midi ... comes below the knee
3.0,"This purse is just okay. Definitely waterproof and sturdy but every time I open up the main compartment, it will unzip all the way, allowing my stuff to fall out. So it kind of defeats the purpose of the anti-theft functionality. Also, the straps continuously become loose. Wouldn't buy again."
3.0,"So the dress is really a 5 except I didn’t even get out of my house before the strap broke. Love the look, fit and everything about it. Quality not so much. Fabric is even ok. Just needs to be sewn better."
3.0,because the one broke but the other one was gust fine but they here way to big so that is what I that
3.0,Great product but I bought this for the purple and teal colors but those were not in the package. Some arrived broken.
3.0,Really wanted to like these but they broke so quickly was a waste of money.
3.0,"Everything is excellent, the only thing they to small"
3.0,It is ok dose not hold its shape to well as it was shipped flat.
3.0,The sweatshirt fits great but came with a rainbow hood string. The picture shows a wide white string.
3.0,The bracelet is beautiful. It was bought for a 7yr old and  4 yr old It's just so big. Hopefully they can wear it as adults.
3.0,"This dress is really nice.  The lace is a good quality and it fits as expected.  I do have to return it just because it is not a flattering fit on me.  I knew that was a possibility in advance, but gave it a shot."
3.0,Too small to really fit properly in a mask.<br />I was disappointed to see they are from China
3.0,Nice but run very small. I am in the process of losing some weight so I won’t be returning it. I am 5” 158lb 38C got a Medium. I recommend to size up...
3.0,I got this as a gift. Wasn't quite like pictured but pretty close. Much better  then other super cheap jewelry  as far as looking something  like the picture.  Haven't worn but I'm sure it will turn skin green if too wet. But I dont plan on wearing  in the shower or pool.
3.0,"The item is not worth the buy. The plastic shield visor was defective. It was bent, creased, and bubbled/puckered up. The plastic shield distance to the face is too close. Not enough room to put glasses on. It also fogs up. The middle snap button was missing. The hat itself was too small/tight. The measurement stated is not accurate. Why did I give this a 3 Star instead of just 1?.....only because the Seller/Vendor was easy to deal with. They responded immediately, they kept me informed when the shipment was delayed and the stock was back-ordered. They refunded my account right away."
3.0,cute but they don't glow in the dark
3.0,I love batman!!!! This ring is great but the only thing is it leaves my finger green :( so make sure you bring wipes to clean your finger
3.0,Does the job but the material and the cut could be improved.
3.0,"Bought for my teenage daughter for school choir ‘uniform’. She is tall and thin. To fit in the waist, they were baggy everywhere else. Made for more curvy body types. Returning."
3.0,Shrank a lot after washing
3.0,Quality isn't the best but kind of fine. Nothing special being a dkny
3.0,It was a little long and kind of messy looking for my taste.  I like that it is a tunic but needs to be stream lined a bit so it is not so bulky at the bottom.
3.0,"I think the main issue I have with this necklace is that the color of the flower isn't what's shown in the picture. The picture looks like a cream color to me, but the actual necklace is a dark yellow. It doesn't go with as many outfits. Also notice that it is kinda small, a little bigger than a quarter maybe. But other than that, it seems to have been made well and I haven't had problems."
3.0,Definitely not “lavender”. It is more blue then any kind of purple.
3.0,The pin itself is gorgeous.  It is sturdy and will last. The pin clasp bent then snapped off when I tried to pin it. But I loved it so much I super glued a better clasp. Win win
3.0,"Very wide and material not that great, of course for the price that's probably to be expected.  The cuff links are super cheap looking and can't be worn."
3.0,"i took two one for me and one for my friend.<br />we went skiing  in Utah and the weather there was 2 C. it's comfortable but it doesn't make a big difference.<br />However, the price was good comparing with others and that why i took it.<br />if you are a skiing person look for something better. But if you will use it for few times take it because of the price."
3.0,"There were strings sticking out in places and it was a bit short. Other than that, the fabric feels nice and it's loose enough."
3.0,"Unfortunately, although I bought one size up, this was tight and with the thin white material, just not flattering on me at all. Love the moon design."
3.0,"Not a good choice for scuba masks.  I have bought two sets of these.  The first one worked for nearly a year before one was lost.  I bought a second pair to replace the lost one.  Neither of the new pair would stay in place.  If the second set performed as well as the first set, I would have been completely satisfied."
3.0,"It was cute, but the zipper broke right away"
3.0,I use it for yoga. The color is bleeding in the white stipes.
3.0,"I like these a lot. Small problem is that one of them developed a hole pretty fast, so a minor snag can lead to the thin fabric easily turning it into a hole. I re-ordered the color that got the hole, and the wrong color was sent. I do like the color I received though. Maybe I'll try ordering my color again or will ask the seller about the original teal I bought.<br />Some colors may be a tad see through. Some that ship say &#34;relaxed fit&#34; so they aren't skin tight, but hug an hourglass figure nicely."
3.0,these are pretty cute but they sorta look like the uppers were sewn on the opposite soles... Like the bottom of the left shoe had the top of the right (idk if that makes sense) but it almost looks as though she has her shoes on the wrong feet. Good enough for pictures or whatever but not so much otherwise.
3.0,The top zipper does not allow you to open up wide enough. Disappointed
3.0,Not actually white; it’s cream or off white
3.0,"It has some silver sparkle to it that you don't notice in the pictures, Definitely runs small. I am a 5 generally but i needed an 8/10. Great value!"
3.0,"The  night gown is nice , the only thing was is that I had ordered a lg. & I was sent a med.  which  is to small for me. other than that it is a very nice gown.  Instead of sending it back I decided to just put it in with  my garage sale items.  I clicked on the boxes for a large  how I manage to get a medium size who knows.  I wished o was a medium size but I'm not.  But that's life."
3.0,"lovely, but would have prefer black"
3.0,"These were a gift and that person really likes them. I, however, was unimpressed with the look of the earrings in person. They were rather blah looking compared to the pictures online. I would not purchase these again."
3.0,Leg pain is dtminished
3.0,Is not exactly what I expected made very cheap. also will not stay in place the hook always moves around neck
3.0,"There are really nice. The straps are very loose howevee, even at the last buckle hole, but if you add a few extra holes, you should be great. The only issue that I have is that where the straps and the sole meet, there are no closing stitches. You can see the inside cushion of the shoe. If you happen to get caught in the rain, the inside of the shoe will get wet and I imagine ruin the shoe."
3.0,"Material is good,I use under a shirt in winter."
3.0,After a few weeks they kept falling out. Ultimately I ordered the screw backs of this brand. I love the brand but the Snuggie hoops are definitely for everyday they are tight at the start and then loosen up.
3.0,Material is ok. I ordered a large and it fits tighter than I expected.
3.0,"Fit perfect however the hem was uneven and for the price it’s not worth it to get fixed I will return. It really is a cute dress. Bottom is a bit see through so wear nude bottoms.  Medium fit great though. I am 5’2, 112, 32Dd."
3.0,The tie dye stripe on the sweatshirt is an iron on. It is not really tie dyed. The stitching in front of the sweatshirt was also off centered. Not what I expected. Do not know how well the iron on tie dye stripe will stay on after washing. I returned mine.
3.0,Printing should have been in white not black. Hard to read by others. Won't order again 😭
3.0,"I mostly liked this shirt, but it was quite voluminous, and because of that I returned it.  I could've worn it as a maternity shirt and no one would've known it wasn't.  The color matched the pic online, and the top of the shirt fit me fine (I normally buy mediums, and this fit as expected) but I could've fit a beach ball in the loose part of the shirt.  Who wants to look pregnant when you're not??"
3.0,I use it to tell time with. The dials on the stop watch are so small I can't see them without a magnifying glass. So that part of the watch is useless.
3.0,The picture makes it look like this is a larger size choker but its not. Its thin but not ugly
3.0,Love the material.  Love the overall tank top especially the fringes.  Size is completely off.  I typically wear extra large with toom to spare.  I ordered a 2x and it is tight.
3.0,"GREAT VEST!! 5 stars for it.<br /> I gave 3 stars because you have to make sure you look at the sizing chart on EACH ITEM before you buy.  The site doesn't let you know that this is a China based retailer selling items for a number of ""companies"" all of which have different ideas of sizing and quality.  if you are careful, you will probably get a good product. Also, takes really long to ship"
3.0,The bones on either side are very uncomfortable.  Other than that I like them..wish  there was a way to remove them.
3.0,Fits well and good for the price.. hole in the right pocket .
3.0,"These are pretty good, but the real sheepskin ones are better."
3.0,"Ring is beautiful I love it,but have not had it a year and a bracket fell off and I lost a stone. So disappointed, afraid the stone next to it may fall out too."
3.0,"Since I also ordered and received plastic collar extenders, I really don't need these.<br />Sice it comes in a box, it would make a nice gift,  I may just do that."
3.0,"I ordered a medium. I wear medium everything. These came and said US: M, Europe: L. They should just say US: L, Europe: L. I even have a different 3 pack of Neleus tank tops I've ordered that are a thicker material and actually fit right and you can see are noticeably smaller when compared in person."
3.0,Strap almost immediately broke but we were able to sew it back together.
3.0,"I thought this would be fun for morning tai chi. Linen is a little crispier than cotton, as expected, but also seems to have less give. I wonder if someone puts lycra together with linen. Maybe it would work better for me with gusseted armpits."
3.0,"These earrings were ok.  A little too big for what I was looking.  I requested a return and was approved.  I sent them off, in their original packaging with label from Amazon but return has not been processed."
3.0,"Looks good but too small for my calves. I think I can still use it, though. It just won't come up as high."
3.0,"I was expecting this item since February the 14th to use as a carry bag for a mini iPad. Though it was worth the time waiting, (it is a nice bag), the item was send by surface mail and the shipping method for a light-weight package like this, it was ridiculous. One thing got me disappointed: the 2 colours choice was between &#34;olive green&#34; and &#34;coffee&#34;. And, what got me to choose the &#34;coffee&#34; one was, the &#34;genuine cowhide straps&#34; while the olive advertised as &#34;faux leather&#34; straps...&#34; At last, it arrived and the coffee-colour bag was fake leather also!"
3.0,"The blue color is way different, looks kind of cheap."
3.0,"These pants would be exactly what I wanted except they are made for a tiny person. They are warm and stretchy and well made. I normally wear a small/medium but the only review on the site said to order the next larger size because they run small. I wish I had ordered an XL instead of a large because they are skin tight, short (2 inches above my ankles and short in the crotch (like a petite size small in the US). If they didn't have to go all the way back to Asia to be returned, I would ship them back right away. As it stands now, I think I'm stuck with them."
3.0,"I usually wear a medium but when the first skirt I ordered came I could hardly fit it around one leg. I ordered an XL and it is a little loose but I don't feel like returning and re-ordering just a large. I would suggest going a size up. Also, the skirt is see through so you either have to buy an underskirt for it or wear skin color undies."
3.0,"I ordered a medium and wear a 36C. It fits well and is comfortable. I like the wide straps and long line length. The removable padding is one piece. If it stayed in place it would be fine, but it moves around and bunches up while you are wearing it. Padding is thin, which I like. I don’t like to remove the padding in things like this because it makes me feel…exposed, lol. But I may have to."
3.0,These seem nice. They have good sturdy clasps that hold on to pants well. The only issue I have is that after a few wears the back strap is stetched out and warped a little. Still usable but proof it probably wont last a long time.
3.0,"This is quite possibly the most misleading thing I have ever bought on Amazon, and I've made some questionable purchases.  THERE IS NO DOLL!! Every picture shows a doll but it is not included! Do not buy this thinking you're getting a doll too. Even the description sounds like you're getting a doll, but you're not!"
3.0,Just for give away....no used to returned it
3.0,"The dress fit is good .however the dress looks matronly on  me.there,needs to be,a better design on the,collar.it hangs on me.this is a bigger woman style or a woman with full bust and good hips.I will consider other styles from Miusol.<br />Fabric is,a bit heavy for spring/ summer and too cool for winter."
3.0,"so, I bought these boots for my Chun Li costume that I am wearing for Halloween, and they're ok. They are cute, but do feel cheap (expected for the price). I ordered these boots twice, the first time i got an 8.5, which fit extremely big. My foot was sliding forward, I decided to return them and buy a half size smaller, so I went with the 8. They arrived yesterday and I tried them on, now they're too tight. I'm hoping that after I break them in they'll feel better."
3.0,Product straight out of the bag has cuffs at the end of the sleeves with missing stitching. The product is soft and stretches to fit a person of my size. It is flawed with stitching issues throughout the product.
3.0,"I wanted to love these leggings. They are thick, comfortable to wear, love the pockets but:<br /><br />A) they have no real compression. I went for a light jog in these and I felt like I was pulling them up all the time. These are definitely better for yoga or lifting weights.<br /><br />B) These leggings have an AWFUL wear life. Within days of getting, the seam was unraveling down the side and down the bum. The seam at the pockets is wearing off and unraveling. Sure these leggings are affordable but this is completely unacceptable. I thought it was just an issue with these particular leggings, but I have another pair by 90 Degree which is also falling apart. I would not buy these again solely because I know that they are not long lasting or made of quality."
3.0,"The idea is good but the velcro is on the wrong side, so you have to tuck it underneath and it's too uncomfortable to wear and shows under your clothes"
3.0,"The quality is not very good. Stitches and threads come out. Does not fit right, not slimming. Overall I am not very happy, but will keep it as a spare."
3.0,it's a Good product my wife love's it. it took a while to received it. very nice item.
3.0,"This top is very trendy and pretty, the fabric is nicer than I expected. However, the sewing job is weak, after only wearing it once and washing it, I have a hole in each sholder as the sowing there became loose and opened a hole, also I think this top runs rather small, not one size at all. Although the fabric is quite stretchy, the area under the arms does not give much."
3.0,"Love this item, however, the bracelet is very short. I had to have a few links added for length."
3.0,"I got these glasses to use for night driving and driving in the rain, as the yellow tint is suppose to help with glare. Didn't seem to help for me, but gave them to my mom and she loves them. Inexpensive, so I can't complain."
3.0,they don't glow as long or as bright as I thought they would.
3.0,"First of all the chain is Extremely lightweight ! But the gold color is vibrant  enough and suits the emerald like charm. The charm itself is passable in terms of craftsmanship and the stone is cut do it does have a sparkle in the light. I feel $5 is the price it should be rather than what I paid😞.<br />I felt disappointed, but will make it work with a  satin slip dress with a v cut neckline."
3.0,"Like the dress,  but is poorly stitched."
3.0,Not all the same size and while washing even in delicate bag the seams pull out and make unusable. But designs are fun w/ great colors. Too bad only a few actually fit and the seams around the elastic ripped out.
3.0,"I bought this for my mom. She's smaller on top and bigger though the hips and thighs. I was concerned about the arms in this shirt so I ordered a size larger and I'm glad I did. There was plenty of flowy material to suffenciently cover her stomach, butt, and tops of thighs but the arms just fit. There is not much give at all so if you have heavier arms order up a size otherwise your normal size should be fine and still flowy tunic style. She liked it and it was nice to see my 60 year old mother show a little skin."
3.0,"Only slightly flattering.  If your busty,  it mushes your boobs flat.  Not how got intended your boobs to look."
3.0,"Yes it's pretty,but I order dark fusia and it's more pink ish."
3.0,"The top fits great, the bottom is soooooooooo long"
3.0,"It was a beautiful cap... then I wore it one day. Just one day. And a hole was put into it..not sure if I stressed it by placing it on my head, but it just looked like the thread wasn't properly needled."
3.0,"Looks better if you add a belt. Dress is loose and just hangs. Not a good pick for a curvy girl like me, but a thick black belt at the waist did the trick. Colors are true to picture"
3.0,I like the fact that it's sterling silver and I can take a shower and it didn't  turn so that means it's real but it's very very small probably for a kid I would say.
3.0,They're beautiful ankle boots but they were too tight and I always purchase the same size shoe
3.0,I did like the shape of the dress. It was a bit lose.
3.0,I like this earring. Just not for tragus
3.0,They don’t closed that well it look good but when you want to adjust for your wrist is not that great .
3.0,The shoes is better than expected. Good quality shoes.but was to small amd also the inside sole was all bent when took out of package.i contacted them twice and still hear no response!i would love to return and get a size bigger
3.0,"The fit was nice, but they came with a hole in the right pocket. On day one of wearing the shorts, my change fell right outta my pocket. I took a look at the hole; in the stitching process they didn’t go over about half inch of the edge."
3.0,"Lousy zipper, otherwise a good buy"
3.0,A little small.  Had to stretch.  The size is nowhere on the boot. Wondered if  they sent  a smaller size but couldn't find size of boot.  Love the style and look.  Stretched and now fine.
3.0,The harness looks and is built very well.<br /><br />But I feel very uncomfortable wearing it with 2 cameras. I had a similar harness from a different company and that was amazing in comfort but not well built so I bought this.<br /><br />I wear 2 camera bodies one with a 24-70mm lens and another with 70-200mm lens. The heavier camera just pulls the harness to one side and extremely infortable position. I am not able to wear it with 2 cameras. Mostly going to return it.
3.0,Can see hot glue marks and some of the flowers came off. No big deal just stuck them back on. Definitely overpriced
3.0,I like it but large runs to big. It's like a xxl
3.0,The packing bags are very pretty and seem to be good quality. My disappointment is that they are no way worth the cost due to their small size. The largest one is a decent size but the two smaller ones are so small that they are useless.
3.0,"About what I expected, pretty cheaply made. The straps come off if you try and walk with them. I just reattached them in a different way for my Luffy Cosplay."
3.0,It’s too bad as the idea was cute. I weigh 120 and got the small. Sorry couldn’t change the weigh bar
3.0,I really like this chain. The stainless steel pendant is nice and shiny but the only thing is that the tribal flame design is actually a seperate peice attacthed to the pendant so it comes in and out of the space which i dont particularly like. It came in a nice silk blue baggie with a small carboard jwellery box which was nice.All in all its an alright pendant and would make a perfect giift. Just didnt like the tribal flames seperarion.
3.0,The belt seems to be good quality but I’m not happy with the coloring. I got the brown and it’s more orange than anything.
3.0,"I've a small frame, but I read the reviews and ordered a large. It's still a pretty tight fit! I'm not skinny, but I'm not very big either, and a small in any random brand usually fits fine, a medium occasionally if I'm shopping in Junior sizes. Also, the pattern on this is actually painted on cotton. That's ok for a novelty dress but you might not like it if  you want a nicer outfit. Still, it's fun and I'll get some use out of it this October."
3.0,I like the cross but the beads move around and they get lopsided and it's not appealing.
3.0,Love the dress but needed a little bit bigger size I ordered a m next time large. Very cute dress
3.0,"I have small breasts and don't have rounded hips. I'm fully aware of that and usually clothes still fit. For some reason, if you don't have a large enough chest, the V notch droops forward. And if your hips aren't round and wide, there's extra fabric that just sits awkwardly creating a lump on your side. If you have ample cleavage and an hourglass figure, I'm sure this would look stunning. Sadly, this dress just isn't for me."
3.0,Cheap material...won't buy again
3.0,Cute dress.  Wish I would have ordered up a size.  Not horribly tight but slightly uncomfortable.
3.0,"Love the design in general, in the photos the pattern is cute, the scarf itself is soft and warm and a great length but upon examining it there are the big letters Cucci repeated across the scarf. It's a bit awkward since I mean it almost seems like a faux famous designer brand that I didn't intend to buy. I only wanted the cute pattern with great color blending for fall."
3.0,The shoe fits fine and is comfortable but the rubber blocks chi and is not suitable for Tai chi.
3.0,Too tight in the bust and sleeves. I ordered a size larger because I read the reviews and it's still too tight.
3.0,I wonder if you're going to sell the official albun global and South African soccer barjitas panini panini and if if it will sell empesarian day
3.0,"I purchased these shoes to put on the top of a cake.  They worked well for that, but were not of a quality for actual wearing."
3.0,Works well except sound amplification is not great
3.0,The dress looks and feels comfortable.<br />But it was rather a bit big and seemed to make me look squarely<br />I would have liked it if I was a bit thinner to look good in it
3.0,Washed after opening package: cloth feels rough and a number of the handkerchiefs frayed.  Hoping that they soften with usage and washing.<br />  Will update if improvement.
3.0,"I was going to return it but decided its cheapers if I kept it, since I have to pay for shipping to return it."
3.0,Fit is fine but feels a lot cheaper than one would think.<br />Don't buy unless you plan on using it as an over jacket to a hoodie
3.0,I love the apron so i went and bought a longer ribbon so i can tie it in the front.  Love it.
3.0,"It’s super comfy, but the cut is slightly off from what’s shown. The pocket areas are a bit clumpy and the shoulder straps seem closer in like for a T-back bra, vs a regular one. Slightly thin material, so watch your undergarment color. Wasn’t pleasant to see a giant seam down the back."
3.0,"The product itself is ok. However it is somewhat large and my daughter hated having this over her eyes. While she likes to have a light blanket over her eyes, she screams bloody murder with this."
3.0,"The boots arrived on time, but I wasn't happy with the way they fit.  They were heavier than I prefer and bigger than I wanted.<br /><br />I wound up donating the boots to a local church who was collecting for the victims of hurricane Sandy, so hopefully they found someone who could use them better than I.<br /><br />Quality-wise they appeared to be well made, so I had no problem with that.  But I learned that, for me at least, I need to try boots on in person to make sure they feel right to me."
3.0,sent wrong size but I sent them to her anyway  if they work I will order more in white but next time the right size would work out better .
3.0,The only color I like is the Blue (which is on the purple side).
3.0,It's ok but I don't like the glitering gold & silver threads that sown into the socks.  I didn't see it in the picture otherwise I wouldn't order them.  the threads gets on my clothes.
3.0,The color that came was all dark gray to black. Would look ok with a matching outfit.  Had a noticeable scratch (bottom right in picture).
3.0,"I got this to match a pair of orange and yellow leggings. You'd expect the overall color tone of this hat to be warm, but the yellow is weirdly a little bit cool-toned and greenish. I'll still wear it though."
3.0,Free Size is 2 sizes smaller than your size. I thought because it was polyester with spandex it would be a little more stretchy. I was still able to pull it on and pop a few threads and still wore it wore it. It was cute on but extra tight. I am a size 14/15
3.0,One reason I bought these was to keep my feet warm. But they don't have much cushion  and my feet still get cold after being outside for 10-15 minutes. I also noticed the stitching holding the sole to the interior side has broken from wearing them for less than one week.<br />Also I wear a 11 size and had to order a 13 size to make up for the fur lining and allow 1/2 inch in front of the large toe<br /> I plan on returning them because of the broken stitching previously mentioned
3.0,"The clasp broke pretty quickly, but other than that it looks awesome."
3.0,"These are very cute. One was a little tighter than the other, but I hardly noticed as the day went on."
3.0,"Arrived with watchband disconnected on one side. Because I had a special tool, I was able to reconnect. Looks and works fine."
3.0,"SUPER THIN. Like you see everything, thin. But I kept it because I can wear it at the pool. It worked for the 104 degree weather in LV. Very soft material. I'd buy it again in a dark color."
3.0,Big shirt.  Collar is very wide too.  Would look elsewhere for a trendy banded collar.
3.0,The neckline is too wide and waistline is too high
3.0,"These are basically good 'ankle socks' rather than 'no show' socks. If you are wearing boat/deck shoes then they are fully visible which is a shame. They have that gel grip style strip to stop them slipping off the heel. If you need a true pair of no show socks then look elsewhere, they are also quite thick for a no show, which makes them very comfortable and durable for sports in your running or sports type shoe, but perhaps not great for warmer weather casual wear."
3.0,Gear fit fell out of the band a number of times at first. Seems to work better after a couple weeks of wearing it.
3.0,"Definitely size up, they will not sit the right way on you if you don't"
3.0,"I am 5'8"" and 180 lbs.<br />With my 3-inch heels I'm 5'11"", and the dress was still about 3 inches too long. I bought a 16 and it was a bit big in the bust and the sleeves were tight. The dress was not cheap material. Unfortunately the lace was not exactly centered on the front or back.<br />I don't recommend this dress. I returned it."
3.0,Tag says it is rayon but doesn't take dye so I believe that it is mislabeled.  Nice quality sturdy knit and construction but not the right fabric for my use.
3.0,"The lanyard has a plastic feel to it, rather than fabric. It also has Velcro at the back (which is not described or shown in the piture) connecting the two strips, which means that if you pull too hard the Velcro will fall apart and the lanyard will fall off. It's also very long (I'm 6' and it hangs down to my belt). For 4.99 you get what you paid for, so at that price it's a decent buy. Would be great to hang somewhere for display, but I wouldn't recommend for everyday use."
3.0,"Good quality, durable. Looks nice. Made my wrist sweat, though."
3.0,I wish it had adjustable straps! Runs small in my opinion but it does stretch a bit if you want a snug fit. Stretching does distort color though!
3.0,"Right off the bat it needs to be known that this is not an officially licensed product from Square Enix (bootleg) . With that out of the way, I love and hate this thing but I knew what I was getting when I ordered it.<br /><br />What I dislike: The directions are pretty much non existent on the back of the box and I ended up looking up a how to on YouTube. There is one hole that does not line up (center piece) and because of that there is 1 screw that can't be screwed in. It's also bent in random spots. When you look at it from the front there are no straight lines that line up.<br /><br />What I liked: Even with it bent, it looks AWESOME!<br />Very cool, sleek, and compact design. This thing has some weight as well. Surprisingly heavy for what it is. Actually metal. I also appreciate the detail on the handle.<br /><br />If you're a fan of FF7 pick it up but don't have high expectations. If you're not a fan this should be a hard pass. Its not terrible but its not great either."
3.0,"It’s pretty and fits well, but the material is scratch so if I’m wearing something sleeveless under it it’s not very comfortable."
3.0,"These seem to be well made, but they are very uncomfortable to wear. I think this may be for some but definitely not for me. Color selection was pretty limited."
3.0,"This handbag is really cute and just the right size.  I would give it five stars if two things were different-<br />1) The opening is too small. When they made this, they didn’t make the sides with the ability to unsnap open or expand.  Really strange opening.<br />2) The smell.  Oh my dear Lord- this thing stinks to high heavens. It has a strong chemically smell that is stomach-turning.  A friend told me to put it in a pillowcase with a dryer sheet and throw it in the dryer, but I don’t know how that will affect the item itself.  So, for now, I still have a stinky purse."
3.0,"OH my GOD, it's made in china...and just cost $30...FK!"
3.0,It changed color.
3.0,Smaller than I had expected.
3.0,Not sure what to do these are too big in the length of the finger.<br />I am a small fingered women
3.0,I bought this for my uncle and he says that it is strong. He uses it during his work out sessions and it also gives back support.
3.0,"PrToo plain...does not stand up by itself. Will used my old one until I can't shell out for a good one.  Probably good for someone who not mind it's short""fall""...good price."
3.0,It's work just one hour in stable situation
3.0,7 inch was too small
3.0,"I received this for free to test and evaluate.<br /><br />Is it glass? It feels more like plastic. That being said, this is something that should be put on another chain, it comes with an inexpensive chain silver toned chain. The chain snapped in the first two days of wearing it.<br /><br />This is a pretty little pendant and it would be a good stocking stuffer type gift or a gift for a young lady. I wouldn't give this away as a bridal type of favor except for a very casual wedding party. This is an inexpensive item and while it doesn't look cheap, it is doesn't scream Tiffany's either.<br /><br />The fact that it seems to be plastic and not glass is a bit off putting. If I were going to purchase this, I would want a sterling chain, and real glass. The idea behind this is innovative, and it looks pretty, but it needs a bit of upgrading to make it great."
3.0,This lasted me about 3 months before falling apart which isn’t terrible considering the low price and how much I used it (which was a lot). The color was nice.
3.0,Not true to size 3x feels like 2x
3.0,I did the material and how comfortable is it but it came too large and it.akes me feel like im older  and I'm 33. Lol
3.0,"Cute dress but did not fit me well<br />- nice soft fabric (a bit thin) - I'll use as a swimsuit coverup<br />- the ties are not long enough to do a nice bow at the side<br />- the crossover is a nice style but when using the snap, the front was very gappy and not a smooth fit<br />- I found that the natural waist was too high, maybe that's why the front did not fit well"
3.0,This wallet case doesn't hold the amount of cards I'd like it to. It only holds a max of 2 cards comfortably and that's not good for me.
3.0,the backing falls off sometimes and the needle part came off on one of them. still adorable though
3.0,Nit time socks they have a heel
3.0,"This product was...ok. It comes all the way from china so it takes a long time to get to the states (Just shy of a month for me) but that's not a big deal for me. Unlike most products from China its not made of plastic but actual metal (can you believe it!) the chains are metal the necklace is metal and the ring is metal.<br /><br />The watch itself is really small, if you look in the show its about as large as Edwards palm, but this one is at least an inch smaller in diameter, also the ""etching"" Edward make on the inside cover is raised, not etched into it, which I think is a pretty weird decision to make but, its not a big deal for me, a hardcore cos-player might be upset over it. The watch works, opens and closes properly and comes with a nice long metal chain with a clip on the end. Also The crystal that covers the face of the watch isn't glass but plastic (I guess they managed to sneak some in there)<br /><br />The Necklace is also metal and come with a metal chain, for me (a 6 foot 190 lbs male) the chain that came with the necklace was just a little smaller than I would have liked, but that's easily replaceable, but just annoying because its just something extra to buy.<br /><br />The ring, it is really small (come to think of it everything to do with this product is pretty small) It would only fit on my pinky finger and even then it's pretty snug. The ring is also made of metal.<br /><br />So in summary<br />Pros: Everything is made of metal (not that cheap plastic Chinese products always seem to be made of)<br />The watch works and has a working second hand (which isn't as common as one might think)<br />Both the watch and necklace come with metal chains<br /><br />Cons: Everything seems to be just a little too small<br />The words ""Don't Forget 3 OCT. '11"" aren't etched into the watch, but raised words.<br /><br />All in all, not really a good product for the cos-players, but not a terrible one by any means"
3.0,"I bought this brand because it's one of the best in dancing supplies, but this leotard it's terrible.. on the second time my daughter wore it the threads started to come off in the back and the sleeves"
3.0,"Not so much curvy fit as advertised. Sits a little lower on the hip as well, was not looking for hip huggers. Also Length runs long, and boot cut is more of a flare leg"
3.0,"I really do enjoy the soft material, and the loose fit allows for different style options(belt or corset). But I've only worn it once and the seam of the pocket is already tearing. So I'm going to have to fix that....."
3.0,"Only sent 1 , product works great."
3.0,Cute pattern but fabric was a little too thin
3.0,"The fabric looks really cheap, not flattering."
3.0,Pictures very deceiving. Tried it on and felt very thin and cheaply made
3.0,Feels like I’m in a wet suit. Not see through. Waist a little too high for me.
3.0,"Cute, but ran big right out if the package, then stretched bigger and bigger as the day went on. It went from a medium to a shapeless blob in a matter of a few hours. It is soft and comfortable so I ended up just sleeping in it"
3.0,Fits fine until you wash it.
3.0,"it's good size wrap, nice thickness and warm.."
3.0,"I do not like big purses. I just do not carry much. This purse is adorable, but too small, even for me. The front zipper pocket will not even hold my keys. The purse is very stiff, almost hard. It will not open very wide so it is hard to get to the few things in it. I wanted to love this, but I dont. I wish that I could send it back, but I used it for 3 days."
3.0,It's cute.  I have extremely small wrists and the small size was too tight.  I'm also left handed and this thing kept getting in my way.  I had to send it back which was a shame cause I wanted to like it.  Points for it being cute and working like it was supposed to.  I had to look up a YouTube video to see how to wind it around my wrist and it does look fantastic once it's on.  I just couldn't keep it bc of the left handed thing.
3.0,"This bracelet is gorgeous, but the clasp is nearly impossible. It takes 2 peoole to get it off. They really need to improve the design of it."
3.0,Really cute a bit to high and heavy
3.0,"These are very pretty. Color matches the photo. I'm giving them three star review because the metal butterfly backs that come with the earrings are too tight and I bent the post trying to fit it on the earring. Fortunately they also come with two rubber stoppers. So I am using the rubber backs and not going to try again with the metal ones. That being said, they arrived on time and there is a cute pouch to put the earrings in. They would make a nice gift, but not for anybody who doesn't know their own strength. These require a delicate touch."
3.0,"Color was way off and it had too much padding in the shoulders. made me look high string and ready to jump on someone, had to cut it out but its price is good."
3.0,It's a little cheap looking but still does the job.
3.0,Not printed as pictured. Checkered stars are pink and black instead of red and background blue.
3.0,"I will update this review to say samsonite did replace my bag and the second was much better. The bag is actually super light and great, but the zippers are fragile.<br /><br />the first time I used this bag, the zipper fob cracked in half, so I could not use a lock. The second time the zipper broke off. I loved that this bag was so light weight, but the quality is the worst I have ever seen, and after a few trips, looks like I will be buying a tumi. Should have saved my money and bought the better bag to begin with..."
3.0,I got this for my teenage daughter who wanted it. It's nice. I wouldn't call it elegant -- it's slightly heavy -- but it's cute. She likes it.
3.0,"worked well enough for the medium-cut back on my dress, but anything lower would have been a problem. Not noticeably uncomfortable for me."
3.0,"Not a bad watch for the price. It was easy to adjust, came with directions and everything. Wish the band was a little better quality, but overall I am happy with it as a work watch."
3.0,"loved the blouse but its way too small.  I should have gotten an extra large.  Fits too snug.  But if it were in an extra large, i am sure I would have loved it.  Gave it away"
3.0,The ear socks are great.  Seems like whatever protective coating the lenses has is quite thin as they scratch very easily.  Careful with what product you use to clean then.  I would recommend running them under water before attempting to clean with the enclosed microfiber bag.
3.0,I'm a little confused... only one hoop comes with the key???
3.0,This line runs very small around the hips but the product is durable and fairly priced.
3.0,Just ok. Not fantastic quality.
3.0,"Had bought for the compression,but unable to say they've helped.Have long-standing elbow problems"
3.0,"Size is made on the small side. It fit but I find it snug for a ""robe/housecoat"". Would recommend  ordering 1 size larger  than you normally  wear."
3.0,Has great potential.  Comfortable and nice thickness to the fabric.  That said they do run a little big.  Are most definitely not high impact for large chested ladies (I'm a 38DD)  and the pads inside get all twisted and turned around in the wash.  Will keep them for around the house wear when not going out.  But won't use them as intended as work out bras.
3.0,"I ordered a medium; when the gloves arrives, they were soft, supple, and warm - and too big.  Returned them.  Can't re-order as the company does NOT have small.  ;("
3.0,"It does work. The drawback is you must keep soaking it in cold water about every 30 minutes. I work in a factory where it's hard to get to the water cooler,besides making a mess around the cooler."
3.0,Very durable but the zipper broke immediately good thing there was a second zipper but sometimes that one gets stuck as well
3.0,"The dress is cute. It is silky and stretch. It looks ok, but when it stretches it causes to pattern to stretch and the color look faded.<br />I would get it a size up just because of that."
3.0,"im 5'0 and curvy, the top part looks really good but the bottom looks long and makes my butt look flat"
3.0,It's more shiny that it looks. It is also maybe a size or 2 small in the bottoms and a small at best in the top.
3.0,Its cute! the star and chain are bulkier then the picture shows which was a bit disappointing bc i was after a more dainty look but still cute and wearable.
3.0,I was so excited when ordering this. Unfortunately the zipper isn’t the best. It wouldn’t stay up at the top when moving around doing my daily activities. Maybe if you just sit but not picking up toys etc. I also wish the arms were a little wider. It was kind of uncomfortable in the arm pit area bc of how tight.
3.0,Cheap material.  Almost see through.
3.0,"They look good and are perfect size, not to small like other brands. Only complaints I have is the blue mirror tint is coming off in a few spots and one of the arms seems to be coming loose. But for $5 you can't really go wrong. It's better than paying $12-$25 for the gas station or CVS ones of the same style lol."
3.0,These are nice. Unfortunately they go right up my armpit. So the deodorant kinda left a spot.
3.0,"Length is great, arms are super wide."
3.0,These are nice  but very brittle.  Might be good for people with small faces since it is very tight around the ears for me.
3.0,These shorts don’t really look like the modeled version and I only use them to work in the yard - bummed
3.0,Very pretty...just runs small. I gave it to my daughter.  The pink is gorgeous somewhat lighter than shown but cute.
3.0,Tight at chest
3.0,Nice sun/ fishing hat<br />Came wrinkled and had to wash and dry then press to get brim to sit properly
3.0,"I wear women's size 7 shoes and ordered small. There's too much fabric by my toes. When I wore the socks to run, the excess fabric is irritating. The bottom of the socks is thicker than the legs so they do provide extra cushion & that was nice.<br />The sock-legs are compressive and comfortable. I am a petite woman (5'4&#34;) and I am pretty certain that if I had bigger calves, these socks would not be comfortable to wear. I want to love these socks, but in general the fit is odd. I have purchased  socks that retails for the same amount with better fit. So I am a bit disappointed by them."
3.0,It’s a bit too small to fit all of my tackle.
3.0,"Super cute! Love the shoe like design on the feet and that it’s nonskid, but it runs small. I got 12-24 months and it already fits my 11 month old baby perfectly. Probably will not last past 18 months and she’s not a big baby either. I wish they had bigger size."
3.0,Color not an scar match
3.0,"Start with the good: The dress was quite pretty, LOVELY color (although more pink than shown in image). All 3 of us bridesmaids were measured by the same tailor before buying. When the dresses came in, one needed just a hem, one needed to be severely re-sized in the waist, and i needed to take mine in TWO SIZES, paying $105 for that. We accounted for and expected the hemming, but *not* resewing the entire dress. The fabric is nice and delicate, although one of the breast/cup liners poke a little through the light pleating on the bodice. This is not a high quality dress, and I will most likely donate it after the wedding. I did not expect couture, but essentially, that is the price I paid. I would give this a SOLID 2.5 stars."
3.0,The scarf part is rather short. Looks good and feels good. Just wish the fabric part was a few inches longer.
3.0,"Im sorry to say I was frustrated when i tried to make it work, it has great bag package, shape & appearance but it doesnt move at all! The button on the right that is supposed to make it work doesnt move!"
3.0,Watch seems fine for the price.  Watch band was less desirable.  Hate the color of barf plus less than comfortable.  Would love a brown or leather tan color option.
3.0,I like the style but the top was a little big while the bottoms were a little small. I'm a size 14 and 38D so I thought the XL would fit but it just doesn't look/feel right.
3.0,"Nice dress. Fit was correct. Size M for 5'7&#34; 135lb broad shoulders 36-27-39. However, it was just slightly short in the waist for me and the length was not long enough. I was expecting the dress to go to the knee for a classy vintage look and it was above knee for me. If you want a vintage, at knee length, you will need to be on the petite side. 5'5&#34; or less I would guess..<br /><br />The fabric is okay, it is soft and flexible. However, I feel that the lining could be better. It is a bit flimsy and a nicer lining would really upgrade the weight and feel of the dress which is slightly on the flimsy side. Perhaps starch would improve the look of the dress, but because of the flimsy feel and flow it does not move like a high quality dress.<br /><br />I recommend this dress, but for casual summer look, not evening wear."
3.0,Doesn't have the same stone as pictured. Has a plastic multi colored bead. Looks pretty cheap and flimsy.
3.0,"Looks good for the price, the detail isn't that great."
3.0,Not a bad scale.  It easily weighs and converts objects between multiple units and the backlight is a nice feature.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Not overly expensive<br />Comes with 100g calibration weight<br />User friendly and fairly durable<br /><br />Cons:<br />Backlight turns on whenever new weight is added (even if forced off)<br />Does not pick up items &#60;1g unless optional cover tray is added and the scale is zeroed<br />Requires frequent calibration (I've had it weigh the 100g weight at 100.30 grams within two hours of initial calibration)
3.0,"Great for about a month, already coming apart, could not find an email/contact for Secure and $16 for a pair is a but much, maybe 2 for $15 would be a better deal, slight thinner sole and better blend up sock to give wear protection about 1/2 inch up sock"
3.0,It is a nice jacket it just didn’t fit.
3.0,Fairly good quality but the arms are very small. Size up once or twice. I’m 5’5” 195. Bought an XL and couldn’t get it over my head.
3.0,I like them but I have small size hands and the medium is not snug enough.
3.0,"Well, I suppose the shoe expanders work as expected.  It just takes me twice as long since I only received one set of the black add-on knobs (I'm not sure what to call them actually).  This means, I can only do one shoe at a time, which is kind of irritating.  Poor quality control."
3.0,Arrived on time. True to color and beautiful.  Fitted per the size chart in the picture and it was a bit baggy in the breast and about 4&#34; to long. Simple fixes but more money spent.
3.0,i order a 3x but it fits like a 2x
3.0,"It's a cute top, just runs small. I even bought a size up and it's still a little small. If you have bigger Boobs it will be small. Material isn't as pictured but it's swimsuit material. You get what you pay for"
3.0,Material was too thick and felt too hot to wear on hot summer days.
3.0,"The garment is very soft, but to small for me. I wear a large order a large, very snug around the arms, should of gotten a larger size. Returning, there is a rip in the neckline in the back."
3.0,"Very nice, bigger than pictured."
3.0,Used them as a stocking suffer for out family gathering. Big hit
3.0,"ordered a XXL, way too small"
3.0,"After a while of wearing some of the plastic started to come out and poke my body, not fun."
3.0,Did not fit as I expected
3.0,Love this little outfit and the price was right! The only downside is that the vest does not connect in the middle and you get flapping vest. It's annoying! Not enough to return but it's a design flaw at least in the one I got.
3.0,it's very pretty but the purple glass part doesn't hang right. We had to do some adjustments to it for it to look right.
3.0,"This is a very beautifl dress. However, it does run a little big."
3.0,jewels fell out soon after purchase
3.0,Size was too small 3x
3.0,"I found another flannel nightgown on Amazon for half the price of this one...fabric quality was the same, and it was longer--came right to my ankles. This one is not high quality flannel. It may be a bit prettier, but not worth the difference in cost."
3.0,"I was disappointed in this dress in person. Unfortunately, it's not for me. I'm not really fond of the fabric. While it is great for quick drying needs(beach, etc.), it's on the rougher side. It's not so bad that I couldn't wear it, if it looked better on me, though. It does have an inner lining that comes about mid-thigh.  While I do like my clothing to be on the loose side, I don't want them to be so loose that I look like I'm wearing a maternity dress. This dress is super loose. It does come with a belt tie, but it doesn't really help the look with all the extra fabric. I just look super awkward in it. On the bright side, the straps are adjustable."
3.0,The leather on the straps was crinkled a bit.. still hasn’t straightened out a month or so later. Loose thread on the seams. I still like it though!
3.0,"Love the earrings but the bar pick, part that goes through the ear is a bit too fragile.  It broke when I removed it from the earring to try it on. So I must return can't wear it & I loved them. It's a good idea but it needs to be made of a stronger material. I would have rated them 5 stars if they had worked."
3.0,My granddaughter wanted a mood ring so I purchased this item. For some reason I thought that I would receive three rings. This is a single ring which comes with no instructions as to what the colors represent. Isn't the whole idea of a mood ring to tell you what your color means? We had to google the meaning of different colors for me to give her the information. This item is a waste of money in my opinion.
3.0,I really like the strap but it’s way too tight to fit comfortably on my Maui Jim’s. The stitching is unraveling on the ends because of the strain of fitting the glasses.
3.0,These earring run heavy. I got them for the value very pretty in person. I was disappointed that the only earring that has screw in backs are the flower studs. The other two are double flair.
3.0,Cute in the pictures but the gold detailing in actuality is bulky and tacky
3.0,Fits strange. Looks awkward
3.0,The sleeves are not long enough for me to cuff like the picture. So a little disappointed with the shirt
3.0,"These leggings were magical at first. Super soft inside. After 1 wash in cold water and hang drying, the fleece inside instantly began to pill. I accidentally put a pair in the dryer (on low) and the outside of the leggings were covered in pilling... more than that... the fabric was starting to disintegrate. Just covered in black strands and fabric knots. As long as they hang dry, I guess their general integrity is okay. Just not as soft on the inside. So, unless you want to hand wash these... be prepared for a short life expectancy."
3.0,I love the Amanda Jeand. Only kind I wear. Have a dozen in different co!ors. Was disappointed that these were not tapered as advertised but we're instead straight legs.
3.0,"They are really cute, the quality is good for the price. I ordered 3, the first one was perfect, the second one had a broken charm clip, and the third had only 6 of the charms. Other than that they weren't bad for the price."
3.0,Larger than size indicates.
3.0,It's a nice tie but definitely lower quality than expected. It's narrower than I though and a bit brighter than what the photos show.
3.0,"my girl wears this most nights when going to bed , it is comfortable and fits her nicely,  just make sure you follow instructions for washing or you will ruin it."
3.0,"Was expecting it to be as pictured, color wise. I really wanted the teal color but all of the letters are the peach color. Way Smaller than expected."
3.0,"Item was delivered very quickly, but was not the quality I was hoping for.  I ordered the Washington Huskies Paw Charm/Pendant; it was thin and feels like a dime-store charm, especially for the cost.  I am keeping the item because it's a gift, but would be hesitant to buy again.  The chain is non-descript and too light to be of any value; it will be scrapped.  I think they would do better to increase the weight of the charms, and forget the chain.  However, this company provided quick service, and with that, I was very happy!"
3.0,"I purchased the size according to the table provided, but it came a bit bigger and doesn't fit very well.<br />Overall the quality is medium, not sure if it will last for long"
3.0,Beautiful but I should have ordered bigger.
3.0,Darker grey then I thought also this was a large bracelet. I would recommend getting a small size.
3.0,Didn't fit comfortably and or provide good protection
3.0,"Comfort.  IT just isn't comfortable.  You might wonder how hard it can be to make a silicone watch band and how much difference can there be from the original.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to buying generic brands for things I need but this one just missed the mark.  I'm not a designer so I won't pretend to explain why it isn't comfortable, it just isn't for me."
3.0,Please go size up for best US fit.
3.0,"I ordered a white shirt an received a grey shirt. t's a bit too tight and it smells awful. I'm going to have to wash it before I can wear it. The overall look and feel are great, though."
3.0,It doesn't really do much for my shape. A bit uncomfortable as well. Does hold my stomach in though.
3.0,The fabric started fraying after only a month or so of use. The metal clip also broke after maybe 4 months.
3.0,"Slippers are very cute. The bottom soles are very thin. My back hurt after a few hours of wearing.  Also, they feel like they will wear apart quickly. I had black fuzz everywhere."
3.0,"I just wanna say thank you for getting my glasses shipped out to me though they were a day late it’s all good. I love how well they protect my eyes but... I feel like the blue tent is too deep on the lenses, I can see my plants but I can’t get a very good clear view at them because the blue is so deep my plants almost look like shadows but I can see a just enough detail to know what’s what on my plants and I don’t see green anymore walking out of the garden room so that’s a plus. Just wish the blue wasn’t so deep where I can get a clearer view of my plant."
3.0,Color was as described but beanie way to big for my head
3.0,"Great and durable bag, only con is the inside of the bag is ripping pretty bad and I’ve only had it for a little over a year. Good thing it isn’t that pricy so if it completely rips I can order a new one."
3.0,"Odered the one that looks to be clearly purple, just letting you know it is gray, not purple, and the head strap is very tight causing the nose piece to dig in. I added my own adjuster to the bottom neck elastic to adjust the tension as it is too loose around the bottom of the mask. I have their around the ear mask and pretty happy with that one."
3.0,"Although the gown fit well, it was way too long. I'm 5'7, so am not short. I would have had to pay someone to hem it. Not worth the extra money. Had to return."
3.0,"I was trying to find something adjustable for my toddler.  I wish they had children sizes as it is a little long for him, but it does work well."
3.0,This dress is absolutely adorable but runs REALLY small. The colors are just as they show in the picture and the fabric is nice but definitely order larger than you would normally
3.0,"Small for what I was looking for. Nice color, nice material, just to small for me."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:f774a6add68bc1c14be227405cd2994d]]
3.0,"Quick shipping, good price, but not what I expected.  I thought the details would show better but the just look like black circles in my ears. The front piece was large compared to the actually size of the tunnel so they looked weird and big on me.  I don't think I'll wear them very often."
3.0,Would work for a long legged person.
3.0,"Cute, but pilled and got clingy after a few washes."
3.0,"They're cute, but the sizing was wrong for me."
3.0,"These are definitely more of a brown color than pictured. They are not khaki or mauve like the picture or the description. For reference I am 5'1 and 150 pounds. I carry most of my weight in my mid section. I ordered a large (my normal size). The fit it ok. The waist hits at an uncomfortable place. The length is almost perfect for me, so beware if you are taller. My biggest problem other than the color is that these pants wrinkle so easily! I steamed them and they were wrinkled within minutes of putting them on. The material is very scratchy and synthetic feeling. Not my favorite. 5/10"
3.0,Needs a clearer understand of sizes when you think of mens large you look for a larger shirt but not in this case.
3.0,"Very sturdy, long tie clips. However, be careful that the edges of the back clip is smooth, or it will cause you too pull threads out of your time when putting it on or taking it off.  I'm just being careful with them, but I'm sure you can smooth it out with a nail file."
3.0,"Awkward fit in chest area and over all too short for my torso. Might try a size smaller. However, returning the xl right now."
3.0,Way too small! I have to return these and size up probably 2 sizes for my daughters normal size . I got these for her to wear with her birthday dress since she is having a mermaid party. Also when they arrived one of the mermaids had fallen off the shoe .
3.0,"The picture showed a sage green, but when I received it, it was greener than sage green. Then I looked at the label & it said sage moss/green. Also, the picture looked like the Violet Short, but was the Nimah Short instead. My fault for not paying better attention. So, I was going to send it back, but found out I had to go to all the trouble of making copies of forms they send thru email, etc., plus paying for postage, so I’ll find someone who would like these shorts & give them to her. Next time I’ll only buy from those who say free returns!"
3.0,"True to size. Although if you are taller and have long arms, the arms are too short for me. But that’s normal for most long sleeve shirts for me."
3.0,The blue is a nice color.  Ordered an XL but usually wear a Large. I’m 5’7” 165lbs but a little top heavy. Fits nice. Not too tight or loose. The material is decent. I’d wear it to a wedding or nice events. Not work attire unless covered with a business jacket.
3.0,They  are  just fine
3.0,"Its okay to.me it did not look like images, croownslook very cheap n my opinion."
3.0,"Heavy fabric, which is nice, but it's a little short compared to the picture. I'm 5'7&#34; and 140 pounds so I ordered up as everyone directed. The problem sometimes with that is that it looks a bit odd at the waist line. I like it, but I don't love it."
3.0,"Very soft, comfortable sweatshirt however it definitely runs on the smaller size. I am usually a medium but can sometimes wear a small in some items. I am 5’8” and 140 lbs and I ordered a medium. It was just about the right size, but it shrunk upon washing so I probably should have ordered a large."
3.0,too expensive for what you get
3.0,Don't get me wrong this bag is beautiful in person but my bag came with dents in it.Packing could have been much better hence the reason for me giving it three stars.
3.0,"This product is beautiful, the material and the color as well. However, it runs big, I'm 5.1' and 103 pounds and size small fits loose. I normally wear size small in Nike sport bras."
3.0,The first time I wore this I asked my husband:  “would you believe me if I told you I made it myself out of a shower curtain?” And he said “…didn’t you?” So if that gives you the vibe of how it looks lol has a similar plastic-y smell as cheap shower curtains too… but it works for the intended purpose of keeping you dry and I found it better than a shitty poncho they sell at events for a premium once it starts to rain. I certainly don’t use to for my “every day raincoat”—it’s pretty stiff and the sleeves are way too long. I got it to wear to a tailgating/outdoor sporting event in the rain so I could stuff it in my bag + still see my team colors underneath. 🤷🏽‍♀️
3.0,"the top band is too tight, I'll keep them, but they are not very comfortable"
3.0,"The dress was exactly like photo but just not a good fit for my body type. Quality, fabric all beautiful."
3.0,The braclet was very beautiful but the clasp on it fell off the first week I wore it. I have tried to fix it but can't seem to figure it out.
3.0,Very cute! I ordered an xl and it fits as I expected. It can also be worn as a shirt with a cami underneath. Not too sure how it will hold up in the wash but for the price I wouldn't expect any better quality fabric.
3.0,Its not as full as the picture shows
3.0,very thin material. Was to fit a size 2-4 but really it was closer to a 0-2. I would order a size bigger.
3.0,"Cool hat, but soft packaging almost ruined structure of the cap. Should've been in a box."
3.0,Kinda cheap looking and the chain is kinked up and I can not un-kink it.......thinking of breaking the chain off and putting the charm on another necklace!
3.0,love the patriotic look but that's about it. No cushion at all and very rigid.<br />I wouldn't have bought them if I could have tried on in a store. Lesson learned
3.0,"These are very pretty but extremely large, too large for me."
3.0,It were not what I expected
3.0,The gems were secured very well but unfortunately the studs kept falling out and I lost all three within a month.
3.0,Its not the pants just me.  I am still looking for the perfect that will not pull down when I sit.
3.0,These sunglasses seem better quality then i thought but still seem like they can brake easy.  I got the red lenses and they didn't look the way I thought they would look but they still protect against the sun so I will get over it.  The shipping took a little bit longer than i expected.  Overall they aren't bad for the price.
3.0,"very nice, but size runs very small. I could not use"
3.0,"Good features, but not quite waterproof."
3.0,"I like the colors<br />Purchased for the style especially.  I was disappointed, button holes very small challenging to get closed.  It looks roomy but it runs narrow in the shoulder area, and across the front."
3.0,I think they were too small and tight
3.0,"I'm not sure how I bought a size 1. I am nowhere near that, so 3 stars because people say the waist fits, and the dark wash is nice. I am 5'4. Holding these pants up, they came all the way up to my chest."
3.0,"its okay product, construction of the hat its too weak.."
3.0,Very pretty earrings that sit nicely on ear and don't fall into a dangle. Earrings are sparkly but giving only 3 stars because product inspection or control is not great. One earring has several very cloudy stones that are very noticable against the other clear shiny stones. Doesn't look very good
3.0,Much smaller than the pictures depict. Then one using it as an earring was very misleading as it was much smaller.<br />They are all very cute but smaller than I wanted.
3.0,Pretty design and color…small was too big fir my size
3.0,I used the glove when I first got them and they had a good grip. After a few uses the grip went away so I would not suggest you buy this.
3.0,Nice quality unfortunately they are waaaay too small the sizing is totally off.
3.0,"I ordered these before they are great, this time they gave the wrong ones. I would still order."
3.0,"First off. The cosplay itself is BEAUTIFUL. I was completely thrilled with the design and quality of what I received. However I just had bad luck in the process and happened to get a shirt with a gigantic hole on the side seams.<br />For someone who is 5’2, 150 lbs, typically wears a 34x30 in mens pants and a medium in t-shirts, and a 34 DDD the outfit was just a hair too snug for my torso. The back probably wouldn’t zip up all the way if I were to wear it long term. Definitely not without help. So I already had ordered one size up to a large. I recommend one more size up and it would be just the perfect amount of fittedness. I am really disappointed there was a hole because this was my back up cosplay since prime could get it faster for me since EZCosplay.com wasn’t going to make my order arrive to the states in time. Sooo definitely sucks I don’t even want to wear this with the gigantic hole. I am not sure if I could even safety pin it. So the 3 stars will be for the fact it did come damaged and for the sizing chart definitely being a little misleading. Otherwise if you can order early to find your exact size. It is a great cosplay."
3.0,Hard to take off
3.0,These are not warm socks.  These are alright socks for fall or spring.  I will be keeping them since I can wear them at other times of the year.  I'm actually surprised that this says wool socks.  They certainly do NOT feel like wool.  Nothing on their packaging says wool either except the name of the socks.
3.0,"I liked the look and feel of this coat, but way to size for the size I ordered. I was going to give it to a friend, very small friend but the arms were too long. I wouldn't even know what size to tell you to order."
3.0,"I guess this is a Chinese sized robe. It is really heavy Terry and is really nice and absorbent. The stripe pattern is pretty and bold, and the hood is lined in red material. I would love to wear it but there is no way. It is a large size (XXL I think) but it isn’t just snug, it is so tiny, the two front sides of the robe don’t even come to my sternum in front. There is a gap that stretches from my mid-rib cage on one side to the other. Not just a little too small, it is tiny.<br /><br />Heavy, nice robe but runs smaller than anything I have ever purchased."
3.0,Loves the skirt just the smallest size is big on me. Im 5'2 110 lbs I'm sure I'll gain weight and it will fit. Also the quality is really good.
3.0,Nice but to small and short
3.0,"It's a beautiful dress, however, it is not true to size. For women with curves, I would suggest the next size up.  As for the dress manufacturer, I would suggest a more accurate and realistic size chart."
3.0,Too big for me  the medium I'm 5'8 170 pounds ! I need a small the pants way too big !
3.0,"Runs small, order a size up.  Not my favorite but still cute"
3.0,"I’m so disappointed. I ordered 3 of these previously. Loved them. Well I needed a new pair. Just got it today. While it looks pretty much the same while wearing they seem way less durable, flimsy and cheap compared to the old ones. It’s the same link when I click on “previously purchased”. In their defense they DID update the pictures but I really wish they wouldn’t have changed the glasses. The pictures show the difference. The old ones have the little decal on the arms and are just all around more sturdy and substantial."
3.0,Dress was pretty and LONG for us tall women. Stretchy material and hugs those curves. Must wear shape wear underneath if needed. I went with a different dress because it looked like they had shipped me a returned dress because the dress was full of grass and twigs on bottom. I was  disappointed in no quality checking before shipping. But that being said I'm glad it was already like that otherwise I would not have know it would have been ruined after wearing it. Decided to buy a different dress.
3.0,Didn't like the material and are way too long..
3.0,This fit on this shirt was good. But the red around the color was too bright and shiny.
3.0,"The length of the skirt is great, but the ends of the sleeves were too tight & the velcro that keeps the back top closed is weak & cheap. Wear a white t-shirt underneath the top because it's very thin material."
3.0,"Very cute with great colors, but the ear holes are not spaced correctly for my 7 or 10 year old.  It's not possible to place ears through the ear holes, but otherwise fine and my kids just wear them without ears in."
3.0,Worked as advertised but the hard case wasn’t for me.
3.0,"The material is sort of weird. It is very flowy, which is what I was looking for, BUT it is very short. I will keep it to wear over my bathing suit with shorts. It does fit a little small, especially because it is short!"
3.0,Nice romper. Very thin material. I’m 5’5 200lb and ordered a XL. The front button clasp came off within hours of use due to the thin string holding it together.
3.0,hudg
3.0,This shirt fit I a very odd way. The arms were really tight and the torso was super baggy and just cut weird.
3.0,I am always a small in my leggings but i couldnt even get them up over my thighs. I was super sad but next time I'll order a medium.
3.0,Looked like a nice dress but when you tried it on it fit very strange under your chest. The back applique was not centered properly.
3.0,Fabric is too thin. The dress is see-through. It’s comfortable just as long as you were Cami underneath.
3.0,"How big this the band? Is it standard mens, or mens?"
3.0,"I am 5'9"" and wear a size 16 - 18 depending on the quality of the clothes. I read the mixed reviews and decided to buy these pants anyway.<br /><br />First, I love the material and construction. I ordered the light denim blue. They're not a heavy denim, they're a cotton, polyester, spandex mix - which is perfect for me because I bought them for summer vacation.<br /><br />Second,  the zipper has no hooks or buttons.  While the zipper is designed to lay flat to prevent sliding, I'll probably still have my seamstress sew some hooks in.<br /><br />Third, these parents are short! As they are they land about 3 inches above my ankles. BUT, if you take the hem out, it adds 4 inches and they end up looking regular length. I will take them to my seamstress to finish the new hemline.<br /><br />Bottom line, I love the pants but if you're a tall gal with hips like me, you won't get the look in the picture.  I give them 3 stars because of the effort I had to make to make them work."
3.0,"My 1st dress, the material was nice, kinda like a nice T shirt fabric. I didn't care for the thin kinda shiny fabric on this on this one. The fit and length was good, not so much the fabric."
3.0,The strap is way too short and I have small wrists
3.0,Confusing. Couldn't figure out how to close up the hole in the top. Nice material though.
3.0,Dress was adorable but sizing was way off.  Too small.  There is no stretch at all.  Had to return it.
3.0,"I bought these for my daughter to wear to school, but the material is way too thin to do that.  They'll be fine as sleep pants, but I'm not going to let her wear them in public!"
3.0,"Great quality  just way smaller than any of my bra's, reordering 2 sizes larger."
3.0,"Cute romper fits good , but the seam started to come undone (right leg) so who knows how many wears I'll get out of it, and I wish the &#34;tie&#34; in the middle was a real string so you could actually sinch it up - but it's just for looks :-/ real pockets though so that's nice."
3.0,They are cute but after only a couple of wears they are falling apart
3.0,"I was excited when I received these bags from Amazon.  I opened up the package and took out the bag.  As I opened up the folded black bag, the nylon quality looked alright.  I had read some reviews mentioning that it was poorly sewn or week.  Well so far so good, I felt happy.  Until....... I decided to put my hand and arm into the bag to open it up to see the actual size of the bag.  Well as my hand got to the bottom of the bag, I started to pull it open with one hand on the outside and one inside.  Well... this where the problem started.  The bottom seam of the bag just tore, split in half.  The sewing is awful.  I did not even check the other bags, didn't even open them up.  I just threw the bag back in to the box and decided to return to Amazon for a refund.  The quality Sucked!<br /><br />I gave the company 3 stars because they were very polite from the beginning of the sale to apologizing at the end of the sale.  They even told me to keep the bags that I ordered and not to send them back and they would still reissue a refund which was quick.  The mentioned that they wanted me to try the ""new model,"" which had better sewing.  I am a little skeptical but with Amazon's great return policies, I may try it."
3.0,It is very cute but it is not magnetic as advertised.  It has a pin instead.  I was going to use it as a shawl clasp.  Instead I'll repurpose it.
3.0,"This jumpsuit is great because it is stretchy and easy to take on and off, I also really like the black color. The downsides I found to this is the material is very thin and it almost resembles a wrestling leotard. It is form fitting but there the material doesnt help shape your body so it will accentuate any lumps or rolls in the body.  It's size is accurate so it does fit comfortably, the torso is not too short for me but I am 5'4"""
3.0,"The tabs for chin strap, elastic are all sewn in the wrong place so are unusable.  Just cut tabs out and used hat anyway but...."
3.0,"I read the reviews for these boots and everyone seemed to say they ran small so I ordered a half size up and they are too big.  I have Prime and ordered them that way but they took weeks to get here so I didn't bother to return them for the smaller size, I just wear thick socks.<br />The boots are cute and you can't beat them for the price.  But they do not seem like the most well made product, the heel feels like it may fall off, but so far its been fine."
3.0,I was referred to this sandal to help with plantar fasciitis and my heel spur.  They are comfortable to walk on however the strap isn't snug against my foot.  My heel touches the back of the shoe so it's not as though I ordered a size too large.
3.0,This is the size of a penny
3.0,The ski shirts run small had to return them
3.0,Great material but way too big. I wear a 6/8 and ordered a small
3.0,The stitchings on the duckbill are crooked cheap Chinese quality.
3.0,The hat does not really look like the picture. Not as thick and warm.
3.0,Not a fan of the style but it still looks nice. It seems to be of a cheaper quality material but it fits well. Still prefer the COOFANDY Men's Business Formal Dress Vest Slim Fit Skinny Suit Vest Wedding Prom Waistcoat; same company different colour and style.
3.0,Can blow a candle through mask which means it doesn’t work properly. The filters don’t fit properly either.
3.0,"Cute, but way too short. I’m 5’7’’ and 155 lbs. I usually wear a 6 and this is just way to short. Not sure who this is long enough for?"
3.0,These run narrow and the foot pad is very thin.  Not one of my best purchases
3.0,The small barely fit around my wrist. I will probably order it again in the larger size and give a smaller one to my great granddaughter.
3.0,":  I received this bag yesterday afternoon from Amazon --but I don't quite know what to make of this bag -- it is not quite what I expected. I need to decide what to do.  I needed to replace 2-similarly sized but ageing North Face duffels I bought from Great Pacific Iron Works in Ventura. One (vinyl) is 40+ years old & the other (cordura) is 30+ years old. Terrific build quality. Tough. Used as haul bags across rock. 1000d.<br />The first one I bought from Tom Frost at GPIW -- like the Canterbury rugby jerseys I bought from him back then. Compare classic rugby jerseys with those fashion statements seen today at mass retailers and you begin to see my view & my regrets with this bag. Carhartt products are known for being tough. I wear a Carhartt 12oz carpenter pant to the gym instead of floppy sweats which only last 1-season. Almost like the 14oz heavy canvas workpants I used from those old Chouinard / Patagonia catalogs for rock climbing.  I also have several Carhartt jackets because of their toughness.<br />I was looking at & considering a BAD Bag as a replacement for gym duty. Then I saw the Legacy Gear Bag 20 at attractive price. Good enough? Read the Amazon q&a's. Spec'ed at 1200d! YKK! Should do it. The photo showed a photo w a detachable strap attached with ring tabs just like my old North Face duffels. The ring tab attachment points are useful for things like luggage tabs or for carabiners like I use to attach pull slings to drag-sleds at the gym. And, yes, one of those Amazon Q&A yields an affirmative answer to a query in re to strap detachability. Perfect. Generally -- just like a classic tool wristwatch -- the cheapest sharing the same build quality as the luxury models.  Features are the price comptomise; not the build quality.  A classic work / utility / tool duffle has a detachable strap -- even a small duffel. Not like a Messenger bag which does not. The bag arrives.<br />No ring-tab attachment points! Non-detachable sling! Aargh!<br />I am not saying that this is not a good bag nor am I saying that it is not usable. I am saying that it is not as depicted -- it is not as I anticipated. If I had seen this bag at a retail location I probably would have kept looking. Functionally it is not that different from what can be found at Harbor Freight at a lower price.<br />Then, , I look again at my Amazon order. I paid $54.99. Received YESTERDAY, -TODAY, the same bag is priced at $50.85!<br />What did I get? A different (special purchase) version of a low-priced product? A badge engineered low end lookalike? A counterfeit? What do I do? I will try it today at the gym but I am wondering about that narrow carry strap & pad. Yes, those ancient NF bags have generously sized straps & pads.<br />Do I complain to Amazon about the price differential!  Do I go for a refund & return?  Then keep looking. I could keep using my ancient NF bags until they collapse.<br />Am I picking nits?  Well, I recently also purchased a Black Diamond Rock Blitz 15 backpack for carry purposes to the gym while on my roadbike.  That's a technical bag -- it balances the toughness / lightness compromises in a very intelligent manner.  It actually uses 920d material for optimal toughness where it counts.  A duffle is not so technical so the compromises really jar.<br />I'll query Amazon further re the price and the fuzzy descriptives.  Still a good bag - not a great bag.<br />Chuck M"
3.0,"I normally wear a medium/size 8 dress so I bought a large. Way too small. Would have needed xtra large but then there would be extra gaps in certain areas. Just fit weird. Do not like the skirt slit, way too high for someone that’s tall - I’m almost 5’9”."
3.0,"They mean high cut when they say high cut. I felt like Jamie Lee Curtis in Perfect.<br />Not quite enough coverage of the butt. Pretty comfy otherwise.<br />Wouldn't reorder, but I will wear them and they're kind of funny to have around."
3.0,I bought this too to layer with things in the colder months. Honestly it’s not a very comfortable shirt so if you’re looking for that then I would get a different brand. I’m keeping it though because it looks like what I bought and the color is nice! It’s just a stiff material and doesn’t have much give to it.
3.0,"Much more comfortable than the standard wrist bands (which irritate the heck out of my skin) but, durability is suspect. The problem is the hole I use for comfortable adjustment is getting stretched and beginning to tear through to the next large hole. I've been wearing it pretty much 24/7 for about 6 weeks now. I figure it's probably got another 6-12 weeks before it stretches/tears all the way through.  r anything like that.  So... I'll keep looking for a better band. Not silicone, not too heavy, good adjustability and lasts at least 18m to 2 yrs and ideally under say $40... Unicorn?"
3.0,This is good for storage but the succión is not as good.
3.0,The jacket is small but the pants are so big
3.0,"Boots are very comfortable and work well for pheasant hunting the whole season. I finished my first season in them and went to clean them up with some saddle soap. The leather on one of the boots turned a dark reddish brown and the other faded to a light tan. I contacted Browning to see if they would replace the boots, but stated it was the saddle soap I used to clean them up with that caused the discoloration of one of the boots. I guess it doesn't really matter to me as long as the boots work as intended, but I was disappointed that the company would not stand behind their product."
3.0,"If you are looking for cheap, bulk sunglasses. I bought them to pass out at a parade. They are all about quantity not quality. But saying that, they were the biggest hit of the parade and will be doubling my order for next summer."
3.0,"Runs small, cheap material - I wore it once and the material ripped down the seam in the back."
3.0,Not a bad item but it's hand wash only. Really for kids clothes hand wash only is ridiculous other than that it's a good outfit
3.0,These do fog up pretty bad and water gets in easily. Wasnt impressed. Save your money.
3.0,"the quality is good, but it is much smaller than anticipated"
3.0,"Ordered this for my son's birthday because he loves Naruto. The necklace rusted in less than 3 days and he hadn't gotten it wet. Then, the charms changed colors about a week later. He ended up hooking the charms to his key ring. The bracelet is still holding strong almost 2 months later."
3.0,Ok shoe
3.0,Doesn't fit very well. Keep falling off my son's hands.
3.0,The buttons are sewn in a very annoying spots.  The back of my ears hurt after a few hours. I added additional buttons and relocate the pre sewn buttons. Now they work great.
3.0,I purchased this for Halloween and it arrived on time. I would have given this 5 stars bc the dress is gorgeous. It is see through towards the bottom but they send a pair of high waisted undies with it. However when I put the dress on I noticed the zipper was busted towards the middle & it had chips in the zipper. There was no time for me to send it back so I ended up having to pay for it to be fixed.<br /><br />The elastic band in the back pulls the zipper outwards so the zipper would get stuck ( along with the chips in the zipper its self. ) I am super sad about this item and I am going to tell Amazon about it.<br /><br />Other then that it is absolutely gorgeous. I ordered the beige color and it is a bit more peach then the photos but that's normal.<br /><br />I'll update the photo after the seamstress fixes it and please excuse the paint on my nails! After all what's Halloween without a little crafting.
3.0,"This not a patch you can sew on a jersey or sweat shirt, it more of a light metallic sticker"
3.0,I like the material and design the most. The size runs smaller than normal. It is a little snug on me for a large which usually fits loosely on me.
3.0,"So these are reasonably cute and I do like the colors, however they smell like chemicals:(<br />A little better after airing out for a couple days"
3.0,Looks better online than at home. I thought knit was going to be a heaver fabric.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress. I really dislike it!<br />The material is that heavy polyester that clings to you and shows your pantyline and everything else. It's very low cut, the beige is pinkish which I think is really weird with the green, and good luck trying to figure out how to tie the weird long sash. On the plus side, the quality seems good.<br />If you have a perfect toned body, like showing lots of cleavage, are good at solving puzzles, and like strange color combinations, this is the dress for you!<br />But unfortunately it's not for me, I'm sending it back."
3.0,"This is a nice easily read watch however, it was just too big on me."
3.0,Looks and fits great but the material is very thin
3.0,"This is just okay for around the house, would never wear it out of the house but the fabric is pretty good so I will use as pjs."
3.0,"My son is going to absolutely love this, however, I bought a pullover sweater, this is not sweater material, it's thin, it clearly is for the picture not warmth.. the fit is expected, I bought a little big so my son can grow into it.."
3.0,The bag arrived with a bad odor inside the bag.  I had to spray it with Febreze a few times.
3.0,"Not the best quality material, it is much stiffer than in the picture. It looks more like a pajama shirt than a cute top in my opinion."
3.0,One of the earrings arrived broken so had to return. Size was perfect though. Current pair is tarnishing and will probably reorder.
3.0,Pretty earrings but they don't close well at all. After my fourth time wearing them each time I wore them an earring always fell off) I completely lost one of them. Such a bummer.
3.0,"The coat is really nice, I ordered a large because it stated that it comes a little small. I wear a medium and ordered a large and it was still to small.  I really like the coat but it didn't come in extra large."
3.0,"They look great, however, the ones that I received  were just Moons, not Sun and Moon as it is in the picture"
3.0,"First the good: I think it is a high quality, well made pack. It hauls a heavy load easily and distributes the weight well on your back if you pack it correctly just like any pack. I have the green one and it is an attractive olive green color. I also like the front access. It allows me to pack a light jacket or rain gear for easy access.<br />One complaint, I feel the capacity is marketed badly. It is advertised as an 80 liter, they admit it is only a 70 liter in the description.  They name &#34;4800&#34; generally refers to the cubic inches on every other pack on the market...this is kind of an industry standard. 4800 would indicate a 78 liter pack. My load is not that big and I have a hard time packing it all. Honestly,  I would say 65 liters is probably a much more accurate description.  This is a huge disappointment for me as I wanted this pack to be my large pack. Instead, it will have to be my medium pack and I will have to continue my search for a decently priced large capacity pack. For this reason, the pack earned 3 stars. I almost always give 4 or 5 stars. First 3 star I have given in a long time. Mission Peak needs to start marketing this pack correctly."
3.0,"its just okay.  Little disappointed because it was very hard to fasten the clasp on the earrings.  also, I found that these earring were very uncomfortable to wear.  Looks like the ones I ordered were defective."
3.0,"Looks cute on long skinny feet (size9) but it only came with 1 foot anklet, not a pair. Would buy another one so I have a pair."
3.0,"Product fits well and comfortable, I would have given it a 4 star but one of the arms broke after a couple of weeks. The weak point seems to be where there is a screw to attach the arm to the main part of the frame. Originally we bought a second pair because my wife like it, I hope that this second pair lasts a bit longer"
3.0,kind of cheap looking.
3.0,I would not say this are site 10-13 as I have tried 6 different ones and they are all small . I would say they are more like size 8-10
3.0,Unfortunately these are way too heavy.
3.0,The extra large was ordered.  These &#34;abbreviated&#34; long sleeves will not fit properly on really long arms.
3.0,"Stones ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Not a lot of options on Amazon for larimar earrings that are just studs - lots of dangles, though. These larimar stones are lovely - beautiful aqua blue and each uniquely veined, but still match. Smoothly polished and snuggly fastened to the settings. A bit bigger than I expected but not too obnoxious for my somewhat small, attached lobes; they're not too heavy either. That's 5 stars.<br /><br />Setting ⭐⭐ The concern, however, is that both posts were bent and when I tried to straighten them so they would sit correctly on my ears, I found that they were both very pliable and thin. I have lots of .925 sterling silver earrings settings and these are the most fragile posts I've ever had. The backings are also very tiny (impossible to handle with even short nails) and don't feel secure (in fact I lost one when trying to separate them right out of the package - dropped it and haven't been able find it in the carpet). I'll be using clear rubber plugs in their place. I'm hoping the earrings will still hold up so I can wear them on occasion because they are so pretty, but I won't be surprised if I end up losing one one day.<br /><br />Packaging/Shipping ⭐ They weren't shipped in a box, just in a folded plastic bag, which is probably why they were bent. They were also just clasped together by having one post going through the other's backing (like you did as a kid to keep all of your pairs together).  Plenty of other inexpensive jewelry on Amazon come with a functional, even if not pretty, box too keep them protected in transit.<br /><br />Overall, I think they're nice for the price and I don't plan to return them. Even if the posts fail, I can turn the stones into a broch or something. They would be outstanding earrings if the .925 were plated in something stronger, or better yet, available in 10k white gold."
3.0,It's a very cute swimsuit but it's not for large chested women.
3.0,"Super cute! Perfect for any event, can be dressed up or down. Only issue was how thin/see through the material is."
3.0,Sweet little shoes and really cute bows. The shoes love ok like they might run large.
3.0,They fit really well and are very soft. But they are not wide leg as the picture and description states. They are narrow and form fitting through the leg and ankle.
3.0,Quite alright. I ordered a Medium to just in case it was too tight but the medium kinda swallows me. The jacket fits a lil big which is great. Thin materials so definetly a spring/summer fit. I do recommend it.
3.0,The dress was the correct size that I would wear but it did not work the way the size should work way too small I should have ordered about 2<br /> sizes more than what I would normally wear
3.0,Good but the balls keep falling off
3.0,I ordered a size small and it fits perfectly. My only complaint is the color. It looks brown in the picture however the one I recieved looks more burnt orange.
3.0,To big for my liking
3.0,they’re cute but i honestly dont like them lol
3.0,Fits ok. Tied each side
3.0,"I bought a Large as I am 5'9"" and thought I would need the room and the length. This is so long that I fear tripping on the bottom and falling. If you wear it with heels, that might help, however I wear only flats and sandals. I also had to taper the sides to look normal. I won't get the Medium as it appears just as long."
3.0,was a little snug but okay
3.0,"Even following instructions,  these faded after the very first wash. The fit was very flattering though."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:c0036b24ef9a9a6b57b4a07586960c77]] It’s cute enough but the color is not cyan it’s green. I wouldn’t pay so much for a bag but likes the ad color.
3.0,"Easy to use, the item arrived as promised. The size is way off from the measurement. It is a bit too big."
3.0,"But it's okay. The color does say blue, not aqua. I kind of hated it until I put it on. I won't use it for going out, but for every day, it'll be okay."
3.0,"Enough volume to fit larger framed sunglasses but the zipper leaves something to be desired ... very dainty ... might work out fine if kept in your bureau, but if you plan on using it in your outdoor kit as I do, only time will tell how long it will be before the zipper fails."
3.0,Great for all  types of  glasses
3.0,"When you first take these out of the packaging, they are extremely bright, shiny silver.  However, after putting them on my bracelet, they lost their shine which resulted in ""blue"" marks on my wrist.  Would not recommend these.  Save your money & get a clip of better quality, even though you might not (2) in a package."
3.0,Started turning coper within 3 days
3.0,"This is typical american drivercap of good leather qualitiy without lining.<br />It fits  rather wide than long faces, where it comesdown to the ears.<br />The whole makeup is much larger than other caps.<br />I would very much appreciate the leather tarnish instead of this glossy surfave.<br />It is what it says - a Driver Cap."
3.0,Super cute. Size up
3.0,"It came with some loose strings and the belt is cheap, accidently washed it and the knit frays easily but its decent for the price and is cute."
3.0,"Alright, honestly it's not that bad. This is coming straight from the package, excuse the wrinkles. It's not as fitted towards the end of the dress. The quality is actually decent. It's a little thin but can be worked with. I ordered a small and I'm fairly satisfied. You get what you pay for. Overall, it's decent for a night out."
3.0,I wasn't expecting it to be like a bolero tie (hahaha) just kidding but it's big enough to be one. It's made well and has great detail but too big to wear as a necklace in my opinion. I returned it.
3.0,I was a little disappointed with this product.  It was advertised as a camisole but it is really more like a sleeveless undershirt.  When I tried it on under a sheer Georgette blouse it looked really bulky and the bra really doesn't support at all.  I have returned it because it just didn't fit the bill fore me.
3.0,This shirt is see through through the whole thing. (I got it in white). You would need a shirt underneath even if you were wearing a nude bra. The collar is bigger than it looks in the picture. Not flattering. Fabric feels junky. The button in back fell off within seconds of me trying this on.
3.0,"Love the look of the shoe but the width is very narrow. Also, the top strap is loose letting the foot slide forward and off the top of the shoe. Shoe is somewhat heavy."
3.0,"The look is good, true to size, a little bit tight at waist by ok for me. I’m 5-3, 120lb and S fits fine. It is warm and comfortable, but the quality is just so-so. It’s not bad for the price but certainly not a deal. Don’t buy black color if you have pets, it will show everything."
3.0,I like it. Is its practical and nice
3.0,"Print on shirt was not very bright or true color; looked like extremely cheap screen printing, including edges of white visible around the seams. It fit well and would have looked very cute if it hadn’t been printed so poorly. Material was comfortable although it also felt cheap"
3.0,Product runs a bit smaller than expected. It is very cute on and the cups have lining assuring coverage and comfort. The straps could stand to be wider for added security and comfort. Great product for the price!
3.0,wife loved them but stitching was very poor 2 out of 4 already coming apart. can you resend. maybe she received a bad batch
3.0,Quality could have been better.
3.0,Eh... i wish i made it myself. not worth it
3.0,"I bought these boots to wear when I take my dog for walks around the neighborhood. (He's not quite 2 years old, so the walks are necessary no matter what the weather.) They keep my feet dry but have no support or cushioning for my arch.  My dog and I are walking on city streets and sidewalks, so it's hard on my feet and they feel heavy to walk in.  I did find some arch supports to fit into the boots, which help some, but make the boots feel even heavier. Also, the soles are not rubber, so they tend to be a bit slippery underfoot. Not good value for the money."
3.0,"The sizes are WAY WAY off!! A mens X large is closer to a women’s small, especially the sleeves as they don’t even reach the wrist area, otherwise nice thick construction and good warming."
3.0,"The pants fit well and are well made but it’s a completely different blue jeans. I bought them specifically to have a nicer looking jeans for work, but it’s a much more casual faded jeans."
3.0,"These googles arrived with there own case, ear plugs and a nose plug.  Really liked that there was a snap on the back of the straps to secure vs slipping over your head.  Have not had a chance to test how they work in water yet, but they seem like they have a good fit so water can not get in.  I received this product at a discounted price to get my honest review."
3.0,Pro's<br />-breezy and lightweight for any time of year<br />-vibrant colors on the flowers<br />-tassles are an added bonus<br />Con's<br />-tassles tangle often<br />-handwashing is a pain with the tassles<br />-actual fabric is low quality and only comes just below your waist
3.0,My only regret... It's not 100% bamboo... only 75%!
3.0,Not like my old Russel sweatshirt .....sleeves are extra extra long.
3.0,"El vestido hermoso, pero llego en mal estado todo arrugado, a hora tengo que mandarlo a la tintorería y voy a tener un gasto mayor de lo que esperaba,."
3.0,Fitting Not good at the wrist.
3.0,"Comfy and didn't shrink. Wish there were different designs.<br /><br />Update; Took a few stars away. Arms are tight compared to the size, already a hole in the threading beneath the arm."
3.0,material is too thin. Nice cool shirt
3.0,Cheap material but worked just fine
3.0,I returned the earrings. I liked the look of them however the length of the earrings was too short and not what I wanted. These are more like huggies.
3.0,This is the second one I have ordered<br />Love them they are light weight yet warm.<br />I leave one of each at my daughters home.<br />Have to order one more for me
3.0,Very pretty and as described.<br />Size I ordered did not fit. Returned item but did not have time to order different size for the event.<br />Worth trying
3.0,"Not true to size. The quality seems ok, but does not fit true to size. My wedding band is a size 10 tungsten carbide ring. This silicone ring hardly fits."
3.0,If you have a high arch it makes the slippers a little difficult. I ordered a size bigger in hopes that this would not be a problem. However it is still a little difficult to slip on. Once they are on they are very comfortable.
3.0,Good fit. will try washing in a load with extra fabric softener to fix scratchy feel of fabric.
3.0,"I really liked the pattern & material, but the top didn’t sit down and made the dress look big."
3.0,Runs small. One piece suit. Plastic headpiece. Everything is included. Good quality for the price
3.0,"Initially I love the ring, but was very disappointed when the inside (the black inlay) came out after just wearing it two times.  I guess for $7 I really can't complain."
3.0,"Dress itself beautiful but way too small, I feel like need 2 sized up on that dress"
3.0,Too ooen weave to tie
3.0,Too thin!!!
3.0,I think they are so cute. However they run a tad bit small and the cushion is super hard. I will still wear them though.
3.0,Buy a larger size for room.. you can take it in ..but you can't make it bigger!
3.0,"Great looking boot, but fits extremely small width wise. Hard to get foot in let alone just the felt without a foot in it."
3.0,"Fits as expected.  No support.  I know the design of it isn't really supposed to offer support,  but i assumed it would be more than lace laying over my bust. Very pretty with a slight stretch. Perfect for layering over a supportive bra bit under a revealing shirt."
3.0,"Ascot/Cravat was a few inches shorter than expected, could barely tie it around my neck in a &#34;proper&#34; knot.  Material is thick and looks nice, but has some &#34;loose strings&#34; along the seams. Other than being hard to tie because of the length, it looks nice with a proper tie-pin.<br /><br />Buyer beware though, shipping is from China, didn't see anything about that on the seller's profile, so when I ordered it on October 20th for an event on November 10th, I thought I would have time to get it shipped.  Received it in the mail on November 13th.  Had to use a back-up of a standard necktie for my event."
3.0,"feels mostly polyester. it is very stretchy can stretch bigger than they look i like the zippers on pockets, although i have not washed them in the machine yet. it is quite a deal"
3.0,Made really small
3.0,My kid is obsessed with these pajamas. They are pilling already after just two washes though so the quality is not great for the price.
3.0,Very thick ... looked a lot different in photo than the Mask I received ...
3.0,It is not Gov Iss.  I needed to sand it a little to fit my gov iss LC belt.
3.0,I bought a bigger size than what I normally wear and it’s a little tighter than I like.
3.0,"It didn't bring what I had all the way up in color but, still polished and a good product"
3.0,"I only received the silver earrings, where are the gold earrings?"
3.0,Nice quality. Cup size runs a little larger than other brands.
3.0,Fit to tight. My daughter can't get them up herself.
3.0,I think these will work but the pieces that are supposed to hook on the folds pop off too easily. You either need to carefully but on the mask while holding it and the bracket or permanently attach it to the mask.
3.0,Thin - might see thru
3.0,Bottom we’re fine top didn’t fit
3.0,It’s a beautiful dress! Well made material is great and all but unfortunately it runs small. I’ve always gotten XL or XXL dresses and they fit fine or a little big. Sadly this dress did not fit at all! Bummer!
3.0,"This product was a little large around the bust, I'm a 38DD, and ordered an X-Large. I think it was mainly how the garment was sewn, the bust gaped at the sides even with the straps adjusted. If it had one more dart in the breast it would have solved the issue. Also the material was a little cheaper quality then I thought for a 60+ dollar dress, It was stiff and not as flowy as I imagined. Also as another reviewer wrote, my dress arrived with dog or cat hair all over the skirt. Very unappealing and gross. I would not order from this seller again."
3.0,Cute with shorts
3.0,Didn't realize it wasn't one piece
3.0,They are cute.  I struggled to get these in my nose.  The post after the angle was a bit too short.
3.0,"Looks ok, but cheap as paid."
3.0,I'm not really pleased. The belt is very small.
3.0,Didn’t like the length
3.0,"The watch itself looks great, I've gotten several compliments on it, and everyone's thought it was much more expensive than it actually is. However, the glass crown is... made of glass and cracked incredibly easily, within two weeks of wearing it. It was my fault to be fair, but it took almost nothing to break the crown. Be very careful when wearing it."
3.0,Nice looking dress and material had to return it given the fact that the top is to tight for someone like my wife that is 38 C in bust.
3.0,Love the elephant but I'll probably replace the chain.
3.0,"Too short!  It's about 6-8&#34; nice my ankles .  It's also big.  I bought a size small.  I haven't washed it yet, so maybe it will drink a bit.  I sure wish it was longer.  I'm 5'7&#34; and weigh about 128.  It also doesn't feel at all like cotton, more like poly.  I bought it because it's listed as cotton."
3.0,Love the style but very flimsy
3.0,"I bought these because Amazon was out of DEVOPS in my size.  These run small and are made of a much heavier material.  Other than that, they are not all bad."
3.0,"Someone said they were small.  Wow.  They would look great on a child.  They made me look like Dumbo.  I never had to worry about my ears looking fat before lol.  They're also so small that they are almost impossible to ""latch"" in the back without ruining them.  I don't recommend."
3.0,"Only offered in one size, however size is super small"
3.0,okay price.
3.0,"Great pair of Glasses and Sport By Sager whom was the shipper did a great job of trying to resolve my Issue. The three stars is because Maxx Sunglasses the manufacturer calls these Coyote brown, that is not the case they are maybe a dark tan. but like the other review states great sunglasses for the price so I will keep for non military use."
3.0,The two sides of the wrap dress barely touch each other. I would only wear this as a swim suit cover up dress.
3.0,"These shorts are so itchy! They’re cute but drive me crazy. Also, they’re shiny, which I didn’t realize when I bought them. Wish they weren’t so shiny. But the itchiness is the deal breaker."
3.0,super cute top but way too small on me. i have a 35 in chest (34d cup size) and there is no way i could wear it
3.0,Quality material but the size chart is way off I got a medium and either my gym gains have been on point or that medium ran small. I think the later :-)
3.0,It’s so so. Ordered a small and it was too big. How much would it cost to add a couple more inches of Velcro? Materials not very soft. It’s not horrible but it’s not what I was hoping for.
3.0,"My ears have been pierced since I was a child--27 years and after wearing these for about an hour, my ears were bleeding.<br /><br />The seller did respond immediately after I wrote about my problem. If you have sensitive ears do not buy. I will however highly recommend this seller."
3.0,tighter than I expected
3.0,"I was disappointed the pendant has a yellow color tone. It looks more clear and iridescent in the picture, but it is clearly a yellow color in real life and doesn't pick up the rainbow of colors as I expected it to. It's still cute, but just now what I expected."
3.0,"It's a great shirt, but the sizing is too small. I always buy large T-shirts so that's what I ordered. Unfortunately, it is too tight so I won't be wearing it. Like I said, it is a great shirt, so I may reorder in a larger size."
3.0,Ordered size 6-12 for my 4month Old who wears 6-9 and it fit more like 3-6. Super small. The shirt was short and the pants were tight. The shirt is soft cotton and the pants are see thru spandex. So as they stretch they get more transparent. Returned. Very cute outfit though. Ordering a size up. Fingers crossed!
3.0,"The USAF logo on the cap is not centered properly. I thought maybe it would be just the product pictures that had an off center logo for just their hat, but my logo was off centered exactly like in the product pictures shown in the page."
3.0,then were fine. Average qualitybut I wasn't expecting anything more
3.0,Paint chips easily when using the bottle opener function and the light is often accidentally turned on in my pocket. Battery died fast and the bottle opener did not work as efficiently after quickly chipping away.
3.0,"The bag is quite cute, but make sure you view all the pics before buying-- I didn't, and am really not crazy about the floral pattern on the inside. Nice overall, though-- I wanted a big-ish silver purse, and this one has plenty of room."
3.0,"It is smaller than it appears online and the necklace latch was almost too small for me or my husband to put on. The chain itself was very thin. It is very pretty however, maybe more appropriate for a preteen?"
3.0,"I was really excited to receive this bra in the mail, and had read previous reviews that it was small, so order a size up.<br /><br />They didn't have my size available if I ordered up, so  I decided to take my chances, and those that came before me were right. Definitely on the small side in band and cup size.<br /><br />However, I did like that it felt sturdy; it would probably last a long while. Also, it does come with extra padding (aside from what is built into the bra) so you can boost the cup size even more, if you'd like."
3.0,I get compliments but up close they are kind of cheap looking.
3.0,the belt is good the buckle broke the second time I wore the belt
3.0,Not impressed… need wider and more durable
3.0,Color in photo appears lavender. Actual color is a brown
3.0,Meh.....nice but I like the old style better that had the ID window turned up/down instead of this way. Oh well allett is a decent product.
3.0,"I bought a xxl still to small when I wear a L to XL think I have to be a medium, so runs very small, like the cut, but material very thin and see through."
3.0,"*EDIT<br />I apologize for my original review on these sandals. I made it right after I got them in the mail and judged them at first sight. But after spending a month and a half with these babies (in and out of the shower), I have come to appreciate their true value.<br />Though I'm sure these sandals are made of something that's not exactly rubber, I am now certain that the material is not styrofoam. In the shower, they get wet and flexible on my feet. Also, they're good for just walking around the house. Though I haven't worn them outside since I don't want to risk using them anywhere but the shower. They still feel fragile to me.<br /><br />I stand behind what I said about these sandals arriving in slightly used condition. One of the logos on a sandal was peeled halfway off when I got it in a plastic transparent bag. Plus they used to smell really bad, giving off this powerful odor. But after constant shower use, the smell is finally gone. I'm glad that I can step in and out of the bathroom without having my bare, wet feet touch the floor. Although they're not the best, these are some great sandals. You have my word on that.<br /><br />But I still think the guys selling this product should post more images of the sandals here. The only customer image (currently provided) is just not enough. It needs to be shown at different angles and in great detail. And they should post a comment about the horrible smell that comes with the sandals!<br />Seriously! Do it already!"
3.0,The color is vibrant in the photo. ..after receiving it ...looked washed  out.....
3.0,"I ordered these pants wanting so open leg sweats, but I’m not a fan of how they fit. I don’t think their is anything wrong with the size, I just don’t think they are made for leaner figures. I’m 5’5 so I’m not extremely tall, just pretty average but I still have long legs. My waist isn’t huger either. These pants reach about my ankles but the waist is huge, the drawstrings are long, and the crotch is also very big. I ordered a medium because there was no small, but I’m afraid if I sized down, the legs would be to short, but if I sized up the legs would be fine but the waist wouldn’t even stay on my body. I’d say they are pretty boxy and not made for leaner figures. They are pretty thick, and are fairly good quality I’m just not a fan of how they fit. Overall I decided to keep them for around the house pants."
3.0,The fabric is soooft.
3.0,good for inexpensive item
3.0,"I ordered the gold frames, but the frames weren’t as gold as the picture, they were more of a silver color."
3.0,I think this would best be described as a singlet underwear and not really shape wear. I almost kept it because it is pretty and seemed like high quality but it was too snug around the thigh openings and didn’t do any shaping or provide a feeling of support so I returned.
3.0,"The sweater is cute and comfortable. The sizing was a little confusing,should have ordered a size smaller. You could dress it up or wear casually"
3.0,The shape is weird. Kinda uncomfortable. Cheap. Just ok. Sad
3.0,The fabric is very soft and the dress has a nice shape but runs SMALL! I am 125 and the size 6 was tight. I normally wear a size 4 in womens so that came as a bit of a suprise.
3.0,"It is exactly what it claims to be, and as to price, the best deal I found. If you are a cosplayer, and are going for AOT..then this will get it done.....IF you have hrs of patience, some maturity,a willingness to put up with the terrible, badly translated .pictograms?!?...well what ever the instructions intended, they fell short, and the Google's and you tubes became our best friend.<br /><br />Mom's and dads, prepare tohelp get them strapped up, use lots of crazyglue, cause you will never, ever, want them to be torn off.  Period."
3.0,"My wife dislikes this. The material is uncomfortable and stretchy. It rides up over her belly when she wears it. She got a M but it fits like a small, which might be the cause of the riding up problem."
3.0,Will not fit on my size 7 feet. Very thin. Do not really care for them and will not purchase any more.
3.0,"It folds down very small, which is nice.  Am not using it for luggage, but for carting documents that I pick up for work that are too heavy to carry.  I use a bankers cardboard box to put the records in.  There is no place to really hook the securing bungie and so I end up squashing my box.  The item came with absolutely no instructions.  It would have been nice for the manufacturer to provide at least a few pictures to show how the bungie can be used."
3.0,"It was nice but it did not fit over the lip,we will learn more about shopping on line ie.sizing Not your fault,You did what was expected.Thank you gloria"
3.0,material was a little heavier than expected
3.0,Received my pant today and a hole on the right side pocket
3.0,I should have heeded other customers on the glass lense being too . However I do have a brick head. The quality looks good otherwise
3.0,"Wasn't a bad purse, it was very nice, just too large for me. I returned it."
3.0,The robe is beautiful  ...However  I was bitterly  disappointed  to find out that that 1/2 a size to a size smaller then it should. its a shame because it truly is a gorgeous robe.
3.0,"Beautiful colors and received well packaged, but right out of the package, the dark blue ones had a missing stone and one of the ends fell off of the red ones as well as the lt green ones. I'm going to try to super glue them back on, but not holding my breath."
3.0,"I am usually a small but order up based on other reviews.  I liked them when I put them on but they just do not offer the comfort compared to another style I purchased on Amazon.  Perhaps I should not have sized up - I;m not sure.  In any event, I still wear them but only when I am doing around 10-12 miles."
3.0,The masks looked good and it was a great price my only issue was the eye holes were too small on majority of them. It made me feel like I had a lazy eye trying to wear it. But the half mask was the best one imo.
3.0,I liked the size of these earrings. They are small enough to wear all the time but not so small that they can barely be seen. The post has a catch on it so the back won't slip off. I thought titanium would be the answer to sensitivity problems but I am starting to have some swelling. The real issue for me was the shipping. They came in a box with other items. The tiny little bag slipped underneath the cardboard flap on the inside of the box and it is pure luck I saw them and they didn't get thrown out. I suspect that is exactly what happened to the first pair I order.
3.0,I like the fit. They keep my hands warm but the touch screen finger doesn't work so well. It keeps twisting.
3.0,"I can't believe I missed all of these reviews<br />everyone says the sizing is trash and they are spot on<br />The straps are cosmetic, the shoe is a platform slipper with cosmetic straps sewed on<br /><br />They run at least a size smaller than standard US<br /><br />Since they HAVE straps, I decided to cut the slipper top and sew the straps back on so they actually work<br />The shoe now fits me but I basically reconstructed the tops<br /><br />I left the middle strap cosmetic (non adjustable)<br />I..  don't recommend you buy these unless you are willing to rebuild them"
3.0,"UPDATE TO SEPTEMBER REVIEW IN DECEMBER: These rings are now starting 5o turn my finger green. This is after daily wear, literally EVERY day since I received them. So far, it's only the gold one, but I can tell the rose gold is fading, too. For someone wearing them once in a while or who takes them off at night, they'd be PERFECT and STUNNING. I'm sad, but they lasted a few months, anyway 😊<br /><br />SEPTEMBER: I wear these every day, through everything, and they have held up, so far. All stones in tact, no green, no bends. Just perfect, simple, sparkly bands. Definitely recommend!"
3.0,The necklace fitted  as expected it matched my dress perfectly
3.0,"Good quality nice feeling comfortable pants with a great little belt but the waist run small and it’s not stretchy, unfortunately this pair had a zipper with no end blocks so it just kept coming off the teeth.  Had to return for those two reasons, otherwise the pants are nice for the price !"
3.0,Way too big for my wrist.  Returning.
3.0,"I like the color and style, but these shades sit relatively flat on the face meaning, they don’t have such the “curve” to them. Otherwise they look awesome!"
3.0,I wore this top over another top and it was still a little too big.
3.0,It’s was a nice dress for the price. Wore it to the airforce ball and received tons of compliments.
3.0,Took forever to receive it.  Got it yesterday.  Going to try it today now that it’s dry.  Looks like what I expected.  Will see if comfortable.
3.0,"Seems like a nice hat but man, it's huge. I have a very large head (7 5/8) and this was too big for that..."
3.0,What I dislike about these pants is that it is very big both in length and width.
3.0,"Nice for the price.  As it states, not for protection, but cute over a safe mask."
3.0,does not stay on heel of foot
3.0,"Update: While I still think these socks are cute, the longer I have them, the more iffy the wool content seems to me. If you're mainly buying these with the wool in mind, maybe look elsewhere. If you're buying for the looks, they're super cute.<br /><br />With the caveat that you should check all the socks when they arrive (one of mine had a hole in it), I love these socks. I wear wool socks pretty much exclusively 3 seasons a year, so, although I'm a knitter, I can't make enough socks and usually buy lots of storebought ones to keep my sock drawer full all winter. Typically, I buy the warehouse store wool multipacks, but I'm never thrilled with the pattern/color selection (but the price is right--about the same as these per pair, but perhaps a little better value because they have a higher wool content than these).<br /><br />As a knitter, I'm always underwhelmed but the selection of storebought sock patterns and colors, and I really love these.  They're slightly unconventional, murkier than the colors you typical see in socks, but very pleasing to me. They're colorful without being loud or jarring. The patterns are similar across the socks (just different color orders, similar patterns), but the heels, toes, and cuffs are different solid colors, so they're super easy to pair up in the laundry.<br /><br />The fit was perfect on my women's US size 8-8.5 foot. You could probably go up to a 9, but not bigger, and they would still fit well on a 6 or 7. They're soft and warm. The patterning means they're thick and cushy over most of the sock, but that the heels and toes, which tend to wear the most, are actually thinner because there are no extra threads being carried behind the pattern. I hope this doesn't negatively influence wear. I'll report back if they wear poorly, but they're great starting out."
3.0,It looked just like the picture. Fit well and was comfortable when I wore it. Only problem was the boning started to come out of the bottom
3.0,First off it is a very comfortable bra. Nice large shoulder straps and wide girth strap. I order larger because after reading the reviews it said to do so but really don’t need to since they provide a additional hook attachment. I wish I hadn’t purchased the larger size since I’m actually at the last inside hooks. As for the look of this it does seem to make me look extremely perky and my breast pushed way in. So being older and a bit heavy it looks “funny” on me. I look like I have one “cone” shape in the middle of my chest. Probably won’t wear this as offend but it is very comfortable and I have a ongoing irritation which causes me to twitch and snap my bra a lot. Just wish it didn’t make me look so cone shaped.
3.0,the shirt has a weird sleeves
3.0,Washed it in cold water twice now. Shrinkage is real.
3.0,I ordered these as a little something extra for Valentine's day as apart of a larger gift ideas and that didn't arrive until mid March. They smaller than you think and average quality.
3.0,Perfect for chubby human like me. Unfortunately my breasts are a bigger size than what cups the outfit has so my breasts fall out. Otherwise I def love this swimsuit
3.0,It’s not the same design that I ordered but it does the job
3.0,A little thin on material but love them! Wear them all the time.
3.0,"A little too small for me, so I sent them back."
3.0,I liked the material but the fit was so awkward! It also ran quite large. Returning.
3.0,"Works but sometimes even when I was holding it correctly and the light would go on, I would get shocked, too."
3.0,It broke. I didn’t even get to wear it. 😩
3.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; and 145lbs, and it's about six inches too short on me. Thought this was a maxi dress but it hits me mid-calf."
3.0,It’s a beautiful necklace but not for an adult. This would be a great necklace for a one or 2 year old.
3.0,There's really nothing wrong with the product but I just wasn't happy with it. I have every wide hips so the chain barely was able to wrap around and then it just sat awkwardly on my body type.
3.0,"Nice pattern. The pants worked for me, but they bordered on being a little too big. One size fits 0-12 is a little broad for a size."
3.0,They work well for purpose intended but because I need glasses to see I can’t see when I use them because my glasses do not fit underneath. It would be nice to have an option for those who wear glasses.
3.0,"The dress is really beautiful. Sturdy material and beautiful color. However, I ordered a medium and received a large. I need it for a wedding so I rushed back to the site and they were out of mediums in the color I need. Really disappointed. :("
3.0,Cute shirt. It’s kind of see through. The pineapple is like the old iron ons from the late 70’s early 80’s.
3.0,"Frame quality is good, glass quality is bad... I just needed the frame, had to put my own glasses, so good for me!!"
3.0,tight in the legs and big in the waist. its not a proportionate fit.
3.0,"The material is very thin.  If there is any stretch, such as in the bust area, you should expect this to be a bit see through.  Also, the pockets do not help the dress to lay as flat as it should.  The length overall is good."
3.0,"I like the Design, I had to order 1 size up to have a perfect fit, I just don't  like the material that it's made out of, paper cloth, which is easy to Rip. Just have to see what happens -"
3.0,"These are definitely not compression socks! They are half calf and have almost no stretch. That being said, they are still very cool. Guess I should have known skeleton compression socks were too good to be true."
3.0,It was not in a box and the chains were so tangled when it arrived.
3.0,One was a size too small and the other one was bigger than what I ordered.
3.0,"Purchased these for walking at a Disney 10k.  Fit was expected, got a huge laugh from my sister."
3.0,Took too long to arrive. The shirt fits ok but fabric is very thin you can see any bra through it.
3.0,"Fits a bit smaller than anticipated, plus the material is not flattering (saddlebags are more pronounced!).  I do like the color."
3.0,Very basic and reasonably okay strap for the price you pay. My wrists are of not too thin and not too thick in size and I have to use the last hole the pocketing strap holders are too close. There is a long strap left out and annoyingly comes in every way. I am planning to return this product
3.0,"Way too small, not for work"
3.0,Pls add latches for large wrists
3.0,"I love the size. Look pretty. However, They are heavier than I appreciate. I do not want to feel my earrings hanging. I never wear earrings that pull down too hard and that’s how I have kept my lobes pretty. I can wear the largest one for a little while.  I’ll be looking for a lighter pair in the mean time."
3.0,The arm holes are big so wear a tank under it. Thin material. I wore it for a beach wedding. Great for the low price.
3.0,The way it cinches on the sides makes it difficult to see/read the full text when it's on.
3.0,"Bought the XS for my 14 month old grandson.  It is one piece so a little difficult to get on and off.  A zipper would have been helpful.  Once on, when in the pool, suit made him tip forward, so not great.  It did make him feel lighter to hold but I think placement of styrofoam could be improved to prevent forward momentum."
3.0,A little big!!!
3.0,"Very pretty shirt, but material is very thin, not like how you'd expect a sweatshirt"
3.0,"This jacket is made of very cheap material. Really I would say this jacket is costume quality. The material just feels very rough. Along with the cheap material, the top button on my blazer was sewn on upside down. Now you are probably wondering why I gave the jacket three stars even though the material is poor and buttons were sewn on upside down. Well I will say that the jacket's design is one of a kind, and even though the material may be cheap the overall jacket was stitched well and unlike other Asian blazers I have purchased, it did not have any loose strings or material hanging anywhere. I have received blazers from other sellers that have been far worse than this one. I originally needed the blazer for a role in a short film. Once again I will say that I like the look of the jacket just not the material it is made of.  Overall all I'm neither happy nor sad about the purchase just indifferent.The jacket did fit me perfectly. If you are considering purchasing this blazer make sure you order two sizes up. I will probably not buy another one of these blazers or encourage a friend either, unless the price comes down. I have attached a picture of what the jacket looks like with my costume."
3.0,I was expecting a softer fabric for night wear and quality was very average
3.0,"Dress came on time. I ordered a size 8 as reviews said dress runs small. Looks like it may be a little long on my daughter but room to grow. However, the picture on Amazon of the hedgehog on pockets doesn't quite match on one side. Has dots instead of lines in hair and no space between nose and feet curled up. Have to look closely to tell what it is."
3.0,I would give a 5 stars but i ordered 2 colors in XL but they keep sending me XXL. It is too big. Rather than that the dress is pretty and nice material.
3.0,I loved the style but the dress had factory damages as not enough material was used under the sewing stitches. I would like buy it again but without damages.
3.0,Wrinkles don't easily come out like a high quality tie.
3.0,"The dress is okay for the price but the color did not match the picture which was my biggest issue. The dress I received is a bright reddish orange, not maroon like the picture. It came in very wrinkled but it’s fits pretty well and looks good when paired with a belt."
3.0,"Great looking, solid protection...however it limits the distance for the signal to reach your Jeep."
3.0,The gloves are very fragile.  I purchased four pairs for our dance group and had to return two because they had holes in the lace.
3.0,I have to return this item due to it being too short on my boyfriend. He is 6 ' 4 and it is almost a belly shirt on him. Other than length the shirt is great. The color and logo are nice!
3.0,Cute shirt just runs small.
3.0,I couldn’t get it over my hand
3.0,The look of these are super nice but they are heavy.  I can’t wear them because of the weight of them but they are pretty!
3.0,"I can usually wear 9.5W or 10's, but my toes hit the ends, and the straps were too short to fasten securely.  Returning is not free, either."
3.0,"The small is large enough to fit a medium frame body.  Plus it takes to long for package to arrive, it got to be a foreign company."
3.0,Bottoms fit really large about 2 sizes
3.0,I love the shirt it’s comfortable but one wash and it fade away.
3.0,"like it, like the design, fit perfect"
3.0,Fit smallest than expected but excelled cuality
3.0,too big. I would suggest to buy a size smaller. Keep warm
3.0,The fabric isn't all that impressive. But it does look adorable when on 😍 so there's that...
3.0,"Mine are very cute, I don't know what the reviewer saying the colors were off was talking about. My issue is that the ankle is SO tight?? The ankle is meant for ankles that are like 4 inches around. Even wearing them a lot or pre stretching them doesn't help. If I wear them two days in a row, they're still incredibly tight the second day. Very weird. I don't reccomend."
3.0,I bought my size based on my measurements and it was way too small.
3.0,"Material is too ""cheap"" feeling, almost like a costume you buy to throw out after 1 party. Super uncomfortable aswell"
3.0,does not run true to size :(
3.0,Very cute but the gold pieces change color after ONE WEAR. Even when I ensure I don't sweat and don't spray it with perfume or any other liquid the gold pieces don't last more than 2 wears. I gave it 3 stars because it's cheap and there is enough variety that I don't feel like I completely wasted my money. They're pretty while they last
3.0,"Beautiful dress but I would say it runs TWO sizes too small. I am 5’4 and 170 and ordered a large and it can’t even come close to touching across my chest area, lol"
3.0,Liked them alot but they run alil small
3.0,"This is a cute suit, but the navy blue dye runs when wet even after washing it twice and wearing it (stained legs and seat cushions on boat). Dye comes off, but it’s an annoyance. Top of suit doesn’t stay in place, and I had to keep adjusting. I love the bottoms! Cute shorts and easy to wear."
3.0,They don't even go to my knee
3.0,The color was perfect but the knee high hose didn't go to the knee.  They went about half way up the lower part of the leg which means to top of the hose would show if I wore cropped pants.
3.0,"I bought this for a friend who loves butterflies.  She loved it, but said it was very tight.  I wanted to return it for a larger size, but she seemed to think she could wear it."
3.0,"It is much more traffic cone orange than a cute burnt orange. Much more noticeable. Also strangely heavy for how thin it is, but a good spring/summer dress. With accessories it could be less shocking, or maybe another layer. Fulfills the modestly requirement for an event with scandalized auntie types though!"
3.0,BEAUTIFUL DRESS BUT TOO SMALL IN EVERY WAY
3.0,Pretty scarf but short.  To wrap like the photo it would need to be a lot longer.
3.0,I liked that the jacket looked as it said but it fit way smaller than an XL should fit. The rose of the front came off also after 2 weeks. That wasn't too cool!
3.0,The fabric is okay not the best and the fit not great very very tight and no higher size option
3.0,It’s my favorite color but it don’t hang nice
3.0,"The emblem is very nice, but the chain broke so i can't wear it as a necklace. If the chain was thicker, i would buy it again!"
3.0,"Returned, don't like stretch pants, thanks."
3.0,The color is ok
3.0,"It's not the color I ordered, and I'm not exactly sure what size I actually got because the bag said XL but the sticker on the bag said 2XL. It's a little big but the material feels nice. The picture isn't exactly what you'll get but it's pretty good quality."
3.0,"I love these socks for the feel and fit on my foot BUT the cuff has too much elastic and squeezes my ankles if I wear them beyond my workout. If the cuff was looser, I would rate these a 5."
3.0,"i liked them a lot super cute, sometimes they'd be hard to get on & off but about after 3 months they were pretty tarnished & ended up just breaking"
3.0,"Sent back, okay for the price. Kinda cheap."
3.0,They run big. I’m normally a medium in bottom but ordered a small and still big on me.
3.0,Cute shoe just made poorly
3.0,They make my packing easier and my luggage more organized! It would be a great gift for someone who travels a lot but the only complaint is that the zippers are not sturdy and they tend to give problems a lot!
3.0,size up by 2. too tight. material is good. Good quality
3.0,"I like this shirt because it is mostly a slim fit, however the length was slightly short. A hole tore in the shoulder after one time of wearing it, but nothing a little sewing can't fix. Still looked great though!"
3.0,Great fit and look. The frame just cracked after only a few days wear
3.0,the waistband is too tight for a size 9.  otherwise they're ok
3.0,Its beautiful but I didn't know that its too long for me..but its okay my niece was loving it..
3.0,hard to get into pants belt loops. Runs small
3.0,"Too big, I look like a 90 year old great grand mother"
3.0,"The metal should be thicker, it bent mid-way while slipping on my Merrel's I was pleased at first but worried this would happen because the steel is very flexible."
3.0,"too tight. not super good quality . they look good, though"
3.0,"I absolutely LOVED this coat for the 2 years I’ve had it. It’s SO warm, slim fitting, comfy, and super stylish. (It’s seriously the warmest coat I’ve ever owned.) However, after 2 years, the zipper broke, and I’m sad but I’m not going to pay $230 for another coat that doesn’t last any longer than a Walmart one. :("
3.0,Love the hat but came bent out of shape could have been driver or someone else's poor handling doubt it was the driver I saw him deliver it he was very careful with the package so probably someone at the warehouse not handling properly
3.0,I give it three stars because the flowers are not made with the best quality but from far away it looks really nice I like it for the price. Runs a little loose. It's a good size medium shirt for those days when you are a little bloated.
3.0,La tela se siente agradable fresca pero para ser talla Xl me pareció un poco ajustado el color es más pálido de lo que se ve en la foto de venta mido 5 pies y peso 170 libras me parece muy ajustado
3.0,"The material is soft but the fitting is quite big ,"
3.0,"I'm 5'8, typically a size small in all clothes.  I ordered a medium and it was still too short for me.  I'm a B cup and my breasts kept spilling out of the sides during class.  Kept having to pull up the neckline to make them go back in.  Maybe if I would have sized up two sizes to a large, they would have stayed in.  It's hard to determine whether it is a sizing issue, or a design issue."
3.0,"The hat is very useful in blocking out the sun's harmful rays but it keeps flying off in the wind! The inner part that sits on my head is too small, and I can't keep it snugly fit. My head's not extraordinarily large. I have not read any other reviews since I bought this last summer, so I don't know if this is a common characteristic of this hat, or if it was just my luck to get a defective hat! In any case, I've tossed this in the wash with my daughter's baby clothes-ie gentle cycle, and it has come out okay. I air-dried it...It's just a wee bit floppier than it was before, but that does not detract from its function. I'd give it three and a half stars if I could, but since I can't, the three sticks. Remaining comfortably on my head is an important characteristic to have in a sunhat!"
3.0,They hurt my ears
3.0,Super cute shirt. But the anchor part is already cracking after only a couple wears.
3.0,Chain breaks easily
3.0,"Just okay, thanks."
3.0,I would order a size or two up for washing. It’s a nice dress however it’s just a small fit really tight. Measurements for sizing must me off. I am a medium and it fits like a XS.
3.0,"Good quality material.  Lightweight.  Ventilation is essentially nihil.  Therefore, too warm in hot weather. Crown stands higher than I would like.  Would prefer more structure in the brim.  If you wear hearing aids, you may get the feedback squeal as brim flaps over the ears a bit."
3.0,Me encantan lo malo es que una pulsera venia rota por eso le doy 3 estrellas
3.0,"The style of this is very cute, but the sizing is way off for the US market. I sized up, according to the chart & still had to return. The fabric would be good for summer, too thin for cooler weather & not very sturdy for any movement."
3.0,Not for wide wrists.
3.0,overall good looking watch. I just have a small wrist
3.0,"I tend to run between sizes so I went 1 up since these are lower slung. I felt like I did the right thing size wise since they fit properly everywhere but there is some elastic give to the waist which combined with being low slung means I have to constantly hitch up my pants whenever I crouch, lean over, or sit down. I'm 5'10 and the length is good but I'm definitely  going to have to wear a belt which means that it'll go across the worst area for us long waisted girls and I will end up with a muffin top to avoid plumbers crack. I paid too much for these pants considering they will never look good on me."
3.0,"Super cute. I really like the looks and the little flowers. The wedge cushion is supportive without being hard. The strap was designed for someone with a foot thicker than mine. Not width I mean actual thickness, from top of the foot to sole. You cannot tighten the strap so my thin bony foot only stays in by gripping the toe piece of the sandal. The length is spot on for the shoe. Now the width is odd for me. The toe area is fairly narrow because my feet come right to the edges. But the heel area is wider for there is lots of room back there. So, when my foot slides just a bit and it does because I can't tighten the strap, my foot wants to slide off the edge of the shoe. I know when I get to walking too fast, and I will, I will roll my foot because I will slide off the shoe towards the direction of my pinky toes to the ground. It will be my right foot too because that is what I lead with. I am predicting the future with these shoes. I know me and how I walk. I will forget to focus on keeping my feet squarely in the center of the shoe. Really, I have better things to think about. These will be relegated to a sometimes shoe, an oh why don't I ever wear these shoe? If you have a thicker foot and can fill the strap I think these will be great sandals."
3.0,"3 Stars only because it will not fit my belt loops on my Dickies or Wrangler jeans. The belt is High Quality, with a nice looking buckle and is easily modified for proper waist size by lifting the buckle clasp and reinserting after cut to desirable length. The belt looks extremely strong, with a nice overall appearance, disappointed to see it not fit my work jeans. I suggest you measure your belt loop opening before purchase of this product. I was really looking forward to using this belt for work, fits some of my casual Levi jeans. Very fair price."
3.0,"Weird fit. Despite ordering a size up, it was too tight around midsection, yet shoulder straps were loose. For reference, I’m 34 bust 27 in waist and ordered a medium"
3.0,"Like the material,soft,smooth"
3.0,very big.
3.0,Did not like how the elastic in the waistband turns and bunches up.
3.0,"I love the look & the weight, but one of the rhinestones fell out early on after I got them. 😢"
3.0,"Beautiful watch, however, the hook keeps open too easily, everything else is perfect!"
3.0,"These are wonderful, but the metal pins go into a wooden bore channel, not a metal lined channel. So they're going to loosen and wear out eventually. One of mine is already loose and falls off sometimes.  I've worn then 4 times."
3.0,Overpriced for basically a shower curtain
3.0,"Mostly pretty good. Seems like it should last as long as the holes don't stretch from pushing the post through.<br />However, it can be challenging to put in one-handed, and-my major complaint-if you have any hair in your wrists, it will get pulled by the holes. In fact, it will pull any body hair it passes by, which makes it rather uncomfortable at times."
3.0,Tight on ribs and boobs.  Material a bit thin.
3.0,These socks keep turning on my feet and become slippery when the bottom side is not in place as it should be.
3.0,It’s okay. It’s a sturdy metal but the hook broke off within a week of having it. It’s a cute gift though.
3.0,"Skinny legs and a drawstring waist.  The fabric is ok, but the fit is strange.  I was expecting an actual waistband, but instead, the waist is a drawstring.  The legs aren’t good for thick thighs, even with the stretch.  I don’t know if they will stretch out or not yet.  I will update on that."
3.0,Hoped the pictures on the Roman Reigns necklace and earrings would have been a little bigger.
3.0,"I love the wallet just what I was looking for although, it did rip by the snap needs made more sturdier fabric"
3.0,Does the job.  Comfortable.  Doesn’t fit well in the back and is a thin material -but not see through.
3.0,"So pretty - I love this bracelet. However, I wore it several days in a row and discovered my wrist had turned green underneath :(. Still pretty, I just dont wear it often."
3.0,the seams on brown made it looks not completely black. it is spacious and for everyday use
3.0,"Super cute but the lower strap sits in an uncomfortable spot and the top strap doesn't work well with glasses. Quality is good for the price. Overall not terrible but not great to wear for long periods of time, and probably fits better on smaller faces"
3.0,"The length is just right, it’s a very thin material.. I do like the bathing suit overall."
3.0,The bag came and it was great. what i didnt get tho was the usb cable that was advertised. that was the main reason for getting the bag. being able to charge while on the go
3.0,"This product works in a pinch, but is far from comfortable. It makes sense now why there are no photos of how it goes across your front/middle. I consider myself to have a fairly trim/toned midsection, but this bra strap cuts right across your tummy. It left a strap mark across me that lasted for 24 hours. I wouldn't wear this again."
3.0,Material is not as soft as it looks in the picture and they do not fit loose like they look in the picture. After washing the waist band bunched up and you cannot fix it so that is extremely irritating
3.0,Socks are a great quality but I ordered 12 and they came basically 1-2 pair at a time and the original quoted time frame changed after I purchased
3.0,Overall product was nice and we'll made it was just too big. I bought these for my bridesmaids to wear on the beach since that's where my ceremony will be held. Unfortunately they are too big and flop around when you walk. I wear a size 9 in women's which is a large size for women and it was still too big.
3.0,I purchased a medium and had to return as it was too big - purchased a small and still too big - will need to have it taken in - May use it for Halloween costume
3.0,"I purchased this Jersey for my for Christmas, I hope he likes it I do"
3.0,"Beautiful earrings, but I had to return them since I was unable to get the heavy thick posts thru my earlobe.  The wire gets fatter as it gets closer to the closure and is very uncomfortable."
3.0,Bought this bag 11/2016. Fell Apart 11/2017 The plastic on the straps started to tear. Also the zipper broke off. Not surprised though
3.0,Some of the latches don't open
3.0,Fleece is lightweight and not very warm. Not worth the price. They need to be more clear and uniform with youth sizes.
3.0,"Great design, sub standard fabric, okay construction"
3.0,Much smaller than expected. My wallet won’t even fit in it. Will give it to my grandaughter
3.0,cheap material and poorly fitting
3.0,Got a sun instead of the turtle.
3.0,"Not high quality but pretty.  Mine broke after a week of wearing,.  Oh well.  It was not expensive"
3.0,Fabric is thick and nicely stretches although it is not 100% cotton. The problem is neck line which is too flat and close to neck. Often I feel like I am wearing it back to front.
3.0,"My wife has a pendant with Baguette diamonds. I thought these would be good for occasional wear with her pendant, but they were disappointing. The baguettes are recessed inside the silver frame and don't show much fire. For $20 I didn't expect much but these didn't live up to expectations. Giving it 3 stars because they do appear to be well made"
3.0,They are cute. The only 2 things I don't like about them is that for 1 the pockets feel like trash bags and wen I pulled them up to the right fit one of the belt hoops ripped.. I'm over it but they are cute
3.0,Have never used this type of item before ?? Think they are alright
3.0,I mean the dress just isn't flattering unfortunately. I had high hopes for it but a model always looks better in it than a regular person will. I ordered a large it fits fine the belt really doesn't do anything for his other people have commented. I tried other belts that I had they didn't do much for it.
3.0,"Love the T shirt, but the pants have no way to tighten the waist and the waist is huge...will have to find someone to pit elastic in them😞"
3.0,"It's okay. I really like the design, and I wish I could wear it more. The top of the tree cuts into the top of my ear a little, so it's comfortable for short periods of time when I'm out and want a little flair. But if I am to active it rubs my ear a little. But I still love it."
3.0,"Affordable, cute designs, but the gold tarnished after a few weeks and turned my ears green :("
3.0,"This top is so soft and I'm bummed that I'll be returning it.  The material is too sheer so I'd need to wear something underneath- which would take away from the great cutout design in the back.  Also, it's very clingy, so while I think it runs true to size, I'd personally go up a size so it's not clinging to my problem areas (something to keep in mind if you choose to order). I really like the lace detail in the back but overall the top doesn't work for me."
3.0,Can't comment because they didn't fit.  The quality seemed good.
3.0,Is rubber/plastic. Kinda beach wear ish despite the rhinestones. Looks cheap
3.0,Wish the soles were thicker and rubber rather than plastic.  These feel good and fun but not much support for walking around the house.  A thicker sole made of rubber would make much less noise.  But I like the fun color and don't getting the morning paper in these.
3.0,"Everything was fine, but they came with this spot on it. Have no idea what it was. After cleaning them thoroughly, I like the fit and style. Took points off for the spot."
3.0,Pretty but too small. Pick 2 sizes up.
3.0,Sewn crooked
3.0,"It’s a nice wallet with plenty of slots for cards. However, if you put one card in each slot, the wallet won’t close. Also, some of the slots are extremely small making it difficult to get a credit card in it. I have this in a different color that I’ve had for several years, it does not have that problem. I’m keeping it instead of sending it back because I was having a problem finding a wallet to match my MK purse.  I just won’t all the card slots."
3.0,"Live the dress, it’s good fabric and super cute. But the zipper broke the first time I put it on."
3.0,Cute but can size down one. The white buttons cheapen the look of the dress.
3.0,Beautiful undies. Just too small and too short in legs.
3.0,"I wanted these bras to fit so badly! They are so beautiful, but were way too small for me; not their fault. Hopefully, I will either lose some more weight or they will start making bras for plus sized women. I was sad to see them go though."
3.0,"Just a little bigger than a quarter. Great condition Great price. I have to say that the upper tree had some white in it that looked like the printed tree had been worn off before it was put into the medallion.(It may just be the way the print is, as it looks the same as in the advertised photo)"
3.0,Need bigger size xxxl
3.0,"Fits fine, but color of green is not as pictured... its a heather forest green, i wanted what was pictured.  Blue was same... not as pictured."
3.0,&#34;You get what you pay for.&#34;
3.0,Looks lovely but I didn't purchase these earrings.
3.0,Dress is longer tgan shown on model and runs large. I'm 5'3&#34; and 108 lbs and the dress was calf length and very baggy so I'm returning it. Looked more like a nightgown than dress in person.
3.0,Bottom are kinda high cut like 80's style and top is very short and wide
3.0,cheap but cute. the sloppy cutting of the material makes it dig into your skin. I haven't felt my feet in years so I'm used to uncomfortable shoes?
3.0,"Image didn't cover the entire front like it shows. Fit perfectly, luckily my kid still likes it."
3.0,"I really liked this coat! I ordered my normal Size of XL, as I 5'7, and I don't like anything tight. I was very disappointed that this did not fit properly. The sleeves were to short (about 2 to 3 inches) and the sleeves were very tight around my arms, while the rest of the coat was ok. I did return it and I purchased raincoat else where. I gave it 3 stars as it a beautiful color and nice style of coat and quick shipping. But just too small! :("
3.0,"Nice strap, feels a little cheap but looks good."
3.0,"They are so cute, but not very stretchy or soft. I thought maybe after they were washed the fabric would soften up, but it didn't help much. Oh well. They are socks and I will use them."
3.0,The backing on these are long and there is no groove to keep the retaining  back in place so they fall out easily.
3.0,Dents easily. Not as sturdy as I’d like
3.0,"The desine is beautiful but the color isn’t like real gold, it looks fake"
3.0,The boots themselves are fine. My grandson thinks they are comfortable and easy to get on. The drawback is the plastic toggles that are on the laces. One of them broke into pieces on the first day he wore them. The other one lasted a little over a week.
3.0,"After first wash, collar does not stay flat??"
3.0,"Was small, still got but was snug"
3.0,Not as soft or flexible or as large as I thought they would be.
3.0,"NO ROOM FOR MY BUM. if you're curvy and have a booty, size up x2. It fit my hips but made it about half way up my butt. I gave them to my boyfriend cuz he has the tiniest bum and they fit him perfectly."
3.0,The quality of the tank is great and it’s super cute but it runs small. I usually wear medium/large and this felt like a small.
3.0,"Thin and look more like a support hose material in the off white color.  Too tight for me, so I know my dad couldn't use them, which is who I bought them for.  And they wouldn't protect his arms any."
3.0,"Really cute! But very low quality. The material was very rough, and the waistband was maybe a half an inch wide. I ended up sending back, which I was really disappointed to do because the style was so cute."
3.0,It's okay. But not recommended for largest chest. You have to keep unbuttoned.
3.0,The bottom guys a little weird but very pretty
3.0,"These are fine overall, but the biggest hoops do not snap shut. They won’t stay closed, so they’re honestly pretty much unwearable. I’ve tried bending the post but there’s no notch to catch it so they won’t stay in your ears. The others are fine, and I wear them. The dangly ones tarnished really quickly and leave residue on my ears. Like another reviewer said, you get what you pay for"
3.0,"The gems are nice and the right size but the shaft is too long for ears, unless you have really fat ears. And they seems to be 18g which makes the threads on the head too small for my 16g posts."
3.0,It does advertise “slim fit” and it certainly is. I ordered a size up and it is still tight but stretchable and wearable. It is a nice looking shirt. Ordered a Large.
3.0,Beautiful blue birds too large and heavy
3.0,"I want to love them because they're so close to the Victoria's Secret panties I love. But they're just not quite right. I'm 5'7, 135 lbs, usually a size 6. The waist band is absolutely perfect. Stretchy and smooth, I love it. They also come to just the right height. But the part that covers all your bits is just a little bit too wide, making them go way into the crease of your leg (luckily they're so stretchy it doesn't dig in) and lay kind of loose against my skin in both the front and back. It's not unwearable, I easily decided to keep them since the price was so good, but I can't help but notice the slightly bunched up lace when I'm used to the Victoria's Secret ones.<br /><br />The picture shows Victoria's Secret panties on top of these, so you can see how much wider the front of these are."
3.0,The ones that did light were very bright but a quarter of them didn't light up and the others dimmed very quickly after 5 mins of being on
3.0,"In my experience, the sizes run small. Need to order a size up."
3.0,Small even for a two year old's head and will only stay on if I pin it
3.0,"I love the color, the multiple pockets, the design, but DANG it's heavy. Empty it's heavy. By the time I put all my stuff in it, it was almost too heavy for my shoulder. I love the purse but don't take it anywhere that I'll be carrying it for any length of time."
3.0,It's meh..but it does it's job.
3.0,"I like that it's lightweight.  Love the pattern.  Thing is I ordered an XL, the bottoms fit great.  Unfortunately, the top portion does not come close to covering my chest."
3.0,"I purchased this pendant to hold pills that I take most days.  And although most of those pills are small, even the smallest wouldn't fit in the pendant."
3.0,"The cups are small and the underwire is somewhat useless but it’s absolutely still wearable in the bedroom. I forgot to return it in time, but I’m glad its still usable even if I can’t wear it out.  I’d maybe think of going up a cup or band size in this one though."
3.0,Didn't have a slot to switch the SILENT button but overall great
3.0,Material is too thin. Other than that fit my husband perfect.
3.0,"Made really well, nothing has come apart. It is very heavy! It does pull down which does become uncomfortable. Perfect for a day in a mid drift or bathing suit, but not for long term wear."
3.0,Disappointed in the fit of the top. The collar doesn't dip low enough. I'll have to cut it lower or find another top.  Shorts fit fine but the color is a bright orange an material is shinier than expected.
3.0,Cute pair of shoes but ran big
3.0,"The shoelaces were very cute but we just weren’t able to use them on my daughters shoes. Her shoes were a size toddler-11 keds and the lace points did not fit through the lace holes. I will find use for them on another pair, most likely mine."
3.0,I bought this as a gift so I’m unsure of the fit however the quality is nice. The color was a little bit more blue when it was black and the writing was a little bit more yellow than expected
3.0,It fit a bit too large on me so it didn't look flattering on me. It is a bit see through as well. I'd say it's a good shirt if you can get the right size.
3.0,"My kid's favorite pajamas. He especially enjoys pointing out the characters and is always surprised to see Elmo and his friend on his sleeves and pants. However, after a wash and dry, they shrunk up pretty well.  Perhaps try sizing up."
3.0,"I am a size 14/16 and this was very snug around the hips and chest- much more so than other similar dresses I bought at the same time. Otherwise I like the pattern and it washes well, but to the back of the closet it goes."
3.0,"Quality, etc. is fine, but weren't particularly flattering on me.  Will return."
3.0,The designs were nice and look like the photo. My issue was with quality as I had issues with all of them and the threading for both sides. The bee has small burs on it that dig into my ear a bit. The flower is much bigger than I anticipated and I'm honestly not sure where you would use it because its too heavy for cartilage and too big for inner ear wear. For the price I'm not overly disappointed but I was hoping for better.
3.0,The only reason I am giving this a 3 star is because I ended up with several that were the exact same color
3.0,"Nice swimsuit, decent quality. Runs a little small."
3.0,"Cute sweater, runs a little big, colors were a little off."
3.0,el color es diferente
3.0,"Optics weren't that great, but customer service was."
3.0,"light weight socks, good for summer?"
3.0,Small in the bust
3.0,"I like the shirt. I will ware the shirt. It took a long long time to be delivered. It is coming from China. . The quality is mediocre, but the price is definitely right. So what's the old adage? You get what . . . .. I'm satisfied"
3.0,"The good news is the fabric is soft and velvety like expected. The pants seem well made. The bad news is everything else. Size small was too small even though according to the chart, that was my size. I’ve ordered medium pjs in the past and those were too big so I figured a small would do the second time around. But alas, it was very tight in the thighs and calf but loose in the waist and ankle. The color is more of a dirty mustardy khaki color. Not at all like the warm sunshiny Amber I was expecting. I actually thought maybe they had sent the wrong brown color at first!"
3.0,I would not recommend this product because it is very cheaply made. You can see the glue on the bottom and it has a very strong smell that’s just terrible luckily the smell faded a little.  It is pretty but the gold is that very yellow color so make sure that is what you want. It is a pretty accessory overall.
3.0,Quality feels and looks cheap. Will be retuning. Also a bit tight for medium and probably the large will be too big.
3.0,These pants do NOT have a narrow leg. Very baggy and wide in the calf and I'm disappointed. My quest for a true skinny leg SlimSation pant continues...:(
3.0,What you see is exactly what you get. LOVE these hoop earrings. Light weight.
3.0,"It was a really great fit ! The only issue I have is that the print on the lower half is a bit lopsided. The stomach lining on the left leg does not line up correctly (2nd photo). Also, the print around the groin area doesn't line up with each other either (2nd photo). It still looks super cool though, and can't wait to wear it for Halloween."
3.0,Not really my style but they were cute. Just too big for my taste ..
3.0,"To loose/large/long. The pouch is to large, you easily slip out if you do anything but stand still. See pictures attached. The blue is PowerShift the black is gearshift. Power shift has a 6 inch long pouch vs 4.5 inch. Unless you are extremely hung (I'm 8inch) these are to loose the Gearshift fits better. The material on the PowerShift is nice tho it really does feel cooler as it is made with crushed jade..."
3.0,This product runs very very small I got the two x and it's more like a large
3.0,You get exactly what you pay for.  Cheap but fun.
3.0,However receive the garment yet I return the other one because it was too small
3.0,Also the leg of the pants ripped after just one use.
3.0,Beautiful gift! Fast delivery!
3.0,"I ordered this for a “Death to my Youth” photo shoot. I opened it up and it was really pretty. Unfortunately, it made me look like I was flat chested when I’m a full D cup. Then, no matter how tight I tried tighten it, it wouldn’t hold of the stomach area. I had only tried it on for roughly ten minutes and it seemed as tough it’s spines we’re trying to give out. It was a real bummer so I had to order something else."
3.0,"cute dress, way longer than I imagined and the sleeves are a little awkward. It ended up looking like one of the dresses the Mennonite woman down the road wear, my petticoat got lost under the because it’s so long"
3.0,"The size chart for this bathing suit is not accurate at all, but I expected that when I purchased it.  For reference I am 5'3&#34;, 125lbs with a 36C bust.  I bought this swimsuit for the top, can't beat the price!  It fits almost perfect, could've used an XL but that wasn't an option.  The bottom is way too small to be a large, fits like a junior small.  The large swimsuit is more like a size 4-6, NOT a 12-14."
3.0,It isn't long enough for 5'8&#34; and above.
3.0,I love this but cannot wear it.  WAY TO SMALL! 😞  I will use for xmas gift instead.
3.0,There's not much support in the top & bottoms were really small. I bought a 3x & bottoms look like medium.
3.0,Bought these for a color run 5K. It's not super great quality but it worked well for the run and it's cute and fun. Thanks!
3.0,Fits best without socks on
3.0,Rose fell off in the first day
3.0,It's ok but not great!
3.0,"Things I like: the fabric is good quality and lined. The color is accurate to the product photos. I think it’s true to size. I’m 5’7 and it’s not overly short.<br /><br />Things I dislike: the sleeves are loose. The padding is awkward, but most padding is and it’s removable. It comes up very high on the hip. It’s pretty cheeky in the back, definitely more than the model photos show.<br /><br />Overall, it’s well made and could be flattering for some, but not for me."
3.0,"So I like this mask, but a few complaints. The picture is pretty blurry, not bad enough that you can't make out what is one the mask but not what I was expecting. The mask is also very thick."
3.0,"The fabric is cloth, more like a T-shirt, but the jacket is light and very cute- the arms are loose and a little big, but definitely long enough.<br />The jacket itself is a little short, but the lines fall nicely."
3.0,Wayyyy too short for me
3.0,Wish they made an XL
3.0,Runs big and fits lose. Not worth the money
3.0,"Really hard to get in, discolored really quickly."
3.0,These really wont that good. For lack of a better way to put it the material felt more like panty material. It was thin. I ended up throwing them away. I should have returned them.
3.0,"I love these little sandals and so does my toddler! Unfortunately,  they do not last very long. I purchased the pink ones as well, and they also fell apart pretty quick.  I would say they lasted about 3 or 4 weeks before the bottoms started to literally fall apart. I read that in other reviews but bought them anyway.... good thing summer is almost over!"
3.0,No size for a medium  build
3.0,not sure exactly what it's made of.  lots of flaking of the silver coating but feels substantial in weight
3.0,Super cute but even though I ordered a size up it was too small on the top<br />There’s no stretch to it so my arms can’t fit inside
3.0,"Didn’t care for the fit, boxy and too tight. Not TTS. Returned."
3.0,"Bought this for my 3 year old son, it was still to big and ended up never using them."
3.0,My 5 year old loves this for dress up and it fits well but she says the fabric is scratchy so it is not worn for very long. Good for dress up. Bad for dance/ballet.
3.0,beautiful gown runs about 3 sizes small. all my bridesmaids ordered them. love them but nobody's fit quite as expected. we have had to do some reading gowns and ordered 2 more
3.0,I was disappointed in the fabric. Its hard to tell what it will really be like from a picture. Also found that the part that goes over the shoulder stuck out a lot when I first received it but once I washed the sweater it doesn't do that any more.
3.0,"This band is less flexible than the other one I bought some time ago which was yellow.  On my yellow one, the little tab that the band goes into to hold it down broke so I bought this purple one.  I ended up using my old yellow one again but just using the little tab off the purple one.  I don't like this band nearly as much, too stiff and not as soft rubber."
3.0,"The masks are adorable.  However, I couldn't use them.  Too small for my round face.  Too bad.  I gave them to my 10-year niece. She loves them."
3.0,The sunglasses look great but not a perfect fit. Also very fragile and very loose fitting.
3.0,The pattern on band does not match the advertised design.  It is off a bit
3.0,"Good headband, just not what I expected. It tapers in the back I wanted a wide headband all the way around, wide front and back this is only wide in the front and underside has a logo on it. If you want to put your child's name/#/whatever you only have a small area in front."
3.0,"Runs small.  Got as a gift, she said it was very tight in the arms.  She liked the tshirt type material and said its light."
3.0,Still have these two years later but the jewels have fallen off many of them.
3.0,"Ordered Men's 9, which is EU 43. Yet when I look at the order, it says Men's 44 - which is US Mens 10.5. They're far too big. Really frustrating."
3.0,Just okay the top eventually gave out and the socks easily fell off as our toddler moved about. They worked okay for a while though and were a good deal for the price.
3.0,"I have worn these 4-5 times and I love them, but a side stone already fell out :)"
3.0,This was not very flattering but super comfortable if you don’t care about how you look!
3.0,"Good enough for a Halloween Costume. I normally wear an XXL, but this was definitely a big XXL."
3.0,"These are really cute! But, they shed! They constantly leave little bits of stuff everywhere. Wanted to love these. 😪"
3.0,Much smaller than advertised. Unable to tell it has a reindeer in the center without getting close. Nicely made and very shiney though.
3.0,It's tight but warm.
3.0,"When I first got it, it looked more like plastic than leather (guess that's what you get for the cheap price), but after a few days of wearing it, I grew to like it more! Definitely worth buying."
3.0,"I love the print of this dress and the cloth was absolutely very soft. The print is really nice and the colors are exactly the same as the picture. It is easy to wash and dry but do not wring it otherwise it will have some wrinkles (I hand wash sometimes.) The cloth is so soft, it will definitely define a body's curve. It could be flattering when one has really nice figure. The sizing is quite off on the armpit area. I wear a small, the arms and body was ok but the armpit was bigger than necessary and therefore it makes me a little uncomfortable."
3.0,"While I love the size and look of this charm, every time I glance at my Pandora it's upside down, with the unexciting 'sole' of the shoe facing out. Thus, not exactly well designed..."
3.0,"It is a pretty style but quality of material was not as expected. I tried to return it but it was not an easy process so I canceled return and just as expected material damaged with one wear and wash. Will when buy from this seller, I buy a lot on Amazon and expect easy returns when I am not satisfied with items bought."
3.0,"The fabric is nice and thick, and I love the cuffed look of the sleeves, but they didn't properly create a T-shirt neck, just sewed a loop of T-shirt fabric in a circle around the opening. I doesn't lie flat and it looks cheap and tacky.<br /><br />The design is thick, but it's soft, so that part doesn't bother me the way it does some people. I just don't understand why they didn't make the neckline properly - the quality of the garment would have gone up exponentially."
3.0,"I ordered similar socks previously, but from these are smaller, and not very comfortable.  I would say they fit a US womens shoe size size 4 to 7 comfortably.  Any larger size will be very tight."
3.0,so bigi have to wait for 5 years to wear.
3.0,"This size has a very long torso, but still snug and very hard to get on.  The 12 was a better torso length but too small...it's a nice suit, but it's not a suit I want to spend the day it...the tankini is much more comfortable."
3.0,"This is a cute top, but not great quality.  It is cut very short and the sleeve material is rather scratchy."
3.0,"Really cute, but unfortunately too small. 😞"
3.0,"I expected it to run small, but it still was a bitter smaller than expected.<br />I'd say the XXL  is between a 16-18 true fit. It's really cute."
3.0,Wallet is quite large with cards and currency within it.
3.0,I bought this for NYE but didn't end up wearing it due to the fabric. The fabric reminds me of a Halloween costume- stretchy and not put together well. Looks like I'll be a witch this year for Halloween :)
3.0,"I am 5'6&#34; 170lbs, 38B. The top was too small  for me in the bust. Seemed to be made well for the price. This tank would be good for a skinny chick. It's also short. It ends at waist line."
3.0,Quick delivery but didn't fit. Need to return item!
3.0,Elastic cuff was too tight for wearing all day.  Put too much indentation in leg.
3.0,"This shirt to start off is very see through not to mention your can see side boob , you can't wear this if you have boobs bigger then a B and it's really short , I mean I gave it 3 stars bc it was only 5 bucks ."
3.0,"The blouse is adorable and I love the rise color. I actually ordered 2. One in my typical size and this one, 3 sizes up. I have my very small sister the first one, she is 3 or so sizes smaller than me. This one fits."
3.0,"It's my fault for not reading the comments, but the image looks different then in person. It's of the rubbery material not a hard plastic and it was slightly torn.(pictures later) the size is best for a child or an adult with a smaller head as well."
3.0,"My dress has two strings attached to the inside on either side , two strings on the attached to the outside on each hip and two more strings on each end of the dress.<br /><br />HOW DO I TIE THIS ON?<br />I LOVE THE DRESS BUT WOULD LOVE IT MORE IF I KNEW HOW TO WEAR IT PROPERLY."
3.0,Nice style but the leather was stiff. I returned them.
3.0,The material is different than expected
3.0,Really dig the style but one of the buttons broke early on. Easy fix but still annoying.
3.0,I was disappointed in the quality of the watch band.  The leather guard that holds the band against the wrist broke the first time.
3.0,"It's a beautiful dress, but there was too much material at the top which made it look really baggy on me.  I had to return it."
3.0,"Based on description and picture, I was expecting something quite different than what I received. Ordered black but color was faded as if the color had been washed out and overall cheap look to the material. Only keeping because I like the fit. I would not purchase again."
3.0,"Nice set, not really high quality fabric as I think you are paying more for the license than the fabric. My nephew loved them though and that is what mattered!"
3.0,Not a fan of this dress. The sizing seems to run super large so I will have to tailor it. But I only paid 6$ for it and that's not a big loss. Just be careful of the sizing.
3.0,I don't know if I went up 1 size too big but it  seems to fit kinda loose around the chest and snug around the waist.
3.0,"Great quality, i don’t know how it fits because I ordered a 3T and received a 6-9 months and had to return the outfit."
3.0,Nice colors but really really sheer!
3.0,Smaller then expected. Love the earrings.
3.0,These look cute. Except one came darker than the other. They were too big for my head and bc they are heavy they just kept falling forward. But they were cute
3.0,&#34;Buckle&#34; broke in less than 3 months
3.0,It closes up too easily and your items fall out if you are using an open box.
3.0,Love the print but it's short! It is definitely not a shawl but more of a scarf. You get what you pay for. But am still pleased with my purchase.
3.0,"So cute but too small. I'm always an 8 but not in these, apparently."
3.0,Did not hold up to baggage handlers
3.0,Used sizing chart to select size and they were WAY too small. Couldn’t get past my thighs to see if they fit at the waist!
3.0,"Ordinarily, I give products I have to return a lower score, but these seem to be a good quality product, it just didn't fit. I am a women's size 9 M US and these were WAY too small. I could barely get one on, didn't even bother with the other. I do have athletic calves, but they aren't abnormally large. My advice is to order up if you are my size."
3.0,"This dress is very light and summery.  The material is see-through, but it has a green slip. It has an interesting design, the way it's cut, but the collar is little bit too low where sometimes, if you're wearing a bra, the straps peek through (which I'm not fond of). The length works for me since I'm only five feet tall; therefore, it's not too short. As far as the size, I really can't say if it's true to size since I was sent the wrong size."
3.0,"Nice too but runs,very small."
3.0,Nice jacket. Felt really nice but thin. Runs extremely small. I’m a a small/medium and the medium fit like an extra small.
3.0,the fit was good except around the neck.The neck it just a tad choking for me. I don't like things too close around my neck area.
3.0,"Out of the package they are comfy, but don't machine wash or dry! They have pads inside the cups that curl up and ruin the smooth look."
3.0,Okay craftsmanship.  Capes are wonky and the masks are really uncomfortable for my 3 and 5 year olds. They loved the bracelets which is why I gave it 3 stars.
3.0,I got the dress for my engagement pictures that I took in a sunflower field. I must say the the dress was perfect for the theme of the shoot and came out beautiful in the photos but i would not recommend the dress to someone that has large Brest or butt. I do not consider myself someone with large boobies and I had to keep adjusting the dress top because it felt like my boobies where going to come out. The under layer of the dress was also very short so when bending over my butt would come out thankfully the long see-throw layer covered it. I would buy the dress with time to find another outfit just in case it does not fit perfect.
3.0,Top is a little large around the neck when only need 2x size for hips.
3.0,"I returned it because the length was too long and I don't like it when my bottom cuffs drag on the ground. Just a warning that the material feels like a swim suit. I felt that wearing it around during the summer would make me too warm, since the material isn't as breathable. I'll probably look for the same style somewhere else."
3.0,Cheap material for the price. Easily  bent :(
3.0,It's OK -- it was pretty big and the fabric was super heavy (causing it to stretch). There was a hole where the tag was attached.
3.0,Thin material - looks good just was too small but I felt like I would be in between a medium and a large
3.0,too tight around the rib cage area
3.0,"I love the variety in this purchase. All stockings are good except the big fishnet one. It ripped while I was putting it on or maybe even before. Other than that they fit great,"
3.0,"It is beautiful BUT they run super small. I was disappointed that it did not fit. I wear x-tra large and that's what I ordered, do not order if you wear that size."
3.0,I'm 5'4 140 and this seemed longer on me than the model. Also it is a lot thicker material . The pic looks more see through than when I put it on
3.0,You get what you pay for. Runs small and is not as flowy as pic. Pretty though.
3.0,"Thicker than I would like, but not bad."
3.0,The product quality is great but the sizing is off. I purchased and had to exchange the XL for a XXL. Both were very long and the XL could not be zipped up. The zipper feels cheap but the look and quality of the fabric is much better. Overall I am satisfied
3.0,The belt looks good but it is NOT leather...it's plastic.
3.0,Zipper to main compartment did not last long.  After about a month it stopped zipping so I went back to an old purse that I had.
3.0,"The sizple was accurate, the color is much lighter than picture. (I ordered the purple) But I was very disappointed in the fabric, to me it looks cheap and &#34;old ladyish&#34; Like something I would have bought at Wal-Mart."
3.0,Love the fit of the dress but it's really too short for my likings . Needs leggings or something unless you are comfortable showing that much leg
3.0,"The pattern was beautiful, but I didn't like the look of the collar. My husband wanted something more fitted,  and this dress was quite full causing me to have added volume above and below my waist. Wasn't a look I was hoping for, so I sent the dress back. I might of considered keeping the dress if it had a better looking collar....that was my number I peeve."
3.0,The side straps are elastic and don't secure the cards in.  There's no fail safe so cards can easily fall out.  It's also not a great front pocket wallet since it's metal and pokes you when you sit down.
3.0,It's a really great inexpensive set.
3.0,"Fit bigger than expected (despite being large busted) and hangs a bit baggy at the back area. Material is thin so a dark bra is a no-no. Hard to get the wrinkles out, you can tell the material is cheaper but I'm not surprised for the price. Decent enough where I will keep it, but I wouldn't order again in another color."
3.0,"Could fit tighter. Not really high compression. The claim of up to 5” waist reduction is ridiculous. I may half squeezed out 1/2” reduction at most,  with these."
3.0,"Meh, one pair game with a seam in the crochet unsewen. Something good is that they are long, my husband is very tall and these fit well. Once we got them stitched up."
3.0,Love the dress but it was to tight in the chest. I usually where a medium to large and I ordered a large.
3.0,"Made for people with wider heads. I have a small, narrow head/face shape and the sides poke out weirdly. Even so, I dig the mask and use it when cycling in the cold. Can get a little hot and difficult to breathe in, but a quick pull down, gasp, and replace will do the trick."
3.0,My boys liked these but they broke off the chain so fast they were a waste of money
3.0,"A pretty bracelet, but a little stiff for me."
3.0,I ordered what the size chart said and it was a bit too tight. The fabric just didn’t feel very nice either
3.0,"Nice gloves but size runs BIG. Kept falling off my 3 year old's hands. She usually wears 4T, so I bought the gloves that were for 2-3 year olds. Will try again next year I guess."
3.0,I could have done the same thing with a printable iron on and a long sleeved shirt<br />I probably will next time
3.0,"just as advertised - very light - bought for my son, who has no body fat to give him an extra layer under his ski pants - may not be enough, but we will see.  I wear silk as a layer under mine and it works great.  can also wear under any pants."
3.0,So nice really cute bangle.  Its kinda small but it works.  The colors are beautiful.  and it does not snag on my clothing.  I ordered 2 additional ones for my mom/sis
3.0,"The bag is very shiny, no weird smells and received as promised. Can fit my 9.7 inch iPad but have to reorganize contents because the bag material isn't flexible, very little give. For an everyday bag I find it to be inconvenient to my needs.<br /><br />Loved the zippers on the outside. Great for a young girl or woman who doesn't carry too much with her. Find it was awkward to hold from the top."
3.0,"Looks nice on model, terrible on me. I bought my size but this top is way too big. size chart is not helpful. I always check the size chart, reviews and comments before I buy anything online. For this top it did not help."
3.0,"Too short to be worn alone, but cute with leggings. I'll still wear it for sure.  Fits nicely everywhere else."
3.0,"I ordered a size larger, should have ordered two sizes larger."
3.0,"The dress is okay, doesn’t look a whole lot like the picture. For 1, it’s not a v neck. It’s definitely a u neck. And the cut is very high. Like at my collarbones, which I really don’t like. I had to elongate the straps so it fit correctly.  The fabric is comfortable. Nice and breathable. The pockets are kind of bulky so there’s weird extra material around that part, makes my hips look huge. I’m 5’8”, 150 lbs, I ordered an XL because I like these dressed kind of loose. I also have a problem with them being too short. Despite the fact that I ordered an XL, it was still too short before I elongated the straps. I’ve had these kinds of maxi dresses before and this one was just meh. It’ll be fine for around the house, but I don’t love it."
3.0,"When I received this, the package said it was leather. It is not, it is the metal mesh.. The package also said it was for smart watches. That may be, but I was able to put it on a regular watch. Seems ok, like it will last. Came with a tiny screw driver, that was helpful."
3.0,Though the quality of the hat is fine. I am very disappointed with the color! I was supposed to be black! Its NOT black! Its grey! At the most you could call it heathered black! I have no need for a grey hat and now have to go by another one. I wont be returning it due to the COVID situation but now have to go spend more money to find an actually black one!
3.0,"This is nice. However, the clear doesn't sparkle much. I wish I would have bought the pink after reading those reviews."
3.0,These run too large.  I got a 3/4 for my size 4 toddler and they were more like a size 5.  They are also hard for a toddler to walk in.
3.0,"The hat is very beautiful but it fell with the wind, I was not able to use it on the sailboat ; it can be use indoor or without heavy wind outside"
3.0,Muy bonita pero la pedí en size 42 mm y me la enviaron 38
3.0,Is beautiful but no fit for my is painful in back part!!
3.0,I had on work watch just returned
3.0,If you go this route definitely go with some type of glue. Several have fallen out for me. Luckily I noticed and was able to pick them up to put back in.
3.0,"So positives... it came fast, it fits (I normally wear a medium I ordered the xl). Cons... the slit is very high it's not super flowy it almost looks like it tapers and the colors are blue not brown."
3.0,These headbands are okay.  I gave them a 3 star because they did not stay in place during my workout.  I had to keep pulling it back into place.  If you are not going to use them to workout or do a lot of movement... I would recommend them.
3.0,"Love the colors,  There is one problem the bands are too long for my wrist, when I wear them they kink I got a cut them at the end  .😢"
3.0,Returning due to fits a little odd in the top
3.0,My 8 year old wears a size 8/10 (medium) and this was almost to small. He is tall and lanky. I went off the size chart provided and reviews. Also it's really thin and see through in places. Not up to quality for what I paid.
3.0,These are very long and big.  I wore them with a Halloween costume.  One of the feathers came slightly bent.  The quality of the metal and piece is okay.
3.0,You get what you pay for. Cheaply made. Very low quality. Not recommended.
3.0,"This is a sharp looking black top, that you can wear with a skirt, jeans, or dress slacks.  I wish the material was more of a stretchy blend of cotton/spandex.  I am going to keep this top because I do like it, however, the length should be longer.  The length seems like it is a petite<br />persons size.  The decal looks very nice.  I wear a size (8) blouse, and so I ordered an extra - large, and that worked out for me.  Order up<br />if you want a looser fit."
3.0,Fit was smaller than expected and inconsistent with similar items.
3.0,Very tight... Didn't fit right on my nose
3.0,These are super cute but the color and design fade quickly with washing (in a garment bag)
3.0,I order an extra large but a large or even a medium might have been a better fit. The material is very stretchy and the material is very soft. The butt area has started to fade after 2 washing.
3.0,"I didn't pay attention to the fact that these were men's sized socks.  Whoops!  They looked like women's socks, so I assumed they would fit my teenage niece, but I was wrong.  They were much too big!  I could have worn them since I have giant lady hobbit feet that run in a &#34;dainty&#34; size 11.5 women's/10 men's, but my shoe size 7 niece would have been drowning in them.  I would say women's size 8 would be a starting point for these socks if you want them to fit well normally."
3.0,Length of shoe is fine but width is way to narrow especially if you’re on your feet all day and they swell even slightly. Not wide enough.
3.0,Cute and fits well BUT the ball comes off every 1-2 days usually while eating. Not sure if thread is too short or if not tight enough.
3.0,Did not light up even though title said it had 12 LED lights.
3.0,so very sad this did not work i have 2 short sleeved shirts of the same size that fit great. however the upper arms of the sleeves are just to snug for me. I normally wear a 1x but chose a 2x because this is made in china and tend to run small. it fit beautifully EXPECT for the sleeves. if the sleeves were just a little bigger I would buy it again
3.0,They were more pink than red
3.0,"Looks nice. Tight on my adult head. My four year old won't wear it because ""it's itchy."""
3.0,"It's a nice material, and the teen my wife ended up giving this to really likes it. If you wear a large, order an x-large, because it will be too small."
3.0,"I purchased this item for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas. It arrived a few days after Christmas, which is understandable since pretty much all mail was running late due to Covid, not the seller’s fault. However, when my daughter tried on her Large sized hoodie, it was so tight. The true size of the hoodie ran between a Small and Medium. It’s always an inconvenience to ship items back, so we’re just going to keep it and regift it to someone else that’s way smaller and can fit into it."
3.0,"One strap is too long than the other one and the elastic is old, I love the pattern of the dress ! And the fabric is good. The other dress that I ordered from the same company the fabric was not as nice and it was very cheap!"
3.0,"I would recommend buying at least one size up- I wear a 30 in jeans and these are very snug to say the least. These have no stretch whatsoever. The waistband stretches about a quarter of an inch. They are very restrictive. On the plus side, they do look really good and are very comfortable once you squeeze into them."
3.0,To small medium size is like xs
3.0,Cheap looking.  Not impressed at all.
3.0,"Shirt doesn’t really have as much fabric as advertised in the picture. Especially if you have even the slightest bit of cleavage. Definitely for the smaller chested. And if you’re going to wear this prolly use some really good tape or a good push up for the look. I thought this was gonna be really cute, it fit me. But not enough fabric was available for the boob area, and to get a nice bow."
3.0,"This shirt is extremely comfortable! I got the pink color and it is similar to the color in the picture but the shirt is actually shorter in the front and longer in the back. I will definitely wear this shirt still and with the buttons it's great for nursing, but it is not the style I thought it was."
3.0,Cut in half and carry my googles and n95 mask in
3.0,"Purchased as a alternative to face masks.  If you have a large neck, it does feel tight.  It does breathe better than a cloth mask but doesn't provide much protection.  You can easily blow out a candle with this on.  Still, others will still appreciate that you are wearing something."
3.0,"It was super cheap, so I wasn't expecting much, but it is worth the $3 I paid for it."
3.0,"I like the color and the fabric feels thick. I'm 5'6"" 130lbs, 36b and ordered a medium. It's a bit too big. It's not as shapely as the pictures show. Not soft or particularly cozy. It's OK. I'd work well for anyone up to about 6 months pregnant imo."
3.0,Small but I hope to between use to them
3.0,The lace part of the dress is a darker mismatched shade compared to the velvet.  It makes it look really cheap and that is what is wrong with it.  I guess it is ok for running around town if you want to look a bit dressed up shopping.  Not a dress to wear for a special occasion if you want to look classy.  I got a medium and the fit is fine if your normal size is an 8/10 dress as it has stretch.
3.0,"The swimsuit is made really well, but for a large size (2x), I would think the bust would be big enough. It wasn’t. The torso is also uncomfortably long so ordering the next size wouldn’t really help. Waited a really long time for it to come as well so I was disappointed in it overall. Returned it."
3.0,Fabric had a scratchy feel ilon the inside of the fabric.
3.0,Really pretty but poor quality fabric. I don’t believe it will last nicely for more than 3 washes. Sizing is ok.<br />Would not recommend.
3.0,Like color and material..sleeves short
3.0,"My friend asked me to order these for her when I was ordering other things. I wasn't too sure about these stockings because many of the reviews talked about how they don't stay up. My friend wanted to try them anyway. Yep, same thing. She used rubber bands to hold them up, but that sounds uncomfortable to me. The design is really cute, but they are quite thin."
3.0,"The bottom plate fell off.. you can't see he plate in this photo but imagine being able to put the skull on your finger like a finger puppet. Regardless, it still looks awesome."
3.0,The photo of a woman wearing these is very misleading. These are very small! Look at the photo of the earring held up to the ruler - that is accurate.
3.0,Shoulders were too tight. Arms sleeves felt a little short. The pants were very stretchy but we’re just a tad bit too long for me.
3.0,It wasn't what I expected to be. I thought the bells were going to be loud but it barely made a noise!!
3.0,"Even though I ordered an XL, this skirt runs very small and not true to size. I had to return it even though loved the style and pattern."
3.0,Product was a little bit small. Brought it for my daughter but didn't waste money will give it to my niece.
3.0,Not horribly flattering. I felt like i was just wearing a bunched up blanket. The slit isn't obvious either. I returned this item and was kindly refunded immediately
3.0,when you buy these - do not expect them to all work at all - I needed 48 of them for kids - and ordered 80 of them and good thing I did b/c out of the 80 of them - 60 worked...just needed tthem - but just hope the others at least last an hour b/c I only have 12 left that work to replace! they are easy prize - but you pay for what you get!
3.0,"This hat is colorful and vibrant, but very small compared to my other hats."
3.0,I love the style of the shoe. good with gothic and steampunk clothing. gives a shorter person a lot more height. nice shoe.
3.0,"I liked it well enough but my daughter nixed it.<br />Sadly, I returned"
3.0,"These were a bit disappointing for me.  I do love that all the little cubes are consolidated into one bag that's about the size of a make-up bag. The varying sizes are a nice option depending on how long your trip is. The quality is ok for the price but I'm not sure it will stand-up long term, which is the reason for the 3-star rating. This is listed as a toiletry set but I wasn't confident in the bag durability to place liquids in them. I felt that if something opened or broke, it wouldn't stay in the bag. I used these more to separate non-liquids and lingerie. I purchased the cream with little anchors and the coloring wasn't what I was hoping for. It comes as a bit dingy and old looking. I wish I would have purchased an alternate color. If you're looking for a basic travel kit, this is definitely worth a try."
3.0,Buy one size up.. it's small
3.0,My 10yo complained the strap hurt her. I am returning them. Looked cute and well made.
3.0,The bracelet broke after about 2 weeks but i have just used the beads in other jewelry. Clasp on the necklace opens up easy but i just closed it with plyers and its fine.
3.0,"the bag was good quality and nice size, just wished the shoulder trap was longer to be used as a crossbody bag."
3.0,Theyre cheap looking. I ended up giving them to my daughter that's 6. She's pleased with it.
3.0,Nice looking shirt just very small!!
3.0,The shirt is made of a really comfortable material and if sixed correctly I'm sure this would be a very good and comfortable shirt. Just order 1 size bigger then you need.
3.0,"Great item for the price.  Very flimsy, but for $30 and a need for a quick fix, definitely did the job!"
3.0,"very cheaply made. although it is beautiful, it comes apart and I have to keep repairing it."
3.0,"I have the same type but from another company. These run small. I ordered a Med, and they were too small. Size up if you plan on buying from this company. Had to return."
3.0,It's cool but not as well polarized as expected. It'll block sun rays a little bit but at as much as some other glasses I've had.
3.0,"I am a true size 11, but these were too big."
3.0,Pros: thick material but lightweight<br />Cons: looks very cheap. Pockets folds are too high in the back
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:18b3d3dc8bde821f4dad55d82fd1d52f]] All the reviews said it was “too small to hold a ring” and I assumed the meant the space inside the moon was too small for their ring to slide through or their ring was too thick. I was wrong. The moon itself is too small or not wide enough to hold rings. Rings have no problem getting onto the necklace. STAYING on the necklace is the issue. The moon is so small that any movement causes the ring to slide off the moon. If the moon was larger rings would stay on top where they’re supposed to, but with as small as it is, they slide off and would likely get lost. The moon is about the same width as a size 8 or 8.5 ring. I’ll attach a picture of a size 8 silicone ring on the necklace for reference. The video, I barely tap the ring and it falls. Any movement at all while wearing the necklace with a ring and you’d lose it. I’ll wear this as a necklace but I won’t trust it with a ring on it."
3.0,"Leather was really well made good quality,yet the zipper handle was already rusty when i received it, i just covered it with clear nail polish. Thats so far the very downside of this product."
3.0,This shirt is really cute and appears to be well made.  The only complaint I have is that it is not as loose and flowy as I had hoped.  I read other reviews and purchased a large thinking it would be a bit over sized.  Still really cute and would recommend.
3.0,"Mask was ok, but broke very easily."
3.0,Don't know how to open the locket!
3.0,This is a good product if you only need it for 1 use. The whole thing broke after 1 use.
3.0,The skirt is SO CUTE but it’s way too small. I usually wear a 14 and I even ordered up and got the XL and I couldn’t get it past my thighs.
3.0,"Tooled leather did not look as nice as the one in photo for this, but it was leather and fit nicely for my Apple watch."
3.0,I almost loved this outfit but ultimately it did not work for me. I am 5’5 and 190 lbs. I usually wear a size L but ordered a size up (XL) after reading the reviews. The pants fit but I must admit the first thing I thought about was the possibility of the pants ripping due them being so thin. The jacket was ok but was too small in the chest area. This was strange because the jacket was really roomy in the arms and I don’t have a large chest size...it made for a slightly awkward fit.
3.0,"This dress is sooo cute and well made, however if you are “blessed in the chest” this probably isn’t the right dress for you.  It was super tight on my chest and arms so will be returning."
3.0,Size was for ages 4 to 10
3.0,Too small for a man's head. Works good for a child.
3.0,Really cute but had to order really big size..I ordered like a 3x..fits like American med.
3.0,The length is great. The material is great for summer. The print is as pictured. The cut of the top is odd. It’s hard to tell the front from the back and the top is simultaneously too big and small in different places. I recommend trying it with t-shirt bra- that could help with the shape and the cut of the top.
3.0,Not near as dark in colors as the photo... pretty washed out! Dont like it.
3.0,"These were cute. I bought 2 and only 1 Stone was missing. Only problem, these were meant for children’s tiny wrists and since I’m not 7 years old they were way too tight for me."
3.0,Waistband not as snug. Panties do not fit as nice.
3.0,these gripper socks shrunk a great deal with the first wash . i wouldn’t order them again.
3.0,I liked how they fit but the material is a real nipple rubber.
3.0,To small. Fabric is cheap. You get what you pay for.
3.0,Pretty but looks a little too cheap
3.0,"Yeah, it is shiny...and I can't wear it till it gets colder....non breathable fabric, which i thought I was getting a summer one....this is for winter and shiny occasions"
3.0,If you have big boobs wouldn't advise unless purchasing.
3.0,It’s tiny. It was ok in my chest area but anything below that was like 3 sizes too small.
3.0,Cute on the model but the V-neck was too high and small - strange cut. You can’t see very well in this photo because the model’s hair is covering the collar.
3.0,"Cute necklace, should be fine for my use, but much smaller than I thought it was supposed to be. To be fair they did give the measurements, but only in the metric system. If you don’t really know the metric system you have to look up the measurements that they supply. It would help if they put it next to a coin like some sellers do, to give a reference to the size."
3.0,"The quality was ok, but not too excited about it."
3.0,Pros:<br />Easy to read digital time and date during the day<br />Comfortable<br />Easy to Set Time<br />Druable (worked on my car and did not scratch the face one bit)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Looks small (i have small wrists/hands too)<br />Light only lights left corner-barley read the minutes section at night.<br /><br />Unknowns:<br />Not sure how water resistant it is....<br /><br />Result: I don't expect it to last long. I expect to lose this or break it while swimming in the ocean. I will try and find a bigger faced didgtal watch with a really nice light up for night time next time.
3.0,Hard to tell time at a moments notice without having to do the math! LOL
3.0,"the top hat was quite small, and it’s really overpriced. it’s not very durable. don’t be expecting great quality."
3.0,This dress is really nice...well made...however...it is a medium size at best not the xl I expected...so ran very small
3.0,"I ordered these expecting them to fit my head even though they didn’t say they are one-fit-all size. But it came as a surprise because it is HUGE on me. I guess it would be beneficial to have a measurement of the height, width measurement in one of the photos"
3.0,"The socks fit my wife who wears a size 8 shoe.  They stayed put in her shoes thanks to the elastic cuff which she didn't find uncomfortable.  They got somewhat ""pilly"" in the wash but still fit.  The washing instructions are confusing.  On the product page it says: ""Machine wash in cold water and Air dry.""  On the product label it's: "" WASH WITH WARM WATER, DO NOT BLEACH, TUMBLE DRY WITH LOW HEAT."""
3.0,"the quality that supposedly shows in the photo is not is!!!  It is thinner and let's say transparent, thin, the XL sleeves seem to be M size"
3.0,Runs extra large. But wrong material to make it work. Sloppy feeling.
3.0,"They are just okay...not super great quality and the silver one I received the hinge is so wiggly it won't clasp to close...they are cute enough, but not worth the money."
3.0,These are actually one of my fav gauges I own. But the size run smaller ! Again the size runs small !
3.0,The sweatshirt material  has almost a sheen to it whereas it is not your typical sweatshirt material.  The pictures do not reflect this.  It does not look of high quality.
3.0,I wish it held more cards. other than that it works.
3.0,"I used to have an old keffiyeh that was of better quality construction. When I ordered this one, the &#34;original&#34; from the last remaining keffiyeh factory in Palestine, i was hoping for the same quality as my old one.  This one looks good, but the tassles around the edge feel/look a bit cheap."
3.0,The material pilled upon first use. They do stay on your foot.
3.0,"Manga muy estrecha de la blusa , soy M y me tocó Xl y aún sigue estrecha"
3.0,It fit perfectly and the material was stretchy. However the cloth in the arms and neck was very itchy. I had to put a shirt under it. I was able to get through Halloween with it. For the price it was perfect.
3.0,I bought these to carry in my pocket to check the dates of coins when i receive in change. The work fairly well as long as you have sufficient light. The Illuminated version i bought is much more user friendly
3.0,"They are nice, different"
3.0,I'm very sad. I thought the strap that goes over your shoulder would be much longer. I can't do the cross body strap because it's not long. I love the purse itself.
3.0,These run VERY small.  Nice graphics but you may need 2 sizes bigger
3.0,I love the colors on this item..the material wasn't what I expected and the bottom was a size smaller or more then the top..
3.0,"Great looking watch band, but it started wearing off already. I don’t think it will last much longer. I wish it was made better and would last longer. I would pay more for the same style with better quality material."
3.0,All fit good
3.0,Too small for my wide calves. But super cute.
3.0,Bought for my daughter. The size runs small. It still fits her but it’s now an outfit she wears at home and not in public.
3.0,Does not prevent bounce when doing a high impact  workout. It is very comfortable and i love the color
3.0,"This outfit is precious, but the reason I gave it three stars is: the top was sewn incorrectly. The top was folded strangely when sewn, so the side seam punctured both the front and back of top( in the middle of the top too! ) . It was unwearable. Luckily I’m handy with thread and needle.  I cut the seam, carefully separated the front from the back, and then sewed it back together. I love the outfit but at this point, I pretty much sewed it myself lol. I know it’s hard to describe and I was so mad that I fixed it first without taking pictures of the defect."
3.0,"This tie is decent quality for the price, although it ended up being skinnier that I had anticipated. Overall I don't regret purchasing it, I just wish I would have known that it was a narrow as it is."
3.0,"These were initially I thought very nice gloves.  My main reason to buy them was so that I could keep my hands warm in the morning before I start work when the air can be rather cool and my hands cold as well.  They seemed well made, made in the USA, and very comfortable, despite the fact that they are partly made of wool and can feel scratchy, minimally (this did not bother me).  At any rate, within only a week or two of wearing them, I noticed a hole in what I used as the left-hand glove in between two of the fingers.  Not really a big deal functionally, but still for the price, this should not happen, so I give them 3 stars."
3.0,"I do love this; but it isn’t quite like the picture, j use it as more of a lounge shirt now."
3.0,I even went as far as measuring myself up top to makrw sure this fit. Had to return and reorder the next size up. I had no padding on and there was no way I could fit an actual bra in that dress. Order up a size or two. I hate retuening things😭
3.0,"Fits fine. Very thin socks, don't put a lot of wear and tear on them"
3.0,"The shirt is comfortable, but more fitted and warm than I was expecting. It's also pretty sheer (especially for a black shirt)."
3.0,Very thin fabric. Runs on the small side.
3.0,"Great price, love the removable pad incerts but this is not an active sports bra. I am busty, and walking, elliptical use seems fine for this coverage but I would not jog or jump in in this bra. I will use for walking and lounging."
3.0,It’s a fine product if it fits you. Somehow the design managed to be too short (didn’t reach the front of my ear) and so loose they slid off at the same time. Returned product.
3.0,Dress is really pretty- fitting is good as well but the quality of the fabric is not that good as in after one wash the dress looks like a few years old…. Therefore I gave it 3 stars
3.0,These run about a size small. My so. Says they are comfortable.
3.0,It's alright. It's hard to adjust size but I like the style.
3.0,"The price was very cheap, but the ring is pretty, but too gaudy. A simpler look would be better."
3.0,Fun little outfit. I'm not crazy about how the shorts fit but i love the tank.
3.0,Thank goodness I had another pair of bottoms from another bathing suit. Something is wrong with the one that came with this one. They fall right off. The waist elastic had something wrong. Not streachy at all at the waist. Really should have sent back.
3.0,"The inner liner is great! Good padding and fit well. The outer shorts were smaller than the inner liner though. They barely fit around my thighs. I ordered 2xl shorts but think they were closer to large. Disappointed in that, but the liner works well with a pair of athletic shorts."
3.0,"This coat is cute, but not as flattering as I hoped. It would be perfect if there was some stretchy fabric in the chest and shoulder area. It just feels a little stiff and limited in motion.  It will probably fit better on women with a smaller upper body."
3.0,clips are to hard to adjust...nose area is small
3.0,"The shirt was a strange texture.  It is not tshirt material, but rather a very thin silky material.  Wierd feel."
3.0,My kids never played with them...feels like good money wasted
3.0,These do not stay on the bridge of my nose as goo as Thin optics do
3.0,Nice design but less compartment!
3.0,Faded quickly and the jeans were not stretchy at all.
3.0,It’s kinda cheaply made and didn’t sit straight on my breast area. I wouldn’t buy it again.
3.0,"I purchased these socks for son that plays football, he tends to get shin splints at the beginning of the football season... he tells me the socks are comfortable with great compression,but it didn't prevent him from getting shin splints... I would recommend the socks for circulation and compression but not for prevention of shin splints"
3.0,I really liked it until the metal part broke. So unfortunately it can't be used anymore.
3.0,Not for people with beards... fits like a tube sock and has no taper like others we have tried.. it will ride up or down because of no taper.
3.0,"Comfortable and warm to have on feet when sitting, but unable to walk with them on."
3.0,Really liked this charm a lot . It was alittle bigger than I thought it would be. I still like it on my bracelet of family charms a lot.
3.0,"Good product if only using for a day, like an outdoor event, sport, theme park etc. Do not recommend for everyday day sun protection (if you work outdoor/landscape).  Good Fit.  I guess you get what you pay for"
3.0,I Did not read the description correctly and didn't realize it was a buckled bracelet. Its good if you want something like that but I wish I had seen that.
3.0,"Great price, poor quality."
3.0,"These were very comfortable but not exactly cute. The fit around the ankles is much wider than the image shown. I wanted a pair of cute, loose fitting pants and they fit as expected in the waist and thighs, but I prefer a little more tapering toward the ankle. The color was a brownish-pinkish, and the fabric was a thin, muslin feel."
3.0,Kinda rough
3.0,Work real well
3.0,"very thick not ok at all for front pocket, thank you for easy return"
3.0,"So I bought this for my 10 year old who is 5’3 and 140 In an X-large, it fits snug, very snug, I was hoping to exchange it for the XXL but the price went from 24.99 to 39.99 within 2 days!! So may just return because I’m not paying another 15 dollar because they decide to up the price!  There should be an option of exchange rather than just return and buy again."
3.0,Way to small!! - definitely size up one size at least
3.0,"So the dress looks really cute. The skirt part, however feels a little plasticky (like table cloth), but doubt people will be feeling it. Only other issue is getting it on...over the ""girls"". Once it is on, we are good to go, but the waist has no give. So to the bigger chested, you have to squish those babies down to wiggle in to the dress."
3.0,They fog up.
3.0,"I don’t know how well the pictures will show up online, but only three of the four scarf /T-shirt rings can be used. The fourth ring is covered in a very gritty glitter that wants to snag on clothing rather than slide on it. I mean this glitter is really rough! I wouldn’t trust my T-shirts to it, let alone a silk scarf.<br />The other rings do what they’re supposed to do."
3.0,"I was a little disappointed with the fabric of this dress, I thought it would be more linen looking.  Cute cut"
3.0,this fabric doesnt breath at all-is not soft in any way-the cut of the dress isnt perfect-a little longer in some areas than others but not terribly noticeable-over all fine for the price but quality leaves much to be desired
3.0,Bigger than i expected but they’re nice
3.0,"I really liked this stocking.  I wanted a pink camo and this was perfect.  It's a rather large stocking and the only problem I had was the brand emblem, approx 2x2 leather,  is sewed in well, on the top in the brown ruff and that is where I would like to put a name.  I'm going to have to have a solid patch made and put it over it.  Also the words realtree are in the pink design.  Just be aware."
3.0,I purchased this set for my daughter for a Cheshire Cat costume.  The pink is more of a neon and didn't really match the other items that I purchased for this costume.  In my opinion the ears on the headband are a bit too close together and didn't really look right.  I ended up using the headband but I took the ears off and attached new ears that I hand made.  The tail was a bit too heavy and awkward. It just kept flipping back and forth and then in between her legs with every step my daughter took so she ended up taking it off.
3.0,"The design is really fun and seemed like an absolute must for a country musician as a gift.<br />Unfortunately, the tuning keys are VERY shiny, which compared to the rustic looking head is just odd. You can take the tuning keys out though.<br />Another thing I didn't like is there are engraved words on the tails, which I didn't really see from the picture.<br />Overall still an interesting looking piece and I would still buy it for the price."
3.0,Good value. girls will love it.
3.0,"Purchased M-Blue for my 8(49”)yr old & 10(55”)year old. It’s absorbent(thick), comfortable, great stitching, easy to put on and take off, and fast shipping. I’ve washed it 3 times already w/o any issues(no pilling/shrinkage/fading/bleeding). The medium hits about half way down the calf for my 10 yr old and right above the ankles for my 8yr old. Afterwards, I ordered second one in Large, for my 10yr old because he said the medium was a little to tight to change in. The second one I ordered, came in the exact same size as the medium. It’s so frustrating, because when I ordered the Large, Amazon had said it was the “last one” and now there is no more Large-Blue to order. Err! I’m going to return the second poncho and order a large in a different color. I only picked this brand over the others because this swim poncho color matches our team color. So frustrating.  I hope it was just a mix up.<br /><br />Suggestions:<br />1. Button closure(armpit area) for more privacy in the chest area for ladies.<br />2. A loop for easy hanging.<br />3. Tag-free size labeled for easy distinction."
3.0,"inexpensive item; the clasp is difficult to manage; very thin metal, but didn't expect much more considering the price.  Looks good paired with copper chain.  Overall pleased with item."
3.0,"They look nice , but made poorly very thin material, shoe laces to short. I was offered a refund and because they were the wrong color. Didn't have to send ones I received back.  TY"
3.0,I only wash it twice and it split underarm
3.0,It's okay is what it is... The belt buckle is a bit loose.
3.0,Looks good - ok
3.0,"Runs very small and even using the size chart and reviews it was to short on my y’all 7 year old. But it’s good quality, colors vibrant and will look adorable on a shorter, smaller boy."
3.0,"This is probably perfect for 99% of the population, and I wore the dress and got many complements. However, the slit is a little higher than I am comfortable with at 5'9&#34; tall. Also, it seems to be pilling a bit after two washes."
3.0,"So these pants are awesome. They fit anywhere BUT the waist. I ordered a medium and I'm usually about a small or medium depending on the make. I feel like if I would have ordered a small the legs of them would have been too tight but would have fit the waist. They really are nice pants and made great. I'm just under 5'2 and about 110 lbs, it was just not the kind of measurements I was anticipating for myself."
3.0,"They look more hot pink than red. Also, the fit is a little weird because of the stitching. Will not be using and will just go to Claire's or Icing in the mall instead."
3.0,Cute style but very thin material; it was very flimsy looking and cheaply made.
3.0,The young woman who wore this in a  play felt pretty in it but after just a few rehearsals I had to reinforce each seam
3.0,"my true shoe size is a 9, and I like my slippers to be a bit bigger but these sandals actually fit my size 9 foot which means they are really a bit too small.  Comfortable otherwise."
3.0,"It's ok, it didn't wow me.  I wish the material had displayed a little more &#34;sheen&#34; to it.  The purse is a little to big; however, I like it enough to keep it and use it."
3.0,"I did like mthe dress ,but too Small"
3.0,"Compared to my other pair of compression socks, these don't really seem to provide significant compression. They are just slightly snug socks.<br /><br />I wear a 10.5-11 USA shoe and bought the &#34;L/XL&#34; size, so I didn't get one that is too large. (supposed to be for 8.5-12) I wonder if the way this product only has 2 sizes may lead to them not fitting some folks very well."
3.0,"Good quality... Fits small,tho.. I'm a 40 waist and ordered a xxl"
3.0,"shorter and smaller than I expected. The Lapis had some imperfections in the cut and wasn't as glossy as pictured. Still a lovely piece of lapis. The silver chain broke within two weeks. I like this necklace and I have gotten a few compliments on it and I want to give it a better review, partly because I just love lapis so much, but my feelings towards it are just kind of average... with a slight bit of disappointment. I would probably suggest this to a friendbecause the lapis is a lovely piece of lapis... but I would also tell them to anticipate the chain breaking right away."
3.0,I love the idea of a scrunchie watch band and this band was very pretty however it is painfully tight. I usually have a problem with finding small sized watch bands as I have a pretty tiny wrist but this is almost child sized. I ended up sticking in a drawer. One of these days I’ll see if I can stretch it out a bit so it’s not cutting off circulation to my hand.
3.0,Skirt of dress fits well but the top is too small and missing loops on the sides to hold top in place.
3.0,It’s cute but !!! To long and it came with a hole on the side of it !!
3.0,"Not so much that it's small, but as in the cut of fabric in the arms and shoulder areas. The shoulder or arms are not articulated.  They pull back tight as I reach forward with my arms. And the entire jacket rises as I raise my arms up. Or maybe this fit is for someone with straight arm and lesser arm muscles."
3.0,"Very light casual dress for every day. Light material, fits as expected, perfect for hot weather.<br />Delivered on time."
3.0,"Somewhat big, but otherwise fine."
3.0,"14 year old son got these. He followed the instructions for the molded insert, and the piece for the top completely melted. This is pretty disappointing, as without the insert, the grill becomes unwearable. He still wears the bottom, and the silicone mold piece that goes inside of it worked fine for that one. Wish it came with back ups or better quality molds, but for the price, you get what you get."
3.0,definitely a 12mo or even 18mo for the smallest size. i dont like the shorts/bottoms as they seem to be poorly made but the tshirt is fantastic and just waiting for my son to properly fit into it.
3.0,It arrived with scratches on the lenses.
3.0,I ordered a medium and recieved a small. It still fit but I can only wear it with very thin shirts under it.  It's jersey fabric and is full of wrinkles - I have not yet ironed it so I don't know how the fabric will do.  Jacket is fairly thin.
3.0,"Size is nice , I would prefer a better quality in material."
3.0,A bit see through and you need to wear something underneath.
3.0,Nice fabric but not sure I get the hype for the price ... was expecting more.
3.0,"The feathers were rather lackluster and smashed flat from shipping.  I was able to fluff them up a bit, but still not an exciting look."
3.0,"Made from latex, this mask was tight on an adult male; however had better visibility than the other Momo we tested. Hair/wig was not attached well. Find EG Scary on YouTube for all my mask unboxing."
3.0,"3 stars because the dress was cute and I liked the pattern but it was too small in the chest. I ordered a Large because I typically wear a Large in dresses, especially flowy dresses (XL in pants). I’m not large chested (38C) but I was busting out of the chest in this dress and it was too tight in the armpits and sleeves. I was disappointed I had to return it."
3.0,The sizes run small.  I'll have to exchange it for a different size.  Fabric feels great and will probably be super comfy in three tight size
3.0,"Nowhere near at high as pictured, but still cute."
3.0,Beautiful tie and color
3.0,the dress is cute but it is definitely larger than it looks in the picture. it's not that tight-fitting. it's pretty loose and feels baggy.
3.0,I have an athletic build from weight training and while the shirt fits the biceps and shoulder area are tight.  This would be a compliment except I am proportionate and  other shirts coming from Asia here on Amazon fit
3.0,"It looks so much better on the site. I got it and was slightly unhappy. The strap, (for over the shoulder use,) isn't long enough so that's useless. And what the heck are those things hanging off on a clip? Even my daughter thought they look like cat toys...so off they went...useless. Good news? Plenty of room inside and a pretty color."
3.0,"I got the &#34;plum&#34; color and the dye bled into other clothes in the wash, even in cold water. I then washed it in hot water with a white T-shirt and now have a lovely pastel-pink T, so I can't complain too much :P<br /><br />Also to note, the second button is further down than I'd expect (and prefer), and the collar naturally spreads out, meaning my chest (or undershirt) is largely exposed."
3.0,I returned this shirt because the printed logo was very stiff and plasticy.  It sat awkwardly on my chest. The tshirt material and fit were fine and the shirt was cute but not worth the weird feeling and fit.
3.0,Purchased for my son's masquerade prom.  Good news - he really liked it.  Bad news - it didn't arrive in time.
3.0,They look great once. But after they were washed..... black spots all over them.... so if your buying them for a one time wear as we did they good
3.0,Not as strong as you would like it to be
3.0,Too small for size indicated. Fabric doesn't give either.
3.0,"The picture and description says there is a breakaway. There isn’t. It both shows it in the picture and says it has one, but it doesn't."
3.0,"Good lens but not as blue as pictured. same color as original lens. Lightblue/ light purple.  This lens dont line up with the goggle as seamlessly as the original, has a small gap light gets through."
3.0,"Didn’t review the photos carefully. The sleeves are held on by a thread, wasn’t what I was looking for"
3.0,"Light weight, flimsy, cheap looking/feeling. Good price though."
3.0,The band is not very reliable broke within 2 weeks
3.0,The large size was way to small.
3.0,Ordered Ex Large and it was to right. I ordered 3 shirts all ex large. 1’fit as expected the other 2 were tight.
3.0,I loved the racer back and wanted to get the normal back. I ordered the same size 32dd but this bra covers 2/3 and leaves me squishing out in the middle. I find that this is not as much fabric as the racer back. You may need to order a cup size up.
3.0,"It looks exactly the same! But the colors are a bit more duller than in the picture, ripped when I washed it and had to see it back. Cheap material but for the price it's good"
3.0,Bought this for a costume party and it ripped the same night. Also too big for the size
3.0,"i love these, but my husbands broke after 2 days of wearing 🥲"
3.0,The ones that worked were great! a lot were duds but the majority worked.
3.0,"the fit of the top of this dress is irregular, even with alterationd the fit is wrong, it qorked for my event but I wont wear it that much, I looked pregnant in it"
3.0,Honestly a lot smaller than I thought. I bought other 2in keychains and they were a lot larger. Not sure if I will purchase again.
3.0,"The material of these pants is nice. However, the seams are not sewn together well. I have only worn these twice and the seams are starting to pull apart already. These fit loosely all over on me. They are very comfortable. I ordered 2 more pair, and it was the second order that wasn't as good as the first. So, it's hit or miss with these."
3.0,Like the fit of the dress just wish the length was a little longer
3.0,"I really want to give this 5 stars as its quite a lovely design. However it is not finished to a high polish as the picture, it's slightly rough and definitely needs polished, some of the edges are a little rough as well. Fit is slightly small, just a pinch tighter than true to size."
3.0,"I loved the design, but, unfortunately, they retain moisture which make the feet sweat."
3.0,I bought this cuz bigger girls were saying how a small medium would fit ok. Bull pucky. It’s beautiful but not for anyone bigger than a size 4. Don’t waste your time or money. I’m a medium in everything n Size 10 regularly. Hourglass shape 36dd with thighs n butt. This was no bueno for my size. I gave it 3 stars for quality.
3.0,Little on the cheap looking side but works fine.
3.0,I thought they would be bigger around and yo me they are too flat. Not much shape yo them. Good for covering nipple but not helpful to me.
3.0,Super cute shirt but was disappointed to find it fits like Jr. sizes and 2x is as big as it goes. It's tight but im going to make it work. i normally wear a size 20 and the 2x fits more like a 16 or small 18.
3.0,"The rubber sole around the side of the slipper can be uncomfortable, I think going up in size will help."
3.0,"Cute socks, wished they were a little warmer and came up a little higher, they are crew length, but not bad for the price, definitely warmer than plain cotton socks"
3.0,These are lightweight and breathable but the design is poor. Tight around the ears and mask tend to slip upwards during constant activity.
3.0,"it is ok for what I wanted it for a work watch . but it has one annoying habit , it is easy to bump and change to military time , other then that for the price it is a good deal"
3.0,Does not look the same as in the pic
3.0,This was actually returned. It was actually shorter then the same size belt my son already had
3.0,They’re cute How ever made my butt flat so I don’t think I’d be buying again
3.0,Not reAlly sturdy.
3.0,I really love this watch but as soon as I put it on the buckle came off the strap was going to return  but instead I decided to keep it my husband is trying to fix it for me
3.0,"A beautiful bracelet, but it's quality is not as I expected! Many beads have crackers!"
3.0,"I like the watch but it looks very little like the photos show, the gold color is very light and the gold on the band started wearing off the first and only time I wore it. I decided to keep the watch but will buy a better quality band."
3.0,"I was sent the wrong size, cute style to back It didn't fit"
3.0,"Fits as expected,  the fabric is a little thin."
3.0,Cheap and way too large.
3.0,"As snow goggles,  these are a bit of a joke.  They are flimsy and pre-scratched. However,  for $7, they did the job for my 7 year old for a one day trip.  I don't expect them to last more than one or two uses."
3.0,Loved the dress but it is too big in the chest area. Need to tailor to my size.
3.0,I made earings and the peices were falling apart but I had already made like ten pair so could not return. Did not even ask.
3.0,I love how the fabric feels but the large runs small and short. Highly recommend getting a size up.
3.0,"Definitely size up. Shorter than it seems, not made for tall people."
3.0,It's ok. The clasp seems to &#34;pop off&#34; a lot though.
3.0,"It is cut but to large for petite women, especially across the shoulders, so it doesn't cover like I wanted it to."
3.0,"As i have come to find sizes vary from country to country, i ordered this product in 2 sizes larger than my normal size, and it appears to have been the right calculations. The top is not exactly my favourite as it is not adjustable but the bottoms fit great and look beautiful. Thank you."
3.0,The panel is terribly sheer. Fabric feels cheap.
3.0,"This wig was great,  I was able to shape the bangs with my straightener. It does need more coverage around the top, the cap was slighty visible."
3.0,"I ordered a normal size but jeeze, these were like a big pink garbage bad on me!"
3.0,"looks decent and feels alright. I would've given a 4 star, but the tie came with the loop ripped and literally hanging by a thread. Needed some needlework to put it back together"
3.0,Love love love love love love love love the shirt.  I haven't watched it yet because of some of the reviews but I'm waiting to wear for a special occasion and then once I wash it I will leave another review other than that I would order a size bigger if you need it definitely not a size smaller
3.0,"Was purchased as a gift...nice, but just heads  it is not for small wrists. Doesn't seem to be adjustable...nice otherwise. Seller probably should have had indication of best fit wrist size in description. Arrived as requested."
3.0,"These shoulder pads add just the right amount of increased bulk for my narrow shoulders. I had hopes that the pads would stay in place with the velcro straps, but they don't. The pads slip forward, requiring regular readjustment throughout the day. The price is a bit high for something I'm going to need to stitch into place."
3.0,not exactally what I thought it is very big so instead of necklace I hung it from the mirror in my car
3.0,Sent back because of the fabric
3.0,Not what I expected but good quality
3.0,Size larger
3.0,Hard to clasp.
3.0,"These are solid for what you pay.  A bit on the thin side, and I'm not sure how long they'll last, but so far they're getting the job done."
3.0,The shoulders have humps. Other than that it looks nice.
3.0,"I was going to return it, too big on the upper part but tight on the waist.  I decided to keep it instead. I can't print the return label."
3.0,Cheaper material than expected
3.0,"It's ok for the price. Material is a bit clingy, so if you are as lucky as me to have a bit of back fat, it'll show. I slapped on a cardigan, though ;)"
3.0,Lights up well but arrived cracked. Very flimsy material
3.0,Absolutely love the look and feel of these. They aren’t too short and feel great to the touch. My only con would be the smell of the garment outside of the shipping bag. It has a VERY strong chemical smell. I will of course be washing it before wearing.<br /><br />I would still give a very high rate as they qualify is very good
3.0,NOT VERY GOOD QUALITY  AFTER 1 WASH THE BLACK FADED
3.0,"I like them,but they are a little snug around the waist"
3.0,"It’s a very cute necklace, but it is very dainty and feels as if it will break. I love the saying on the card and for the price it’s a great value. Just be careful when clasping."
3.0,"This dress is actually see-through. So if you're looking for something that will cause a buzz, by all means buy it! If, however, your daughter wants to wear it to the high school dance, think twice. It was also a snug fit, which may have contributed to the transparency."
3.0,This dress is ribbed and was a little bit sparkly due to a little glitter on it. I didn't really care for it as I wasn't looking for a ribbed style.
3.0,"This is a great top,it fits well.I bought the XL  but if you are looking for it to fit a little loose go one size up."
3.0,"Well it's an okay dress I'm  usually a large. I'm 5.4 height, 1.50lb, 36D. I ordered a medium but it was a bit shorter than what the model has... so I'll re-order large...."
3.0,The waste size was right but their a weird length. I thought they would fit alittle closer to my ankle but they fit closer to my knee. I'm 5'5&#34;
3.0,Yes soft and warm...liked zipper pockets but gave to friend that is in more rainy season then my location...she used.
3.0,The little thing sticking on the T-shirt is useless.  Remove it.  What a waste
3.0,They are OK. Quality of the frame is acceptable.  The lenses are cool looking but difficult to see through.  I suspect its a result from using a cheap mirroring technique.  They are also quite narrow for a pair of aviators.  If you have even a slightly wide face you may want to keep looking.
3.0,"Fits perfect but if you have a little bit of a tummy, which i do and it's not a big ol tummy either just a little one, the color of dark teal green is going to hit you right there.  I will unfortunately have to return this dress as it doesn't look good on due to the tummy"
3.0,Beautiful to look at but it doesn't fit properly. Couldn't stay on. It cost too much to return. And I also saw that the price dropped with an added 20% off after I bought it. Bummer.
3.0,It's a cute overall. Color is not as pictured. More like a dirty wash.
3.0,"I completely love this dress! It’s perfect for when you want casual but yet cute and it even has pockets. However, the quality is not so great. After about 4-6 washes the fabric started to wear holes in the dress where it was obvious and unwearable. It’s worth the money if you’re only expecting to get 5-10 wears out of it."
3.0,"The mouth design on the mask hits so low on face it really falls at bottom of chin. So you can't really see it as a grinch face, just a green mask. Disappointed as this took so long to arrive and then just didn't look correct once on. Even on my husbands larger face, the grinch mouth was at his chin...............The mask itself is really nice overall, with a pocket for a filter, nice ear loops"
3.0,I love the stainless steel they only thing I sont like was I thought it would be more dainty still love my necklace though
3.0,Bought these for my 4 y/o who wears size 5T for preschool because of the grippy bottoms. The size 4/5 is unfortunately already small on her. Wish they came in a bigger size!!
3.0,"Fabric is cheaper than I thought, it’s a bit see through. I got the red dress so it wasn’t completely transparent."
3.0,"super cute, I really wanted to keep it, but the top was too big, even though i ordered a small."
3.0,Not as strong as I wanted. Hopefully it will not break to soon
3.0,This shirt is a light weight pullover not a sweatshirt which I sort of assumed — the sleeves are awkwardly short the length and body is too small ... I am typically a 10/12 ordered the large and it wasn’t at all as slouchy as the picture would suggest ordering up to get the casual baggy look
3.0,"The color was supposed to be green but was a turquoise blue. I was disappointed as these were for a costume. However, I gave 3 stars because they are really soft and comfy, but blue isn’t my color so I’ll wear them to lounge around the house."
3.0,"I wish the mask had more shape to it. It’s kinda flimsy and hard to wear with eye glasses.  Other than that, it’s true to color and it’s not to thick or thin."
3.0,I am returning. They are not the quality I want to use in my embroidery business.
3.0,Gave as a gift. She like it.
3.0,"Nice watch for the price, but what happened to the instructions? I would have added one more star but I had to look up what I needed to know on the net."
3.0,Color is off. It doesn't match origin one.
3.0,"This dress is OK not great as the other reviewers are saying. If you have a chest at all this is going to be a problem in this dress. With a B cup the crossline of the chest goes awkwardly over and a little above the boobs so it’s kind of weirdly unflattering and creates a uni boob. The way the fabric crosses in the front looks like it should be flattering but it kind of pooches out in the front like they’re supposed to be a belly. It almost seems like it should be a maternity dress.  It’s not the worst dressed in the world but it looks pretty cheap and didn’t look great. I ordered a medium and I’m 140lbs, 5”7. Maybe I could have done a small but it already didn’t do well in the chest area."
3.0,It’s  just ToO big it might fit a water head  It’s so big
3.0,"It was a bit too short for me, and there was some extra material on the bodice that I felt would likely end up showing, so I sent it back"
3.0,It’s beautiful but it’s a bit thick for my earlobe so when I tried to put it did hurt a bit other than that it’s a beautiful earring. Love jhumkas
3.0,"I ordered the dark wash first to test them out. Ordered a medium, they are VERY lose at the waist which sucks but a belt helps.. they fit my booty, because I DO have one lol. They rest right at my ankle. And come to about an inch under my bellybutton. The biggest disappointment I have with these jeans is the button fell off the first time I put them on, however I replaced the botton and haven't had an issue since.. for the most part I'm happy, could be better but again they aren't the worst jeans I've ever bought.."
3.0,The earrings were a gift!
3.0,I  would think that a product for Team USA could at least be made in the USA.
3.0,Quality wise these look good. They are nice colors. They are just SMALL. I tried wearing one over night and it's been an hour and I still have a ring outline on my finger.
3.0,These pants fit well but are really long for “average length”. Tailoring expense makes them not a great bargain.
3.0,Too small but good quality
3.0,The two belts are pretty in design but low in quality.  I do feel you are getting your money’s worth.  I just wanted a better product.  I returned them.
3.0,So I got a size large instead of my usual medium and wish I would have gotten a XL or maybe even an XXL. My hips are 39in and my waist is 35in.
3.0,"The short was a little tighter than I had envisioned, but still fits comfortably and didn't restrict my workout at all. I love how quirky it is :)"
3.0,"Came on time, was exactly like the picture. Lasted a week then broke off. Pretty disappointed"
3.0,They fit as expected and look nice. They are not super comfortable and the leather is a little hard so its best if used with socks on.
3.0,"It was a little snug. Good quality.  There was a lot of moving around in the costume. It held up through a senior homecoming parade float.<br />The pieces were a little tedious to apply, so we left those off. Thai didn’t decrease the look of the costume.<br />For the price, it was okay.  Do your research before purchasing. It will be in your top 3 choices."
3.0,"They look nice, but I wouldn't buy them again because they don't hold up very well. I had one of these break the first time I tried to put it on and tighten it."
3.0,larger than I expected but will be okay for wearing as an accent piece
3.0,It started to fade after the first month
3.0,They hurt my ears; not sure if it's the material used or I pinched them to my ear too hard. Get what you pay for I guess. I ended up giving them to my little niece and she likes them.
3.0,"Ok...So I am somewhere between a 38""or 40"" waist. BUT I  have no way of knowing what ruler these Amazon Manufactures [all off-shore] are using these days.???<br />I order a 40"" falls off me. I order a 38"" from another and too small.<br />This brand, while O.K (maybe) as they do stretch. cuts me in the rear end...Actually to ONE side, of my REAR!<br />And I HAVE no REAR End.(my wife tells me)  Maybe for a 20 year old REAR end. NOT for me. So I'm going, I'm getting a bit tired of ordering. I guess going forward...order 2 sizes,... see which one fits. Send teh OTHER BACK  Size means NOTHING now days."
3.0,"Not pleased with the product.I will keep them and wear them around the house,but not out and about."
3.0,"In the picture, it looks like the top of the shoe covers more of the foot, not so."
3.0,It's nice 👌🏼
3.0,The scarf  looked like a lot of strings  sewn together.  I would not buy this again.
3.0,Too small. Looks like it's made well.
3.0,My husband is a 1X sometimes 2X .. I purchased a 3X so he has plenty of room to wear a warm jacket underneath.  But the 3X fit like a 2x
3.0,well the size is big but the style and color beautiful
3.0,"Only held up for 2 months of school.  2nd graded so not really used much.  Very lightweight, and not durable."
3.0,My daughter is between a 4T and this fits but is very snug. She will not be able to wear much longer. I would recommend sizing up.
3.0,"Well made, but doesn't fit well.  Not made to fit the head comfortably and kinda looks goofy on.  Quality material, though."
3.0,"The size was a little bit big for me, so I wear it a night gown. It very comfortable. But should of ordered a size smaller."
3.0,I love these necklaces! How they were packaged was awful! It’s 3 separate necklaces and They came in a bag altogether- so they were all tangled up. Once I finally got them untangled- it was all good! Super cute to layer (as pictured) as well as worn individually.
3.0,The strap was a good size and the quality was good. The buckles were too small for the purse I was attaching it to but you really can't determine that from the picture
3.0,It was not as I expected it. It wasn’t flattering on me. Maybe it’s me and not the dress
3.0,"Ok for the price.  All pieces are holding up well except the wand.  Jewels were falling off the wand within a week. The gloves are a nice satin and better quality than I anticipated. You have to assemble the crown, and it didn't come with instructions, although it was pretty simple."
3.0,"Since the classic &#34;They come in grey only&#34; sweats are no longer made (to my knowledge), these I are the best 90/10 sweats I could find.<br /><br />I first bought a green pair.  It took two wearings before the left waist lacing pull tore off the back.  They are now part of my Man Cave decor.<br /><br />I bought a red pair and so far they are holding up, although the interior fuzz trail on the floor and furniture shows signs of letting up.<br /><br />These silver pants seem sized larger and the ankle elastic must be sized based upon the assumption that people using them will always put on their shoes and then their sweats."
3.0,Just OK quality...more like a cheap promotional item. I will probably return...not something I want to wear with a nice shirt/suit.
3.0,"I was originally buying these for Disneyland but we could t go because it closed for Covid 19.<br />However, now I have time to return them since one of the pairs was unmatched in color. There was 3 brown and 1 yellow. I don’t understand how no one notices that. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
3.0,Does not sit on the neck very well but .. it's a nice piece of jewelry nonetheless.
3.0,"Very nice dress however I bought one size bigger and it was still too small.  I also looked like something I would wear to a funeral, instead of out to dinner.  My husband and son both did not like it.  I was well made, just not right for me, I returned it without any problem and was given an immediate refund."
3.0,"These were ok. They have no structure to them, so they seemed like a waste to me."
3.0,To heavy but nice bag
3.0,Was great at first but my hamster chewed a hole in the plastic with no problem. I’ve only had the item for a few days :’(
3.0,"great colors, excellent fit, but the material is not friendly for pads or pantiliners because they don't stay stuck to this kind of material."
3.0,Horrible smell...and it doesn't go away.
3.0,"I gave as a present for a friend. She likes a lot. But for myself is not my style, a bit small for me, plus a prefer gold tone."
3.0,Super thin. Size 1 down. Sleeves are only connected by a few threads but I think I might just cut them off anyways. Debating between this dress and another so I might jist return this one. I'm 5'6&#34; 150lbs. Originally got a medium but it was way too big. Exchanged for a small.
3.0,These fit a bit loose. I was expecting more of a squeeze.
3.0,No half sizes order and 11 and it’s too big
3.0,Its an alright shirt overall. The material is a little weird. Not my taste.
3.0,"Cute shirt, but doesn't fit well...it's shapeless."
3.0,Update: First one lasted about a year. The button to make it talk fell out.  2nd one stopped talking after about 2 months.<br />I got this for my 87 year old mother and she likes it.  The only complaint she has is that the time it says if off by a few minutes from the time she sees.
3.0,Cute but cheap looking. Good for a kid or teen.
3.0,I normally wear a size 12.  The mediums are 10-12 and large is 14-16.  What happened to the 12-14 size?  Think they would have been perfect
3.0,"I did like them, I ordered a medium and it was a size to small. I could pull them up, but it tore in the crotch area. But it does make you sweat"
3.0,"I ordered 3 pairs of these in different colors, 2 of them had pockets and 1 didn't, also 1 pair fit a little weird, like I had them on backwards!<br /> I loved how they looked when they arrived, they were comfortable, but running a little small.<br />The disappointing part is after 1 wash all 3 came out peely, little balls all over the pant, and got worse after each wash<br />So....they are cute but look like I've had them for years,<br /> and they are only a month old."
3.0,Too small to button around my chest. I returned it.
3.0,"The shirt and head wrap were cute, the suspenders were wayyy too big probably can use them next year."
3.0,"First of all, I love these pants. They are so incredibly soft and comfortable. Warm but don’t make me sweat. So why not 5 stars? Reason 1, they already have a big hole in the seam on the leg after wearing maybe 3 nights. And 2, just saw the exact same pants at Wal-Mart for $9.99. Half what I paid for them."
3.0,It's wide which is good for sun protection but she can't see anything. Maybe I wouldn't make the rim so big.
3.0,"I don't have large hands, and these are very tight. Perhaps they''ll stretch over time. Otherwise they are nice."
3.0,Leggings run kinda small
3.0,These are nice lil earrings but they are a lot smaller than I thought..they will be good for my grand daughter
3.0,"I like the way it fits, hem came out though."
3.0,I love white denim. I love the skirt. It is a little tight and Really short lol. A medium woudve been better. I am losing weight so i will stick with the small as a goal of mine :)
3.0,"There're nice, but that case and glasses smell like they were stored were someone smoked a thousand packs of cigarettes and the smell still hasn't gone away."
3.0,Body of blouse runs 1 size smaller. Arms however are very tapered-a little snug.
3.0,"I have a great shape but I was swimming in this. I wear it to bed. Its my fault though, I forgot that I can't pull off the color grey."
3.0,"I get so many compliments on this sweater! It really is eye-catching and fun. It is thick material but will not make you sweat. I loved wearing it at the beginning of Spring when it wasn't too hot yet. However, I cannot stand the orange color. It does not fit in with the rest of the color pattern and just throws me off. I especially hate that the orange is at the wrist on the sleeve, because I am forced to look at it when I work at the computer. If it was any other color, I would give this 5 stars. But seriously, the orange is hideous."
3.0,"This key chain is not made for the newest Honda CR-V vehicles. Keys are too large to slide onto the clip. Very nice quality, but I had to return it! :("
3.0,Light weight and wrinkle -free... all but the collars.. the collars on these are atrocious....looks like you slept in it.
3.0,"I bought them because at local drugstores and such places, they don't protect the lenses; they just toss them on a hanger. Inevitably you find a scratch or a flaw right where you don't need it.<br />These work and are very light, but that is because of the extremely flimsy temples and bridge. WalMart's are better and cheaper. At least they aren't scratched.<br />UPDATE: Temple broke at hinge after a couple of weeks or minimal use. Forget these."
3.0,Expect better.
3.0,From the waist up it’s adorable and very flattering.<br /><br />But that middle slit makes it look like palazzo pants. Gross and not at all flattering. I’ll be sewing it shut.
3.0,"its okay! smaller than I thought, and not that durable. ill use it when I don't need a lot of stuff to lug around"
3.0,"I have never heard of 16K Platinum Plating nor have I ever known a jewelry seller to use either of these Metals for this price! It’s just not done. I didn’t learn about my Metals until a few months back. It was extremely eye opening and helpful! I wish ever buyer would do it because it’s important, it saves money and time etc...This is my fault for not knowing this, just like the size (I did read) has a few people upset but you need to read everything! Seller’s will say one thing near the photo and another in the description! It’s wrong to do to Buyer’s and it should be stopped. I need to stop buying anything that isn’t .925 Sterling Silver but I have a lot of those items that 70% of them were faked as well from here and another shopping site online. It’s hard to believe someone would do this and also for Amazon to allow it! If I right things like this in questions they don’t get posted. Crazy...It’s hard to resist what you think is a great deal, but the jewelry only has to last for 30 day’s right?! Wish I could help other Buyer’s even if it’s one person I’d be Happy! Thanks for reading and good luck to you!!"
3.0,Way too big for women
3.0,"I have to wear compression socks and stockings but I don't have to wear boring ones.  These aren't boring.  They fit well, have good compression and a cute style.  My only complaint is the design will imprint circular marks on your legs.  I have several styles of this brand (my favorite is the bright stripes). I would recommend them...unless you are a leg model."
3.0,I did not like how it was shipped! Came smashed in a bag but the hat is nice
3.0,From biceps area it is way to big for me
3.0,"These do look nice, I wear a 10 and these were a bit to long but they fit well with an arch support insert. I do not feel much support but they are not flat either. I bought black and red and the colors are perfect."
3.0,The elastic stretches and makes it useless after awhile.
3.0,"Smaller is size, make sure you get it at least 4 sizes larger than your size"
3.0,"The sizing is all off. Some run really big and some run TTS. They don’t stay up, they always fall down toward the ankle."
3.0,"Good quality material though the image on the sweatshirt is very poor quality color and clarity, and the red stripe on the pants doesn't match the top."
3.0,"I wish we could depend on the sizing being correct, but we can't.  Shorts too big."
3.0,Did not fit. So big I had to send it back
3.0,"The kids liked them, but the quality is less than satisfactory."
3.0,"While this is a cute an inexpensive naval ring, I already ended up ordering two because the hamsa hand ended up detaching from the hoop that connected it to the main jeweled barbell and fell-off.<br /><br />This hand is also bigger than I expected and does get caught in my shirts and pants--which has led to infections.<br /><br />My suggestion would be that once you receive your order, take some pliers and reinforce the connecting hoop so that you don't lose the hand. Also, just be careful when putting on clothes, as the piercing does get caught in clothes."
3.0,Soft material runs big
3.0,True to size . I don’t like shiny fabric
3.0,I liked the color but not the material.
3.0,Its good looking but the material not really good
3.0,Bulkier than I imagined and don’t like having to hit a button to see the time.
3.0,"I liked this hat very much, but you need to know that every hat varies in the colors you get.  The picture shows black, with just a little bit of pink and other colors, but you don't see the colors on the other side, and the one I received had a lot of big patches of pink, and I'm just not a pink person.  I returned it for this reason."
3.0,"I think the seams were off when made, so when it was washed it looked awkward.  Faded quite a bit too after one wash :(  Too much money for a very poor quality t-shirt."
3.0,"This is a gorgeous style, and I'm so sad it didn't work for me. I have a high arch and need arch support or I suffer from plantar fasciitis. I always wear orthopedically designed shoes. But these arches were too high for even me! (The shoes were wide enough but a little long.) They were also pretty hard so they hurt. I wore them for a little while the day I got them and decided to send them back. They're so beautiful that I gave them another try the next day and they felt like they were softening a little, so I thought maybe they were like memory foam and would form to my foot. That night I was sitting and watching TV and the inner half of the top of my left foot cramped up so bad I couldn't move it without a lot of pain. I didn't know how I'd walk. Fortunately, it went away in about 30 minutes and I was fine the next day. But I knew it was from wearing those too-high arches and the shoes are definitely going back now. (Warning: the seller wants six dollars for you to return using UPS dropoff so you're taking a small risk buying these.)"
3.0,The name necklace looks great I love it and will order more the name plate is strong its lite weight to wear all day .The only problem i had was the size in the picture the necklace looks big but when i opened it wow it was small compared to the picture but over all great item will order more .
3.0,"Honestly, these leggings were supposed to be super flattering and fantastic, really supposed to enhance the booty. Unfortunately for me, these leggings did not in fact enhance the booty, the booty doesn’t look much different except I look like I have fishnet leggings on.<br /><br />Also, they looked tiny when I took them out of the package, and yet weren’t as tight as expected when I put them on. The tummy control wasn’t as extra as I expected and I even sized down since I fell in between the sizes. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
3.0,I was very disappointed with this bracelets. It fell apart within just couple days of wearing.
3.0,Cute and very soft shirt but wayyyyy to big. I bought a large which is my normal size and I probably could have gone with a small. Gave it to my sister.
3.0,"The color was not why I expected. I ordered black harness Fryer boots and upon viewing the boots , the color was more to a charcoal grey. The leather was not the same quality as my previously owned black harness Fryer Boots. Which I own for several years."
3.0,It would have been great if the sizes were exactly as it says it was. It was more like Boy large vs. Men Large. I gave it as a gift to my brother who works out. He is slim fit so you fit it out. My brother however liked the style and logo on the shirt.
3.0,"These lenses are elegant and I thought I could use them however I were too small, should come by size so that the customer can guide. I had to give away them"
3.0,"Christmas present for someone else.<br /><br />I liked what I see in the picture, as to why I ordered it. That is not what arrived. Altho, what arrived will do. It's not as bright and sharp as I was hoping for the color."
3.0,"I like the pattern on the dress and the colors are beautiful.  The fabric is lightweight, stretchy, and feels nice.  However, the bottom of the dress is somewhat see thru.  Unfortunately the dress was to large for me overall (ordered small, for reference I am 5'2&#34;, about 95 lbs, 32D chest)."
3.0,Very comfortable but hard to put on.<br />Not really supportive for busty girls
3.0,"If it was smaller, I would've liked it more. I'm a 5'3'' female and definitely bulky on me. The stitching is pretty decent. I do like the satin shine of it. But, the padding probably needs to be broken in. Feels hard and rigid. Doesn't flow/fall freely on the body as it did in the movie."
3.0,"This is probably more like a $3 shirt. It’s thin and soft and stretchy but the seam is very thin on the bottom so it rolls up even when you’re standing. Pleasantly surprised that it covered side boob though! It’ll work for what I needed it for. For reference, I’m 220lbs and 5’1 - this was the XL"
3.0,"Length wise these slippers are OK but width wise just a bit too narrow for me although I do wear them.Still have another pair I wear mostly and will probably get a second pair of that brand,L.B.Evans.They are the width I need to be wearing regularly ."
3.0,Nicely made. Sturdy material. Too small for my wrist. I have average sized wrists. Or so I thought.
3.0,This is cute but it barely fit my very petite daughter's wrist.  A little snug for her. The description states that it measures 8 x 2.5 inches but it doesn't.  I almost think it would fit my 7 year old grand daughter perfectly. It is pretty though.
3.0,"Normally, if something were to fit as poorly as this skirt does, I would definitely not give it 3 stars...I would be generous with a 2 star review.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there is an upside to this skirt.<br /><br />As other reviewers mentioned, it is way too small. In fact, I do not know how this could be a one size fits all, or even one size fits most. To be fully clear, the seller does not necessarily claim this; rather, the size merely states &#34;one size.&#34; So, just know ahead of time that this &#34;one size&#34; is going to fit one size of person, and that size is a small!<br /><br />Here's the upside...it is made well. The fabric is soft and while I ordered the &#34;coffee&#34; color that is really more like a &#34;thoroughly toasted slice of bread&#34; color, it is still a pretty color, though not what the picture indicates by any means. The seams are nice a strong and even though it is too small for me, the seams did not split or cry out in terror when I attempted to squeeze into this skirt! That's a win!<br /><br />Here's another WIN...even though it is small, it is nice and strong enough to still hold you in and ends up not looking too bad! Really, it's like you have a skirt (or even a dress) with built in SPANX! I found that the skirt was a bit too long to wear as a skirt, unless you pull it up high or fold the waistband down a couple times. BUT, if you pull the skirt up over your chest, it actually works well as a slimming strapless, casual summer dress.<br /><br />So, even though it is too small, too long as a skirt (I'm 5'7&#34;) and the color is not what it should have been, I am going to make this work to my advantage!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,beautiful but it can't hold my weight. It bounces when I walk and the straps keep falling down.
3.0,Very cute but not good for Ive protection.
3.0,Good product but get a smaller size then you wear normally
3.0,very cheap flimsy plastic. More like for a kid than an adult.
3.0,Everything is good I bought 2 packs but one of the packs had a short sleeve 1 in it  Other than that everything is great
3.0,"The dress I received was made of a scratchy material. And wearing a size 3 dress in Torrid, I ordered this dress in a 4x to be safe. But it's snug at my stomach and hips.<br />Sidenote, at 5'5, the dress is floor length on me."
3.0,It's pretty but more for young girls. A little too small for me.
3.0,They broke easy
3.0,"It’s a decent hat, but the flower and feather were in the dead center. Not like it was advertised."
3.0,"I really like the style, and cut but it was too, small for me. A 44yr old, 5' 10"" 235lbs over weight American. But when I put it on my 14yr 5'7 140lbs son, it was a hit. I'll need to tailors the arms, and maybe take in the sides, but I'm going to keep it for that reason. If you a bit on the heavy side avoid China's products as they are not sizing it to big America."
3.0,Nice hat but it began to pill fairly quickly! Will discard at the end of the winter.
3.0,"Gemstone eyes are cockeyed, but I still love it :)<br /><br />***edit: knocked this down to 3 stars. I love it but it turns my finger green."
3.0,They are very big gloves that fits a man’s hand
3.0,"It's nice but not sure about the quality, Fits a little snug."
3.0,"They are small, usually I'm size large , but extra large didn't fit me . Overall I like it the colors and the tall"
3.0,love the shoe but the size was too big. makes it difficult for my daughter to walk with. I will exchange it for a smaller size
3.0,I needed a size bigger
3.0,"Ok for the price.  They are a bit thin and transparent, but I wore them once & hand washed, and so far no runs or tears."
3.0,Very tiny...and not as I had expected. Arrived in a timely manner and is cute but rhinestones are really small as ear cuff is really small.
3.0,Definitely order at least 2 sizes up
3.0,"So I really like the top of this swim suit. It is fitted and padded well. I gave it 3 stars because of the bottoms... revealing and not lined thick enough, you could just see too much. I paired the top with different bottoms and that worked well."
3.0,I thought I ordered green but the cap is yellow. Still love it!
3.0,"Falls off kind of a lot, but is very pretty. Not as wearable as I had been hoping, unfortunately. I do have smaller ears than most, but they are not extremely tiny, so perhaps this is best for those whose ears are a bit wider than my own."
3.0,"I like the helmet, although I find the visor to be next to useless.  Chin strap is a little to far back and ends up rubbing against my throat."
3.0,They gave me a credit for Amazon for the price of the necklace. Not really what I wanted. Wanted my necklace fixed.
3.0,The charm is very cute but the metal chain turned my neck color. After I switched out the chain I wear it a lot and get compliments.
3.0,nothing not what expected poor material.
3.0,"Very Stiff material & sheer, I can't get the wrinkles out of it even after washing."
3.0,"Although this is  wonderful idea and I couldn't wait to get it in the mail, I'm a little disappointed in it. I've lost my glasses at least 3 or 4 times while wearing it. If you're not careful when you lean over you can easily knock your glasses off the Bola. This is great if you're not a very active person."
3.0,"man. too small. too bad. it's super cute. i could wear it if i dropped twenty pounds. that's a lot, though, dawg. and like, it's short. it's not gonna work. i gave it to my daughter who wears a US juniors 5 - 7. it's an XL and is only a little big in the shoulders. it'll fit her next year. (she's 12, 5'7&#34; and still growing)."
3.0,ordered large...their large is our small
3.0,Super cute and convenient. But tassel broke within a week.
3.0,"Loved the idea, however the zipper broke within a couple months and the back compartment is now useless."
3.0,"It's okay. Color is as advertised, and it did not have a strong chemical odor like the other scarves I ordered from another seller. However, the packaging said this is 100% cotton, but it's supposed to be 70% cotton and 30% hemp. There is no actual label on the scarf itself, which is a plus."
3.0,"Bag is the same as the one it comes with your sunglasses, however the side label does not have the O from Oakley but the HDO initials."
3.0,I loved the waistline of this dress but I could not get either one to zip. Zipper located on the side. Blue is a large and green is an XL. There is a little button and elastic hook on the back to secure it at the neck.
3.0,"I like having the mask on me and ready to be put on. Like all masks, it's not easy to breathe through. But easier then most because of design and light weight material."
3.0,Very comfortable and soft .....but def. Not a high impact sports bra!!  There is very little support for large breasts.
3.0,"The flower is so pretty.  Also so small.  Yes, I saw it in the picture…."
3.0,"The straps are o.k., the metal piece that goes into the bands holes is a bit short, so that makes it difficult for the band to stay attached."
3.0,"For a brand new leather strap, it arrived wrinkled and looks used."
3.0,"Cute, and quality is as expected for the price, but two complaints... Sized for small wrists, and closure hook sticks out too much and can snag or catch on things easily.  Won't be able to use as intended, but I was taking a flyer on them anyway so not a huge deal.  If these two issues don't phase you, just be aware that shipments from China can take two or three months to arrive, so don't buy if you want it sooner.  Though I won't be able to use, so they'll go into my next yard sale, I'm fairly certain that I will recoup the few bucks I spent, because they really are cute.  😁"
3.0,"The shirt is nice, but the fit was a tighter than expected."
3.0,El cordón no es de la mejor calidad. Y la piedra es demasiado grande y robusta como para llevarla colgada todo el tiempo. Incómodo
3.0,Like these but the strings come undone thts the only disappointment
3.0,"Definitely not as vibrant in color as the picture, but material is soft. Doesn't have as many pleats as pictured, but hangs ok."
3.0,"Overall fit is ok. They look like the picture, a bit plain and sorta cheap looking, but they were pretty cheap so...<br />Less than 30 minutes after wearing they were already rubbing blisters on the back of my heals so just make sure you keep a few band aids on hand. Don't know that I would necessarily recommend unless someone just wants an inexpensive pair of flats for running around town  I don't regret the purchase and will more than likely get more than my money's worth of wear out of them."
3.0,Broke after 4 weeks
3.0,Kit looks authentic but red thread on collar faded on the blue shirt and washed on delicate and came out with a pull in the fabric so a little disappointed in the quality for $65.
3.0,Color is not correct with what is shown on web site.
3.0,Its a nice cover for style but not for protection. Its easy to put on. The material is thin. The cover does come up on the rim of the watch
3.0,Ok but nothing great
3.0,"Don't love the elastic sides,  and it's uncomfortable on the inside without long enough socks"
3.0,Good but too higth on my legs
3.0,This is way too short to be a dress. It’s more of a long shirt. I will probably wear it with leggings and knee high boots. But definitely being wrongly advertised as a dress.
3.0,Way too big. Look like earring was made more for man
3.0,"Coming from China, they took a long time to arrive. I wish they were a little bigger, because they're tight enough to give me a headache. The colors are nice. I'll probably end up just using them for my dogs to keep their necks and heads warm during the winter since they're too tight for me."
3.0,"It isn't a fine as the Alex and Anne, but my son pick it out for me so therefore it has great meaning to me."
3.0,"Very disappointed with earrings, first of all they were much lighter grey pearl than appeared on the computer, and since I bought them to wear with a  tahiitian black pearl necklace than I had made, it is too different. Also the size of the pearl is smaller than I wanted, more 9mm than 10, so they seem  really small in comparison to the ones I owned previously and my necklace. The white gold is very light weight and seems like it would bend very easily. For the price, I didn't feel it was a good value.Im sorry."
3.0,All you guys have to do to make it better is give the strap a single twist before fastening near the clasp so it fits perfectly around the neck without a noticeable kink in the strap.
3.0,"I absolutely love the Papaya Art brand and was a huge fan of their Luxe totes. My first luxe tote lasted for years before the material began noticeably flaking. When I purchased this tote, I was expecting the same experience - but it has already begun cracking a little more than a year after purchase. Super disappointed. If they release another set of luxe totes in the future, I'll check them out, but cautiously -- and I don't plan to reorder another within the current line."
3.0,But they break easy
3.0,"Design and chain length/sturdiness are great - however be aware that this is a very yellow gold, almost the same color of those gold coin candy wrappers.  I don't mind too much and wear it super casual with a t-shirt and jeans, matches well for super casual wear."
3.0,"Ring is nice but the names aren't very visible, the names stood out in the ad but barely on the item. I can't hardly see the name to make sure it is spelled correctly"
3.0,"Beautiful ring don't get me wrong, it even came sooner than I had anticipated but the drawback for me is that the numeral eight had a piece missing and honestly I felt that the picture looks better than the actual ring. The numerals look stamped on but personally I do love the outward slope inside the ring it feels nice and smooth plus it is very sturdy.. If it wasn't for those minor flaws I would give it a five star rating."
3.0,Purchased for my mom and they are difficult forbher to get on and off.
3.0,Didn’t like the fit. Not flattering for my body type.
3.0,I don't think the green shoes up very well. They r cute still but just wish it showed more
3.0,"I wear a 7 shoe and they won't fit, closer to a no show, not low cut, but still couldn't get to fit. Will give to neighbors kid, not worth returning."
3.0,These are really nice however arrived damaged. Posts are bent and will most likely not last. Put in for return/ exchange and now no longer available. Wish the y would have packaged them better. Now I have to decide whether to keep and hope they don't break or get refund. Totally bummed out.
3.0,"I ordered my regular size, 8.5 M, which is what all my shoes/boots are, and according to their size chart, that's what size I was as well.  I received the boot today and my foot was so tightly squeezed in it I could barely move.  My disappointment is in the return policy.  Of course, fit can be a problem with shoes and boots, but you are unable to exchange them for another size; you must choose a refund and you are charged for the return shipping.  If I could have, I would have exchanged them for one size up, a 9.5 M, but now that I have to pay for return shipping and reorder I will not be ordering them from here again.  If you choose to purchase the boot, oder one size bigger and be aware that, if they do not fit, you will not be able to exchange them for another size.  Otherwise, the boot itself is really nice."
3.0,"Love the dress and it fit perfectly, like it was made for me, but the zipper broke after I tried it on once. I'll get it fixed because it's a darling dress and design. I'm 5'5&#34; and 126lbs and got the small."
3.0,"It's a nice looking wrist watch and I like wearing it. There's a low quality feel about the crown but for the price, I don't really mind. It would lag behind whenever I placed it down overnight so I had to readjust every morning (the not-so-precise crown did not help). It stopped working after about 5 months but I suspect the battery died. Difficult to find the battery in stores so had to order that online. Hopefully, it's a battery problem. Overall, if you don't care about the quality per se and just want something that looks good, I say go for it. It's cheap!<br /><br />Update: It was a battery problem. Watch's working fine now!"
3.0,"I purchased this shirt/dress for my wife a couple months ago and so far it's holding up well. She wears a lot of black because its slimming and she prefers to wear this piece as a top with jeans. She said it's too short to be a dress, but likes the soft fabric, so it still works. The only reason I'm giving it a 3 out of 5 stars is that it feels very thin and some of the threading around the sleeves has started coming undone. She only wears it about once a month and in not sure it will last more than a couple of years.<br /><br />Overall I'm not sure I would buy this again for her, because of the quality, but it does look good on her for the time being. I did get a discount on this product in exchange for my honest opinion of it."
3.0,Thought material was different
3.0,If you have arms like pencilsthen the shirt is great but the tightest part is the seam around your biceps
3.0,"It is shorter in the front than in the back. I'm 5'3&#34; so this dress works fine for me. I bought a medium. With a lot of maxi dresses I have to knot at the side or hem, but this one is floor length in the back and hits a couple inches above my ankle in front. But keep in mind that  if you're taller you may have a tea length dress rather than floor length. Also there is a seam down the front of the dress. With the large polka dot pattern it is very noticeable since the pattern doesn't line up. With all that being said, it's fine for the price. For me, for the price point, it will serve its purpose of a long flowing casual dress to wear on a hot day"
3.0,I like this dress but even at 5'8 it's dragging the floor and there's a hole in one pocket like another person said in a review. The pink is also much lighter than the photo.
3.0,"I ordered this mask for one purpose ...to mess with my dogs and it totally works. Very funny but also pretty cheap plastic, hot to wear and not the greatest detailing."
3.0,"It’s underwear, not much else to say"
3.0,"This necklace is as described but very small. As an adult I had to put the closure on the very last link possible. After wearing it for two times, the clamp actually broke. Cheaply made, I wouldn't suggest purchasing this item."
3.0,Too small too short
3.0,"Looks like in the pic, but the chest part was big for me, even do I'm going to  wear it, what can you expect for the price."
3.0,I measured my daughter's feet to get the right size and they still came barely fitting her. The fur from the inside is poking through around the seams.
3.0,Good idea but about two sizes too small
3.0,This skirt had a weird fit on me. I don't like the material at all. Also not a fan of the little slit on the bottom. Wore it twice and it sits in the closet
3.0,This seems to run big and it's really thin.
3.0,"The color is not bright as seen in the product pictures, the colors look faded. I was really excited to have a dress with the bright rainbow colors & was disappointed with the faded version I received. The dress size is also too big - several inches bigger than the sizing guide provided in the product description. If I had known the sizing would be so big I would have ordered a Large."
3.0,"Looks nice but bulky and hard to read the date even in daytime back up light is very dim . Very hard to see anything on it  at night , not very luminous as described."
3.0,"Product is way too tight. Material has very little elasticity to it. If you want to cut off circulation to head, this product is for you."
3.0,Cute but super cheap.  The chest portion is just mesh and its thin and not very supportive. Its bigger than expected too.
3.0,"The color and thickness are nice, however the waist is too big and the legs are too tight on me, which causes them to fall down during running/squats/etc. Maybe it's just my weird body haha but I prefer more high waisted leggings that are tight enough to suck everything in without falling down."
3.0,I'm happy with this pin for the price. The quality is OK. Pretty much as pictured. Shipping took about 3 weeks.
3.0,"My son likes them, but he did say they run small. We got the same size as all his other Nike’s, but these ones for some reason are smaller and narrowing at the mid sol. He also says they’ve got a big dip (arch) at the mid sol which is kind of annoying, but he will be fine because he loves the color."
3.0,"I am hard on shades, go through a couple every year. Don't want to drop a pile of money on these. I reordered these after the first pair I owned lasted about 2 years before the soft rubber around the ear stems started to tear. A few marathons were run in them, so no regrets.<br /><br />But this edition feels a lot tighter than the previous one and I am afraid they are going to snap eventually, so rating 3 as a precaution. In terms of value for money, even if they do snap, between this one and the previous pair, they average out to a 3, so that rating feels fair."
3.0,"The material is very thin, not the best quality"
3.0,The Over the head design is aweful if you have big hair style. Both.models had to take Hair down to get small opening over their head. A clip or hook would have been a better design. We plan to have it cut and hooks attached it was purchased to make a jeweled costume.
3.0,Love this brand but can’t get a grip on the sizing. I ordered a small and medium top and they both feel super small. These medium bottoms feel like a small. I’m a 34b and wear size 27 in pants so I don’t feel like I need a large but these run so small lol
3.0,The light feature did not work. Impossible to plug in to charge.
3.0,"This is a minimalist-style card holder. Not many cards fit in it but if you just need a few dollars and a couple of cards, it may be exactly what you need. It's made of leather. The seams on it are well made with a very heavy thread, so it should last.  The size is 4-1/2&#34; long, 2-1/2&#34; wide."
3.0,"it didn't jump out  at me when I tried it on,  but was  okay with jeans"
3.0,"They are comfy, real waterproof ! Only con is the hair sticks to them & is difficult to get out. I don't wear mine often bc of this."
3.0,Very cool  my daughter loved this but it didnt fit. Too tight. She is 13 and has an average size hand.
3.0,Ok tank but not for an every day kind of tank so I returned.Was true to size and color though.
3.0,Letters not as clearly etched as appears in the picture. Metal was probably dirty under the laser engraver. Still ok for price point.
3.0,Thin material. I am an A and I still wouldnt wear it to the gym. Comfy for bed though!
3.0,Love them but are smaller in person
3.0,The front falls off easily
3.0,Too large. I am 5’1 and 110 lbs. small is too big. Material is high quality but order size down
3.0,"got for my wife. she likes it but wished the lace at the bottom was stretchy too. It's fine standing up, but laying down it is a bit rigid. She's going to take the lace trim off."
3.0,The flag kept coming off so I had to finesse it to keep it from coming out. I suggest it be attached to a coil type ring...like a tiny key type ring.
3.0,"Cute dress, the back didn’t work for me. It was not very flattering for a wider figure"
3.0,I got the 6-12 mo my son is 8 mo and average size. They barely fit on his feet. He will outgrow them in a month if that. But they are cute and they seem to be staying on. But i would definitely buy a size up.
3.0,Looks a lot cheaper than the picture. It was stingy on seam lines when I got it and it's see through. But still cute
3.0,The color shown is not what you get
3.0,Lenses snapped into ravishing Oakley frames with some play. They don't pop out but you can tell the lense is not snug.
3.0,"Cute but not the best design. Very uncomfortable and wobbly. The pointy back on the show shoves into my ankle, and the heels are placed too far inward, so even when the it isn't on the shoe leans to the outside wich makes it much harder to walk in"
3.0,I need a bigger size.
3.0,Cute but doesn’t stay on- weak plastic clasp
3.0,This is a very cute dress but the sleeves do come down very far at the arm pits and I don’t really like that. I love the color I choose and the material. I got this dress to wear to my sister in laws wedding and I’m not sure if I like the sleeves enough to wear it. It is a cute dress though.
3.0,"It was cute and comfy and hung just the right way at first but shrunk the first time I washed it! Still is cute, but now it’s just a normal long sleeve shirt rather than an oversized shirt."
3.0,Super cute but stopped working within a couple months.
3.0,It's a little on the small side for me.
3.0,Ordered a size medium and was too tight. Very uncomfortable to work in. Order size up.
3.0,%)
3.0,"I wear a size 6 shoe , thats what I ordered in this sandal and fits perfectly  ."
3.0,Longer than wide.  For plus size it will not wrap all the way to rhinestone front.  For a cape to hang off the shoulders it works well.
3.0,"The concept of this is great, but it doesn’t work that well. I found that even well-fitting  masks have a tendency to slide down leaving the bracket visible at the bridge of the nose once I start talking. Too bad."
3.0,The material is thin and cheap feeling compared to similar Nike products. The fabric bunches up slightly around the shoulders when I wear it. I was slightly disappointed.
3.0,Sleeves were to long.
3.0,Fit is nice but something about the cut isn’t to flattering and also material is on the thinner side!
3.0,"The hair on the wig was decent, but the way it was folded in the package cause it to have a point at the top of the wig that was hard to get to flatten.  Even when I pulled it down tightly over my scalp, the point still showed.  I looked like a cone head!"
3.0,Liked them and very nice
3.0,"Loved this belt for aprox 8 months.  Then the belt broke.  The advertising says &#34; ...high-quality genuine leather concealed with fortifying polyurethane.&#34;  Believe it is more Polyurethane than leather.  I have other leather belts that have lasted for years, one of them at least 10 yrs old now, warped a bit yes, worn yes, but certainly still usable and no cracks.<br /><br />I love the ratcheting style, will likely buy a replacement belt if I can find just the belt portion.  Hopefully, can find a belt made with a bit more leather to it."
3.0,The versatility of the item along with the variety of color schemes that was presented by the product.
3.0,"I'm 5'7"" and 198 lbs. The xl size are just a bit too tight and the pant leg ends just above my ankle."
3.0,"It was good at first. The quality is decent, but after a couple wears and washes, the letters start to come off. Keep in thought that I’ve had this sweater for at least 3 years. It’s fits well and im sure the letters can be put back on if ironed"
3.0,"Nice looking, but painful to wear after a short time."
3.0,Very cute print but sizes run extremely small.  Bought for my friend who wears 2XL and purchased a size up 3XL due to reviews stating they run small.  Didn't realize a size 3XL is more like a Medium for Women.  Didn't fit my friend.  Was disappointed because the shirt is cute but too small.  Recommend if you were any sizes bigger than Large do not order as they will not fit.
3.0,Nice but the strap is not in the right spot and does not stay up.
3.0,Only 3 stars because the we sizing is small but very durable
3.0,"My sleeve seem ripped in the first wash, no biggy. I am 5 ft 100lbs I ordered the smallest size, and I honestly should have ordered the medium, it is SNUG. Love the fashion, overpriced for it to rip before I could even wear it out though."
3.0,"Beautiful colors and v neck and sleeves tassels are nice, but runs smaller. I'm size 20 had to reorder!! Love it so much , reordered Xxl"
3.0,"the fit was great but it went all the way up my thigh. It was &#34;Pretty Woman-esque&#34; and because of the height of the heel, I didn't think it was for me - style wise. But other than that, it was a great price for what it was."
3.0,It's a little on the small side.
3.0,"Cute, but fits tighter than I expected"
3.0,"Speaker works great, but the top of the hat/beanie is way way to high/big. Also struggled to find the charging plug from the opening that was given. Nothing like the picture shown."
3.0,Nice quality and fit but words are in a sewn seam so it isn’t easy to read.
3.0,"Liked the fit although the it was somewhat smaller than I expected. Normally size 12/14 so got an XL. Sleeve and robe length fantastic, love the fitted back, it just didn't overlap for tying as much as I had hoped."
3.0,Bought these for bachelorette party gifts. Was excited when I saw they were foldable for travel. Only complaint was that only one hat came with a neck strap. The rest were missing. So they weren't delivered with all pieces as expected.
3.0,Hi I only gotten the one chain not the three that was posted that I should have gotten. Refund please or send the othe two chains. Thank you
3.0,"Only okay. They are thin, which I like. But they slide around and bunch up inside the slipper."
3.0,Its nice but keeps rolling down. Not enough silicone.
3.0,Fairly cheap
3.0,Looks and feels good but it is Not warm for Minnesota weather!
3.0,It’s cute but a little cheap feeling
3.0,You get what you pay for.  Arrived broken but easily fixed.
3.0,"Gloves look and fit great, but after just a few days the touch screen capability stopped working."
3.0,Very nice but kind of big
3.0,I love the dress but it is too large to wear. I would get it in a size smaller but it's very pretty.
3.0,They are smaller than I thought. Sized more for a teen or child.
3.0,Size chart is wayyyy off. Size up!
3.0,"The leather seems pretty thin.  If you have something in your shirt pocket and you put on this jacket, you will see the outline of it.  Makes me wonder how durable it will be.  But, it's a nice looking jacket."
3.0,Hard to see through but look great
3.0,It looks like a cool hat if you could figure out what size you need. They should have fixed numbers instead of vague small medium large.
3.0,"These jeans are super cute and besides the waist fit nicely. They are longer than expected but I wore them with wedges. They’re not high waisted at all as described, they actually fit low rise. Which was a bummer because that was the main reason I bought them. Oh well 🤷🏻‍♀️ They’re still cute."
3.0,"Perfect fit, and I wanted to love it, but it's very orange and not so brown! Definitely doesn't look good next to my purse, doesn't flatter my olivey skin tone like neutral colors usually do. Tried to give it a chance thinking maybe if I found the right boots? Surely couldn't find a match there!"
3.0,"Of all my cute new t-shirt dresses, I am least thrilled with this one. It looks like a pajama dress after one wash. I guess this one becomes house wear."
3.0,"I bought several similar shirts all XL, but this one was way too big, the others from other brands fit fine."
3.0,"As advertised,  But basically too small / short."
3.0,Keep banging my fingers on it will I'm strumming its dosen't gold really tight I wish it was slimmer
3.0,"No washing instructions. Fit was a bit tight, and they don’t stretch much, especially with the velvet lining."
3.0,"Pretty earrings however they are really small. I purchased two other pairs of earrings by Pandora, they are also really small. I may give to my grand daughter s."
3.0,It just barely fits 5 cards and dollar bills and no room at all for any change
3.0,[[VIDEOID:b2206fdbfb4df819369272518f641d42]] Very cute but very uncomfortable toe band.  Scratchy.  The heel squishies are fine and I've been pulling my foot back away from the toe and it stays on because of those.  Half thinking about getting another color half size up to see if that loosens it enough to be more comfortable.  They really have potential to be a favorite if I can correct that problem
3.0,Returned because it didn’t fit.  Very well made!
3.0,A bit snug. It was after the order arrived that I realized this is a Chinese made product which mean I should have ordered 1 size up.
3.0,They are very pretty but a bit smaller then expected
3.0,Cute design but have holes already
3.0,"came broken but was able to fix that, other than that lil negative note it looks really nice and pretty"
3.0,Cozy and long but pulls up quickly and needs shavihh NG regularly.
3.0,"Too tight for a small, petite person. very transparent. returned the next day."
3.0,Band broke during first use.
3.0,very cheap material but will be ok to wear a few times.. not as vibrant red as the pictures. probably wouldn’t recommend.
3.0,"The fabric is not very high quality, stitching around neckline was sloppy. I put it on a few times before going to the pool, but took it off each time because in the end I thought it looked too cheap."
3.0,"I bought a pair of these for myself,  but they were so tight that I gave them to my tiny petite daughter.  She wears a small in most clothing items,  these fit her in a medium."
3.0,"Watch strap is slightly stiff, hope it will relax after some days of wearing"
3.0,But fine in an emergency
3.0,Looks more yellow in person than the picture. Both are wheels are also lined with diamonds. I couldn't see that from the picture. I still really like it though.
3.0,"Started peeling and breaking, however when I first got it looked amazing"
3.0,"I have bought 2 of these, one for myself and one for a friend. Sadly they both broke within a month. If you are not going to buy it for daily wear then it's perfect but if it's daily buy a back up to be safe. They are super cute and add a little more to your outfit though!"
3.0,They are affordable but only after a few weeks they have some broken seams and I've had to fix one of the zippers. They do keep your feet warmer than without.
3.0,"It is hard to get the socks on even with the zipper. They may improve over time when they are used daily and washed. The craftsmanship was excellent, but they seem pretty small since my mother is petite and 95 years old. Not sure if they would work on someone larger."
3.0,"I am just less than a full size person. Men's small was perfect. Buttons were extremely loose. I'm going to have to re-sew. Too shalow of pockets, but useable if you want to pack a matchbook. Cheap but looks good."
3.0,"Used these for a Halloween custom. I wouldn’t get the biggest size cause they are  ridiculously big . There Was something on the lenses that made the leanse unclear and it wouldn’t come off. But for the price, they did the job."
3.0,"Cute cover up, haven’t wore it yet but it seems like he might get caught on things and pull."
3.0,Not as good as expected.
3.0,"It's an alright fit. It's not super form fitting like o wanted it to be, but I am a rather tiny lady so it's hard to find form fitting tops. The print is cute. It's not my favorite thing to wear, but it's a nice statement piece for a cute outfit."
3.0,"This product was ok, cheaply made at a low cost. Works for what I need but I wouldn’t suggest anything heavy and it will not hold anything larger in diameter than a soda can. Like I said though, works for what I need it for."
3.0,I really love this sports bra and I am a small women 120 lbs and the small is way too small
3.0,It's cute. Kinda frumpy. Fits true to size.
3.0,I usually ware a small/med. I had to return for a large. Large fit good but with no wiggle room.
3.0,"The bracelet was not as pictured.  The 2 hearts were on the top of where it says One Direction and they were upside down.  If I were to put them right side up, then the One Direction would be upside down.  I was not happy with it, but ultimately it was for my 8 year old daughter and she said she could live with the hearts being upside down.  It is adjustable fit."
3.0,"The black bodice of this dress fit me PERFECTLY: the armholes don’t cut into my flesh & aren’t too narrow or unflattering & the criss cross detail is really pretty! I’m 5’8”, 140 lbs, 36B & usually wear 8/10 or M/L.<br />BUT the great fit ends there. The black top to flowered skirt portion is waaaay too high on me - it hits at the rib cage for that ol’ “Is she pregnant?” look! There’s pockets in the swingy skirt & everybody likes pockets, but the length may be pretty long for anyone shorter, as it hit the bottom of my knee.<br />A cute, one-piece, easy dress that is just out of proportion for long-waisted me."
3.0,Dope hoodie but didn't fit how I wanted.
3.0,"Seemed like a nice enough hat, but did not seem true to size.  Too small, so it was returned."
3.0,This dress feels cheap with a classic itchy polyseter. It billows flattering on the bottom but is VERY tight up top. I am a 36C and my shoulders are by no means a line backers but I couldnt stretch
3.0,Purchase for my daughter she loves it it runs small you need to order up one to two sizes. And you need to wash separate it will bleed onto your other clothes. And it takes a long time for delivery
3.0,"I am 5'6&#34; and 170 lbs. I would normally take a large in anything, but after reading the reviews about how the size runs small, I ordered the xxl. The bottom fit great. The top was a little too small but still did the job. I am normally in a D cup but this top fit like a C. The padding is extremely thick and unfortunately not removeable. If it was removeable it would have fit great. Now, it does come with a pack of pushup inserts if you're on the small side."
3.0,"I ordered this dress in a size small, and it is small. I am 5'4 and 116 pounds for reference.<br /><br />The dress is pretty but I did find it a little short. However I tried it on with tights (see pics) and found it to work better that way. The gold in this dress is very &#34;gold&#34; and almost comes off a little Egyptian if that makes sense. The sequins are nice and not cheap looking which can easily happen with a sequin dress. The dress itself is actually very flattering on which I like and would look great for a night out. This was also a little itchy.<br /><br /> I attached some pictures to show how it looks.<br /><br />I received this dress at a discount in exchange for my review."
3.0,Sizing was way off. Size up
3.0,I ordered this one for high school prom and it didn’t fit well. It’s always hard to find correct size online.
3.0,Nice bag but smaller than expected.
3.0,"It's a unique dress, but the white is a little see-through. I'm 5'4"", 165lbs, wide frame, 34G, I ordered a large/10, but forgot that turtlenecks are terrible for my shape. The ribbed top ended right below my breasts, making then look enormous and saggy (I tried it on with my ""good"" bra), and the poofy shoulders made me look like a linebacker. I think this dress would look better on someone with a smaller breast size. The proportions were all wrong for me."
3.0,"Small charm not very polished or finished but it looks like the number 60. As far as silver content and weight, silver isn't that expensive and this charm is pretty small so you figure it out."
3.0,This product is smaller then i thought it would be & I don't like that it came with no chain..
3.0,"Ordered these sandals in the pink. They are true to color and style, very cute. I recieved item quickly. My only complaint and why I choose 3 stars was because I ordered these shoes in what they have listed as ""0-6""  months size and received ones that are for ""6-9"" months. Huge disappoint as we will have to wait longer before using them."
3.0,Not as tight as I hoped
3.0,"Came to me with one end of the wire holding up the beads broken- but I'm familiar with jewelry so I tried to just set it all back and reattach. It worked out after a few tries, and it's pretty on. The royal blue color is nice. Of course, from China and for the cost, you should expect it to come a little... off."
3.0,Nice shorts however when washed in cold water and hung dry they still shrunk a lot and the elastic waist band is all turned after washing. Thus makes them uncomfortable.
3.0,Cute but earrings want stay on .
3.0,It's not good for a stomach sleeper.
3.0,Very nice but is a little small perfect for a light breezy night
3.0,The yellow trim is not sewn straight and the fabric is see-through.
3.0,"Perhaps I missed it in the description but the posts are threaded like a screw, not your typical push-on earring back. So a bit more labor intensive to insert. Mildly disappointed."
3.0,"Shirt quality itself was good, but the length was too short. I’m 6’ tall and the length barely made it past my waist line."
3.0,"I was so happy to purchase this coat, very good quality, it really keeps you warm and Iike the color (beige) BUT the sleeves are way too short! Too roomy for M size and sleeves too short .Very disappointing. I have to return it."
3.0,Mostly accurate representation of the dress but fabric is thin and it just wasn't flattering. I'm 5'5&#34; and a sz.14/16US and this dress was down to my feet.
3.0,like the design. item too big for me need xs but was not available. you need to have available for smaller sizes
3.0,"this cap doesn't looks so good as the picture, and was delivered in an envelope.."
3.0,"This is a cute dress, but buyer beware.  Do proceed with caution.  I'm somewhat petite, but the sleeves are extremely tight.  As others have noted, while the yellow fabric is quite pretty, it's a weird blend - sort of like your grandma's satin nightgown or something.  It took a LONG time to arrive and is currently a wrinkled mess.  It's going to take a professional steam to make it wearable.  Lastly, the 'V' back is quite low -- like strapless bra low.  I'm not quite sure where I will wear this, as it's a bit daring for a conservative church service."
3.0,They are very cute but WAY too big for a baby. I was disappointed.
3.0,It is transplant.
3.0,Like the shoes but one strap was not seen to the shoes. They are not yellow but more of a butterscott
3.0,Had to return due to sizing.
3.0,There is zero tummy control and bottoms are super tiny. I’m a 38DDD and almost fit up top. I’m a 12-14 and bottoms are super short ie plumbers crack.<br /><br />I also ordered a 14-16 and the top fit perfect. However again the short bottoms were just as tiny as the size down.
3.0,The band is very nice looking. It matches the Samsung Gear Sport perfectly.  It adds a noticible amount of weight to the watch but it’s not terrible. Getting the links out to adjust the size of the band is a nightmare.
3.0,"It's well made, design is nice, yoshi is like colored in like crayon you can't really tell on the picture, still cute. The smallest size I bought youth small and its more like a large for kids. I was disappointed cause it was a present and this won't fit my 4 year old. But it fit my 8 year old nephew"
3.0,"Not really a fan of the quality of the fabric, but I got what I paid for."
3.0,Nice heavy gloves.
3.0,Too short for my 5 year old granddaughter.
3.0,These had a strange fit.
3.0,cute style but it runs small
3.0,"This is the second time I had to buy this item. I really like that it covers the thumb, but as I was taking it off, it ripped between the thumb and pointer, only after about 4 uses."
3.0,"The middle one, aka the best one, broke immediately so they were p much pointless now :'c at least they were cheap tho"
3.0,These were slightly smaller than the original lenses. I can feel then shift in the frames. Makes me think they will fall out.
3.0,I could have gotten a little smaller size for compression. I wanted to give my big girl issues some support during workouts. These are baggie on me.  Cool colors though.
3.0,"I wish I could not &#34;score&#34; this item because I wish I could have had them fit for my girl who's got entirely too wide feet, and feel an average &#34;meh&#34; score is a little unfair because they look like pretty good lil soccer shoes/boots.<br /><br />As stated, they looked like they would work and seemed well made, but when the rubber met the road they were too narrow in the toe-box for my daughter's Barney Rubble feet - something I had hoped this wider brand shoe would overcome, but she is the exception to the rule... she's got really wide feet.<br /><br />With regards to wide shoes, perhaps this one would work for your child who may have marginally wide feet; it's tough to find soccer cleats as they're nearly all made for kids with slender to normal feet - so do give them a try.  Honestly, these came to a close to a good fit.<br /><br />As a critique, perhaps a half size option in the wide would work (I didn't see one here as a purchase option, though I may have missed it).<br /><br />To Amazon's credit, the return was head-ache free.  Overall... a good retail experience."
3.0,Not much more than an iron on. Cool<br />But kinda cheap.
3.0,"I have a 15.75 in neck, and 32 in sleeves. This was much too big.<br />The fabric is quite transparent. If you're looking for a beat up shirt, this is it. But for a professional setting, I highly recommend against it."
3.0,You can tell that these are costume jewelry.
3.0,"Loved the material, and pattern, just ran small for someone with curves"
3.0,My daughter loved it. But for the price I thought it should of been bigger...
3.0,"size label says XXXL (made in china) however, actual waist size is about 22 inches,waist about 28 inches.This size is for a petit body"
3.0,Arrived with a brown stain on it. Otherwise it was a nice shirt.
3.0,nice material and production but they are low cut and i'm just not a big fan of that design.  but they are comfortable and would buy again if they came in a style that tied on your hips like normal pants.
3.0,I bought these for my little one when she was 6 months old. She just turned 1 and they’re still loose.
3.0,I got the pin for my Aunt she likes but it doesn't look like the picture just wasn't what I was expecting.
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, but it has some things I am not a fan of. Let me start by talking about the fabric of this dress. The fabric is very heavy. I have quite a few vintage style dresses and none of them are made from this type of fabric. It is thick and stretchy. It reminds me of a table cloth or upholstery on a restaurant chair. There is an invisible zipper down the back. The front has false buttons on the front and a collar with bow in the center. The bow is probably my least favorite part of the dress. The bow is two stretchy ribbons that are sewn in between the collar points in the front. No matter how I tie the bow it makes the collar lay weirdly. It would have been better to have a pre-tied sewn together bow.<br />I am about 5’6.5” tall and weigh between 135-140 pounds. I usually wear a US M or 6-8. After looking at the measurements in their size chart I ordered a large. The large is a smidgen too big, but a medium probably would have been tight. The bust of this dress is larger than I wanted. I need to wear a good push up bra with it to make it look good. This dress can be worn with or without a petticoat. I prefer it with a petticoat. I wear it with a 26-inch black petticoat. The petticoat adds a fullness to the skirt that I love. Because of the thickness and stiffness of this fabric it does look better without a petticoat than some vintage style dresses. This dress is okay, but the fabric and the bow make it not as good as I would like.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,This was just okay for what I needed but it does look just like the picture and the starfish earrings were adorable.
3.0,Holy cow these guys are huge. I bought a large based on other reviews and my current sizes...but they swallow me whole! I feel like I aged many many years when I put these on. But they are very soft and I like the colors.
3.0,"I ordered a size 2x for what should have been a size14 American size. The top fits fine, but the shorts fall off."
3.0,OK quality. It serves its purpose
3.0,"Worn for only 4 months. Toe area is tight, and a little painful. As for waterproof..... I don't think so. Good price is as about the best I can say. Going back to my last pair in spite of the extra $."
3.0,I loved this one of my favorites but it turned so quickly other than that it really is well made and soooo cute
3.0,it falls off really easy
3.0,The dress is made backwards it is long in the front and short in the back.  Kinda awkward.
3.0,Keeps the wind out
3.0,Cheap fabric and wrinkles easy. It might have been ok if I ironed it.
3.0,Squished and bent out of shape.
3.0,"Products looks great and is very classy, however the print is starting to rub off after one week."
3.0,fits as expected but nothing spectacular
3.0,The chronograph is not working properly
3.0,The product is fine but it took months to arrive! It looks like the picture. It would fit almost anyone.
3.0,"I know there is variation between screen display color, but the green just isn’t even close to the color as it appeared my screens. There’s some stretch to the fabric, so it did a reasonable job of accommodating my small waist and bigger bust & hips. The lace is nice. I’m just bummed about the color."
3.0,"Runs large, not a true buckle. You hook the strap rather than actually buckle th he shoes."
3.0,the top of the bathing suit is extremely small for a large
3.0,This woudl be better if it had a plug inside for each cord and then a outside cord to plug into a charger and plug everything in at once and charge it for the blue tooth items.
3.0,The material is fine but I expect something with more fabric and stitching so that it can go through more washings.
3.0,It's ok...doesn't smell like leather & it's heavy even empty.
3.0,"Like the band overall but I wouldn't get this if you like to change bands frequently. Maybe it's the specific one I received but one of the pieces is VERY, and I mean VERY difficult to put on and take off. Maybe mine was machined wrong? Not sure if it's worth the effort to exchange. Looks nice though. Color match is 90% there with the Series 4 gold (rose gold). Not perfect but pretty good. Leather seems to show scuffs easily but they kind of blend in."
3.0,"The shoe was comfortable, but runs quite small"
3.0,The sizing is WAY off. Order about two sizes bigger than you would think if you want a loose fit like on the model. I can squeeze into mine but it's not exactly flattering the way some other suits in this tank style are.
3.0,Material is very thin and almost see through.
3.0,It was a good purchase ..... i actual regiftedsome and persons were happy with it
3.0,"I bought in Feb. 2016 and am writing this review in Sept. 2017. I bought these to keep the wind out of my eyes while riding. They didn't work for me. I have a wide face and a narrow bridge so the glasses end up squeezing my temples to the point that the lenses float away from my face letting the wind get into my eyes. I have tried using the gasket and it rests on my cheekbones causing the bridge of the glasses to float out away from my face- once again allowing the wind to get into my eyes. Eating or talking will cause the glasses to move out away from my face and ride lower on my face as well. I think if you have a narrow face, these would work fine, but for me, they weren't good. Wiley X is a good brand, in my opinion- I still wear them daily and they haven't broken!"
3.0,"Cute shirt, but rough material and it looks tapered like a maternity shirt in the pic but it's not it's more short and wide like a regular t shirt but for a bigger person. I have yet to wear it I've had it a couple monthes but waiting till I get a little bigger and really fill it out I'm only 5 monthes. I ordered a large it does appear to be long enough to cover my belly  I'm 5'7 and 130 pounds now and I'm a 36DDD and seems that it will fit alright. I left 3 stars cause the pic shows it as long and tapered and the material is a bit rough and the price is a little steep in my opinion. But it shipped quickly"
3.0,These earring are nice but the magnets do not hold as well as what we thought they would. They tend to fall off. Some are stronger than others. You have to find a matching pair of strong back magnets so you don't loose an earring. Be careful so you don't loose one.
3.0,"a beautiful scarf marred by poor packaging the result of which one corner was damaged... however it can be folded to hide that. for such a quality scarf it should come in a box, or better protected as my other scarves have."
3.0,Runs a lot smaller than described
3.0,"This is a damn good watch, no doubt about it. Like all the watches in the Presage series it's well-designed and built and offers great value for the money. But there's a serious problem: the great disparity between the way it is represented online and what you actually get (Amazon and pretty much everybody else who vends this product online use the same photographs, obviously supplied by Seiko itself). The photo shows a watch with a thoroughly green face. What you get is a watch which seems black under many lighting conditions, out of which a rather ghostly green comes swimming up in very bright light. It's so dramatically different from way it's represented online what when I first unboxed it my immediate reaction was that I had been sent the wrong product. Some folks will like this, but many will hate it and I bet that Amazon has experienced an unusually high rate of returns from dissatisfied customers. My advice: don't buy this watch without having seen the real thing so that you know what you'll be getting. (Seiko offers a matching watch in red, the problem is not nearly so acute with it).<br /><br />My only other criticism of this and most other watches in the Presage series is that the case is rather thick for a dress watch and looks a tadklunky. Use of a domed crystal instead of a box one would have been a better choice."
3.0,"It’s cute and all but if you are skinny like me, it won’t b as flattering. It was baggy at the coochie area but if I was thicker it would’ve been cuter"
3.0,"I ordered what was supposed to be pink, it looks a peachy color so it doesn’t match the dress I wanted to wear it with. I guess i’ll keep it, maybe I’ll find something else to wear it with."
3.0,There is an opening at the collar. The quality is bad.
3.0,"Looked like the Apple band. Fit great for a while but stretched out. Bought an 8, should have got a 7 ( sizing matched Apple guides), just didn’t last. For the price, I can’t complain, just wouldn’t get another."
3.0,They are nice looking and fit good.  Had to return because they did FOG up the first time out snow shoeing making it very hard to see.
3.0,"It’s not the best quality but it’s still nice none the less! Thin , but stretchy material."
3.0,"Love the look of it.  Feels nice.  However, the clasp to open and close it has to be done using two hands.  If you just try to use one hand, the clasp stays flush.  You have to put your hand in the pocket and press it forward in order for the clasp to stick out far enough to turn.  This is hard when you are in the store and there are people waiting behind you.  Also, I can see where the clasp scratches and shows where it turns."
3.0,Beautiful colors but elastic on bottom is extremely tight while body is loose. Will keep shirt for price. Normally wear a medium but had to order the XXL.
3.0,I purchased for a dance performance and had no other option. It fits a bit snug and it rubs on my forehead to the point where during rehearsals it created chaffing. The rehearsals consist of taking it on and off a few times and we practiced for 2 hours. I didn't realize until my friends pointed it out. I now need to figure out how to line it
3.0,Low quality fabric. It is very rough
3.0,These skirts are great in every color EXCEPT white.<br />I have this skirt in 2 other colors and it’s great. The white is horribly see-through.<br /><br />Note: The skirt is a lot whiter and brighter than it looks in my photo.
3.0,only problem i have is that the body length is too short.. the sleeves and chest look and feel good
3.0,"Excellent for the price, fit great; 3 stars because there were no pockets as indicated."
3.0,An okay product
3.0,"I prefer the waist of my leggings to not make me look like I have love handles, thats part of the reason I wear leggings. These scrunch at the waist and give you almost a muffin top. Great material but could do without the elastic sinch."
3.0,For the price you'll be paying for these shoes. They're great. I ended up changing out of them into another pair of shoes because they rubbed a blister into the back of my ankle but overall they're good shoes.  Tons of compliments.  I wear an 8.5 with a slightly wider than normal foot and they fit just fine.
3.0,It's quite beautiful but it runs much smaller than expected. I order a lot from Patty and I always get a Medium but this medium was just too tight.
3.0,"I have tattoo's that need to be covered for work. The quality is nice and comfortable but totally could see all my tattoos so slightly disappointed. I would return them but I opened em so I feel like they're unreturnable, at least by my standards, I won't do that to the company."
3.0,Bigger than I thought and turned out that is a lot of zippers. Took me back to the 80s. Not real impressed with it.
3.0,Item did what it was supposed to but seemed very cheaply made.
3.0,Nice for a few times wear... of course its not real gold so its not meant to last...it looks beautiful the first few times your wear it then it tuyrns very quickly...it turned in about a week...
3.0,"I was really, really excited about this jacket because it looks so nice, and I was not disappointed when the actual jacket did look like what you see in the picture provided. It's just too bad the size is very small. I ordered an XXXL expecting that to be super huge on me because that was what I originally was looking for. Putting this on felt like a medium size (maybe large). I was still able to fit in this, surprisingly, but it was tight around the arms. Not too badly tight, but still enough to bother me. This review goes out to the curvy girls who are considering buying... this is surely not for you. (I'm 5'9, 210 btw)"
3.0,The dress is cute I got a size Large I’m 5’4 155 pounds the dress fit like perfect the material was ok I had to returned it I wanted this dress for a wedding but it was too short on length ones I put my heels the dress was way above my ankle I didn’t like that
3.0,The letters start falling off as so as you put it on but the crown is great.
3.0,Somewhat small but ok.
3.0,Not as effective as wanted. Better for a quick fix.
3.0,Love the fabric  but the shirt is short and.shrinks even more in the wash making it too short to wear<br /> The fabric is nice and soft
3.0,"Overall a nice watch however is it worth the high price tag?<br /><br />The pocket watch is a bit bigger than normal. Quality is nice, it has a nice weight to it, and it fits comfortably in the pocket.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1 Larger than average size<br />2 Face of the watch is very nice (it was a factor in my purchase)<br />3 Keeps accurate time (sounds strange, but my last pocket watch did not)<br />4 No battery to be replaced. You will need to wind it up each day<br /><br />Cons:<br />1 The watch hands are sometimes hard to see. The hands on the watch are very thin, and placed against the see through background (silver in color) the watch hands tough to see in certain lite.<br />2 since it is a wind up watch you can hear the ticking of the watch. I am not sure if this is a good or bad thing however I can hear it ticking away during the night.<br /><br />The watch opens up on both sides of the pocket watch. The hinges are located on the 9 o'clock side. You can also see the inside of the watch (kinda cool).<br /><br />I don't have any real concerns, however I wonder if it warrants the price. With this said...I am keeping it and hope to enjoy it for years!"
3.0,"Received product quickly.  The size was not what I ordered. Was a small version of what an extra large should be. Would not have been comfortable to sleep in, so I had to return it. Too tight around the chest & waist. Need something more flowing for ease of turning during sleep."
3.0,"I did not expect the opening under the arms, so I had to send it back.  But it was very pretty and fit fairly well"
3.0,It get rusty quick
3.0,I liked but it does run smaller. It fit a little too snug.
3.0,"I know this is advertised as a small bag, but for me it's too small to be practical.  I wear size 12 mens shoes and they barely fit in the shoe pouch.  With the shoes in the pouch, there is barely enough room for my clothes inside of the bag.  The ""wet"" pouch is nice, but way too small to hold anything bigger than a hand towel.<br />I really do like this bag, the features are awesome.  I just wish that it came in a larger size."
3.0,"I ordered 5 of these dresses in different prints, all XL. There were three different fits! One a tad too tight, two felt a size too large, and two were as described.. thank goodness for free returns.  But, the one that is a tad to tight is my favorite. Do I return? I’m still thinking. The lemon print and the navy floral were size correct.  The mint and pineapple dresses are too baggy and I will return them."
3.0,"The dress is beautiful.  However, I ordered an xl as I usually wear a 16-18 and it was HUGE! I am about 5'8&#34; and about 200 lbs.  I am going to return and order a large. I will post a new review for that order. Also, for any that may be wondering - the liner stops at the knee, but is full so no worries about it being too tight.  I would say the safe bet on ordering this would be to order based on your top half as the bottom is plenty full enough."
3.0,"My kids went through a Yu-Gi-Oh phase where they just had to have what the characters in the TV show had (along with scads of trading cards, of course).  This did not hold up very well to hard play, though.  The dangly bits came off pretty easily.  It wasn't too hard to put them back on, but they kept falling off and eventually were lost."
3.0,Make sure to order a size larger than what you normally wear. I'm a size 10 but found these too be to snug so I'm attempting to return them to get a 10.5 so we'll see how they handle their returns.
3.0,I was looking forward to wearing this to a special event.  The chest size is extremely tight/small.  (I am not a big chested woman).  Beautiful but I cant wear it..
3.0,Shrinks like crazy. Go 2-3 sizes up!
3.0,Higher waisted than expected and very thin material.
3.0,"Your company and delivery was great. I just didn't like the shoe. It looks better in the picture, than on my feet. I will still look at you company first when I want to order shoes."
3.0,I ordered for a child. The item is SO big my grown son says its too big for him too!!
3.0,"The strap looks good and quality, but feels thin. Also strap is two layers top being a leather veneer and bottom is black and what I believe to be “pleather”. Overall if your looking for a cheap great looking strap this will do, but if you want a more quality strap that will last I suggest you spend some more and get a thicker leather."
3.0,"It is extremely long and large, it did not fit well at all. Will have to make sure I purchase petite and smaller  sizes in the future. Pretty pattern, just wish it would have fit. The cost of alterations would exceed the purchase price of the dress."
3.0,Too loose on top and too long
3.0,The dress was more see through than the picture shows.. I’m a 16-18 and ordered a XXL. I would’ve been happier with the size if the dress wasn’t see through.
3.0,I ordered a small and it was a bit too large. (I'd usually wear a medium) It's reaallly cute though. I'm going to give it to my sister instead of send it back. She likes it too and it fits her. She is probably a large.
3.0,Very cute dress but a very tight fight.
3.0,I’m 5’6 163 pounds . I bought a medium.The top runs very small and the mock neck is too big around the neck . the shirt stops right under my boobs  to the point that I’ll have to be careful raising  my hands. I considered buying a large but the mock turtle  neck  would probably be the size of my head!!! Waaay tooo much room on the neck!!!!! . I 👍 the skirt. . I Will probably try to find a different top. Cute concept for the price.
3.0,"SMALL/BLUE, 5 7&#34; 115-120 Lbs, Design is super, material is thick enough so do not need to wear slip or anything but the shoulder is too loose, keep coming down and too much revealing chest, I will have to add about 1-2 inch material on the top portion to wear this dress."
3.0,Wasn’t expecting much when purchasing this item. But was little upset when the music playing is really low. Almost have to pin the music to you’re ear too hear it. Also does very quickly not even half way to my 8 hour work day this product was already going to die and need to be charged. Also ran a little small but at the same time you do get what you paid for.
3.0,"liked style, color and fit."
3.0,Short life
3.0,Nice but are not squat proof like the reviews said
3.0,"I finally received the Halloween masks that I ordered almost 6 weeks ago - AFTER HALLOWEEN!  The masks are great - nicely printed, very comfortable, nice sized.  The 3 star review is for the shipping and unkept promise of a mid-October delivery."
3.0,"I normally wear size 16 and ordered XL.  The material is very nice, but the gown runs really small."
3.0,"The watch is well made, but the color difference is too big"
3.0,"Product fit: short in the torso. I normally wear medium/ large depending on tightness in chest, this came to me in XL ( I believe order L) but Xl fits well with but much room to spare."
3.0,"They all broke very easily in about a month. One of them came broken in the package. They are very cheap, so if you just need them for an outfit it's ok, but don't expect them to last long."
3.0,Nice quality but it's MUCH smaller than I expected
3.0,The earrings are soooo cute but they took 8 days to get here 😭<br />I got a lot of compliments on them though :)
3.0,Can carry a Fire 10&#34; but only after you cut out the inside zipper.
3.0,It's a cute dress and fit great everywhere but in the chest area and my boobs aren't super large.
3.0,It's fairly large even after washing and drying it a couple times to try to shrink. My toddler is hard to fit so I was hopeful!
3.0,"Good price,  cute pattern awkward fit/style.  Ah well,  I knew what I was getting into."
3.0,"UPDATE: After wearing the dress the first time, I noticed imperfections in the fabric. Thin lines like runners in pantyhose material. I was afraid it would snag and spread so I opted to return the dress. Such a shame.<br /><br />  For reference, I'm normally a size 14, pear shaped. 38-34-46. The XL fits me perfectly. Keep in mind this dress is a polyester spandex blend so while it does stretch alot, it also hugs and will not hide imperfections. So if youve got some rolls or dimples you want to hide, you'll want to wear a slip or shapewear with this dress. I love that this dress stretches so well, I dont even have to bother with the zipper, just pull it over my head. Now if I wanted a form fitted look, I probably could have sized down to a large without busting out of the dress. But because I'm not a tiny girl, I opted for the XL comfortable fit. The chest and armholes aren't too snug  and the length is a couple inches below the knee on me (Im 5 foot tall) I would buy this dress in other prints. The color of the navy with white flowers that I got is just as expected from the picture. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the quality of material doesnt seem like it will hold up well to washing or last long. And the material also will tend to get warm, not breathe well."
3.0,the necklace is beautiful but the link to fasten broke...
3.0,item was way too small
3.0,"Pockets are too short. Other than that, very good quality."
3.0,"Came with rips in the seems. Should've been sewn better, poor quality, but pretty dress. Thankfully I can do the repairs myself, but constantly worried I'm going to rip something while wearing it."
3.0,"I’m sure the product works fine but if you look closely at the pics that advertise it you don’t see one person actually wearing the product, just have one guy who wears it and uses it so we can see someone actually using it and so we see that it’s ligit  and it’s something worth buying"
3.0,Unknown if they work well- nice color. Third email so rating is this.
3.0,One of the snaps (plastic) broke after the second wear.  But the fabric is soft and comfortable.
3.0,"Better done costume. This must be put in over-the-head as there are no closures. I had to safety pin my own darts into the waistline to create a waist. This is likely due to the fact the Child cannot otherwise get the dress on. She had to have her arms outstretched, then I had to carefully pull the dress over her and down while helping her fish her arms into the sleeves and face through the neck hole, etc.<br /><br />The length is perfect and the skirt is full. When you add the darts with careful placement in the tush area, you won’t need a petticoat. However, a slip is necessary or some shorts. This is a simple cotton woven fabric and quite sheer. Proper undergarments are necessary."
3.0,O love the shirt but will he ordering it again a size up.
3.0,Looks cheap and gets caught in everything. Quality is alright tho.
3.0,"Color is nice but the fabric is low quality, kind of disappointing"
3.0,beautiful dress was smaller than expected
3.0,Used for a beerfest photo shoot. The mug hat is great the beer bottle is a tight fit and great for little heads. Great material and lasted the shoot and is still apart of our photo props
3.0,"It's literally a different shirt than is pictured.  It's like this company looked at a picture of this model in this shirt and try to replicate it.  The shirt itself is fine, the material is soft and somewhat sheer.  The best part of the picture is the way the shoulders hang.  In the picture, the string is holding the shoulders on, and the material gathers.  In real life, the shoulders are elastic and look cheaply gathered, like curtains or something.  The shirt if fine for the price, but do not order it and expect it to look like the picture."
3.0,I wish it was double sided
3.0,"I like them but I have large feet size 13 shoes so they don't rise very far on my legs. Also, two socks had holes in them."
3.0,"Super cute in the front and on the sides, perfect size but unfortunately my booty did not fit in the bottoms. And not in a cute cheeky way, it cut in really bad. (Perfect for small/fit bootys)"
3.0,"The PJs are soft and comfortable.  The however did shrink in the first wash. I got a large for comfort.  It now fits like a medium.  If it didn't shrink, i would have given it a higher rating."
3.0,"Love the look and size. However, the hook which fastens the strap on to the side of the purse broke off when attaching it. Had to use a paper clip to secure it. Not happy about that."
3.0,"I Order 2, the lg was smaller then the med."
3.0,"It feels like thick felt, not suede. Otherwise it looks like the photos that the seller provides."
3.0,Had to return. Too tight.
3.0,"On one hand, finding something that fits perfectly is hard... on the other hand, it feels like its made of the fabric you'd make into rolling briefcases. ugh. No freaking way this fabric was intended for clothing."
3.0,"I just received this dress in the light blue.  I plan to wear it for my maternity photos.  I am currently 6 months pregnant but had no issues with the fit since the belly area is loose and the material is stretchy.  The elastic waistband helps it stay in place nicely.  I need to practice more of the styles from the photo examples, but it seems diverse.  The only downside I can see is that the length hits about 2&#34; above the top of my foot.  Not a big deal and I do plan to keep the dress. I am 5'6&#34;, 36B cup and 147lbs (6 mos. pregnant) and small was the correct size for me. The fabric is light but not sheer.  Plan to wear the proper undergarments though!<br /><br />Update: I attempted to wear this dress to my shower but it just didn't work out. Knowing that I couldn't wear a strapless bra because of how low the back is cut, I bought breast pasties. Well, in the light blue you could still see everything. Not appropriate for most occasions! A darker color may not be noticeable, but I just couldn't imagine actually wearing this in public without giving everyone a show."
3.0,"I purchased the purple shirt.<br /><br />It has a slick, almost plastic-like feel, not very comfortable.<br /><br />I also have the grey, which is a different fabric, more cotton like.<br />The shoulders are a bit tight."
3.0,"I like how it fits in my pocket but honestly it is really difficult for me to fan out the cards, so i stumble around trying to get a card out as someone waits for me to be done struggling. i like the concept but it is just hard to get my cards out. I have been using this for almost two months by the way, this was written by my own personal opinion."
3.0,"Very pretty dress however a few things to mention.  Zipper was very difficult to move on the delicate lace part of the dress.  I was nervous that I would rip the material.  On the right body this dress would look great, just not on me.  Waist was a little high which was not flattering on me.  Alas, the dress was returned."
3.0,looks nice but didn't come with a key like advertised
3.0,Price is great. My problem is that the o for the clasp neither I nor my husband could close it. I had to put a bigger one on...
3.0,3 stars because it is a cute top but it runs small. Large is more like a medium.
3.0,there okay
3.0,Did not fit the way I hoped. Was a bit loss
3.0,love the purse.....but the strap came with only 1 hooking clasp on it......rather useless as a strap without clasps at both ends
3.0,This is ALOT smaller than I was expecting. I normally wear a medium and I ordered a large so it would be oversized. It is borderline too small. It’s comfortable and cute but size up.
3.0,"too small for feet, too large for boots"
3.0,"This Fred’s fit great and actually made me usually not so appealing curves look great but the train of mesh looked like the inside of the dress was falling out.  It’s way longer than the dress itself, even if it’s supposed to show.  I considered cutting it but in the end I returned it instead."
3.0,Very pretty color but fits too small than expected!
3.0,The material is not the greatest
3.0,"I am enjoying the softness of this band, however the only negative thing is that is only available in one size and I have extremely small wrists and found that it was just a little to big as it came and I had to cut the length down to make it work for me. Other than that this is a really great band."
3.0,Runs small which makes it tight
3.0,The top is a bit loose I'm usually a medium but this top was a little loose and the bottom was a bit tight it looks like the picture it's a nice bikini but wish you could order separately
3.0,I actually love the ook of this but can't find the right bra to fit without looking stupid.
3.0,I ordered up a size based on other reviews that it was too big.
3.0,It didn’t stay where it was supposed to - the top rolls down
3.0,I love this but it tarnishes quickly.
3.0,Material is not good for an athletic/gym stringer sticks to your skin a lot but for the price is decent
3.0,"So I ordered this big, because I like my sweaters big. The arms are wayyyyy to big and the body part of the sweater is small it’s like a large sweater with XXL sleeves. Super disappointed, I can’t wear it in public because you can clearly see something is wrong with how it’s made. Giving three stars instead of one because the material is soft and the print is nice."
3.0,Broke second time I wore it. Cheaply made
3.0,Order a size bigger than what you normally wear.<br /><br />The design would lead you to believe it is a cold weather garment but it is more of a cool weather garment.  The material is light and breathes but it feels drafty and there is no elasticity to it. I am returning mine because though it fit it was tight on my shoulders and arms and if it shrunk after a wash or two it would be to small everywhere else as well.
3.0,A little flimsy but a great price for someone like myself who tends to lose or break their glasses.
3.0,"The boot is so cute! I loved it, but that Locamotive Grey was just too Grape looking.. I actually thought the color itself was beautiful, but maybe for towels or something."
3.0,"I ordered the short sleeve button down midi dress in light blue. The material is nice and breezy, except not stretchy or flowy. I Ordered a Large according to the sizing they provided.I am 5’7, 160 and thicker from hips down. I would say it runs a little small. Order a size up. The dress didn’t have much room on the skirt part so it looked funny on me, it’s not as flowy or roomy as I would have liked. Kinda stuck straight onto my hips and thighs. The light blue also looks like nurse scrubs so I might suggest a different color. Unfortunately returning."
3.0,"Needed to test out myself to be the judge. Verdict is in, buying numerous."
3.0,Got for gf.  Did know that they are pretty much see through
3.0,Decent pendant but the magnets holding the necklace together pops off too easily.
3.0,I ordered a small and it was too big.
3.0,"I expected this shirt to have more of a shaped construction, like the picture.  It's actually quite boxy.  The color is as shown, and the fabric is a polyester chiffon, which is great for wash and wear.  The sizing is accurate if you follow the chart.  I like the hi-lo hem, but once again, it is not fitted like the picture.  I will still find ways to wear it, but I was hoping for something more tailored."
3.0,The shorts run large and don’t seem to have much compression.
3.0,Was not a perfect fit but it doesn't fall off.
3.0,I returned this dress because I could not even zip it up. I read the reviews and bought a size larger but I think honestly I would have to jump 5 sizes larger than my usual size for it to fit.
3.0,"The stone was crooked & it wasn’t big enough for the setting; there was a gap between the stone & edge of the setting. I knew it was too inexpensive, I should’ve known."
3.0,"A bit dissapointed that when I received my glasses today the nose pad was missing. :( Overall, they're cute and I enjoy wearing them, though. Would've been completely satisfied had that one problem not arose. And I noticed they're screw in? So it's a bit questionable how the pad came out and it- nor the screw- was anywhere to be seen in the bag or packaging the glasses came in. I even searched the floor just in case it could've dropped."
3.0,The fabric is a little different than I expected. I don't know how to describe it. I feel like the design will be ruined very quickly when you sit or wash it.
3.0,"If this fits up to a size 8 , well , they must have a tiny wrist , this barely fits me period , whether I try on my left or right wrist , it is okay , nothing to get excited  about in my honest opinion . Came fast , well packaged , might gift it to a smaller person though because it is a hassle to get on and off ."
3.0,My daughter loves it but if is too short
3.0,"This sweatshirt was way smaller than the usual sweatshirts in that size.  The material seemed nice, but we will be returning it."
3.0,"Good quality, but if your daughter is slim, it's going to be much too wide and have huge gaps showing in the leg area. Had to return it. Thank you for the free return."
3.0,The images on the clothes are like iron on and not actual paint or part of the fabric. This was kind of disappointing for as expensive as this item is that it looked and felt like an iron on product. Which is concerning when washing and drying it in washing machine and the dryer.
3.0,Broke in half after 2 weeks
3.0,"I'll be saving this for when I am 7 months pregnant as it is pretty large. Very warm, perfect for fall!"
3.0,"Very cute bag for the cost, but doesn’t hold as much as I thought it would. Great for snacks, I would consider this a smaller tote. But definitely super cute!"
3.0,Runs very large.  I bought XS and it was very roomy.  Im 5'3 and 165lbs.
3.0,"Love these, but they run about a .5 size too small. Probably won’t get to wear them cause they’re too tight. Not a warm shoe either, thinly made."
3.0,Theyre pretty not the best quality but still very nice
3.0,"Sleeves were too tight.  Had to cut them ,to make them short sleeve in order to fit."
3.0,"Ordered this as a coverup for several swimsuits.  Was disappointed when it arrived.  The color is more of a wedgewood blue. I gave it 3 stars because it is cute and works well for someone like me with a short frame (5'3"").  If it would have actually been navy, it would have been a 5-star review."
3.0,"The gloves are okay for the price. They run small. I have tiny hands and ordered a size small. I can wear them. However, they’re a little tight. I recommend ordering a size up."
3.0,Color is not as shown.  Straps are baggy and slide off the shoulders.
3.0,"I wasn't a big fan of this shirt even though it looks exactly like the picture. I was hoping it would be a little more flowy and flattering than it actually was. The neckline is pretty high while the bottom layering hits a funky area on my belly. So instead of cute and summery, it looks kinda frumpy and fattening on me. Maybe it would look cuter on a different body type though. Not a bad shirt for the price."
3.0,"This is a pretty piece, but I'm not sure it was worth the price. The silver is thin and the back is rough. $25 or $30 might have been a fair price."
3.0,"I'm 6'5&#34; and ordered XXL. Legs were a little shorter than expected, they aren't quite as high as capris but they are not down to the ankle. Waistband can slip down a little too often, but the compression of the pants is great, they are nice and tight through the knees.<br /><br />For the price, they do the job."
3.0,Somewhat small around the chest area feel like it would show nipple if you did wear now show bra along with the romper  even though  it has &#34; built-in bra&#34;
3.0,Very cute outfit-runs a little big.
3.0,I'm getting a lot of compliments on it!
3.0,Not as shiny/shimmery as I would have liked.
3.0,This is a crop top. It appears longer on the model. It stoped at my belly button and im only 5'3. Beautiful otherwise
3.0,There ok ! Not real pretty !
3.0,These run small and hardly cover my chin and tip of my nose. Like most masks of the cloth variety. No stretch or give and comfort is not a word I would use to describe having to clench my jaw to keep the mask over my mouth and nose. Very light weight masks.
3.0,"Face is too small for a workout watch, and the strap is barely long enough to be useable. (From the info online, it's hard to tall that until you receive the watch) The features per se are fine."
3.0,"These are cute but absolutely not slip-proof. I need to attach the headband with clips to keep it on my head. My head runs a little small and I have problems with headbands and wasn’t really hoping these would be the fix but I was disappointed upon trying them. They may stay on my head if I open them all the way, but then they cover my whole head and don’t sit with the curves of my head."
3.0,"The colors are lovely, and bright. The fabric is kind of stiff,... they stretch and lose shape somewhat while wearing them... not soft at all.  Overall I would say I like the socks, but they are over priced in my opinion. I don't think I would buy another pair...I expected more for the price."
3.0,Love this shirts but your shorts and pants have a fuz ball issue weather you wash them separately
3.0,they will do
3.0,"It is the correct width (20mm), but the depth of where the pins connect to the watch is too short for the length of the lugs on the watch.  If you zoom way in on the pic, you can see where it just can't quite reach the place where the pin needs to insert.  Plus, this watch band is too long for my wrist (5.75""), even when I've made it as short as possible.<br />3 stars because it is a really nice looking band."
3.0,"Although the quality of the material and construction of the product is excellent, it runs very small.  I ordered a six larger than I normally wear and was disappointed that I could not pull them past my hips."
3.0,"There cute but, rip really easy."
3.0,the material felt nothing like the ones we had bought in a store.  they were the same type/style but these from amazon feel very plastic and not material and soft
3.0,Brim is extremely long. Never seen a brim stick out soo far. It’s almost double the length of a normal one.
3.0,So the shirt is really cute but the outfit didn’t come the way that it look like in the picture. The shorts were not as fluffy as the picture looks and that’s missing the purple bow?
3.0,it is nice size sloths are big enough for  credit cards to slide in and slide out but the whole feel of it is very plastic but  it is functional- Zipper works good
3.0,WAY TOOO BLUE!.. But a nice bag. I use it for the gym and short vacations that requier an over night bag.
3.0,"This is a beautiful ring, but wearing it is another matter.  It should have been smooth on the back side, instead it is the same all the way around and is very uncomfortable to wear.  I tried to wear it, but gave up and now it sits in the drawer.  Too bad!"
3.0,I wish I could give 5 stars! I love the dress! The fit is great and it is such a cute style. Super comfortable! The only negative is that it is totally see-through!! I wish it wasn’t! I wanted to wear it as a casual dress but don’t feel comfortable with that as you can see everything underneath. I have been wearing it as a swimsuit cover.
3.0,The hat is somewhat larger than a normal sized baseball hat. Does not fit medium sized head at all.
3.0,Wanted to love this dress but its just poorly made. There is no lining in the dress so you can see through the gaps in the buttons. Its also sooo boxy and unflattering. Sadly will be returning
3.0,Seems nice and well made but will not fit 12.9 iPad Pro in a case
3.0,They are very  small.
3.0,These sandals look lovely. The bottoms feel very comfortable as well. Only down side is that they are so uncomfortable between the toes when walking.
3.0,"Not the material I was expecting. Looked more cotton in the photos. Other than that it is very comfortable, and a great color!"
3.0,Super cute but clasp weird and useless
3.0,I thought this dress was super cute. I have narrow shoulders so I couldn't keep it up. but i needed a bigger size for my chest. I returned it
3.0,"These slippers were returned because the size was too small.  Therefore, I do not know about how well they operated or how comfortable they are."
3.0,I ordered the black one and the color is a little off. I didn't notice it until I placed it in my closet up against other black clothing. It is lighter and has a reddish cast to it. As far as fit I am 5'3&#34; and ordered a large.  It comes about mid hip. I was hoping it would be a little longer to cover my entire bottom.<br />I like the feel of it and that it is light weight. I wouldn't mind having it in another color.
3.0,I bought the XS and it literally fit me like a dress.  I wore it over tight leggings and decided to keep because I love what it says. I get a lot of laughs whenever I wear this puts me in a better mood.
3.0,"Runs quite small. Also short-waisted. NOT a sweatshirt. If you want a long-sleeves hooded t-shirt, then this is for you."
3.0,Great for ladies though. My lady says they don't move around either.
3.0,Had to return this because it was too small and daughter did not like it.
3.0,Too fuzzy. Materialcomes off on my clothing.  I gave it away.
3.0,"The cap looks nice, is warm and comfortable, but the inner lining is coming apart from the cap. I've had it for less than a day. I'm not sure if I just got unlucky, but the stitching could be better. Reaching out to the company led to an auto-reply message."
3.0,"I bought size LG and still too small. I am 5&#34;6 , 125 lb. Usally by med for comfy fit. These feel like I am going to split the seat. Material has no give to it. 😩"
3.0,"Lovely work and beads but silver hearts seemed too flashy to/for me.<br />Prefer more 'tailored,' simple, style that showcases beads and will wrap smoothly."
3.0,This dresss would be a lot cuter if the entire dress was double lined and not just the chest area...part of a white dress being lined and the other not draws more attention than it diverts. Planning on lining it myself...might make it worth the money.
3.0,"If you are short, this dress is overwhelming. The stripes are too broad and the dress is very long. The fabric is soft and comfortable though. The only way I would ever wear it is as an outfit to lounge  around the house if I was alone. I should have returned it. Probably would be fine for a tall person."
3.0,This is not the hat that it comes with. The hat I received is a bathing cap that my daughter hates. It will do nothing to help with sun and is not cute at all. Aside from that the swim suit itself is adorable.
3.0,I like it but it is a bit skin tight. I would order 2 sizes up if you want it to be a bit loose
3.0,"These are made just fine for the price. Just know that if you’re tall and have a long torso, the waist seam will be a hit below the boobs and the bottom will hit between the top of the knee and mid-thigh. It’s nowhere near knee-length.<br /><br />That being said, they’re perfect for a myriad of outfits. I can wear them with tights and boots and a cardi for office casual. Or a jacket and flats for errands. Very versatile."
3.0,"After reading the reviews and hearing everyone saying that this shirt runs small and to order a couple of sizes bigger I decided to do that. I wear a 2x-3X so I decided to order a 5x which was a big mistake. It looks like a tent on me....HUGE. As for the shirt itself, the color was very nice but the shirt is a little thin (see through) you would definitely have to wear an undershirt. I have seen a few reviews where people mentioned poor stitching, the shirt I received did not seem to have any stitching issues.<br /><br />I purchased the JJ Perfection Men's Classic Modern Fit Convertible French Cuff Dress Shirt at a discounted rate for testing and review purposes. I have provided my honest and unbiased review. My opinions are my own and in no way did the discounted price influence my review of this product. I only rate positively those products that I really am happy with the product and would recommend or purchase again!"
3.0,It’s not the best quality
3.0,"The color is beautiful but the material is  not that good.  It looks great on, DEFINITELY need to wear a tank top underneath it.  To sheer for my liking!"
3.0,This is a nice quality dress. I’m usually a small or medium depending on the garment and based on the reviews I got a medium since people said it ran small. I feel like it runs big I got a medium and I wanted to compare it with this other medium dress I got from a different seller and it’s like a tent on me. The boob part is so big it holds itself up. I don’t have huge boobs but they are definitely not small either and it wasn’t even touching them at all. It’s pretty long also but I’m also 5’2 130 so I’m not the tallest. I think I’m gonna try a size small and I’ll change my review if I do. But I’m just nervous at this point the boob area isn’t gonna be any better with a small.
3.0,"Small, black plastic sleeves fit the cards inside the sturdy case. Once credit cards are inserted though, they are not easy to distinguish from one another.  Find myself removing each card out of their slot in order to identify it...impractical."
3.0,See through and runs small
3.0,Item is as described. I am returning since they are too gaudy in person for my personal taste.
3.0,"I like them, but half of them didn’t fit."
3.0,"I bought this key holder for my wife. I like that this key case has two sides to it to accommodate keys & key fobs. It's  a bit thick, but it holds many keys & such.<br />What e don't like is that the zipper keeps coming apart--it doesn't stay closed."
3.0,I'm a size 2 with a curvy shape. I wish I had more room. I felt a little like a pig in a blanket. My husband liked it but I didn't
3.0,"For being a lang sleeve it's very thin. The design is cute, the material feels nice, but it's completely see through that's how thin it is. I'm wearing a black tank and black leggings underneath. I make it work for me but want to make sure everyone has a heads up on the see through thin part. Not the worst buy on Amazon."
3.0,"Would be okay if the sleeves were longer. They sit right at my wrists, which sounds right.. but if you're going for an oversized chunky sweater look you might want the sleeves to have a little more length. I will probably return it since it feels almost matronly instead of Kurt Cobain-y due to sleeve shortness."
3.0,Very difficult to put in... I got the wrong gauge size but that’s my fault. Also when I received it there was only one gem and it fell off so I glued it back on..
3.0,"I LOVE THE PRINT ON THESE, BUT THEY ARE DEFINITELY NOT KNEE HIGH.  I AM 5'3"" AND THEY, UNFORTUNATELY, DO NOT EVEN COME UP TO MID CALF ON ME, SO THEY FALL, A LOT.  I WORK HEALTH CARE SO THE HIGHER CUT IS DEFINITELY NEEDED."
3.0,Looks nice and material feels decent but bag is pretty small.
3.0,"I love 90 degree leggings and have several pairs now, but for some reason this color shows sweat A LOT and none of my other pairs do this. So I think it's just the color. Other than that I love them."
3.0,"I had to return the jacket because it was some what small, I like it a lot but it fitted a little close."
3.0,I suggest to create these leggings a little smaller in the knee area since the most common variety for legs shape is calves an knee size and in my case I have a lot of calves but my figure is reduced in the knee area so it doesn't slim as expected. I don't know if is part of the design but i received my legging with a line in the pelvis area that makes it look like as if i broke the legging in the half
3.0,"Nice watch, just a bit heavy"
3.0,I purchased the bag for myself initially. The bag in itself is beautiful. But it was small for me. I do own other bags from dooney and I reality prefer the larger ones. Also it wasn't made in the quality of my other ones. I know it's an authentic . Yet something is different. From the lining to the trademark on the bag. I really know my bags. Anyhow I gave it as a gift to a friend who loved it. So that made it worth purchasing
3.0,"I have tons of headbands. When I say tons, I have tons!!! More than you can imagine. I'm always looking for different hand bands to set a trend In softball and this is it!! This headband has held up with my expensive under armor headbands that I own. But there is a bit of the headband (the glitter part) that fell off but doesn't change the head band one bit!! I'm glad found this headband!!"
3.0,the real size would help
3.0,"These glasses were just so so, but to be honest I wasn't expecting much anyway. I purchased these as backups for when I either loose my better readers or leave them at home. One pair had a lens that required you to look through it at just the right place or it was blurry, however, the other two didn't have that issue. I'd purchase these again for the same intended use, but would look for a nicer pair for my regular use."
3.0,"It DOES help keep your mask out of your mouth, but doesn’t want to stay in place for singing. I suppose taking big breaths is more about the mask than this bracket, but it doesn’t solve that problem."
3.0,jacket is soft and warm
3.0,"These are okay.  The pattern is not dyed into the fabric  It is some kind of application on the surface, and it is peeling in places after 1 wash.  Not a huge deal for my purposes, but some buyers might want to beware."
3.0,Cute top just was too small and stained
3.0,"IT'S OK, SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE ZIPPER PLACE FOR KEY WITH OUT HAVING TO USE THAT INSIDE THING."
3.0,"Runs a little small, didn't need the hole puncher but it didn't come with it. As it says in reviews, I bought the silver and black had no hermes engravement ships way faster than they say. No one will be able to tell unless u make it a real center of attention in broad daylight"
3.0,"Detail is great but it's very large, heavy and turns your finger green."
3.0,"Good quality for what you pay. Normally I'm concerned with bottoms fitting, but these fit great. The sleeve are too tight in the elbow, so I havent been using the top. Next time I'll size up to see how the top pan out."
3.0,"I actually bought this product and another case (spigen) for my new smart watch.<br />This product came with all the right pieces and was fairly straightforward in how to attach the samsung galaxy watch to your leatherman tread. It locks in tightly and doesn't feel like it's going to detach. That's about it for the positives. It's a well engineered product.<br /><br />The issue is that the galaxy watch uses a lot of glass, is somewhat delicate and is made from very scratchable surfaces. The tread uses steel and the watch frame is aluminum so any time you take it off the tread will start rubbing on the watch ans steel loves to chew up aluminum.  Additionally, a lot of the watches functionality requires the bottom sensor to rest on top of the wrist. There isn't a lot of minor tightness adjustment on the tread and since the watch is more dense than the individual links, the watch tends on my wrists to swing until the watch faces down.<br />Finally, I work with my hands and I got so nervous using this set up due to the aforementioned points that I stopped using it.<br />There are too many exposed surfaces that can be easily damaged. The spigen case I ended up getting not only encapsulated the sides of the watch, it even protects the bezel from damage.<br />Overall, a good idea if I still worked in an office, but a terrible idea if you are out in the field."
3.0,"Pajamas are comfortable, good material.. but run larger than other brands. I bought a 2x (size I usually wear) and they’re so loose the Leggings almost fall down. The sweatshirt is very big. If you like you’re clothes extra baggy, it’s okay. Otherwise I suggest sizing down."
3.0,"While it seems like a good idea, the one way valves are not really one way…they valves don’t close completely when you inhale so they’re really not ‘one way’ and therefore of no use. You inhale whatever is around you…very disappointing."
3.0,"I like the look and the concept, but the ink is raised and on the cheap side. Wish they used a different printing process. Also it's prone to fraying at the arms."
3.0,Very comfortable with a long inseam which I love because I'm tall. But warning-- I purchased the black and white and its not black...it's blue!
3.0,The picture looks really nice but the item was not as nice and fabric was not very good quality
3.0,"I am extremely happy with the larger sets of earrings however, I received the smaller set of hexagonal shaped earrings with one round. That is not a matched set as described. I am not returning since I am happy with the other 3 pairs. Just not pleased with a miss matched set."
3.0,It's actually really long. but I guess I'm content with it.
3.0,...They arrived broken.
3.0,I like the mask it fits perfectly the only issue I have with it is the fact that it came stained on both sides on teeth yellow and the back of the zipper was coming of and if you try to open it will break.
3.0,Not alot of padding on the sole. The arch doesn't sit well against my foot. It feels like something is poking me.
3.0,Too small for the size Large that I requested.
3.0,Not a fabric that breath its like thick polyester. Image is perfect.
3.0,"I am still burning these socks since I bought them. didn't do laundry for 2 months and I barely go anywhere so the beg of socks as I where them over, they are lasting but not comfortable and make me itch"
3.0,"The front shade is a little long , I am looking for a short one so that It look better.  Please make one that is not long or short .  Still Good for the way they make it  and  Cool n Comfortable !"
3.0,"Let me say , if you have any kind of booty  forget it.  Big in waist runs  low and small in the booty.<br />I am a size 6 also"
3.0,I wear  10-12 slacks.  I ordered a large per the size chart.  It just fits.  I would say it ran a little small.
3.0,"Pretty good pants.  I was hoping these would be the same style as another pair of 90 degree capri pants I have--but they are not.  Even though both styles state a 22 inch inseam. These are a bit shorter than I expected, and they need to be pulled up way more at the waist during a workout then the other pair too.  The other pair I have has black and white stripes at the waistband.  But material, thickness, wash wear is up to par.  The other pair I love I hate to admit that I cant believe they are still in one piece with how much I wear them. I would expect these to wear the same."
3.0,These are ok. 3 stars because I bought them for compression. I bought medium I’m 5’4” 165lbs. Would get Large normally for a comfortable fit. These fit but not compression at all. Comfortable close fit even by getting a medium. Material is thin and stretchy but they look well made. The blue is longer than the black and grey. Not worn to workout yet so will update when I do.
3.0,"I guess I can't be upset that the zipper started to rip after only having this case for about three weeks, but, you do get what you pay for. The case is quite large and fits sunglasses that are bigger, so keep that in mind. The case is sturdy (minus the zipper mishap) and does protect my glasses while in my purse. Not bad overall."
3.0,Wife loved for 3 weeks. Then it broke.
3.0,Does not work for my kids
3.0,Didn’t really help with night driving for me.
3.0,"4 pair dark gray, 4 pair that are navy... not black. It’s the bluest blue-black and looks navy in the sunlight.<br />I bought these to give out during outreach so I’m not getting complaints. I just expected to get what was described.<br />The dark gray looks nice. I kept a pair of those for myself.<br />They are a comfortable fit for people like myself with very long fingers."
3.0,"They are comfortable enough, however they are very cheap. I normally wear a 3X, so I purchased the 3X/4X size, however the fit is smaller than expected.<br /><br />Also, I've seen these exact leggings for sale at places like Goodwill for about half what I paid here. I didn't realize they were the same product or I would not have purchased them."
3.0,Not a conventional shirt<br />Jumper style<br />certainly shouldn't be a slim fit<br />Colors are fantastic
3.0,Material is a little thick and uncomfortable.  Also runs small.
3.0,It was considerably shorter than the picture but other than that it fits well. Because of the length I won't get another.
3.0,"Can be worn cross cross in front or back. The idea is great but the quality is bad it’s seen crooked so the middle part is alway closer to my left boob and the shirt never sits correctly. The underwire is a joke and it rides up, the top is just not sturdy. It’s very pretty and would be a great idea if made correctly and with better quality materials"
3.0,"It fits of course, but it was a mistake on my part for getting a silk robe!<br />I'm already cold enough getting out of the shower."
3.0,"I REALLY like the looks of this bracelet, but the clasp is basically worthless.  It is quite hard to put on, then it falls off.  I have had it about a week, and it has fallen off 6 or 7 times.  Luckily I have found it each time, but I am sure the day is coming when I won't find it.  Too bad, because it is really cool looking."
3.0,"The pants were looser and lighter in weight with less elasticity.  I bought them for gym workouts. No, they are not as good as the 2 pair I had bought at Costco."
3.0,It had a very strong vinegar smell. It went away after washing a few times but it did shrink a bit as well
3.0,Looks cheap! Returned!
3.0,Material is a bit stiff. Size was perfect.
3.0,One of the spray nozzles doesn't work
3.0,"The pendant was great just the box chain was super super cheap, if you're going to get this replace the chain because it just was horrible looking"
3.0,The product pendant is much smaller than described (I would say between the size of a dime or penny) and the chain was broken when it arrived. It’s a beautiful necklace but it was a bit disappointing to have it come in broken. I was able to fix it with supplies I already owned.
3.0,Cotton casual similar to a thick<br />T-shirt material. Thought material might be more formal. Nice though.
3.0,"Good, quality material and cute style BUT order a full size larger than you think you need. They shrink considerably. So my petite daughter only got to wear the 3T shirts twice. Now they're super tight and don't even reach the top of her skirt or shorts. Passing them on to a younger friend so she can at least wear them."
3.0,"I use my iPad for work. I get lost in my project, and before I know it hours have passed and my eyes feel like they've been staring into freakin laser beams. Strangely, I don't have this when using my laptop. Anyway, I purchased these to cut back on the eyeball burnout, and so far so good. My eyes have remained cool and calm after several hours of iPad use. Comfortable, as well. So, yeah, they work for me. (I know, I know...frequent breaks...)<br /><br />1 YEAR UPDATE: I'm removing a star 'cause both these glasses broke at the bridge. Unfortunately they're not that robust."
3.0,Shirt is fine but it’s just too small.
3.0,"Quality is ok, but it was sold as a men's shirt and appears to be a woman's cut and is far smaller than anticipated."
3.0,Little big for me
3.0,Just got the product haven't really had a chance to mess with it but it seems to be OK
3.0,"Cute skirt, elastic is tight for my size. Hole in one of the pockets. I like the skirt but got what I paid for I guess."
3.0,Bought one for my friend. Miscalculated the size so gave to my daughter because it’s so nice. Rebuy for my friend? She loved the pattern and color
3.0,Like these so much more than silicone! Only problem is that they are very difficult to attach to my Fitbit Versa watch face. It's quite frustrating.
3.0,They were not what I expected
3.0,"Bought XL to fit a larger bust. Love how long they are and soft fabric.<br />One star deducted for bust size. As an XL, I expected more coverage, but this would be better for a C cup maybe D at most if tightening up the straps all the way.<br />One star deducted because of the weak small plastic connectors. One broke immediately just for trying one. They are very thin and I anticipate more will break.<br />Not returning because I do like the three remaining and they are great for seeping in or as added comfort as a camisole."
3.0,"Decent quality, just very long."
3.0,"I was excited for this dress because the photos looked great. The pattern is adorable and I liked the color too- those are true to the photos. I was expecting the dress to be short from the looks of it, but it was extremely short on me. I'm normally  a L/XL- got the XL and it did not work for me. It was way too short and the bust area was coming apart, so the overall cut and fit I think run pretty small. The material also has NO stretch at all and isn't very breathable. Its the kind that makes you feel stuck and restrained if its just a little bit too tight. I think if you are petite this dress is super cute, but any curves or bigger sizes the dress wont fit right."
3.0,"If you looking at the picture of the girl in the blue these are nothing like what she has on, the are a thinner cheaper version and dont hold you in. This item is for casual wear and not workouts"
3.0,The slipper/boots are very reasonable for the price although the insulation/padding on the foot is low. Great for the price but too early to tell about the durability. Sizes run small--I've seen people all over the place on this.
3.0,Muy pequeño y
3.0,They are alright. Dont give much support and the padding is round and looks weird. I ened up pulling the padding out. I do wear them with strapless dresses and shirts. They sorta work but if you have large breast I would look at somthing different.
3.0,This is actually a really cute skirt but a large is about a size 6/7 In juniors. US sizes.
3.0,Honestly the material is a bit scratchy. It's also sheer a tad with the skirt and it's very cheaply made.
3.0,socks were a little tighter (smaller) than expected.
3.0,You can barely see the opal in this nose ring
3.0,The neck latch was missing but luckily I can sew a little!
3.0,Too heavy.  But love it!
3.0,"I bought this for myself, and it's tiny. It wouldn't even begin to fit my head, but it looked beautiful on my eight-year-old daughter!"
3.0,"Very sheer fabric, extremely small fitting, took a million years to ship. Would not recommend unless you’re willing to buy super big and go get it tailored."
3.0,A little thin but love the colour
3.0,Cute item but broke immediately
3.0,"The product looked almost as pictured, but the length was much shorter.  It barely passed my waist and middle of my back.  I was really hoping it would hit the top of my thighs as photographed. Still trying to decide if I should keep it.  (Also, I’m only 5’4”, so it really should be a little longer.)"
3.0,Gave them as gifts
3.0,boots very ugly
3.0,This fit much bigger then expected even ordering the small I’m not well endowed and I’m very small 115 lbs so I had to end up double wrapping and tucking the strings into the under arm section
3.0,"WAY too big! I ordered the small and you can see by the photo what it looked like. Not much shape to it. Extremely poor quality. Thin, almost sheer material. I altered it, put on a cami and petticoats and it looked great for a costume! Gently watched it and it held up surprisingly. I had a hell of a time ordering. Used prime but the item never shipped. Got with Amazon and they sent me another without canceling the first order. So I got a replacement in time for Halloween and the original quite some time later."
3.0,"I wish it was more secure, and fit me better personally. but overall it’s not a bad product."
3.0,"Cute shorts,  alittle big since they ran small I ordered a bigger size, I'm a size 4/6 and 1st ordered a small , way to small so I went with an xl since the small would fit a child.  I can make due BUT where the button is supposed go into is stitch closed and I would have to cut it open to put the button in."
3.0,These are okay
3.0,Preety but broke on the first wear.
3.0,"I was swimming in the shorts despite it reading Medium, it fits more than like a size 6-8. I just re-ordered in a smaller size in hopes it looks like a 4-6. Leggings are more of an opague greyish color but realistic on the tattoos. Top clips to shorts, not to orange bottoms but it seems to work. Good quality overall."
3.0,Very cute but didn’t hold up well
3.0,THEY ARE CUTE AND NICELY MADE.  WILL NOT FIT DRIVERS NOR 3 WOODS OF CURRENT PRODUCTION.
3.0,Cute dress.  Fit wasn't right
3.0,"The color is nice, but the fit is loose. The spaces for the buttons wouldn't line up and the top of the case made it difficult to pull the icon tray down on my screen."
3.0,"I got this dress and was surprised how big it was on me, and beleive it does not look cute being as big as it is. The front part kind of goes out a bit and makes my stomach look bigger than it is and I realized that if I wanted to wear it I would either have to return it or take it in to wear it. So, if you have a smaller waist and a flat-ish tummy but you normally wear a medium, get a small"
3.0,"They are cute, arrived on time, and feel like quality but the ball end of the jewelry is larger than others I have purchased from a variety of other retailers. It was not very comfy trying to put it through the nose piercing. Ultimately I couldn’t get it through without it being painful."
3.0,"It’s not the same material as shown in the picture and it shrunk up in the wash, but it is very comfy"
3.0,Very pretty but cheap. A great one-wear set.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, nice quality but the small is too small in arm holes and chest. I wear a 34c, this didn't fit."
3.0,Very unhappy product size is very small. Ordered large which is my normal size these feel like a small
3.0,"Very pretty design, but the zipper should have been placed in the back, not the side. I got the largest size available and there’s no way to open the top up enough to get it past the shoulders or hips to even try it on.<br /><br />I was looking specifically for a dress with a lot of room up top and a small waist, and I think the  dress would have fit if the zipper had been placed in the back going all the way up to the top of the dress.<br /><br />Otherwise the fabric and pattern are beautiful. It has a slight sheen, is good quality, thick material and exactly what I wanted. It just needs the zipper moved because in its current place it’s like there’s no point to having a zipper at all. Imagine trying to put it on without any way to open it up. It’s just not possible.<br /><br />If you’ve got an hourglass figure and you’re not a seamstress, then you should probably look for something else."
3.0,first time i wore them got a sore from threads on inside of sock.
3.0,"These pants are so cute... just not on me. I think they could have been a little longer and a little more loose at the waist. I gave them 3 stars because I liked the material and I still think they are cute, they just didn’t fit me I bought a small. I’m 5’6” and 130 lbs."
3.0,"Fits smaller than expected even when I looked up the size chart. I am a size 8, medium at best. I ordered a large to account for any shrinkage in laundering but it was already a snug fit. I liked the gauge of cotton, I would just suggest one orders up twice the size."
3.0,Collar sticks up too much
3.0,Way to many loose threads on the inside of these socks however they seem to be comfortable enough.  I haven’t worn them hiking yet.
3.0,"Nice set, but they really needed to include a slip of paper that tells you how to use each of these. Even after searching the internet, I'm only really using one."
3.0,One of the bands was damaged- buckle installed with the 'fork' going backward so it was unusable.
3.0,"This hat was so close. The fabric is good, and the ears are sturdy and stay up. The problem is, the hat shape is really odd. It's very boxy and doesn't fit my daughters head right. I tried it on to see if it was meant for adult heads, but it looks boxy on me as well. She really doesn't wear it much."
3.0,Cute boots... Very nice lining inside. Comfortable but run a little snug mostly width wise. I wear a 9 and med to narrow width and they fit comfortable but snug. I use these for yard work so usually do not wear socks in them (incase dirt gets inside I can just rinse off) and the lining is comfortable and keeps me from getting blisters and my feet don't get to hot. Would have given 5 stars but the first time I wore them the little buckle came off of one boot. I'm assuming it broke off since they don't seem to be removable. I was only walking the yard checking sprinklers so there wasn't any strain on it that could have caused it. So that was pretty disappointing since it holds that adjustment piece down and looked better.<br />The other side has stayed on just fine and I have used them a lot now so it must not be something that happens all the time. Oh and there are removable insole (little thin ones) that I threw away because they come out every time you take you foot out and fixing it constantly became annoying and they are fine without it.
3.0,Embroidery was kinda stiff. Pretty ok shirt
3.0,Worked ok! Still fogged up tho!
3.0,My daughter wears a size 12 sneaker now.  Got these for her in a 12 and they fall off her feet.
3.0,"Super fast shipping and these earrings are adorable and perfect! I also love how they each come individually packaged. However, I was supposed to receive 16 pairs and there were only 15 in the box."
3.0,"The double headed zipper wouldn’t function and was extremely frustrating. It worked  a couple of times but it took me forever for that to happen. The zipper worked better when I was not wearing it but it had laid out on a table and then it would zip up.<br />Ultimately, I sent the jacket back for an exchange and I will update you when I receive the new jacket!"
3.0,Nice dress but it was too tight for my wife so we had to return it.  She didn't like the overly snug waist.  It is probably better suited for slender women who don't mind the figure following fit.  I think it would make a great party dress for the young at heart.
3.0,I like the product but I thought it was cotton it’s polyester but it’s comfortable and feels nice and warm to wear..
3.0,"It is not large as I expect ,"
3.0,"Looks great and the blue mirror reflection is perfect. Would have gotten 5 stars except that the temple tips are metal and this is a problem when glasses are stored in an area where it can get really hot to the touch.  I keep my glasses in my car and when temperature is hot outside, the sunglasses gets really hot to the touch because it's metal. I put my glasses on after getting in car and the temple tips burned my skin!"
3.0,"It is cheaply made with cheap material.  There was hot glue all over the bow where the heart jewel is, so I had to scrap that off.  Also, the bow was sewn on crooked, which I also had to fix."
3.0,"The seams of the waist appeared a bit uneven, and the hem was a bit higher above the knee than expected. I'd advise buyers to consider wearing a complimentary petticoat underneath, to give volume to the skirt, and ensure modesty when the breeze picks up."
3.0,Made with thin fabric and dented 😥 I'm saddened because it was a replacement hat for my daughter it did however arrive early.  It came beat up and the quality isn't that good either
3.0,smaller fit but it will work
3.0,Was a little bigger then I expected.  Will probably send back.  Haven't used it but seems to be a good product
3.0,The watch is pretty but the white band has absorbed color from my clothes sleeve. Watch face is easy to read and attractive.
3.0,I think it was the top that fit great and bottom not at all. Looked nice other than that...
3.0,Very average. Lots of wrinkles. I think it will work fine over a tank top.
3.0,It was to big for my wrist
3.0,Not really happy with the look of the stones. Solid color with no character or differentiation in the pattern. Looked cheaply made.
3.0,"Glad I read and listened to the other reviews.  They definitely fit small so buy the next size up.  (For instance, a 31/32"" waist is definitely a Large in these).  Bought them for my husband and he's happy with them.  Nice variety of patterns, and colours are deep and as shown in the photos.  The large are significantly longer than the medium, but it's not a problem at all, because the fabric scrunches up nicely and comfortably, no matter what kind of pants or shorts he wears.  They have a nice feel, but keep in mind they're just 100% polyester, not silk or satin.  They could feel a tad more luxurious, but they're a good buy for the money."
3.0,"Why the product LOOKED great, it did not detail an important fact.  The &#34;skirt&#34; looked like short shorts but since it was a skirt, it did not cover my wife's underwear.  Granted she is tall and this item highlighted her legs, it should not have been &#34;passed off appearing as shorts&#34;.  No reviews noted this either.<br />Wanted to use this as a beach/vacation piece."
3.0,very nice boot but the open was way to small.
3.0,It is great but a little large for my taste
3.0,"This bikini is cute for the price. I usually mix and match top and bottoms and was worried about how it would fit, since this is not a mix and match item. I usually wear and extra large top and medium bottom. I ordered an XL. Both pieces are slightly small. The bottoms are cheeky cut in the back and would fit perfectly if they had a bit more elasticity. They have very little stretch to them. The top is stretchy but seems more like a large than an extra large. I recommend ordering at least one size larger when purchasing this item.<br />All in all, it is worth the money. The pattern is cute and it's perfect for the occasional pool day."
3.0,Feels very cheaply made.
3.0,"It’s not an actual necklace it’s just diamonds  with no clasps<br /> You can buy this at a fabric store by the yard, I<br />Wish that was in  description"
3.0,Although it's beautiful and looks amazing on the top half it's a bit to short. I sized up hoping to avoid issues but still didnt. I would need the bottom dropped a couple inches due to my torsos a little long and it rides up me so bad I can't raise my arms my best friend who's 5 ft 3 a good 5 inches shorter could wear it though so mot a total waste
3.0,[[VIDEOID:716eeb3a97a4d7b1a9b7653b172f70a2]] These were OK wasn’t in love with them didn’t hate them they were just kind of so-so. The flowered stud one is worn as cute as I was hoping pretty cheaply made.
3.0,"Cute, love the variety of colors, too big for my 3 month old daughter's head as of yet"
3.0,"I loved the color, smaller than I'd prefer"
3.0,Would order again only much smaller size. Ordered medium could have order small or even extra small.
3.0,"We really enjoyed these masks, but they broke pretty easy. It was a bummer. But other than them breaking easy the rest of the quality and everything was nice!"
3.0,"This was too large for me, which was my mistake. I do like Syrokan bras and have purchased them in the past. However, I won't bother getting this one in a different size due to the double clasps in the back - just too cumbersome to put on. I do plan on looking for a different model in the same brand."
3.0,A bit to small! So l will return and get a size xl...But I really dig this shirt.
3.0,"I really loved these boots out of the box, but wearing them through my job of construction, they only lasted a month before the whole heel came unglued. Nice looking boots but quality isnt all there"
3.0,"EH. Looks cheap. Not happy with the bracelet, but I love the matching earrings."
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but it's just off. The faux wrap bodice just hangs open and I'm large busted so that's not the issue. It's awkward and looks stretched out like it wasn't lined up correctly so I can't eveb tack it down. Otherwise fit would've been correct and I love that it has pockets"
3.0,"I like the style but even the &#34;Small&#34; fit too loose on me. I'm 5'6 120lbs 32D, athletic build but still have some curves and I'm surprised that this didn't fit tighter on me. Furthermore, it has built-in hip siding material (I suppose to project the illusion of giving you hips? For a more womanly figure ?) but it just ended up looking super awkward. The patterns also don't match up on the upper portion of the dress , which at first bothered me. But I now realize that the normal person looking at you won't notice. I don't regret the purchase but wish it had been more satisfactory ."
3.0,"This dress is a beautiful color and fit. I have a larger chest (38D) and this dress fit me well because of the elastic in the cutout area. Besides the fit, the color was as bright and appeared as it was described. The major con to this item is the material. Sadly the dress the material is thin and see through so I wouldn’t feel comfortable wearing it out casually. I would say it is light weight and it would probably work dressy as a beach coverup."
3.0,"Great beanie, but it is not like the picture which looks like a ""lid"" what I wanted for under a  bicycle helmet, otherwise it was great."
3.0,Gave to friend
3.0,This tool is hard to use. The instructions make it seems as if it is as easy as 1-2-3 but we didn't seem to find that true.
3.0,"The vinyl stay that holds it in the wallet could be a little thicker, but it was well worth the money"
3.0,"I got these for my double helix piercing and while they look cute, they don’t stay closed! I’ve had to continuously fix it to keep the hinge outward so it wouldn’t come off."
3.0,"Unfortunately, the Asian XXL did not match a US XL.  The sweater is somewhat small"
3.0,"Runs 1-2 sizes small, which I expected. What I didn't expect, however, was that the material is super itchy. I thought maybe it just needed to be washed, so I did. It's still very itchy. I'll still wear it, but I'll have to wear something underneath. Also, shipping was a nightmare - I don't think that was their fault, though."
3.0,Only bought for cases when I had to wear a mask.
3.0,but the straps are very tight...i ordered a large as well...i thought it was weird that the bra padding had like balls and bars in it...
3.0,"The quality looks good, but the zipper opens like ones on a women's garment....this is a men's garment.<br />The down side was that this was ordered on Nov 12 and it was received Jan 8!  Granted, it came from China, but really...aren't there any cargo airplanes leaving that country?"
3.0,"This dress is pretty from far away, but sadly it was incredibly itchy just trying it on. Also, the zipper was *so* difficult to pull down.<br /><br />The lace part is very pretty, but it definitely needs to be sewn down onto the skirt of the dress to give a more polished look. You could easily do this yourself with needle and clear thread or even settle for steaming it down.<br /><br />Overall, it wasn’t what I was looking for so I returned it. Besides a couple of minor issues I would say this dress is good. It is very pretty even in person. It just isn’t a 4 (almost perfect) or 5 Star Dress IMO."
3.0,"Your sizing runs small, I guess the 1x would have fit like Xmas extra large"
3.0,"Smaller than expected , and odd buttoning, but kind of cute."
3.0,Used as a gift to my wife
3.0,This exercise bra was great. Wore it maybe 5x was going to order another but put it on and zipper broke.
3.0,Cut small! But cute
3.0,The pendant part of this look just like the photo. But the pendant is really large and chain is super cheap junk that looks like dirty metal. There's a reason it costs $3. It is just junk.
3.0,"I didnt pay much so I really cant complain, but a little cheap"
3.0,Hat was very nice but ran small was unable to use. Was too late to return.
3.0,I ordered size S but still loose.
3.0,The parents were really nice and I would’ve loved to have kept them unfortunately they were just not cut correctly for my height I am 5 foot seven and weigh 165 pounds I Purchased a large in the waste fits just perfect but the length of the crotch was entirely way too long as if it was designed for a much taller man so for that reason alone I had to return them
3.0,For a man it is not got for your head<br />Because it is not tight
3.0,"Perfect jacket for spring, but run SMALL. My daughter wears a 6/7 in clothes I ordered the 8 for her & it’s way to small."
3.0,Very scratchy under breasts (crevice) and around back.  Not for anyone with delicate or sensitive skin.
3.0,"There is nothing actually wrong with the shirt. I purchased a green one in XL and I loved it, but it fit a bit bigger than I wanted. So I ordered in black and went down one size and it fits as if I went down 3 sizes.  Looks good, but not appropriate for work."
3.0,"I ordered the 3X I usually wear 1X. My bottom is very curvy and the 3X was perfect but my breast are pretty average 38C. The 3X top did fit it. However, My breast just didn't fill it all the way out on the 3X top. I expected for the sheer to more pleated and longer, but it wasn't. It came slightly below the knee I'm 5'7."
3.0,"The color was not light pink as advertised. It's coral. When I washed it (instructions indicate it's machine washable), it shrank to the point that now the lining is longer than the dress material.<br /><br />The fit is great and I will still wear it with jeggings or shorts underneath."
3.0,They are the perfect size but cheaply made.  The silver hoop broke immediately after I opened the hinge.  There is a little piece that sticks out from inside the tube on one side that the hinged piece catches onto to close.  The little piece is what broke off so now the hinge has nothing to catch onto and doesn't close now.
3.0,I was hoping this would be more drapery. It is thick-not cushy thick but stiff thick. Not very flattering on my 5’ 4” 130 frame.
3.0,"Although I really like the print and I really wish this shirt fit me right, but it's almost like it is twisted. The right &#34;sleeve/strap&#34; pulls in strange and it just seems a little off."
3.0,I love this dress. Only disappointment is I'm a larger chested woman and it's very tight in the chest. It fits nicely everywhere else.
3.0,Appears to be well made. Order WAY up. I wear a size 12 and the waist on the L was directly under the bottom band of my bra.
3.0,"I had honestly purchased this because reviewers had said that this was so comfortable that they would wear it around the house, I have to say they are OK but I would not say they are exceptionally comfortable my feeling to them is just meh.<br /><br /> For the shower they would be great I guess but for my intended use it felt lackluster. Also they are much tighter then I thought they'd be."
3.0,I love the way it looked... But I received it damaged beyond repair. The hat was in a bubble package and smashed the point of no return. Deformed isn't even the word for it. Steam forming wouldn't even work. Got my money back and hat is went to trash.
3.0,"Product did what I needed. Size is a little awkward, I​ feel it could be slightly longer. It also had no weight to it and bent really easily for me."
3.0,Not used yet but looks good .
3.0,Little bit small.
3.0,"These feel nice but they definitely run small! I ordered the same size I always order and they were too little. The only reason I didn’t send them back is because they fit my teenage daughter, so at least someone could use them!"
3.0,"Its an okay product. Good for wearing under clothing. It runs a little bit small and its very thin and a little see through. Overall, okay product."
3.0,"It's a really cute shirt, and I got size small. It's pretty big still, if you're a average small this will work for you unfortunately it didn't for me."
3.0,One size does not fit all. They keep falling off my size 10.5 feet. The pictures here are misleading. The socks barely cover my ankle. About 20 times a day I have to adjust them as the heel goes sideways. They are soft and I like the grips on the bottom. They definitely help on slippery surfaces. I ordered a different brand yesterday and I hope they fit better. Beware these Tru Tread socks if you have larger feet.
3.0,"Cute bra, fits snug so may want to size up if you have big bust."
3.0,Very thin and flimsy. Open them very carefully or they will tear apart.
3.0,looks big and flowy in the picture but runs small.  Soft material but there are no tags in it or on it so you wonder where this was made or by whom.
3.0,"small for the size, but not way to small like some."
3.0,Very nice. My son loves this but I was a little bit disappointed that it isn’t sweater material. It’s a really thin fabric.
3.0,The fit was tts but the fabric was super thin and see through.
3.0,Fabric to thin.  Needs slip.
3.0,Hard to tell time and set
3.0,I do like the top. Should be greatvforvthexsummer.mits a bit bigger than anticipated but ok
3.0,Pretty set but the chain is so short it chokes me. Looking for another chain so I can switch out the pendant. Other than that it's a beautiful set for the price.
3.0,Idk what I did wrong he asked for it.
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress but the sleeves were very long, the fit was loose in chest and midsection but tighter in the hip and thigh area. I typically wear a US size small. I loved the fabric and the details, also the color is true to the photo."
3.0,"This is a cute tshirt! Kinda thin material but it is good quality! However, this shirt is advertised as being “oversized.” I ordered an XL expecting it to be super roomy and long, and it fit like a standard Large."
3.0,"This item was also ordered as gift and purchased with two matching tops<br />This item's appearance and pattern were  very nice, the fabric was of good quality but they appeared a little smaller than the size that I had purchasd"
3.0,"Of the 4 pair of slipper socks that were ordered, only 3 1/2 pair arrived.  One of the gray socks was missing.  Of the ones I did receive, most of them fit perfectly, but there was one (blue) that was slightly too large and slides off my heel.  Overall, I do like them, but am not happy about being shorted by one slipper."
3.0,Fit a little tight at first but it stretched. Good buy for money but not the best suit I've owned.
3.0,I love the pajama set EXCEPT that the top is not as it appears in the picture. It is more of a crop top style shirt which is not what I was looking for.
3.0,True to size. Minimal shrinkage.
3.0,"It's a pleather band, which feels plastic. It looks good but there are better bands out there for a similar price point. It works so I can't really complain, just a little disappointed."
3.0,"The rhinestones are starting to fall off and it's been a couple of months, but have gotten a lot of compliments on the bling bling of it :)"
3.0,Ok quality but the neckband.was too large. Returned.
3.0,No matter how many times I wash this or how...if I wear a darker colored undershirt it gets white Fuzz all over it. I have many colors and they seem to be fine. But very comfortable and durable if that's all you care about.
3.0,Thin fabric. Polyester. Runs small.
3.0,"They are supposedly polorized, but if they are, it is only slightly.  I was disappointed.  I think they did cut down on glare while driving a little bit, but not very much.  The lens are tinted amber (which is what I wanted), but when you put them on they seem clear and do not block out the blue rays.  Thankfully, they were not expensive.  Some people mentioned the fit...for me, they did fit perfectly so that was not a problem.  I only wish they cut down on more glare and helped see things more clearly, especially on the water.  I would not recommend them to fishermen or golfers."
3.0,Have tried three of the five in the package and ne of them with not lock on.  The good part is the other two I have tried are fine and the price was very resonable.
3.0,Not as long as I expected.  The material is thin thought it would be heavier.
3.0,This dress was kind of cute. A bit on the small side. Mine did not come with the tie at the waist. Arms were uncomfortable. Fabric was nice and it comes with a built in slip. Would have maybe kept it if I had been able to see it with the belt and ordered a size up.
3.0,The I is welded to much together. You can barely see it. I purchased 2 of them and the letter I is the same way.
3.0,This was way too big! I purchased the 1-3 year size for my 18 month old and it didn’t fit at all. I couldn’t even try and make it work by rolling the arms it was HUGE. So disappointed because it was really cute and soft.
3.0,"The material is good. A bit pricey , the fit is a bit odd"
3.0,"Not much protection from the sun, works best in the shade."
3.0,"More of a medium weight sweatshirt, was expecting more of a thinner sweater type,  but I still like it.. definitely wouldn't wear a dress"
3.0,"This tucks you in a little but doesn’t really hold you in. You can still tell you have a little pouch. It was almost pointless with a dress, but ok to wear with high waisted jeans or pants."
3.0,"I know they have a note in the description of these shorts that mentions that the colors may not be exactly what is shown, but honestly the blue shorts are the color of hospital scrubs. As soon as I put them on that what my partner said. I would return them if it wasn't going to take a month to get a replacement pair."
3.0,ASIAN  SIZING AND US STANDARD SIZING A TOTAL MISMATCH - CLOTHING HAS ALWAYS RUN EXTREMELY SMALL<br /><br />THE DESIGN AND THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT IS WELL DONE.
3.0,It's ok<br />The organizer area needs to be able to expand more so that it's easier to get your cards out and to see which ones are in there.
3.0,"The sleeves are super tight and the fit snug. So, photo must have a very small model. The quality of the fabric and construction is excellent as in all of their products. Mordenmiss is a great line whose sizing will always be problematic for folks like me...I'm 5'2 and stocky with larger upper arms. I love everything in their line...but only half of it fits. There is not consistency in the products."
3.0,The dresses was very thin needs a.liner
3.0,"I normally wear a medium, I ordered a medium and they’re pretty tight. Very disappointed"
3.0,just okay.  A good accessory.
3.0,"For the most part, this is a great product.  The price is really good, compared to OEM fitbit bands.  The texture of the rubber is not quite the same as OEM.  It is softer, so while I think it is more flexible than the fitbit ones, I am not sure how much better it will hold up over time.  Also, the colors are a lot more muted than I expected from the photos.  For instance, the light blue is very pale, almost washed out looking, and the teal is a little on the darker side and not quite the bright teal in the photo.  But those are minor cosmetic issues.  For the most part these are a steal to have som variety and options if your band were to get damaged.<br /><br />My main concern in my experience is that they are not all consistent.  One of the bands in the pack got stuck and would not come off.  I had to use a screwdriver to pry them off, and I am a little wary of connecting it again."
3.0,Excellent show other than it not being a wide fit
3.0,"The quality is metal. Be extremely precautious. The insides did have sharp edges that WILL cut your fingers if not careful. I used a dremel to smooth out the insides of the finger holes. If you buy this, inspect thoroughly before you try wearing it."
3.0,"They're cool, but they are a lot junkier in real life-so not worth what I paid."
3.0,"I suspect the dress photographs nicely, but it honestly doesn’t do anything for my body. It is very loose fitting— does not hug my chest or my waist. So it isn’t very flattering. It is also see-through and extremely wrinkly. Of course you can iron the dress but it gets wrinkles throughout the day very easily.<br /><br />It is a very pretty dress with great flow/movement from afar but I wouldn’t recommend it to a friend."
3.0,For small hands when I put them on the split between the fingers so if you have medium of large hands these won't last long!
3.0,"The tops fit as expected, however, the material used was quite flimsy."
3.0,the shirt is kind of short and square like
3.0,I guess for the price it was ok. My set was missing the print on one set of the earrings.
3.0,COLOR SEEMED DULLER THAN PICTURE
3.0,Leather has a certain scent to it. One of the hour gems fell out. Good enough for the money.
3.0,"These earrings are very large, much larger than anticipated.  Lovely though."
3.0,Way too heavy and it said light weight.
3.0,"It arrived with the second hand of the pocket watch already broken. The ring and necklace are nice, but I mainly bought this for the pocket watch which came broken. I am disappointed."
3.0,"This swimsuit is super cute and  well made. It has removable pads and two types of straps. However, it's super small. I was spilling out of the cups,even when I removed the pads. I usually wear a size 12  in pants and the bottoms were a bit too tight. If you are a DD like me, I would avoid this suit. It's a shame that I had to return in because of sizing,but if it fit, it would have been an amazing buy. If you are smaller, try buying a size up to give yourself more room."
3.0,Is good. I ordered Blue with green but received full green color watch. But I think blue with green would be more better.
3.0,"I give it 3 stars as the quality isn't what I epected.  My son likes the outfit so.we will keep it. Like other reviews, the pants are small...however, they may be ment to be worn lower on the waist...which makes the pants long enough on the show"
3.0,"Giving 3 stars because it came fairly quickly and was pretty accurate color, but Very cheaply made, and poor stitching quality. Seems disposable despite claiming to be washable. Will still use, but disappointed"
3.0,"Hats are cute, but the material is thin and feels cheap. If any moisture hits these hats, they will be ruined."
3.0,Super cute but it’s a little bigger on the top end and the zipper definitely won’t last long.
3.0,"A little small. Stitching coming apart in places. One button hanging on by a single string. Lining is nice and comfy. Sleeveswere too short. Overall, awkward snug fit and stitching off. Disappointed."
3.0,"I love the dress, however, the pattern at the waist doesn’t match up and it looks weird. I need the dress for a trip I’m going to and I don’t have time to return it, so I will try to hide the imperfection with a wide belt. I ordered an XL and typically wear a medium/large in top size."
3.0,Very hard to see
3.0,It’s so pretty but my ribs are too big and it’s doesn’t fit! I’m giving it to a friend (: I sized up on this (I got a medium and I’m usually a small). It’s also a little see through.
3.0,"Order came in fast and my girlfriend loves it, though it's not as thick as I thought, it was exactly what she expected."
3.0,"The band and bottoms fit great! however, the cups are definitely not a ""d/e"" its a c at best."
3.0,These are pretty nice pieces there were total 85 pieces evenly decided in style and size as advertised with no missing ends. Most are 16g but some are 14g. I would have given 4-5 stars but some of the threads are not quite on point but there all decently threaded just could be better. For the price it's surprisingly nice. Basically it's not high quality body jewlery but its way above junk jewelry and worth the price. I don't regret my purchase.
3.0,Fit nice but after a while the material starts looking awful. Would not order again
3.0,"awesome quality, just smaller than I needed"
3.0,"The Ryukyu is very nice, it would be nicer if perhaps the chain were nicer and more durable or even a leather or waxed cord. Other than that the medallion is well crafted and sturdy!"
3.0,It okay.
3.0,So far so good fit is good....buuuuut have not laundered yet so might be a different story then...hope for no shrinkage.
3.0,Quality is ok not that great.
3.0,"Great product for the price, well made and good variety. Bought as a favor for rock star bday party. Only problem is that only 19 came in the box even though it is sold as set of 20."
3.0,there was not enough elastic in the top to keep them from falling an bunching around the ankles. For that matter it was hard to decide what end was the top or the bottom so I tried both ways.  They still kept my legs warm so I must say substance is better than style.
3.0,"Nice quality, lightweight,  but too tight for a contractor or worker."
3.0,Too big for me so I took it apart and sewed it back together now it fits! Still kinda big on top! What ever
3.0,"Prompt delivery and even prompter refund when I returned them (well done, Amazon!).<br />I bought these boots hoping to use them as actual 'motorcycle boots', which they are not.<br />I am admittedly NOT an authority on the subject, but these boots seem to be more of a fashion accessory, best purchased by someone interested in soliciting a social reaction regarding 'style'. NOT very practical.<br />Based on other reviews, I ordered one size larger, and while they were long enough, these boots are extremely narrow and squatty, absolutely no room in the toe area (sorta like a leather sock), so tight, in fact, I needed to loosen the laces and 'peel' them off (no way I was getting them off by just unzipping the zipper).<br /><br />In short, cool looking boots, but not for me. Sincere thanks for the great service, Amazon!"
3.0,Cheap material. Almost costume like. I ended up hanging this up in my daughters dress up closet.
3.0,"Although they are high quality, these earrings don’t stay on the ear like they’re supposed to."
3.0,"I orginally bought these to dance in, but wore them to work instead, because they were not as comfortable as I would have hoped for dance class. The legs were too baggy, but the top was too tight.  I work at a pretty low-impact job, and they somehow ran on the very first day I bought them!  Kind of disappointed, because I own a Danskin sports bra and love it.  Try another brand for your dance tights."
3.0,"I love the top but the fit is a little wonky. The material is super thin too which is nice in the summer but overall, I wouldn't buy it again."
3.0,Runs big. I'm usually an 8-10 and the medium was a little to big.
3.0,To small expected biger sized
3.0,The necklace is pretty. The planets keep flipping over to show plain metal backing
3.0,Very cute but the cups are really tiny. Like really tiny. My whole boob can't fit into it. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone that's a D or above.
3.0,It was way to small. My suggestion is to  get a size bigger it's a pretty dress jus couldn't fit it. Wasted money
3.0,Band isn’t as bright as in pictures. Really hate of the end is on a spring type pin. When I put the watch on or take it off I have to be really careful because the bar comes off. See attached photos.
3.0,"Thin fabric, ordered the 0-3 month, size is comparable to 6mo clothing.<br />Pieces came torn/not sewn properly."
3.0,"I order from colorful koala ALL the time. These are nowhere near as stretchy as their normal leggings. I ordered a medium (my normal size) and a large, and even the large comes up high on my ankles, and isn’t as high waisted/was hard to get over my butt. I do carry most of my weight in my butt and thighs, so if you do, I’d size up two from your normal size.<br /><br />They seemed like they like wouldn’t be that warm at first, but once I got them on, I could really tell the difference. They’re much thicker, and I can feel the fleecing. I’m borderline sweating in my apartment."
3.0,The arms fit nicely but it was way too large everywhere else. It swallowed me up!
3.0,"Too small and although it runs in small, it’s very beautiful"
3.0,"I ordered this dress because of the muted and somber looking fall like colors.  Showed up much brighter and loud, instead of muted.  Would need to wear a slip under this too.  Sent it back."
3.0,does not wash well. even when you hang dry seems to shrink
3.0,Super cute and great quality... just a little too small for my fingers.
3.0,I bought another blouse same size and the fit was good. This fits more like XXL than XL.
3.0,Was not at all the color it should have been (bright bright orange) and was extremely see-through. Very cute style though!
3.0,They shrink 8 inches in legs.
3.0,much smaller than expected but nice
3.0,These are more like a one time use kind of accessory - they’re all pretty flimsy. Also the hat arrived rolled up in a small box and it was really hard to bend back into the shape it’s supposed to be in
3.0,I like the equality but it took months to get here
3.0,I really like the metal band!
3.0,The color is not as I thought but other then that perfect
3.0,there cute but was to small
3.0,nice but a little big
3.0,Love it just bigger then I hoped should have ordered md
3.0,I still haven't worn this out of the house. The sleeve ruffles are too bulky to wear under a cardi or pullover.  The fabric is much thicker than I anticipated.
3.0,"It's absolutely beautiful, just VERY heavy!"
3.0,"The 4 largest ones are a little big for my nose not to mention that one came broke. The multicolored ones are not a bright as I expected but other than that, these are just  an ok set."
3.0,Super tight in waist. And super long and large. Tried it on and felt like it weared me. Not me wear the pants.
3.0,Had to send these shoes because they weren't wide enough I would love to have them if the size was a little bigger
3.0,"Beautiful and I absolutely love it, but it broke within 2 days."
3.0,"Love them, but they don't last. Perfect size and style, but the lenses are starting to peel/discolor after only 4 months"
3.0,"These leggings were disappointing for me. They aren’t see through or too long or short, but the calf-to-ankle part is too wide. Yes, I’m a 3x, but most people my size don’t have elephantiasis; we have only slightly larger calves and normal sized ankles. The waist-to-thigh area fits fine, so it’s basically a pair of jogging pants. I will still wear them, but it’s not what I wanted."
3.0,"Great cut, just ran large"
3.0,"These are good quality sunglasses, but really too big for my face. They look like some sort of novelty sunglasses, and I can not wear them in public. I have a few pars of oversized sunglasses, but none quest this bug. It's too bad, because they are a good price and I like the style and color. I wish I could use them. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. The reason I decidedon't to give this product three stars is because they are nice, and I feel that my experience with them has more to do with personal preference and the fact that I am a petite person, not because there is anything wrong with them. Someone else may love them. Ifor you have the attitude that sunglasses can't be too big, these will be perfect for you. Unfortunately I will be returning them as they did not work for me."
3.0,Touch portions are not great. Can't use pattern lock with them.
3.0,"Cute skirt, and I love that it has a pocket. Fabric is a little flimsy, and it’s more blue than purple."
3.0,I ordered a small. I am 5’5” and 112lbs and it is way too tight. The tag shows slim. If so had known it is a Slim and not just “runs small” I would have ordered a medium. The skirt is cute so i will return for a medium and try again although I wish it had a ball pocket:
3.0,Just a tad short for a stack of one's. Nice colors. Made nice packaging for Xmas.
3.0,Quality is ok. The top fits nicely though.
3.0,"Ok so these are just “ok” I guess you get what you pay for. They don’t have that stretchy material that you find with other leggings. They don’t give in the butt and thigh area and they are constantly slipping down even those they fit snugly on my stomach. The area around the calves are way too tight and don’t stretch. I won’t say these the worst pair I’ve purched, but they are a close second. I have ankle length and the shorts still coming this week so hopefully they are better."
3.0,"Cheap, uncomfortable top. Had to return."
3.0,Nice jumpsuit.  Comfy.  Not upscale material ( very affordable price).  But it is functional something nice enough to wear out in casual functions
3.0,Did not grip firmly
3.0,"Let me start by saying this clutch is beautiful to look at but unfortunately, I will be returning it. It's smaller than expected, multiple loose threads, the hinges are flimsy and the latch is extremely hard to open. I really wanted to like this enough to keep but there's too many things wrong with it."
3.0,This item does not show a size
3.0,Didn't like the necklaces they didn't fit the charm.
3.0,Much thinner than I thought
3.0,"I just received these Lian San readers in black squares and blue dot, in 2.75 strength.  I put them on and immediately my eyes felt refreshed with crystal clear computer reading vision!  I'm wearing them outside on a steamy Florida morning, with absolutely no fogging.<br /><br />But ... I'll be wearing them in the dark.  These, for me, are seriously ugly glasses.  They are too narrow a width for my smallish oval face.  They seem child size.  The ""Wayfarer"" shape is fine in oversize sun glasses, but in clear glasses they're simply not flattering in any way.<br /><br />C'mon Lian San.  You can do much  better than this !  Your technology is great, as always, but I won't be wearing these anywhere I can be seen."
3.0,"It is a little flimsy for a tote. It has a very dark Interior, so it is hard to find things. I am using it, It was not at all expensive, so I would not bother sending it back. You get what you pay for."
3.0,Mine does not say Sabrina...it says World.  This always makes me wonder if I got the right thing. I prefer to get that which is advertized.
3.0,Sleeves just a little shorter than expected
3.0,Already has a hole in the side seam!!!
3.0,"They look nice and are good value for price, but slightly thin fabric for my preference (that may be fine for others of course)"
3.0,"This scarf is nice; not super substantial, but a great price and really good color (looks wonderful with grey). Not SUPER warm, but warm wnough on many days in terms of blocking the wind, etc. What I would say is you get a LOT more than you pay for, because it costs next to nothing. So all in all well worth having - just not tremendous quality that will last for 20 years!"
3.0,"looks good, nice quality. The fit is really weird though."
3.0,Never received instructions on how to use the product
3.0,The earpieces are too short for anyone who wears glasses.
3.0,I ordered this beautiful blue sky umbrella and a I received a red/black umbrella......I would like the blue/black umbrella I ordered.....
3.0,"Great quality necklace, but one earring was broken when I opened he box."
3.0,"I was really impressed with these when I first got them, so I ordered two more sets. You don't get many duplicates, some of the colors are really pretty, and some of them, not so much. There were plenty that were my style, but after ordering 3 sets, I didn't have many that matched. I like to wear three at a time, and there were maybe 3 or 4 sets (of three bracelets) in the total 32 I had ordered. So I tried one last time, figuring that one more might help get more 3-bracelet sets, no luck there. But for the price I really can't complain too much, in my town we pay $30 for a set of 3, so this is definitely a deal, I'll just have to purchase some singles to complete the sets I really really want."
3.0,"This blouse is very pretty, but very. very small.  Too bad."
3.0,No dice si es cuero guenuino!
3.0,These were tighter than I was expecting and the material is very shinny and too silky feeling.
3.0,OK workmanship but runs VERY small. My son wears a 31 or 32 waist and his sweatpants are usually a size medium. I purchased these in a large to make sure they wouldn't bind. They JUST fit and that's with the legs coming to just above the ankle bone. My son is using these for football so he just adds socks to hide the shortness. I would strongly suggest ordering a size larger than you normally would.
3.0,The length of the arms is way too short. It’s extremely thin and hard to keep in place because of that. It is easily packable which is nice.
3.0,I love this cute bag... vivid colors... the outside of bag has been very durable so I was very disappointed when the inside liner began ripping within a week of using it...
3.0,Small. But pretty
3.0,Like is textured but the net part on the sde rip already within 2 times i wore it dissapointed
3.0,Color is good the intention was to find a match for my coral and it was.
3.0,"The top fit perfectly but the leg holes for the underwear were different sizes, why???"
3.0,The product looks very cheap and many of the pieces were broken
3.0,"Original item is much darker, not add attractive as picture. It's very stiff, not firscomfortable. It's cheap, so I'll keep it as it is just for Halloween. But not very happy"
3.0,"Nice material, however I haven’t even wore it yet and it has a rip in the seam. I washed it, so now I’m stuck with it. The cuffs are really big and not adjustable but overall the material is good and it didn’t shrink. I ordered a small, however I medium probably would of been better. I’m a 36d, 5 ft and 125 lbs., it’s not snug, but I would of liked it more jacket like. So I would say it fits as expected. It’s not too big, unless you count the cuffs, and it’s not too small either. It’s a good buy for the price. Just check the seams before you wash. :("
3.0,So disappointed. Love the simple look and heel height. Would make a great dress boot. Returning them because the whole leg shaft is super wide. So much so it's awkward to walk in them the leather moves so much and ends up rubbing my leg.
3.0,The bag is smaller than advertised. Can't fit a laptop in it but it's the perfect wedding guest bag. Can fit flats and all other personal items.
3.0,Cute and the granddaughter loves everything Sofia!
3.0,The shirt was way too big for me!
3.0,Nice ring but smaller than I expected
3.0,The shirts themselves are super cute however my 10 year old daughter wears size 10-12 and these shirts are suppose to be size 12 are tight on her. She can wear them but was hoping being a size 12 would last here longer than her next growth spurt
3.0,The holes are distressed too much. Fits a little too small although stretchy.  Buy one size up if you're curvy.
3.0,Small almost as if for a child
3.0,"As always, I compare everything to the gold standard. For me, that is Maidenform. This doesn't measure up. It is quite decent, however, it is not as form fitting, structured or flattering. The flattening of a bit of, shall we say, fluff, around the midsection, is noticeable, but the effect requires having this fit far too tightly to be comfortable. Putting this on a smaller person, it just didn't smooth her out enough. I can't say it is worth the effort to get on and off, when a Maidenform would do the trick and be easier to use. Good luck finding what will work for your needs."
3.0,"Comfortable and light,in material description linen is listed first what makes you think is predominating in the blend."
3.0,They came in quickly but they were not mirrored in any way. The pink one is just a pink lens no mirrored lens like some that that I saw in the other reviews. They are still nice and don’t feel cheap I just wish it would’ve been what it was advertised as.
3.0,"Nice color, but the fabric feels very cheap. It is not stretchy like described so it fits a little tights, and the sleeves are too narrow."
3.0,I loved the material but size small was very large so I had to return
3.0,turn green fast
3.0,Comfort and texture and looks so expensive
3.0,"watch looks great and feels great.  Light.  Band is small for me.  Only thing I do not like is that after a couple of days of not wearing it, I have to wind the watch and set dates.  Getting it running again can be a little difficult as the hands don't want to turn"
3.0,"I wanted to love it but...<br />It arrived with the ring detached from the jewelry. Bummer I couldn't wear it for Halloween as it was too late to send back.<br />Also it necessitates another person to fasten the clasp, which is rather annoying.<br />It really is beautiful and maybe if I repair it and have someone else put it on for me I'll be able to enjoy it."
3.0,Body and not tapered.
3.0,"they were almost a cheapy metal not that i was expecting anything overly high quality,  they keep popping off the ribbon i have them on because the pin back wont stay closed, but they are fun to look at and my friends love them so im happy ^.^ just kind of wished the pin back wasnt so thin"
3.0,"Bought these for a gift.  The yarn is not stretchy, so had to send it back as it did not fit.  However, he quality was very good and if they had fit (wish they had XL) would  have been very comfortable."
3.0,"They are smaller than expected,  need to order 1 size up"
3.0,"I am a 42dd. This did fit around nicely but did not cover top to bottom enough. I bought to wear with my maid of honor dress and it worked okay until the end of the night when it started rolling up out of nowhere, leaving me exposed. The color was nice, it washed well, and it was not too see through. I just wish it covered to the bra line or a little below. In my case, I would have needed about 4-6 inches longer for a more secure fit and full coverage."
3.0,Could be wider through the hip area...
3.0,"Fabric is a little cheezy. Much fabric, so a little difficult to look lovely."
3.0,need to buy i phone 7 case only too big
3.0,"These flip flops felt great, I’m sure they would have been so comfortable but sadly their size 9.5 women’s is more like an 11.5.  I think they have their men’s and women’s sizes messed up. Would have just exchanged for smaller size but they didn’t have the smaller sizes in stock. Ugh.  Returned for credit. If you order these I highly suggest sizing down at least one size maybe two."
3.0,These are very durable and really cute the only issue is that they turn colors. Depending on what you use them for they take on other colors. Mine turned almost black from being in my pocket
3.0,Quality was not bad but I got almost all of the same design. Over 60% were skulls. Wish it was more random.
3.0,"Lovely style and fit well, but the stone is very dark and the cut means it catches no light. So it's a very dark navy and looks almost like I bought an onyx stone. I will keep it because I like the style and fit, but disappointed in the sapphire."
3.0,The hat is too small for me.
3.0,Very cute and soft but sized for a child.
3.0,Works well under my cycling helmet.  Smaller ear pieces.
3.0,Not a great zippier
3.0,Heard some cracks at the top stitching. Nervous BUT will wear for the kids!
3.0,"I was looking forward to these goggles, which seemed like great quality when they arrived. HOWEVER, I did not realize that the nost bridge is not adjustable. I don't have a big nose, but the bridge was still too small and hurt when I tried them on. I attempted to return for a refund, but there's a minimum charge deducted of $6.90, which basically equates to me getting back a little over $9. So now they'll just sit and collect dust until I find someone who has a small enough bridge to give them to."
3.0,"These are pretty, but very tiny. Good for people who don’t like large earrings."
3.0,"Small in size, but good quality"
3.0,"Product was delivered late because it was shipped from China.  No hems on either opening which causes a little bit of slippage depending on you size of head. Would recommend hemming for a more polished look.Light weight and breathable, light colored gainers, dark color are a little heavier."
3.0,"Aerives with one shoe not functioning, even after charging.  Returned for a different brand."
3.0,Like it but it’s a bit to large
3.0,Way too small. It is made of strong good material and if it fit I think it would have been perfect but it was way too small.
3.0,"Beautiful top.....thin, like the picture.  Runs small."
3.0,The bottom piece did not look anything like the pic
3.0,"I’m 5’10”, 185 lbs and ordered a XL.  They were way too small!  Just trying to get them over my calves was difficult. I only got them up to the thigh area and decided not to force them up.  According to the size chart I still have 10” to spare in the hips.  Definitely doesn’t stretch to accommodate 29” - 50” for the hips.  I think the low number on all the sizes is the actual inch measurement."
3.0,there is no pocket...fits a little weird...I will probably only wear it to  bed
3.0,Cheaply constructed...
3.0,"las capas son muy bonitas pero las mascaras, de muy mala calidad"
3.0,"I was hoping this shirt would look as it does in the picture but it’s a little more boxy than it looks. It’s still comfortable and I would say that the sizing is accurate, but it’s not the most flattering if you want to wear it on its own and not layer it."
3.0,"The pendant itself is pretty nice, although the etched black parts aren't quite as dark/deep as I would have hoped. The chain is really where the problem lies. The chain is very short (for me personally) and the closure is rather small, making it hard to put on. The pendant itself I also isn't heavy enough to weigh down the chain so it end up getting lost in my hair sometimes. All in all its not too bad, probably would be better with a different chain but I don't think I would purchase it again."
3.0,I had ordered this exact necklace before and the one that came in the mail was NOTHING like my original one. The quality is much less. I should have expected that with a necklace being as cheap as it is. I guess I was just hoping for an exact replica of what I had ordered less than a year ago and this was not it.
3.0,"Cute, but cheaply made and too small."
3.0,Boots were missing some of the gems and were stained.
3.0,The graphics are blurry compared to what you see on the screen. Not worth the $10 bucks I spent.
3.0,"I expected them to have more tummy control, but they're super comfy"
3.0,pants were well made but were a little baggy returned and easy exchange/refund.
3.0,"Not the best quality, gold turns after 1-2 uses. But very cute on."
3.0,The color is 2-3 shades lighter than portrayed on the web-site. It looks faded and cheap. It also runs small.
3.0,I'm 5'3&#34; 120 lbs 32DDD bust and 26 (0-4) waist and I ordered a large. The bottoms fits pretty comfortable without hugging my sides. The top was super loose around. There's no stretch or support in the top. I normally always have to get larges in bathing suit tops but medium should have been okay. I was going to try to order the medium to compare for everyone but it wouldn't arrive in time when I need it.
3.0,I am not a fan of the fabric.
3.0,"I am 5 feet and 4 inches tall, 113lb, I bought medium size. It fits overall except the waist position of the dress is higher, therefore I could not wear the belt, because it looks odd the belt is put under the waist line of the dress. I think this is because the dress is designed for Asians.<br /><br />The material is good, but the sewing is bad, many stiches are loose , not aligned well"
3.0,"These are OK, the are very thin and run on the smaller side."
3.0,Cute boots. Need to exchange for size
3.0,it's just ok not what I expected
3.0,"I would like to have had the colors that were shown in the picture blue, pink and purple.  I got pink, orange and yellow.  My toddler likes the pink one we got for dance class. Really don't see her wearing yellow and orange."
3.0,"Flimsy rim and odd shape on my head. The beige is more a peachy taupe. Though inexpensive, not what looking for or hoped."
3.0,These look nice but they run small. My 11 year old wears 14-16. I got size XL and they fit him too small.
3.0,Does not come with the gift packing shown<br />I bought this as a gift thinking it included the packaging shown in the photo but ended up returning it because it just came in a plastic bag with none of the gift wrap items shown. Ended up getting a way nicer and even engraved leather lanyard with nice  packaging for even cheaper on another website. The material here is decent but it’s not worth $30 and the hook park felt kind of cheap.
3.0,I bought an extra large for my husband who is a big jeopardy fan!  I always wash everything I buy first.  I used cold water and no dryer. I let it dry on a hanger.  When my husband put it on it was so tight.  He thought it was a medium.  He can’t wear it.  It says no shrinkage but yes it did shrink.  I would recommend getting a size or two larger!
3.0,Picture doesn’t provide the details that the sweater is soft inside and warm. However photo advertised does not capture the patches seem homemade so looks cheap.<br />Definitely will need to be spruced up with accessories!
3.0,"Sleeves are enormous ! I have decent sized arms , but these sleeves are made for man wings . Ashame ...great looking shirt but sleeves are way to large"
3.0,"The daytime sunglasses are just fine. like other reviewers have noted, the clip is very small. but I have small fingers and small glasses so its not as much of a problem for me. The ""nighttime"" glasses, however, are garbage. they do nothing to reduce glare and are pretty useless. I see little to no difference when wearing them. 3 stars for arriving on time and I will use the daytime glasses"
3.0,"The seller clearly states the size of these lenses. I compared their size to the size of my glasses lenses. They were the same, so I ordered them. But they fit onto the glasses not exactly corresponding to the location of the glasses lenses. These have the nice clip-on grip -which works well. But that grip also places these lenses above the rim of my glasses -  upward, toward my eyebrows. So the top of the lenses were above my glasses, and the bottom of my glasses were below the lenses.<br />Moral of the experience? Buy lenses that are larger than your eyeglasses lenses. Maybe one-third inch or 10mm larger vertically."
3.0,"Very see through you will need a slip. Thin but nice. The zipper doesn’t work well at all I think that’s the biggest downfall. I am 5’2 204lb and I ordered the XL and it is tight on my chest as I am a 38DDD and a little tight on the arms but I have very broad shoulders, luckily I know the best alteration place to take it out a little.  Not the best for busty chest but everything else I like. Overall beautiful dress. I gave 4 (update 3 stars as zipper has become more of a pain since?)  star only for the zipper! I knew it would be tight on my chest and arms as I usually order a size bigger but it wasn’t available so I decided to just alter it so that part is on me. Hope this helps!"
3.0,"Super cute pattern and what I was looking for! I was disappointed that after using for only a couple of days, the hole that attaches to the sunglasses failed to keep the sunglasses in there because it doesn't have elastic or something similar to keep the sunglass arms in there."
3.0,"It's a soft dress, very cute. The color is darker then on picture. The chest area could use some work though it might be that it runs big.<br />I am 5' 135 lbs and got a size 8 and it was a bit big on the arms and chest. The wait was a nice fit. The dress was also very long."
3.0,Won't stay on without making a few knots.
3.0,Liked it but they where a little low quality coming from amazon.  I expected something better
3.0,"The material on this is very thin and feels/looks cheap. Not the highest quality set.<br /><br />That being said, it does fit perfect and the material is soft. It felt nice to wear.<br /><br />Decent set. Felt nice fits good, but died felt don’t feel it was worth what they’re charging for it. You can find much nicer quality sets for that price."
3.0,Fit was great. Shirt was thin and the bow fell off the skirt after 10 minutes of wearing it.
3.0,I must have a massive head cause this doesnt fit.
3.0,"This shirt was pretty disappointing for me. It looks so cute in the model photos, but the cut is very boxy and unflattering. I'm 5'4"", 155lbs, 36C, and I ordered the medium, which was huge on me. The material is thin and flowy. Better construction would make this shirt work better. But as is, it's not for me. 3 stars."
3.0,"The corded bracelet looks fine but the silver part is stamped and rigid and very cheap looking. It doesn't lay to the wrist very well.  In the picture, the silver infinity looks better with a little more curvature."
3.0,"This sports bar is probably really cute on people who don't have large breasts.  It came with really small cups, but when I took them out it works."
3.0,The back part of the dress was too big (it folded downwards) and in the front the lace was not even (one side of the bra area showed more white fabric than the other. The dress look nice and I would love to keep it but the dress was badly sewed
3.0,"I read the reviews and ordered a XXXL-- fits good on me, who normally wears an XL or L. I had hoped the shirt would be warmer but it is not warm like a sherpa lined garment, although it is warmer than a tee shirt."
3.0,The cap is alright but the head scarf is small and the quality isn’t that good and. I won’t be using the scarf.
3.0,"Cute dress! I’m 5 foot 6, 135lb, and ordered the small. I have an athletic build so I don’t really fill this dress out so it’s very roomy and baggy on me. It’s also on the shorter side, especially since it’s so flowy. It’s a cute dress, just not on me. Will be returning."
3.0,I got size small for my son because he want them to be tighter but they run big.
3.0,Shirt size runs extremely small!  Thin fabric also.
3.0,"Beautiful dress way too small. The material is beautiful, good quality and it does stretch but it did not fit my mom.She was delighted with it and at the same time sad it did not fit."
3.0,Look great feel greatv
3.0,Way short for a longer torso. Not impressed
3.0,These are adorable but bend too easily.
3.0,So it's a beautiful necklace and would have given it 5 stars but Unfortunately I wore it for about 3 hour's and all of a sudden it fell off and I realized the clasp broke.
3.0,"It was too big, there was a tear to the back. I ordered armygreen I got a black. I love it but can't wear it."
3.0,Too tight for my 9 and 11 year old. Might work on younger children.
3.0,"Cute shoes, work well, but did not realize they were so glittery from the pictures. My little boy was a bit disappointed by them."
3.0,"Awful design!!  Carhartt should be ashamed, but I'm sure they're not.  I've had many of these, insulated and non insulated, for oil field work in colorado and North Dakota and the reinforced suede on the glove doesn't cover where the thumb meets the palm... Where it's needed the most!!!!  DUH!!"
3.0,"This and the correct other colored charms were purchased as a Mother's Day gift as birthstone colors. It is a thoughtful concept for a gift that you can customize and arrange as needed. The stones themselves were not particularly impressive; they look similar to plastic costume jewelry. So, in summary, if you are expecting classy-looking gemstones, look elsewhere, but if it's the thought that counts, these are something that any mother would appreciate."
3.0,The coin purse does not close tightly.
3.0,Slightly different than what you will get from clothing and sales. The shape is just a bit off.
3.0,"These are not great quality material. Two of the bonnets are just a cotton material. I thought they were supposed to all be satin material. Bought for a 2 year old child. Sizing is good for her, but not happy with the material at all."
3.0,I had to send this back. The arm holes come down so low I couldn't even wear a strapless bra. If u don't have to and you are looking for that then it's cute.
3.0,"Wrong birthstones were in it, but necklace was beautiful!"
3.0,"These are great sweats, but they are really, really low rise. Like lower than what I would wear back when low rise was like mandatory.<br /><br />They would probably be super cute on the right person but I wanted something to sprawl around in, not to constantly worry about wardrobe malfunctions, so I sent them back."
3.0,Shoes look like a good quality but the remote doesn't work unless you put it right up to the shoes.
3.0,Not very stretchy. Not what I expected.
3.0,Nice woolen feel but too small.
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress, but it is short from shoulder to waist.  The belt was a good 3&#34; above my natural waistline so I had to return it."
3.0,Nice design . Bad quality and very high price
3.0,Nice but WAY SMALLER than I expected. Good quality though. For the size they were heavy. I had bought for my rearview mirror but they were too small. I will be keeping them because the quality is so good. Not sure what I'll use them for but I like them.
3.0,Material is tooooo thin and delicate. Tears easily. Didn't lose color upon handwash with strong detergent though.
3.0,"Very cute bra, and quality material.  But unfortunately, it's not true to size.  It fits like a D rather than a DD."
3.0,"Thank god it didn't shrink in the dryer. Although it still fits &#34;snugly&#34; Wasnt worth returning the product, it is a $20 sweater, nothing too fancy. The whole dry wick system, we aren't a full believer in. Giving it three stars because they described it to be very heavy thread weight. Well, its not, its your normal run of the mill sweater, but for $20 maybe it will do for a NE fall. I will say this, this is the first sweater we've gotten with tags and packed nicely."
3.0,"Bought the coat for my engagement trip to Vegas. It arrived the night before my flight so didn’t open or inspect the product, threw in my luggage and flew out. Get to Vegas and open it to wear, and coat appears to be worn and used. Black stains on the collar that kind of resemble mold spots, dirt marks near the coat tail, pet hair on it, and the buckle is tarnished and worn out looking. Needles to say I won’t be wearing and having to make a special trip to a store to purchase a coat for my time here. Super disappointed. Coat itself looks to be cute and good quality… if only it weren’t dirty and used 😭"
3.0,"I too ordered the gray and ended up with pink. I hesitate to suggest these as you don't know what color you'll get when you order.  As others have stated, they are missing the Z87 stamp.  I got these for home repair projects (like chiseling stucco away from a door frame to get a screen door to fit, etc).  They fit my female head well, but they do NOT fit over my corrective glasses.  So if you have good vision, these are okay.  My husband will use these (even if pink).  I think for home use they're probably okay, but you might as well spend your money on a pair that you know is ANSI rated.<br />It does state that the clear lenses are polarized, but they are not.  Perhaps the mirrored ones are?"
3.0,It was somewhat small. Guess it's my motivation to lose a couple lbs. I'm keeping it.
3.0,Not nearly as attractive as the photo
3.0,"The arms were super tight, and did not give at all when I tried to stretch them out a little so my arm fat wasn’t protruding from the short sleeves. It is also a little short. I ordered my usual size, so it should have fit me properly. A little disappointed"
3.0,They are cute and you get what you see. 4 of them broke after taking them out of the pack though.
3.0,I haven't used these much.  Seem OK.
3.0,"its cute and it seems to wash well so far, but it is a very thin material so I only wear it over something like another tank or sports bra or maybe a bathing suit when it gets warm out."
3.0,"VERY tiny - even in my son's hand it was very small. My son absolutely loves pocket watches, but this was disappointing. It's cute, but description did not make it very clear how stinking small it really is. Not practical to actually use. :("
3.0,"Overall decent gown material has decent weight, good quality sewing.  Howeverb this gown is not for a tall woman. I am 5'9"" and weigh 120.  The sleeves were barely long enough, but shrank after the first wash. The elastic now sits above my wrist and is very tight and uncomfortable. I think I might cut the elastic before wearing again, but then I will have loose, floppy sleeves which I dislike and will have to add my own elastic or other solution. I did not buy this nightgown  so I could do alterations.  Also want to note that the style of collar is not right for a nightgown. It is too large and flops around. Collar is just minor, rated it 3 stars due to the sleeve issue. I will not buy this gown again."
3.0,"Long time buyer of Sperry boat shoes. This is the first black pair, unfortunately they didnt have the same quality and longevity as the brown ones."
3.0,Cute way to have fun with my baby girl. She is 11 wants to wear ratings but sensitive. Fun colors a little. She couldn't war them long. Little to tight for comfort. Have to readjust the tightness and try again.  Product it self not bad at all.
3.0,The sequins was falling all over the place
3.0,Horrible material. Not soft and there is no stretch whatsoever. Will probably return.
3.0,I am 5’5” and the length comes down past my ankles. I chose white and the print is pretty and I like having pockets.
3.0,"I love large sunglasses which is why I bought these not sure why people are complaining that they're too big... Yes they are big, if you don't like big sunglasses then don't buy them.<br /><br />Anyway on to the review. I did notice that the lens tint is kind of see through, which is not what I've seen in pictures so I'm wondering if these are legit Quay sunglasses. In all of the pictures I've seen the lens has been opaque which is one of the reasons I bought these.  My only other note is the sun glass case they came with was in a plastic film like a new pair would be but was dirty like it had been used before.  Other than the lenses and case the frames are nice and don't feel overly cheap."
3.0,These are a LOT smaller than I expected. Order bigger than you'd originally go with.
3.0,They run large. Even on the smallest setting its too big for me and I'm just plain average in size. They constantly turn around which is kind of annoying but I still wear them and they are cute. Just wish it was a bit smaller.
3.0,"I had really high hopes for this shirt, but when it came in the design did not match from oe side to the other. I was able to correct it by removing the buttons and moving them all over by an inch, but that was less than ideal."
3.0,Beautiful but too big but any way I love it
3.0,Nice ring but the prongs of the stone tend to catch on everything. I am surprised I haven't broken one off yet. Would rather the stone was recessed.
3.0,"Nice dress, material is not soft but is tolerable. I may need to give it to my daughter... :("
3.0,"The embroidery on the side is dark blue or purple, so you can't see it. It does not fit like a normal baseball cap, it's more like a painter's cap. Seems to be well made though."
3.0,So I bought these hoping to be able to wear them on the motorcycle. My thought was the ear loops would hold it up but since they were so loose on me that didn't work. Even when not on the bike they fall below my nose. I personally cut the ear loops and sewed them tighter and now I can at least wear them into places without them falling down.
3.0,Good product but bag does not glow like advertised.
3.0,Not as good as the comfort insoles
3.0,"Fit and color of these pants are great, but I found a hole on the hip area after washing. It wasn’t even in the seem. It was simply the material coming unraveled. Not cool! I have another pair because I bought these in two colors. The other pair don’t have a hole- at least not yet!"
3.0,Was a bit small. Also thight on waist and made her itchy.
3.0,"I’ve had this for 2 days, haven’t worn outside yet.  I think it’s going to be fine for keeping sun off my face.  When I snap the sides up, the hat doesn’t fit well & the brim does not hang down to cover face.  I don’t think I’ll snap the sides."
3.0,"Ok material, but WAAAAAAAY too big. The buttons were literally tied into the hair area because it was so big. I have a regular sized adult head.  I’m going to remove the buttons and sew them in a different spot and make it work, but I should not have to. A bit disappointed."
3.0,This Lovelyduo women's lace party dress runs extremely small. NOT true to size! I ordered a XXL which is my appropriate size and it's so snug it fits like my second skin even though the fabric is stretchy. I would guess this is the equivalent of a size 14-16 perhaps. I wear a size 20-22. So that was disappointing. The dress has a silk sheath lining which is stretchy too. With all the stretch this dress will fit snug regardless. The dress has a v-neckline and the top is see- through. The cap sleeves are just cut off lace which appears to be fragile and easily to snag or fray. The lace is pretty but appears cheap looking and snag easily. Not tastefully made nor classy. Maybe something you'd wear to a sleasy bar kind of dress. No class! Guess it's okay if you're shopping for a man but nothing I'd wear to a cocktail party or wedding. The wine color is pretty. They recommend hand washing and hang dry.
3.0,"This was lightweight and cute, but the sleeves were wide and short."
3.0,Love the design of this t shirt but it was not as soft as I was expecting since it was a cotton and poly blend and it fits a bit more snug then I was expecting seeing how it is a XXL.  Disappointed but I'm going to try and wear it.
3.0,"Only use a few times, one of them already broken."
3.0,"People say this wallet is big, that's an understatement.  The wallet was so big it barely fit in my hand. When it was sitting on the table it was open at almost a 45° angle.  However, I really enjoyed the color. I got the blue color, it was really nice."
3.0,I’m usually an Xl and probably should’ve sized up but it fit way too small
3.0,Did not work for me. Material was not bad the style is just not my type.
3.0,"It was a gift for someone.<br />I did get a chance to try on wasn't pleased with the chemical smell.<br />I tried to leave it unwrapped for a week or so before wrapping it, and it still had those horrible, chemical fumes all over it.<br />Good news was that the person thought it was so cute and didn't mind the smell.<br />They would keep it aired out in order to help cut down with them.<br />That is the only reason I gave it three stars... because it's cuteness outweighed the smelly factor."
3.0,I love this jumpsuit!! However it started falling apart in the seams the first time I wore it :(
3.0,It is not a one size fits all. Did not come close to meeting in the middle. No elasticity. I’m a size 12. Head piece was nice though.
3.0,Blouse fit perfect expect the colour is more like pink and not red
3.0,"I bought this sweater for as a Christmas gift.... unfortunately it runs small. So just be cautious in size selection. Gentlemen, of you are purchasing for a gift, go one size up"
3.0,The word on the bracelet is very very small. It's a nice idea but I think the message you are sending out to others should be larger to be seen.
3.0,Was not impressed with this shirt. I have ordered a few others from the seller and this one seemed very cheap
3.0,These definitely fit smaller than what you expect so they didn't last as long as I had hoped they also faded and shrunk even more after a wash
3.0,"The idea is cute and seems to be okay quality, but they’re just too big for comfort. I can’t imagine wearing them all day without problem."
3.0,nice and light but they have no grip and fall off whenever I lean over
3.0,Were very nice and fits good but after a year the lens seem to be bubbling. I'd like a replacement and hope it last longer as I do really like them.
3.0,The material of this dress is more of a cotton/ jersey material. It fits well so I'll make it work.
3.0,Don't like the smell of latex very strong
3.0,Beautiful ring but could not adjust small enough for me. Photo indicated it could be adjusted quiet a bit but the one I received could not be adjusted any smaller.
3.0,"I received this watch very promptly, and it was well packaged with its original box.  It is beautiful and I was excited to wear it.  Unfortunately it came with a completely dead battery.  It took a couple of days for me to get a battery, due to where I am living.  I got the cover off to replace the battery easily enough, but in the process of fitting the cover back on the watch I shattered the crystal!  I have no idea how I managed this, but I am very upset that now I have to find a person to replace the crystal, which I am sure is more expensive than the watch.<br /><br />I have several Fossil watches, and I have never had this much difficulty with the back cover.  Just keep it in mind with this one, if you are getting it as a gift."
3.0,I love the kitty charms but they don't hang properly. They frequently get flipped up and stuck in that position.
3.0,"So, this was a tough call, as they look great and my boyfriend loves these cufflinks. However, the wood fell out of these right away and I had to super glue it back on. I am glad we didn't lose the piece, we could easily have."
3.0,"Likes: Color of the beads - I got the black<br />The band attaches well to my watch<br />The area around the band has pretty silver rings<br />The pictures show all the charms on it<br />Dislikes: Charms are too much - I don't think half of them are very cute (I do like the cross, butterfly and little jewel).<br />the strings of the band are thin plastic elastic and I am just not sure how long they are going to last.  So far so good though"
3.0,"Looks very cool! However, after about two months the watch stopped working. It was unable to be wound, but was never overwound. For the two months of enjoyment I got out of it, it was worth the money!"
3.0,It’s pretty but it doesn’t stay tightened.
3.0,"These are nice and I love using them instead of bringing home a whole bunch of plastic bags I won't use.<br />HOWEVER I read in reviews that they are a bit tricky to open and close, so I practiced on one before I went to the store. After 2-3 times of opening it/putting it back in thepocket, the pocket started ripping. I hadn't been impressed by the quality of that one before that happened. I can mend it (and did) but seeing how much use the little pocket gets I don't expect it to hold up for too long.<br />I opened 2 others and took them shopping and they held up well with the groceries. The other reviews say they're good quality (and the two I took shopping look better) so I must've just got the one that slipped past quality control. I've only had them for a weekend so far. Hopefully the rest of them hold up well with repeated use."
3.0,Love the bracelet unfortunately it only last 3 months and now is broke
3.0,"Beautiful dress, had to return. Purchased a large, Bust size is a 34 DD, size L was to tight. Had to return"
3.0,Would have been better if one side did not have to be sewn and adjustable like the other side
3.0,"It's the perfect basic black bottom, however, it runs really small. I'm a size 4/5, 5'5 athletic build with average hips, small waist but it's a little soft from having babies, and not much of a booty sigh, and very broad shoulders. I'm usually a size small in everything unless it runs small, but these were way tight...more like size xs or size 2 for a comfortable fit."
3.0,"it's kind of heavy, meaning it doesn't distribute the contents well but overall its a pretty good bag"
3.0,I'm 6'1&#34; and I bought the xxl which was the largest size the have. A xxxl or xxxxl would have fit better.
3.0,They smell absolutely terrible but they are cute. They are a lot bigger than I expected
3.0,"These were okay, not what I expected thought."
3.0,The material was great quality but my upper body is petite and the dress was too large in the shoulder/chest area.
3.0,I love the dress. The color and quality is great. I don't like the sash. I can not keep it in place. I guess we are off to finish  a seamstress to fix the problem.
3.0,These are comfortable to wear and fit fine but padding is too high up.
3.0,I didn't find this to really work as well as I would have liked it to
3.0,This is another piece of jewelry I would truly love if it didn't start falling apart on me. I've been able to repair it somewhat but it's a disappointment.
3.0,No es el mismo color de la foto y muy pequeños.
3.0,"Is cute but not what I was expecting,<br />I feel is kinda big,"
3.0,I'm really really disappointed.  The straps are too short - can't reach the velco closure across my foot.  I read some other reviews that said they were short and I thought... my foot isn't that big.... BUT oh well.  I had to send them back.  HOWEVER - they were LOVELY.  Great workmanship. I would have LOVED to have them on my feet.  Soooo sad.  I mean... I ordered the widest width for my flat feet.  I thought the straps would be plenty long.  I did slip my stocking foot into one sandle to try it and it felt soooooooooo GREAT.  Off to look for another pair.  BUMMED!
3.0,"Loved the necklace, but when I got it a bunch of the strands of pearls were hanging and it was broken. Really wanted this for an event but have to return it."
3.0,The watch line purchased from Ali is more luxurious. What is this?
3.0,"The bra padding is not secured in the suit so it floats all over the place.  Other than that, I like the suit!"
3.0,"I like the frame and lenses, but the package arrived with another box inside. The glasses were not in a protective case so the mirrored finish was a little scratched on both lenses. Not ideal."
3.0,The mesh band had a peculiar set-up to make up the size needed. Had to take it to the jewelers and it even took himj10 minutes to figure it out.
3.0,More like a pajama pant
3.0,It was cute but kind of a funky feel to the fabric.
3.0,My gloves are comfortable
3.0,El modelo me defraudó no era lo que esperaba
3.0,"It's nice and thick, but the snap popped off after 3 uses...  return window has closed.."
3.0,"Good, tough, inexpensive watch.  I love the classic 80's styling.  The light on it is pitiful though.  I found it to be useless in low light. I would recommend the slightly more expensive F-105W.  It's the same watch with the 'illuminator' glowlight."
3.0,"These are plastic if you didn't know. I like this style, but in the hard plastic form, not in the soft plastic form."
3.0,Love the color but the zippers are plastic so 2 of them didn’t work properly out of the box and one keeps jamming but if you keep zipping and unzipping they all work eventually. Not as sturdy as some others I have used but these are less expensive so that’s appropriate I guess
3.0,Pants were very narrow in the thighs. I had to return.
3.0,Too small around the neck and arms opening. Guess I needed a bigger size. 36D
3.0,"Returned due to the width, larger than a normal 7.5M.  Disappointed that I had to pay for the return."
3.0,The earrings were much larger than I anticipated and I did read the dime and before ordering.  Too large for the child O bought them for.
3.0,Kinda short compared to my actual piercing but decent quality.
3.0,"Size 16. Got 2x because I wanted it to be loose. PJs fit like an L or a XL, which makes them hilariously unflattering. Thank goodness I’m wearing them in the privacy of my own home.<br /><br />Still giving 3 stars because material is decent enough. I am just sleeping in them after all. But if you’re over a size 12/14 and want to impress someone with your cute bed attire, don’t get these. I don’t know why we all think a crop top will be flattering. We have a belly. It’s never flattering lol"
3.0,I'm kind of disappointed to be honest the bandages we're not hemmed and they were already starting to fray a little bit when I got it.
3.0,I was a bit surprised to see how small the earrings were. I thought they would be bigger but that could’ve been my fault. The material is a bit cheap but they are very cute.
3.0,"This sweater is much warmer and thicker than expected. Which I liked yet, the fit was smaller and less loose at the bottom of the sweater it was too snug for what I was looking for."
3.0,Not the best but it works. The sleeves will not properly fit anyone. The amount of fabric pass the thumb opening is way too much. I had to cut off about two inches just to make it wearable. The sizing will work for about anyone since you can lace up in the front and back which saves it because it is so extremely baggy.
3.0,"I ordered this dress for an all white wedding I will be attending in July. The dress is nice, but the skirt is very sheer. I had to order a slip to go under. The material is more of a rough linen as well. Over all a nice dress, I’ll keep it, but I not the greatest quality."
3.0,"I’ve gotten these in several different sizes and styles now, trying to find one that would actually work best for us. They are available in full sock, toe-less, and leg sleeve and we have tried all three.<br />My first complaint is that they are definitely made for people with longer legs. The size in the description does say for leg lengths 14 to 17”, and you will definitely be most comfortable on the longer side of that - although with the amount of stretch in these, you can fold down the top if needed (our measurement are 20” calf when not swollen, and 14” from heel to the top of the calf and we definitely had over 3” of fold down at the top on the 4x). They are also made for a larger foot size, so if your foot is average women’s range (8.5 to 9 women’s), you will find the foot bed to be a bit long - this does leave plenty of toe room, so that might be a plus for you. The material is soft and very thick, and we have not been able to test them yet in warm circumstances since we have fairly cool weather where I am right now.<br />The description lists a 3X calf to be 20 to 26 inch circumference, and a 4X calf to be 20 to 28 inch circumference, that’s a HUGE overlapping range, so you can see how this would leave a lot of confusion as to which size you might need. And there is a big difference in the feel between the 3X and the 4x. The 3X is very snug, and feels like it would provide a good bit of compression. The 4X were very comfortable (even with the 3 1/2” fold down), so it’s hard to say if they would actually provide any/enough compression when the leg is swollen.  The 4X in the toe-less was even roomier at the top of the calf then in the full-foot version.<br />I think our favorite out of all of them was using the calf sleeve and actually bringing it down over the heel to make it into a toe-less. That took care of the problem of a too large foot bed and a too long calf length.<br />So I feel these are decent but I’ve definitely had much better compression products. They most certainly need a much better sizing chart easily accessible, maybe in the photo section. And I feel like they definitely need to make a version for people with shorter legs. I did not notice any unpleasant odor in any of the versions we tried, which I’d read from another reviewer was an issue. The price point of $27 is definitely on the high end, I would expect you should get two for that price."
3.0,Not real happy with this bag. I like the Glenda's!  The zipper pocket on the outside is too small.
3.0,"The design is so cute and material so soft. Only three stars now, because I have not worn it yet. But super cute."
3.0,plated no good
3.0,"I purchased this item for a gift. It looks pretty well made, especially for the price. My one issue is that the circular part part of the pendant tends to hang over towards the crescent part and sometimes go a little under it."
3.0,"I have previously purchased Beroy cycling shorts, but these were somewhat disappointing.  The bottom ""cuff"" is just a band, unfinished, with a glue like substance.  The finish of the ""cuff"" is also very poorly done.  The gel pad in the seat is as in the past, adequate for the task.  The fit is as with previous product, though the length of the short is a bit longer...that might not be terrible, just different.  The fit overall is a little looser for the same size ordered in the past."
3.0,Theyre ok
3.0,"I have a 24&#34; - 26&#34; waist (depending on bloating or the week you know) , but it didn't get small enough and I bought the xs. I knew going in the thing was stretchy but sizing is a little off. Silhouette is ok but again, because it didn't pull in enough it wasn't that Shapley compared to my regular waistline because just the nature of having fabric wrapped around your waist gives you an additionAl inch in girth.  even though it says &#34; waist training&#34; no true corset will ever be stretchy. I was naive to that . All that being said, I chose not to return it because when I do wear it it helps me remember to be concious of my posture! Also it is pretty breathable !!! Just not good for my original intentions"
3.0,"I ordered these through WOW Sales and the sunglasses were nothing like what was pictured.  They are not silver, they are gunmetal (black/grey).  They are not thin arms, they are thick plastic arms.  I don't mind the ones I received, it was just not at all what I expected to get."
3.0,"Not too snug, but, not as free flowing as I would like it...And wayyyy too short in the back....was hoping it would be long enough to cover my bum...but, no such luck.  I will keep it tho, and find a use for it."
3.0,"love the style and fit, get a lot of compliments, looks just like the picture"
3.0,"This item is beautiful and very light weight. This one said it was 8 inches but when I got it home it is less than 7 inches.  So I cannot wear it.  I bought the other one with hearts also in rose gold so I could wear them together. This one said it was 8 inches and it is so what's the deal? It would cost to much to send it back, so I will give it to someone who can wear it."
3.0,Gloves are ok for basic work  Velcro’s  on back does not hold that well.
3.0,"I’m a size 14, and ordered XL. These leggings are super comfortable and stretchy, but they fall down. I spent the day pulling them up repeatedly  because there wasn’t enough compression to hold them in place."
3.0,"It's sturdy, but the color wore off almost immediately.  It's probably fine if it's not something you intend to carry around in your pocket."
3.0,Was looking forward to getting this for winter season but I was not a big fan of it. I gave it away as a gift. Sleeves were too loose-fitting for me. If you like your sleeve extra loose this would be good for you.
3.0,Product is very cute however it runs small in size... bad for me good for my daughter! Other than that I’m pleased it just runs small in size..
3.0,The color was more of a peachy color than brown as it looked to me in the picture.  They are very soft!
3.0,"I ordered an extra large and they might fit a medium.  I guess I can maybe wear them like tight support under clothing to hold in my flawed areas.  They might smooth those areas out.  However, I am highly disappointed in the sizing.  Hopefully, I will continue my weight loss journey and be able to wear them in the future.  Until then, they will sit in my closet as a reminder to continue on that journey.  I will try to use them as motivation instead of being frustrated that they do not fit."
3.0,"There's no nose-wire on this mask, so it can't be molded around the bridge of your nose; and, it's relatively smaller than most other masks I've purchased."
3.0,Nice. A little more bling than expected. Can be irritating on the wrist due to beads being cut like crystals.
3.0,A little small but I can deal with it by the pool/beach. Because I didn’t pay much I don’t mind if it gets sandy or worry about it losing shape laying out with it on
3.0,"The costume arrived within two weeks which was faster than the month it said it would take and came in good shape aside from expected creases. The material is cute and detailed, the bets way to describe to ensemble of pieces is that it was thoughtful. The Ganyu cosplay comes in a lot of pieces with a lot of accessories so its easy to put on and adjust. I’m always an XS, but referenced their sizing chart just in case to find XS would still be the most accurate option for me. When trying it on though, the bodysuit was tough to pull over my calves because the lower part of it has little to no stretch, no problem stretching around my thigh, but the tough part was starting to pull it around your legs. The main part of her costume is like a Velcro skirt piece and it was super baggy on me and making the skirt as tight as can be on the little piece of Velcro made it look uneven and still baggy in the front right under the bust. The bell sleeves might be too tight for others as well, for me they were perfect but if posing (like with a bow) it kind of pinched my upper arm. The gloves were big too but they were mostly hidden by the sleeves so it shouldn’t be a dealbreaker. I love how this set comes with anklets like for her shoes because that saved me money in reusing a pair of white heels instead of trying to remake her’s! They were, however, *super* big, honestly I could not wear them without sewing adjustments because they were very loose and slid right off. All in all though if you know how to alter clothes or the basics of sewing, you can really make this costume work, but otherwise I can’t promise how well her costume specifically will fit because for me the sizing was all over the place. I will update with photos!"
3.0,Like the style and fabric but small on shoulders area.
3.0,I ordered a small. Top fit ok (I'm a 34B) but bottoms were a little to small!
3.0,Purchased the olive green and it’s definitely not true to color. I received a brownish greenish product. Not really loving the color.
3.0,"I do like it, don't expect great things."
3.0,"Adorable dress but not for those with any kind of chest. The weird curved hem on the front would be super cute if it fell just under the bust like an empire waist but it doesn't (as many others have attested to as well). It cut me straight across my chest and looked very weird. I tried to pull it down so the seam would fall under my bust but it wouldn't stay nor did it look right when I did that.<br /><br />The fabric is also super thin, and weirdly bouncy. Might make an okay swimsuit cover up.<br /><br />The fit (besides the weird chest issue) was perfect. I normally buy a Large (I'm a 14, 40D, 5'6&#34;, 180 lbs) and the Large fit me perfectly everywhere - plenty of room in the chest, just perfect right under the arms and around the torso, great length. But between the odd placement of the seam and the weird fabric, this is going back.<br /><br />Also: I ordered the pink and it was slightly different from what is shown in the photo. It's a warm peachy-apricot pink, not a cool cotton candy pink."
3.0,A couple areas of the scratchy side of Velcro rubbed skin.  I was able to trim it down but was very uncomfortable until then
3.0,"I like this wallet, my iPhone 6 fits into it fine.<br />there's plenty of slots of my cards, however the zipper broke off after one use."
3.0,"Definitely a smaller hole, couldn't quite get the jewelry in"
3.0,"scratches very easily, nose piece came off really easily"
3.0,The hooks come off the lanyards too easily
3.0,See through. Will have ro wear something underneath.
3.0,"I thought this would be fabric, but it’s printed nylon. Poor quality for the price. It’s cute though."
3.0,"While the colors are vibrant, the quality of these tops are very poor. The material is unfortunately very cheap looking. I advise wearing it at home."
3.0,"The dress was too large for me, but I suppose it was wishful thinking for me to order a small, as I am 5'3 and around 116lbs. Nonetheless, had it fit perfectly, I'm not too sure I would've still kept it because it looked very box-y and shapeless, which was a surprise because &#34;fit and flare&#34; is usually the best dress style that flatters by body type (small boobs and no butt). I expected the skirt to be more flared but when I tried it on there were hardly any waves (pleats?) in the skirt."
3.0,Runs a bit large. Fabric is very soft. Color appears washed out.
3.0,The print was not like the one in the pictures. It was pretty but not as expected. I am usually between a small and medium and went with medium and the sleeves were way too short so pushed them up to be 3/4 sleeve. There’s also a button on the chest keeping it closed and does not look right..too high on chest.
3.0,I understand that this listing says 2pc. So I assumed I'd get two of these! I only received one. So other than that I enjoyed the product. It's cute and it fits nicely on my ear. I hoped for two though since I'm very good at losing things and would want one for backup!
3.0,"I bought this because it is simple and does not have metal on the front that interferes with my long necklaces. It is tight but makes my waist look super tiny. The picture has just the elastic band and the 8 shaped ""leather"" buckle but this has 4"" woven leather pieces on each side. Not crazy about it but might as well keep it for the price.<br /><br />EDIT: I decided that I did not like the woven sides so I cut off just the buckle part and put it on a thicker, wider, sturdy elastic with e6000 glue. Looks great now!"
3.0,Cute idea but too small not true to size
3.0,"Design is super cute, but I ordered an XL and it came as a medium... too tight and too short."
3.0,"They're masks, they serve their purpose, they're pink, but they don't fit my small square face that well."
3.0,Comfy and good quality hat...very disappointing that the lettering is just an iron on. Overpriced for not being embroidered.
3.0,Perfect color that I was looking for. The top bust area was too tight but every where else fit perfectly. Ended up having to return the dress.
3.0,Wish there was a bit more than what was in the dirt.
3.0,It is some sort of leather. It smells really rancid. I sent it back to Amazon.
3.0,The face piece is shallow and keeps slipping off of the nose.<br />The fabric feels comfortable and keeps you warm.<br />Do not confuse this product with a balaclava.
3.0,"I bought this for myself because I am short.  Kids' sizes 12-14 (or L) generally fit me quite well, particularly in the Nike brand.<br /><br />However, this top was extremely long, as though for a tall adult who wants to wear it as a tunic."
3.0,"It's not the best quality, but what do you expect for a $25.00 sweater, so why the negative reviews...duh? It doesn't compare in thickness and quality as the more expensive versions of this sweater. You have to layer it with a black undershirt or thin black Henley. It's worth  $25.00 bucks as long as you aren't expecting high quality.<br />As for size. I am '5 9&#34; @ 177 lbs of. The slim but muscular build and I ordered a large. I fits me just fine."
3.0,They are ok but cheaply made.
3.0,Nice dress but you definitely need to size up. I’m usually as size 12. I figured since the dress stretches that a large would fit but it is way too small.
3.0,Nice quality but don't expect to see the word 'Love' on the band. It gets polished off.
3.0,Really cute top! Just be aware that it runs a little small.
3.0,"I bought this for my wife as a gift she loves it! Except one thing, the claps come open when any pressure is put on the bracelet. So please keep that in mind when purchasing this. She wanted to wear this every day, but this has become a special occasion piece!"
3.0,Bracelet has been hard to size
3.0,It is a little bulky!  Doesn’t hold fabric well !!!
3.0,"I gave it the star because,Today was the first time I carried my little backpack. It’s a perfect little bag to take around but, today the zipper scripted and it won’t zip anymore. That’s the sad part about it."
3.0,Nice item but smelly
3.0,"I received 2 of these cute little bracelets. One with 4 shells and 1 with 6. The 4 shell bracelet won’t go over my hand even though it says it extends to 13”. It has the same specs as the 6 shell on the sales page, but in real life it’s much smaller. It’s a cheap little item and doesn’t look like it would last long, but I bet a 12 year old would Love it. It comes in a pretty velvet pouch and would make a perfect stocking stuffer."
3.0,"I didn't realize how small it was, and one of the zippers is messed up....guess I made a bad decision but dealing with returns are too much of a headache. I Don't recommend"
3.0,"I ordered the dress with the white/floral bottom, and the bottom is significantly sheer. I'll try to wear with nude undies, and at night, but still not sure it will work."
3.0,"First off i love the detail and designs on this watch. And i love to hit the button that makes the noise. And i love the fact that it actually tells time. It's just a fun toy.<br /><br />But i do have to say it cost more than it's worth. And i wish the watch was not plastic. And the button on the side that makes nose is easy to hit and always go's off, if your not care full. So don't bring it to class like I do and make the teacher mad because you have the doctor's voice coming from your jacket pocket."
3.0,I like how it looks. I wore it over Christmas but had to take it off early as it was too heavy.
3.0,"Felt soft and is very breathable, only complaint is that pearls came broken in the package and pearls did not last long on mask"
3.0,"Fits pretty tight and arrived with quite a few seams coming undone. I've ordered a few things from Allegra K now and I can never get the sizing right. I usually wear small to medium and this time I tried a small and regret it. I ordered a small before and it was too big. The sleeves are tight and sometimes the buttons look like they'll burst. I don't tie the bow because it doesn't looks right.  It is a very cute shirt though,  perfect for spring. Just order the right size."
3.0,"Wrong color..i ordered red and got orange,the fit was fine."
3.0,"I really like the 100% cotton and nice feel of these. They are tighter than other brands of the same size. Medium fits 30-32. I'm size 34 and usually medium fits me well. These feel uncomfortably tight. Also the fly won't stay shut. The tailoring seems to be the cause, and the inner side is slightly longer. I have at least 5 brands of boxers and these are the only ones that do that. Maybe not so much an issue if you always wear them under something, but it bothers me."
3.0,It works as intended but it is a bit flimsy on the wrist so for that it gets 3 stars
3.0,The toddler almost immediately ripped the flowers off as soon as she had it on. The three flowers in front are a little much and unnecessary. Decided to take them off and add ribbon to replace
3.0,"Cute, but the charm has fallen off the key ring multiple times! Had to replace the piece that holds the charm to the key ring."
3.0,My son loves them so I can’t take them back. Very narrow...
3.0,"This is a weird polyester material, way less breathable than I expected. It was also super short on me (I'm 5'7) so I ended up giving it to a friend who is a little shorter."
3.0,Decent quality for the price I suppose. I wish that they lasted a bit longer. They started to wear down after a few months and I wasn't able to wear them anymore as holes started to form on the inner thighs. I prefer a more durable legging for daily workouts.
3.0,"Decent but somewhat misleading... a hallow ring, with some sort of pattern/design underneath, with rough interior edges makes it almost unwearable 24/7. Should be much better!"
3.0,I don't like the style.  Joui
3.0,Little small.
3.0,"fabric a bit heavy, but true to size and is a cute dress.  a bit small in neck and shoulder area.  the 2 crochet lines running down the front arent very flattering on an xl gal, especially on a shapeless dress.  looks better belted, but is quite short and belt makes it even shorter.<br />love the criss-cross neck and bell sleeves."
3.0,"chain is as shown in picture, the only problem is the clasp as a bad defects; hard to open and close plus...  a 3 star was given for appearance and length, but should be a 2 star..."
3.0,Husband liked it a lot
3.0,"the printing of the larger mermaid set is not the best quality, you can see the little dots that make the color. Everything else is nice, 100% cotton and the size fits nicely too."
3.0,Size runs really small
3.0,These sunglasses are definitely cool and I receive many compliments. That said the screws have to be constantly tightened. I also dropped them and it cracked the frames.  Granted it was on concrete but it wasn't very far.
3.0,"On the second day the gems started falling out, but customer service gave me a full refund. They also said they would notify their production to make sure it doesnt happen again."
3.0,The shirt was a little smaller than expected and I found a whole under my arm put after a few weeks of use
3.0,"I didn't care for the elastic straps.  Can only imagine the mess in the washer, especially when washing all six of the ones I bought together.  Sending back."
3.0,"Smaller than I expected, pretty see- through."
3.0,I did like it but for 21 smackers its a bit too small.
3.0,"The slit looks like it’s on the side in the pictures, but it’s actually right in the middle and goes up pretty high. I loved every other thing about this dress so I hate that it was cut so weird. It is one layer of unlined fabric so very thin but flattering for a curvy figure. The purple color is beautiful! Just wish I the slit was lower or in a different place so I wasn’t afraid to show everyone my baby box."
3.0,These are more neon than the picture shows.
3.0,"I bought two, one was perfect and one of the zippers was broken for the change compartment."
3.0,Doesn’t make you sweat like the Sweet sweat band does. It’s like an off brand version. Will not repurchase
3.0,It was smaller than I expected. It is also a low quality item that is not put together very well.I am afraid to wear it much because it might fall apart.
3.0,I loved it but when i got it the heart had smugges on it and the daughter heart jad a chip in it it was sad...
3.0,Fabric is not top quality !
3.0,"The mask fits good but trying to wear it with glasses is difficult with the nose peice, ot leaves indents on your nose"
3.0,"I guess it depends on who you purchasing this necklace for. I bought it for my 9 year-old daughter and it seem too heavy.<br />Also, the leather string smells sooooo bad that we had to air it out in the garage for 2 weeks, but finally decided to replace it."
3.0,Poor quality and bad fit.
3.0,Really cute and comfortable but it was missing a button so that threw the whole thing off.
3.0,Got this for my mom's birthday and they are beautiful! They are great sizes and aren't heavy.<br /><br />Update...zipper on the larger bag is already broken. Mom is so disappointed.
3.0,cheap so you get what you pay for- perfect for a 10/12 year old friendship
3.0,"Little big for me, but cute and nice quality. Gave it to my sister!"
3.0,I gave this necklace as a gift and she loved it. It has been 3 weeks now and the chain is starting to change color.
3.0,Elastic
3.0,The size is nice and flowy but the length is very short. Great for shorter girls but I'm 6'1'' and will have to wear them with leggings.
3.0,"Item is as described.  Nothing too fancy, not as clear and bright as image online. Comes in a cheap clamshell like it came out of a claw game machine."
3.0,Runs small!! I would size up!!
3.0,"This a beautiful classic watch....great European styling, very comfortable....it was if fact designed by Europeans. But be warned, it is manufactured in China. It is a fine watch but I don't like being mislead. So because of the deception of origin 3 stars it is."
3.0,"I thought this was a great idea, however the  product creates to much fog on the vinyl/plastic face shield to use the shield.  I ended up folding that part down and eventually just cut it off.  your better off buying the ones without the face shield and buying a separate face shield instead.  I give them an A for effort but a D for effectiveness.  Sorry guys.  just being honest.  Other than that one small detail I am happy with the product."
3.0,it could be nice but it is too loose and the matterial is weird
3.0,Not as big a brim as shown.  Packed all rolled/folded up.  Still trying to get wrinkles out.
3.0,"Daughter wears an XL and was too small, I wear a med/LG and it fits"
3.0,its good and matches my purse; its also genuine leather
3.0,Didn't fit well on my body
3.0,"Loved the color of this purse so I bought it on a lightning deal, which by the way is still the same price 2 weeks later.The color you see on screen is brown but when I got it I would've called it golden brown because it is soooo light in color and I think most people would probably not like it. That being said you get 3 sections and the 2 on top are nice but they don't open very far but enough for me. The middle section is nice and has small pockets on the inside which I like. The hardware is really shiny gold and looks rather cheap but it doesn't look cheaply made. My sisters comment to me was it looked like something an old lady would carry and I reminded her I was 47!"
3.0,"did not fit i had someone who i could give it to, nice style"
3.0,"Cute, but they are kinda heavy"
3.0,Would have been nice if the fabric wasn’t sheer/ see through. Now I have to wear cycling shorts under this.
3.0,What if didn’t like about this product was it’s size and the eye pieces were not adjustable. The color was really a strong yellow that was difficult to adjust my eyes to. I do computer data input and I had hoped these would help me but they were too difficult for me to get used to.
3.0,It's good as lounge wear but has no support. Padding is very uncomfortable so I took it off. Don't think about using this at the gym unless you have a small cup size.
3.0,a lot smaller then it appears.
3.0,Doesn't drape evenly.
3.0,I had surgery on one foot last May. I could feel the texture was too rough for the healing foot and I couldn’t wear them.
3.0,Works great! Don't have to put a bandaid over my stud. Work required that wither I take it out or use a clear stud.
3.0,I am  bit unhappy because the dangle does not set even when being worn.
3.0,"Honestly it is a beautiful sweater.  Well made, soft and silky but AI wear a 6 maybe an 8 if it is very form fitting.  I would normally order a medium in a sweater like this for a little extra room.  Based on reviews about size I ordered a large.  It just fits and actually pulls a little when it is buttoned up.  Sleeves however are more than long enough and have to be folded back.  I was going to order several in different colors. If I get a bigger size the sleeves will drag on the ground, so sad."
3.0,I love the support these slippers provide however I’ve had these just over a year and the velcro closure strap is already ripping. Poor quality for an $80 slipper! I can’t find any customer support information either.
3.0,"I thought the color was coral, but it’s bright orange.  Disappointing, but I kept since I can pair the patterned ring with my remaining purple twilight ring."
3.0,Fit well but material is thin and light. I was hoping for a better quality material.
3.0,They are heavy. But nice.
3.0,Different shoe.  Pretty narrow.  Do not buy to walk in. This shoe is designed for running.  There is extra padding in the fore foot which is great for people who land on the fore foot.  Fortunately I run this way.  My foot is just a little too wide for the shoe though.
3.0,Ring is great for an active person. Looks nice too. The only problem is that it stretched out so now it's too big. Luckily I bought a size smaller i had planned on returning but will now use.
3.0,i thought they would be a bit larger than they were i was trying to use them in a burlesque feather dance but they are way to small for somthing like that more of a hand fan size but cute for a party or a costume
3.0,The description of the dress was red. The dress is actually hot pink.
3.0,"It may say plus size, but it really isn't.  It fits great thru the legs, but tight in the waist area.  I tried wearing them for a day and couldn't stand it."
3.0,These shoes are not comfortable.
3.0,These were great for our Mardi Gras party and went well with the rest of the outfit!
3.0,unfortunately this does not fit.  I bought this in the black andnitnfit wonderfully so i ordered it in blue same size...however itnis 3xs bigger and bc of covid not easy to return
3.0,"Nice material but very boxy fit, I will return"
3.0,Well made but very short.  My wife now wears them.
3.0,"I was looking for a racer-back tank that also offered a higher neckline to cover my chest from sun exposure when working/exercising outside. This tank fits the bill. The fabric is very stretchy and billowy in the wind though, clinging to and highlighting any curves below that you had hoped the looser fit would conceal."
3.0,Fit's like a half shirt.
3.0,The material is bigger than expected in the arms. The fit is loose and the front maerial hangs down far. The color is as seen on photo. The material is much thinner than anticipated but overall the cardigan is nice.
3.0,"I compare all of these China-made socks to my Darn Tough ones, and only a couple have held up.  These are well-built and have some extra padding on the soles/toes/heels and the shins, but it appears that ""extra"" is really in comparison to some rather thin material throughout the rest of the sock.  Maybe a little deceiving, if you ask me.  That said, I'm looking forward to knowing how this wool content works out - my hope and expectation is that it will keep my feet warm while working from home in my basement this winter, and will help to manage moisture better than other socks do.  When my feet are cold and sweaty, I'm not a happy guy!  No comparison to Darn Tough, by the way."
3.0,Not as nice after washing.  Make sure to hand wash this item.
3.0,I was disappointed in the quality and appearance. Very cheaply made. Wouldn't recommend.
3.0,"This is a nice outfit but not one to purchase on line. The skirt was too small and the top was huge. The corset is nicely made. I am disappointed and returning it. If I had a chance to try it on, it would have been an easy decision. I hope this will be more appropriate for someone with narrow hips and big boobs!"
3.0,My daughter loved them but stopped functioning after 2 months lights would not turn on even thoughwe charged them.
3.0,"Too large.<br /><br />I got the green one and how it is portrayed in the picture is very one sided.<br /><br />When walking, it looks like I have nothing but a towel on.<br /><br />Also, the way it is tied and folded in the image looks significantly better than what is shown in the instructions that come with the bottom.<br /><br />Just a let down. I'll have to try another pair from a different company that produces different sizes."
3.0,The print and design of th dress is so nice but it’s see through and very very short
3.0,"Very thin material, and faded."
3.0,"I mainly bought this watch winder because it appears to support battery operation. Unfortunately, the device isn't able to run for very long off two AA batteries, and stops running after a few hours / days (depending on the type of battery), even though my battery tester still reports acceptable charge. I ended up having to use the AC adapter to keep the motor running.<br /><br />Otherwise, the device seems to operate the way I expect. I was just hoping that battery operation would last longer (e.g. a month or so on rechargeables), so that I'd have more flexibility on where to place this device. Not sure what I was expecting out of something this price range, but definitely disappointed with this purchase."
3.0,"The picture of the scarf (scarves- because for some reason they send you two of the exact same one- not complaining about that) is different than the one you get. The coloring is off and I prefer the color in the picture. The one I received is more of an burnt orange-brown, it doesn't look as nice."
3.0,"I bought these glasses to protect my eyes during UV photography.  I held them in front of my UV light and they hardly cast a shadow.  They are not protective enough for my purposes.  I haven't tried driving with them because they don't fit comfortably over my glasses.  Your results may vary.  I thought I could save a few bucks on UV blocking glasses but, not with these.  I guess I'll have to spend the big bucks on proper ones."
3.0,The watch band fits my watch nicely. The quality is poor it's more like suede not leather. I'll use for now but I'm ordering a leather one from a different seller
3.0,I like the look of it but the clasp is easily opened and watch falls off. I have had it for a while now and it has fallen off several times.
3.0,"Made of good quality, but color is more of a cream than brown color like the picture"
3.0,This dress is really cute. I only give it 3 stars because it was to big. And to long.
3.0,"I love the bag itself. It is roomy and I love the colors! But the handle is already coming unstitched. Not worth the hassle to send it back but I'm not impressed with the poor craftsmanship. If I had paid retail, I would be angry for sure. But I will fix it myself at the price I paid."
3.0,Was expecting more of an elasticity glove.  These are very cheap and not very durable.  They are good for minor handling of items.
3.0,After a few wears the plating wears off and your ears will turn green and itch. Pretty but not what I was looking for.
3.0,Great shirt. Nice quality. Size is not even close to correct. Runs very small
3.0,"This is more of a toy like,  the cross piece that is supposed to be inserted and the lock pin are very loose. I'm not sure if I would tfust this to catch a crab line, let alone to hoyst anything... Then to be able to grab a penny or even a ball, well, it hasn't been very sturdy in the practice before going outside with it. Upon the first hour of review, I think next time I'll buy a real grapple without the novelty portion."
3.0,"Muy bonito para nuestro nieto,lo recibió en Miami pero tiene un olor penetrante e insoportable,no se si es la pintura."
3.0,I liked the material. I am bigger and it did not do me any favors. Not flattering at all.
3.0,"Very nice bracelet, only lasted 3 days though. Clip/hook broke :("
3.0,Somewhat cheap looking
3.0,Great bold dress
3.0,Small and cute. Great for the price!
3.0,"This ring is gorgeous, and decent quality for the price. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it already.  Unfortunately it isn't holding up as an everyday ring. I've been wearing it every day for about 2 weeks now and the gold plating is already wearing off. It's copper underneath the rose gold so the color will stay the same, just less shine. Hoping it doesn't turn my skin green! Otherwise, I love it!"
3.0,This hat was soft and does not hold its shape. The accessories came off easily.
3.0,"Very &#34;lightweight&#34; material, wrinkles eaily"
3.0,"Very Tiny for larger woman, can barely see the diamonds or the small stone, maybe 1/2 long?  Love the style if it were larger."
3.0,"A bit larger than your average US size. I have wide feet and usually wear a 13 wide. I wore a 12.5 regular in these.<br /><br />The quality did not equal that of the Rocky S2V boots I had prior to these.  Two of the eyelets snapped on me in the first week. The laces were far too long for the boot (I replaced them with a shorter pair) and the stitching in the back came out completely on one boot after just a few months of wear.<br /><br />I always add insoles to my boots, and they have been very comfortable, I just wish they had been a little more durable."
3.0,The hat is adorable but we had to return it because the glasses arrived broken.
3.0,It’s a good idea. But the fit of the charging attachment isn’t right. Had to struggle to get it attached to the sunglasses. The frame is Soprano. Not sure if it works for other models...
3.0,The material was kind of see through and a little thin.
3.0,I love the design and how it look its just a bit uncomfortable to wear. When I do wear it I usually have to take it out for a few minutes to give my ear a small break
3.0,Super thin. The pleats at the back were crumpled and there is no way to smoothen them out. I tried washing and drip drying the top but to no avail. The stitching was good. I am a medium in tops and the sizing was exact. If you will be okay with a super thin top with a crumple pleat back than you would be okay.
3.0,Good face mask for all this nonsense going around right now. Really comfortable. They do say it doesn’t pill but with about a weeks use it definitely is pilling. With that said it is still pretty good. I would probably buy another one price is decent and it is functional.
3.0,"This product was almost there. I sized up,  but I shouldn't have. Maybe I'm also too short for this to hug my curves correctly. I'm 5'2 and 125 and should have gotten a small or extra small for it to be flattering"
3.0,It was very pretty but the fit was a little snug.
3.0,Not very soft cloth.
3.0,"Super cute, but please DO NOT DRY it shrunk almost a foot when I dried it."
3.0,Shirt shrunk after one wash
3.0,"A little bigger and darker than I thought, but a good product for the price."
3.0,"I really like these and have bought several pairs however the last two times I ordered them in long, they have been very short.  More like capris.  I didn’t return because I’ll still wear but changed my review to 3 stars because it’s not what I ordered."
3.0,Okay is you're okay with see through shirts.
3.0,"The size was too small for my needs. The product was well made and would have met my expectations,"
3.0,Liked the look. Not a heavy necklace. Clasp a little hard to open. Very elegant necklace for an affordable price.
3.0,I loved the bear sizes! UHowever the chain was a little long and this same product was on eBay for $1 the price wasn't personally worth it
3.0,"NOT FOR HIGH IMPACT<br />Great for everyday but NOT HIGH IMPACT!!<br />Not sure how to rate this because it is comfortable, but it is NOT FOR HIGH IMPACT!"
3.0,Liked the dress but a little too loose for me in the top.  The print was a little too large and loud in pictures.  I wish I had worn something else for my event.
3.0,"I like the look of it however the sleeves were too short and the bottom where they cinched was too tight. I do have longer arms, so may work for others.."
3.0,Fits smaller than expected and was thin material. I had to wear a shirt under the top because the top is almost see through. Was a nice design and soft material.
3.0,Closest cheap option to Victoria's secret bombshell bra. Was hoping this bra would eliminate the space between bra and breast that often comes with push up bras. Sadly it does not but it is effective at giving your girls some extra padding to make them appear bigger.
3.0,Definitely not long enough.
3.0,"I like the belt when using the piece to connect it together. When using it on the belt loop, it pulls the loops so far since I need it tight to close the back gap and I'm afraid it will break."
3.0,Adorable but the bottoms aren’t close to a 2t size.
3.0,"I didn't realize this would have a satin sheen to it, which makes it look a bit cheap to my eye."
3.0,The quality of these were good my only reason for reviewing and warning really is they are MUCH darker than pictured. So dark that the use I wanted them for (pyrography) couldn't be done so I had to return them.<br />Also the necklaces were all kinds of tangled so that might be a chore.<br />And lastly I counted 23 of 24 in the pack I sent back. So quantity issue as well.<br />That said nice quality. They weren't chipped/broken/or any other issue with the cross or necklaces themselves.
3.0,Pockets for cards are a bit small for credit cards/ etc. It smelled funny when i got it but other then that i thought it was a good product.
3.0,"I want to love these, but i have a very sensitive face, and these feel scratchy to me. They are beautiful and i definitely receive compliments when i wear them."
3.0,"I like the design idea, but the dress is badly made. It did not fit correctly, and the fabric was cheap. The dress I received had a fault in the lace all down the skirt front."
3.0,"Good quality fabric but it was way too short. I'm 5'2&#34;, 120 lbs. and ordered a size 8. I usually wear a size 2. It was very tight and pushed down on my shoulders."
3.0,"I am disappointed in the clips used to hold the light on the belt. The first day I used it for walking after dark, one of the clips broke off. Instead of a heavy duty clip that has the belt run through it, it is an open clip that hugs the belt, the kind that you don't need to open the belt to get it on and off. The pieces that wrap around the edge of the belt, are thin plastic that are strong enough."
3.0,"This looks great on the model, but in real life it is a bit tight and not as comfy as I had expected. It is best if you don't have a lot on top. Otherwise, even for a small busted woman, it is tight."
3.0,Love the shirt but it is way smaller than I thought. I purchased an XL and normally wear a medium. it fits but is tight.
3.0,Arrived with torn zipper and lace in one sleeve. Had to return. Amazon customer service was great as always! Otherwise a pretty dress.
3.0,"Looks great,Fits perfect! Great deal!!!"
3.0,Color was a little off in upper chest area...
3.0,Now it's too short.
3.0,"Although I do like these blouses (this is my 2nd) this pink is not pale! My other color was true gray. Then I wanted this style in pale pink, but received a hot pink color…..just sayin….not me."
3.0,"This band works as a great replacement for the stock band on the Samsung Gear S2. It has a nice slick silicone feel to it. In my opinion it is just a tad bit over priced. There are tons of other bands out there for around $9. Also I have to say I do not<br /> like the way this band closes. The set up of this band is very similar to the Samsung Gear Fit 2 band. I had that one for only 10 days and it was always coming undone. The bands that just pop into place are not very secure. Lastly, the blue band showed in the stock photo is no where near the color of the band that I received. The stock photo is a bright royal blue and the band I received looks more like a slate grey than a blue. (see photos) This is not a bad band by any means, but if I had read the product description a bit better I probably would not have ordered it. To me it just is not a very secure way to wear the band. I received this product for free or at a reduced price, the review above is my unbiased opinion."
3.0,Loved the colors! But the top did not fit well. Lots of side boob and the elastic didn't seem to grab well. if the straps were adjustable I could have made it work
3.0,Pretty necklace for a little girl. Well worth the $3
3.0,"This watch band seems well made. But, the pin and band are both too wide to fit a 23 mm Citizen Eco Drive watch.  I did confirm to size with Citizen, and ended up buying a new 23 mm band and pin from a local jewelry store."
3.0,Got small and literally look liked Harry Potter’s lil sister. Not what I wanted them for. Wouldn’t recommend for the daily aesthetic but if it’s for a Costume go ahead boo.
3.0,Fits a bit big
3.0,"I sent it back, it looked weird on me."
3.0,Girth is small. I am 5'2&#34; and got a large. I suggest getting an XL
3.0,"There is no need for these glasses to have dark lenses....a slight tint, ok...but super dark sunglasses with a light up feature makes no sense. I couldn’t see so they didn’t work for me."
3.0,"My son loves these shorts. They're super soft on the inside and the fabric is nice, fit is good....but the second time he wore them, a seam came loose and there's a hole in the crotch now."
3.0,lenses are super dark so you can only wear them on a really bright day.
3.0,"The sweatshirt was cute! If you like all black pumpkins. I like color so Just not my style or the one I ordered.  It was light weight and looked very comfy, I have a similar sweatshirt I absolutely love. Unfortunately I don’t like the decal on the front. I ordered the one with colored pumpkins.<br /><br />I ordered the one with different colored pumpkins and the four spiders and was sent the all black pumpkins one. I asked for a replacement and was sent the wrong one again. It’s in the process of a return and is THE ONLY time I’ve had to wait for a product to get back to Amazon before I get a refund. I usually get them as soon as I send it. So fingers crossed I get my money back."
3.0,"These are nice glasses.<br /><br />They fit well, come in a nice case and have a spare set of lenses.  However, they do not keep as much air out of your eyes as I anticipated.<br /><br />If you are using them jogging, mountain biking, or hiking, they would be fine.  If you intend higher speed sports, like snow skiing or motorcycle riding, your eyes will water."
3.0,Did not fit my needs.  I wanted to use as a hand bag yet it was just tooo large.  Would be good to carry a laptop or work supplies but not as a fashion statement or clothes assessory.
3.0,"On the ad, this looks like a date or dinner dress - but in person, it's made of such thin T-Shirt fabric that it would show any skin or undergarments beneath it. The side ruffle is also kind of thin, so it was hard to tie or to lay flat against the dress.<br />Nice price, but returned due to too casual style."
3.0,"Fit as expected, material thinner than I expected. But my real disappointment was the misleading picture that item comes with a belt.. It does not,  when I returned to the post I found out I was not the only one that was mislead. The seller's reply to the query was that the absence of the belt was stated in the description,  it is true,  but I still considered it misleading picture..."
3.0,Fits small and odd
3.0,Thicker material than I thought they would be.
3.0,This is an ok set...everyone asks if it is a Christmas poinsettia and it does look like one.
3.0,"I love anything yellow, so these were a perfect addition to my jewelry collection...the only complaint is that the bevel tarnishes. I think it was already tarnished when I received them."
3.0,It's OK just not like the picture
3.0,Too big I ordered a size large and I wear a size 10 dress it was way too big please order size down
3.0,"The quality is not the bad , but it looks like it won't last at all .  However it looks Super cool if you wear with spaghetti tops."
3.0,Material is a little thin. Not stretchy at all. It was a little hard to get on my daughter.
3.0,The fitting is not as expected
3.0,"They look really nice in the picture but when I got them, they looked and felt cheap. They weigh next to nothing and the lenses weren't put on correctly. I did however appreciate the little bag to put them in that came in the box  but I would not recommend unless you are buying them to see how they look on you before purchasing the expensive brand ones."
3.0,Loose in the groin
3.0,It was a little hard to put on and was a little itchy but it’s super cute
3.0,"While these are what I expected to a point, they failed the battery test.  Neither piece had a good battery.  You should factor in the battery cost with the watch purchase price, then there won't be any surprises."
3.0,Sizing could be better. I bought an xl but too small so had to go up to an xxl. These are made small so order a size up. Have to return the first one that was way too small to get refund.
3.0,They should take the word suede out of the description
3.0,Very pretty but fits large
3.0,"It worked, but it was very poorly done. The teeth weren't all painted and the edges weren't trimmed."
3.0,Returned because the color wasn’t what I was looking for. FYI this is the “burgundy” one
3.0,"I love these sweatshirts, but this was obviously a previous return. The entire thing was covered in cat hair. If you order this make sure to check it thoroughly when you receive it."
3.0,The cotton cord appears to be black in all photos but it is not black it is gray.<br />Disappointed
3.0,Definitely not plus sized arm holes...more like wrist sized
3.0,"The picture makes it look like there will be some excess fabric to hang at the top, but this hat is not really that big (and I don't have a big head).  Otherwise, it's a warm cap and I did get many compliments on it."
3.0,"I bought a size down, and there was no compression. I usually wear a large sized shirt, and I should have ordered a small."
3.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): This layered necklace is so pretty.  It is sparkly, delicate and dainty.  I got the ""ferris wheel"" design with the little gold circles with tiny faux diamonds.  The ""ferris wheels"" are beautiful.  The necklace is very versatile - it can be worn with a casual outfit or a dressy outfit.  The necklace comes very nicely packaged, making it nice to give as a gift.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when I wear this necklace I find myself having to constantly adjusting it because the two layers tend to twist and tangle the wrong way.  This is a bit distracting."
3.0,Little large for kids and quality is also not that great.
3.0,Print quality looks just like the photo but does not fit my face. It’s too big. I have a smaller face but I feel this would even be too big on my fiancé’s face.
3.0,"Shoe was very cute and seems to be constructed well, only problem being that they are very big and would definitely not fit a 0-6 month old. (More like a 1-1/2 year old)"
3.0,Haven't used much but visor smudges easily. My fingerprints all over it. Solution?
3.0,They are ok. I wouldn't buy them again. They seem cheap.
3.0,"I have purchased their yoga shorts and they are perfect, but these pull down away from waist and the crotch.  I have pulled the material way up hoping to stop the drop; but no luck.<br /><br />They are well made but don't fit me well.  I am 5'1"" tall, weigh 103 pounds and bough a size sm.  Xsm would be TOOOOOO small in my legs and waist."
3.0,Great for the price. The colours are nice but ultimately the band looks a bit cheap. My wrists are small and this is a bit wider than the regular sports band which didn't help the overall look. Returned them.<br /><br />PROs:<br />- great colours<br />- price<br />- easy to install<br />- comfortable<br /><br />CONs:<br />- wide (for small wrists)<br />- looks cheap
3.0,hang to low for me but there ok
3.0,Not as large as I thought.
3.0,"I wouldn't suggest to wear this dress to a formal event.  Also, not as pictured - the cutouts on my dress are white."
3.0,"Comfortable, and good value for the price.  Only thing I didn't like is the color of the faded portions - instead of looking nicely faded it looks dingy/dirty."
3.0,"Its pretty, but made of cheap polyester.  Its like wearing plastic."
3.0,"It's easy to use because you don't have to take it off and on when you are out in public. Just pull it down, pull it up - very easy to use. It is easy to clean."
3.0,I gave 3 stars because even though the overall outfit is pretty..mine did not come with the two bells for the hair or the one at the waist?? I read other reviews that some people received them and others did not. The description does say it comes with the bells. I am disappointed and will be returning back.
3.0,"I got the 5&#34; and that size worked great as filler in my paper flower center pieces. I am giving these 3 stars because the color shown is not even close to the color I received. My colors were pale pink, pale peach and ivory, and the color shown is perfect for that, however, the color flowers I received were a very vivid peach, almost orange color (see picture). So I was a little disappointed by that. I still ended up using them, but it just wasn't the right color. *I sprayed them with gold sparkle spray on the edges, that's not how they come."
3.0,I usually wear a medium. I got a medium. I could fit several of me in this thing with room to spare! I'm not sure sizing down would even help; it seems to just be cut with a ton of extra fabric.
3.0,"Not off the shoulder as described, that’s why I wanted it. But cute & comfy enough to keep anyways. Over sized."
3.0,"Cute comfy dress, but white dress is VERY see through. Even with white underwear and white bra you could totally see it. Thin material as well. Definitely wear leggings with this. Also nude color bra or white sports bra works best."
3.0,"The top is very cute, but runs small."
3.0,"Runs a bit on the small side , really nice , I received the wrong size though so I’m returning to reorder ... hopefully it will be the right size"
3.0,"These shoes are really cute, but they run a little large.  I ordered a 6.5 and I should've ordered a size 6."
3.0,"These are perfectly fine jogger shorts. For the price, I think they are not the best quality. I ordered the extra small and feel like they run a bit large."
3.0,"Faster shipping than expected. Item is like picture. Obviously since the price is so low I didn't expect a very nice necklace. Its cheap looking, but its cute though. Makes a nice stocking stuffer."
3.0,Too narrow for my flinstone feet.
3.0,"Very basic, thin material, not suitable for me.  Teenagers perhaps."
3.0,I LOVE THIS NECKLACE!  THIS NECKLACE IS A REAL CONVERSATION PIECE.  IT IS NOT THE FINEST QUALITY BUT IS GREAT FOR WHAT IT IS.  THIS DID TAKE VERY LONG TO RECEIVE BUT AWESOME WHEN IT CAME!
3.0,"I didn’t expect anything amazing for the price, but I did expect a completed garment. The bottom hemline was just cut fabric. “They” didn’t bother to hem the dress. While the rest of it is decent, at best, I’ll be returning this."
3.0,No really for every table thickness
3.0,Bought 3T size and got the undies with the tag on the outside. I ended up cutting  the tags off myself hoping it wouldn’t tear at the seam once I washed them. They held up fine. Got another similar pair and the tags were on the inside back which is a much better place for the tags. Quality is good and much better than Target undies.
3.0,these fit a little big on my head. Not sure I will order again
3.0,"I love the look of this, but it is not as loose as it looks on the model. I wanted to order a few of these too."
3.0,"Ordered a small and the fit was good.<br /><br />Material is super light and possibly very flammable (the dress is made out of very thin nylon)<br /><br />Did not wear it for my event because the dress came in a very small box and when I opened it, it was very wrinkled that it looked so messy. The tag says not to iron so I couldn’t do much with it (even left it on the hanger all night to see if the creases would soften but nothing)<br /><br />Sad to say I didn’t get to enjoy this dress!"
3.0,These are adorable. Although I will say they feel a bit cheap. They run a little large as well. My daughter is rather petite so I got her a size smaller and it was still a little big. Still cute though.
3.0,These bands are ok for the price.  Wish they were a little longer because I have a big wrist.
3.0,Alot heavier than expected to the point I know I can't wear them long term but are absolutely adorable
3.0,"The upper portion of the dress fits kind of big and slides off my shoulders. I probably should have exchanged it for a smaller size, but I wanted something loose & flowy. The material is heavy though and the side split opens up to expose upper thigh when I walk."
3.0,"I took a side by side comparison of a regular US size large and their size large. I understand that the item came from China, but their large looks like something that would fit on a child, not an adult like the picture portrayed. I'm disappointed because the fabric and print are really nice and soft. I just wish they offered larger sizes. Unfortunately I will need to return the shirt for a refund because I cannot get anything larger."
3.0,The color was completely off. Not a burgundy more a red.
3.0,"I have had this chain less than 6 months and it broke. Loved the look, not worth buying. Very disappointing."
3.0,"I have other socks from this manufacturer that I like quite well, but these just annoy me.<br /><br />This package comes with six pairs of colorful socks - two each of green/blue/black/grey; purple/black/grey; and blue/red/grey. I really like the colors, and the fact that they are mostly cotton, but that's about it.<br /><br />The description says ""The low cut socks are triple wide silicone heel grips help keep socks from slipping down."", which is absolutely correct, as you can see from my photo, but the strips just annoyed me to no end. (And I don't generally have trouble with socks sliding down anyway.)<br /><br />These socks also sit lower than typical low-cut socks I wear (see 2nd photo), but the heel had some extra material. (I wear a size 9 shoe, so I don't think it's my feet!)  They just weren't comfortable to me.<br /><br />Each pair of socks came on a piece of sorta-foot-shaped thick, cardboard (see photo), which leaves you with a lot of cardboard shapes that have no use (unless you have kids that might want to color them). They were bundled with a ""panvbo"" paper wrapped around them, then in a plastic bag. I personally don't like waste, so this huge amount of trash created bugs me.<br /><br />I machine washed and dried them with no problems.<br /><br />At the current price of $13.99, that's about $2.33 per pair."
3.0,"Super cute skirt! I expected the colors to be much more muted than they are, the purple is and green are almost neon. Still cute tho"
3.0,"Ordered this shirt last min because I needed a xmas shirt for a party. On a good note, the shipping was pretty fast and I got it like 3 days later, just in time for the party! While I was satisfied with the overall look and feel of the shirt, I noticed it was extremely thin, not of good quality. I wore it for the party, it looked great, but, after I washed it one time, a hole appeared in the neck line. I was very sad, it may be good for a few more wears, before the hole gets bigger."
3.0,This is not a tunic but a normal length sleeveless shirt
3.0,"not bad, but quite a bit smaller than most XLs."
3.0,Good quality but runs a little smaller than i would e expected. Order a size up.
3.0,Fairwell
3.0,Not really for a person with a size 10 or larger shoe
3.0,"Very nice coat, great price, but the sizing is off considerably.  I'm 6'2, 320 lbs, I ordered a 5xl, it fits like a 2xl.  I'll have to sell it and hope to find a coat my size."
3.0,Top fit just fine. Waist on shorts is super small.
3.0,Lower quality than I had expected for the price. Other similar pendants were about half the price and I was expecting this one to be a little sturdier. But it fits the purpose and the picture is accurate. Gift receiver loves it.
3.0,"Cannot wear this on its own because you can see right through it, and does not come with the tights (which are impossible to find). And the scarf is not like it is in the photo, it is soooo tiny."
3.0,If you are looking for softness keep looking. These are not fleece lined or anything. Not very soft.
3.0,"I had this for about a year - during that year, I saw several of my keys fall off on the floor, but was able to spot them before losing them. The little key hooks are small and flimsy - they get stretched, scrunched, and space opens up for keys to fall.  All of this was fun until I lost my house key off this case and had to pay a lot of money to replace.  I've since replaced this case with a much simpler & less stylish [[ASIN:B013THC6LQ Cevinee&trade; Mini Outdoor EDC Carrying Bag, Small Molle Accessory Bag, Portable Travel Coins Purse Change Wallet Key Pouch with Inner Stainless Key Ring - Coyote Brown]], which holds the keys securely in a pouch of comparable size."
3.0,El artículo no llegó en buenas condiciones la visera llegó doblada
3.0,"The dress felt super soft but it was also a somewhat thin material. The dress engulfed my 5'2 frame because it was a bit too long for my preferences; it came almost past the bottom of my knees. It's hard to hem up as the ruffles would look uneven but other than that, the dress was nice."
3.0,"It's nice ,but that's about all I can say about this product."
3.0,"When I bought this item, I mark is a gift,but it was came in plastic bag.So now ,I need to buy a nice box for that and it takes me more problem with packing nice/special box for birthday gift... and material nothing special,not bad."
3.0,"Good looking rings, impossible to close!! Great packaging and shipping but I can't fasten them. Tried using tweezers to get the little evil tiny piece conected back into the ring and it shot across the room. I don't know if you've ever tried to find a single tiny piece of metal in a carpet but it's not a good time. That happened twice. The earrings are still sitting on my vanity, not in my ears."
3.0,Very flimsy. I got them all twisted out of shape trying to put them on.
3.0,"Fits very tight and goes longer than my waist past my butt, which I was not expecting."
3.0,not sure what to say about it
3.0,I wish the gold coating was smoother. I really like the silver one but the gold one is bubbly. I'm thinking about returning it but as I said I like the silver one. Still thinking about it.
3.0,I've been wanting to try a digital watch ( I have a Casio divers watch). Can't believe how small this one is. Tiny face and the band barely fits my wrist. Seems like a youth size. Can't really wear it. I've given it to the granddaughters.
3.0,"These are the best readers I own. They weigh nearly nothing and the lenses are super clear, and not as small as some other readers.<br /><br />Edit: while lightweight and crystal clear, they are also as incredibly fragile as they appear. The temples are especially delicate; I've handled then with kid gloves and still broken three consecutive pairs. They don't get a fourth chance."
3.0,"The dress is cute but cheaply made. I expect it to pill easily. I’m 5’6”, 180 lb., and a 38-D. I have a bigger belly and not much butt or hips. The dress is too tight for my figure."
3.0,"It's okay, but I'm returning it due to the flimsy zipper I'm afraid will break on me.. or the fact it bubbles above my butt because my butt is somewhat big, lol. I also wish the jean quality was nicer, but hey, you get what you pay for."
3.0,"It fit just as I wanted. I got the smallest size. Except I was unhappy that after just two uses the fabric doesn't stay in place, it makes folds and it doesn't feel or look smooth when under clothes. Also one of the hooks was already falling fall"
3.0,"Not quite what’s pictured. My navy dress has a high low hemline. I’m 5’7’’ and it’s just above ankle length, which would be too short if not for the high-low hem. Has pockets. Top area fits a little weird and material is extremely thin, so this will mostly be a summer/poolside dress."
3.0,"Nice fabric. Ordered XL and the waistline was so tight I couldn't even pulled them up.  Sent back and ordered another brand, which fir fine."
3.0,"Opening and closing these hoops are SO HARD! I had to use pliers to pry them open! Then after trying to close them in my ear for like an hour, I finally just bent the hoop a little. Then finally I was able to close them, still using my pliers tho. Now I have a sore ear, but hopefully these titanium hoops will help my piercings to heal. Because surgical steel irritates it. Also they feel light and comfortable in~"
3.0,Broke 2nd time wearing them
3.0,"I was hoping this was softer. The inside isn't. It feels the same as the outside. The fit is good and as expected. The collar is oversized, but can be worn draped to the side if wanted. I wish the bottom was more elastic/stretchy. It doesn't cling to the bottom like my other hoodies or crewnecks, it just kind of hangs off me there. I'm average size, so I would prefer it to have a little elastic on the bottom. I washed and hung dried it so there was no shrinkage."
3.0,It’s very thin and you can see your bra and pants through it. I washed it and the length shortened up tremendously.
3.0,The fit is okay. The fabric is not great. It's very itchy and hair/lint cling to it easily. Would not order again.
3.0,"I was so excited to get this key chain charm as it was gift for my brother. On the pictures it looks nice size but once I got it, it was way to small I was disappointed."
3.0,Not the best quality. Very thin material. Hopefully it holds up
3.0,Had to return.  Size was too small.
3.0,Not really adjustable at all. I thought I could adjust it more for my head but it didn’t allow much at all. Great hat except for that.
3.0,These fit good but I didn't like the fabric.  Returned.
3.0,Fits the glass is perfectly but the lenses have a bit of a blue tent to them but for that kind of money what do you expect
3.0,"I got this mask for a masquerade party I was hosting.  While it's a pretty standard mask, as far as comfort and looks, the straps used to tie it on are so cheap! They feel like paper and I was afraid they'd break at the party (and it was very important that that didn't happen since the party was being filmed as a movie and no one was supposed to know who was who. Thankfully it didn't break because I was very careful not to bump it at all once it was tied). The mask itself is nice looking, but it did shed some glitter (right into my eye). It was expected that there would be glitter shedding, so that wasn't a big deal( despite the fact that I couldn't take my mask off because of the party theme to get the glitter out of my eye). The feathers on the side are also pretty awkwardly placed since they covered one of the eye holes almost completely. Overall, if they changed the straps to real ribbon and not paper, or plastic, or whatever it is they are made of, it's be a pretty good mask. I would NOT recommend it as is."
3.0,"SUPER THIN. Like, entirely 100% see-through and cheap feeling, definitely not worth $22 in my opinion. Does not look like the same material as the pic implies."
3.0,Ouch. I almost think it's child size. I'd like to find one in mine. Perhaps XL would fit. I'm 10ish or 42
3.0,This is a comfortable beanie but it is not slouchy. It's much shorter than the picture. Still a nice and warm hat. The mask is a nice feature.
3.0,Nice sweater turtleneck bothered me
3.0,Great sizing with extra room. Pockets tore within a week and the zipper is hard to work.
3.0,"This has a weird smell I can't get rid of. Also, the faux leather came off, so I did my best to peel the rest of it off the arms. It's ok I guess, but you get what you pay for. I will probably take it all apart and remake it how I would like."
3.0,"I needed a necklace for my daughter for her ""Billie Eilish"" themed birthday party. She loved the necklace but it was too big and slightly uncomfortable for her to wear. It's not the best quality but it will dont if you're in a pinch and don't want to spend a fortune at Hot Topic"
3.0,An OK cheap watch.  I already lost it and don't care.
3.0,"Okay so I got this to go to a convention. It’s pretty in color. I only complain about no arm holes, the hat not staying on (but that’s because my head and hair is huge) and the neck hole was too small. We had to cut it and alter it to fit it over my head comfortably. I wore a body suit under it because it was a little short. Im 5’7 with long legs for reference. The building was hot so I did sweat in it, but that’s not the costume’s fault. However keep that in mind when you wear it. Since there were no arm holes it gave the closed cloak look that I did like, but I suggest a fanny pack under it for your phone and money. Maybe a book bag. Id wear it again, but it was definitely a cheaply made costume so keep that in mind. Also, maybe a headband if you have locs like mine, very full and thick."
3.0,"I like the charm and the beads are nice.  But it was smaller than I'd hoped.  I don't have large wrists and usually don't have a problem with bracelets, but this was tight.  Gave it to my wife and she likes it."
3.0,"It is very tight and has left lines on my arm but its fine other than that, its comfortable if your forget it is on your wrist and the colors are good and the fabric is good"
3.0,"Very cute, but runs a little small. Bought a medium and it was a bit snug on my daughter who usually wears a girls 16 or a women's 4. My biggest issue is that it started fraying and piling like a sweater would after one wear. Will add photo when I have time"
3.0,Flimsy fabric but for price if I wear a few times it is ok.
3.0,So Narrow.  Needed bigger size and still narrow
3.0,"Looks really cute on! Fits okay enough. Is a little tight in the waist on me. I ordered a medium and I am 5’6” 155lbs. The top is cute, but just not super functional and hard to move in."
3.0,Material quality less than desirable
3.0,"They came quick, and are as shown BUT packaging was so small. All 10 were shoved in a box smaller than my hand. They all came smashed and unusable. I soaked them in water for about a minute and let them air dry and they are perfect now. I bought them for party favors for a carnival themed party."
3.0,Had to return first pair because one clasp didn’t work. Same thing with replacement one broken clasp.
3.0,It is very comfy but I am larger in the waist so it ran small on me.  I enjoy wearing it.
3.0,"Fits everywhere except the bust.  Couldn't get the zipper closed, and husband laughed at me when I asked him to help.  Not worth the cost of returning it, though - will give it to a smaller-chested friend..."
3.0,"Got them for my son, as he has a large head for a kid of 6. Wish there was a way to tighten them. Red one seems to stay on better than the blue one. He wanted a little variety and they are that. He did say they were comfortable."
3.0,This Batman muscle long sleeve shirt it’s small for me I didn’t know XL it’s kinda small for me but I give it to my lil bro and he loves it  I will buy a little bit bigger size for me tho.
3.0,"I thought there was actually a watch there, but it is just a picture of a watch covered with glass. A bit disappointed it didn't clearly state that!"
3.0,Very nice bag but I don't like the smell. I think it is polyurethane smell I smelled before on other item from different company.<br />I hope the smell goes away before Mother's Day. I bought this a gift for my mother in law.
3.0,Bathing suit is cute but I bought a large and the top looks like an A cup.
3.0,"Returned these glasses, not good quality, very flimsy!"
3.0,"Cute, but I didn’t like the top fabric; much to thin, didn’t match with skirt style"
3.0,This would have gotten 5 stars but the sticker was in an awful place and tore the tint when I tried to remove it.
3.0,I would say that they're not bad for role playing but you may want to fortify them with something more sturdy on the part that goes on your face
3.0,This is really not sized correctly.  If your buying make sure you go 3 sizes up!
3.0,Good quality my BF loved it
3.0,"its a beautiful dress and colour. it does look like the picture but its really long because I very short so it falls on a weird position. if it was longer or shorter it would be fine it just looks strange if you are short. the quality isn't too bad, you get what you pay for."
3.0,I received this necklace in a timely manner. I have not worn it yet but plan to do so with a basic black outfit. The color is more pink than rose gold. Another reviewer made that comment but I did not believe it I guess. But she was correct. it is very pink
3.0,Very pretty shirt but fabric is stretch knit which I do not like and is cut larger in the shoulders and tapered over the hips so the fit is off as it is in items not made in America.
3.0,"after a few wears, this tends to fall and bunch up at the ankles, but material is nice, warm."
3.0,I love the design of the case it is beautiful. I just thought from the pictures the case would be bigger. And also once you put the case on its hard to take off. But overall it's a nice case.
3.0,Runs very small. Shorter than 7 inches. I normally wear size small but these are way too small. Nice lightweight fabric. Will be great for summer.
3.0,Way too small on the chest part. Don’t get me wrong this shirt is super cute I just wish I would have gone up a size.
3.0,"These are more like &#34;costume&#34; goggles than they are &#34;actual&#34; goggles. The &#34;chrome&#34; frames are actually made of light plastic and the lenses are thin plastic as well. Will work well for protecting your eyes from wind and small bugs and/or debris. Peripheral vision is very impaired, so not recommended for use on the road (if planning to use as motorcycle goggles)."
3.0,It’s cute but way too small. Had to return
3.0,Not the best but cheep enough and good enough for Halloween
3.0,I thought it would be cuter but looks better in the pic than in person
3.0,"They are soft, the grippy dots are perfect for smooth floors, but they went thread bare within a couple months."
3.0,Their Medium runs smaller than US medium.
3.0,"The inseam of the shorts is as advertised, but there seems to be a significant ""distance"" of fabric between the top of the inseam and the waistband. I'd have preferred the shorts to fall a little higher on the thigh, but that's just personal preference. I can remedy this by rolling the waistband once. (For reference, I have a ~31 in inseam and ordered a size small)<br /><br />Despite this, they are still very ""silky"" and comfortable. Great for lounging around as well as for sport. I've worn them to the gym a few times — the yellow pair are slightly see-through when squatting or deadlifting, but not scandalously so.<br /><br />And yes — I knew these shorts didn't have pockets when I ordered them, but here I am regretting there's nowhere to put my hands when standing around... alas."
3.0,It's light but the material inside I'm sure will rip fast. Nice size though.
3.0,Earrings are beautiful. Wire back to weak & flimsy. Need better grade wire back.went to put plastic back on them. And they bent. Not happy about that.
3.0,I purchased the gold one. It is cute but it turned colors in less than two months. I had to throw it away. It was cute the few times I wore it.
3.0,Socks are ok but that beanie is either for women or for kids. Too small and too tight. After the first wash it will probably become XS
3.0,"The print of the dress was very pretty.  However, the size runs small.  Not a fan."
3.0,You get what you pay for.  My 5-year-old granddaughter loved it.
3.0,"Very sexy! I bought to go with a maid costume. They looked great however they seemed to fall in weird places, yet stay up at the top. I'm not exactly sure how they gathered the way they did. Also, not as soft as i was anticipating, but still looked great!!"
3.0,"Fits pretty small on my two girls’ heads, despite them having average sized heads for 3-year-olds. Brim is also small, so it won’t actually offer much coverage from the sun. Will work as a last minute purchase for a beach trip this week, but if I could shop again with more time, I would pass on these. Small, cheap, wrinkled."
3.0,"These are really cute and made my butt look great, but they are extremely uncomfortable to wear for longer than 5 minutes. The stretchy material that pulls right at your butt crack is so uncomfortable and made my butt so sore. Just don’t. They’re cute but the pain isn’t worth it."
3.0,Decent variety for the price.. but a couple that I’ve already used were stripped therefore useless
3.0,Vary  heavy
3.0,"This skirt is a real buy for the price.  Not my favorite as it wrinkles badly but, overall, an OK skirt."
3.0,My brother likes the show and the shirt fits him. I think it looks pretty cool.
3.0,"Nice conchos, but thought they were going to be a little larger, like about an inch diameter."
3.0,"Perfectly cute, just way too small.  Probably by 2 sizes in US.  I ordered 5-5 1/2 and more like a 3."
3.0,"Well made, but runs small."
3.0,"These are nice, but I have multiple piercings, so they just don't lay right on my ears.  I thought (hoped) they'd be smaller - they were alittle too big for my taste."
3.0,It was a cheap fabric with a bad smell.  Returned it.
3.0,Doesn't work on my brass carriage clocks but OK on my old child's silver plated Mickey Mouse drinking cup.
3.0,I was disappointed when I receive this cover. The color was more of an ugly yellow and I thought it was going to be green. I ended up returning. It also seemed kind of pricey
3.0,"It was tough getting this on, and the edges dig a little into my legs. But it does a nice job of smoothing everything out. I maybe could've gone up a size, but not sure because sizing was a little confusing. Its definitely better than I thought it would be, and the price was great."
3.0,Bought for wife. Runs small and not very soft but cute shirt. A bit overpriced
3.0,"Lately I’ve decided I want to lay off my jeans and wear more dresses for the spring and summer. I am on a spree buying up lil dresses with pockets from Amazon. I love dresses with pockets, OMG! There are a TON to choose from, but most are variations of each other. This one really stood out and excited me! It’s not only the only dress like it that I’ve seen here on Amazon, it’s also really cute. The floral pattern is beautiful, and the empire waste is traditionally very cute, comfortable, and classic.<br /><br />Unfortunately the empire cut, along with the pockets hitting at my hips, wind up being rather unflattering on me. It’s not slimming, and since I’m about 10 pounds heavier than usual, and 30 pounds heavier than I would prefer, this dress just doesn’t look good on me. (I’m a petite frame, 5’3”, guessing I’m about 135 lbs but I avoid the scale since I used to be dangerously anorexic - 86 pounds at my nearly-hospitalized “worst” - my own skewed perception saw things differently, of course, and to be extremely honest, I’m not entirely over it, mentally. But enough oversharing, eh?) The style accentuates my big booty, and not in a way I think anyone would admire.<br /><br />I’ve legitimately heard, from more than one source, that empire waists are universally flattering, but I’ve equally heard that only slim, statuesque women actually look good in them. I tend to agree with the latter. You could also call this style a “baby doll” dress, but the same rules apply, no matter what you call it. Certain body types run the risk of looking pregnant, especially since this style is so popular in maternity wear, so it’s already associated with being pregnant, whether your tum is an actual baby bump or not. Women generally don’t naturally have flat tummies, not without careful effort. When I hit my 30s, I finally inherited my mom’s body. I thought I didn’t have it; I thought I’d be naturally slim even without the eating disorder. Damn my genes! Now at 36 I carry my weight in my middle and in my butt, with skinny arms and legs! ARGH I WANT TO BE 22 AGAIN!<br /><br />Ok, ok, calming down, back to the dress . . .<br /><br /> It’s very comfortable, at least. I will definitely wear this around the house. Those pockets are extremely handy when you’re doing light housekeeping and just want to move some clutter to wear it belongs, while keeping your hands free to keep working. And wearing dresses around the house makes me feel less frumpy!<br /><br />The material is good quality, not thin or cheap feeling, rather soft and flowy, but it clings weirdly to my curves, despite its free flowing form. The fabric is cool for summer temperatures, but will transition well into autumn. I would recommend washing in cool water and drying on low, because it seems at risk for shrinking.<br /><br />I’m going to keep this dress and try to lose at least 10 lbs. I think it’s a very cute dress and I want to be able to wear it with confidence! It’s nice to see a dress with pockets that isn’t the same swing dress that’s sold under dozens of different brand names. I’d love to see more simple lil dresses with pockets, particularly flattering corset-back dresses and dresses with princess seams, which are very slimming. If you know of any, please link me to them in the comments! I’ll buy every color/pattern available!"
3.0,"Haven't worn it yet.  I bought it because it was cheap and a pretty color.  I will try wearing it with black or brown leggings. Kinda big though.<br />I think heavier women would love this though. It does look comfortable, we shall see."
3.0,"Cute shirt for the price, looks MUCH better on model. I'm 5'4 115 lbs and I got a small and it fits perfectly but since the actual shirt is clingy it does not flatter bellies that have carried babies and are less than perfect. The sheer part is cute but the clingy aspect makes the shirt unflattering overall. Something I didn't consider when I ordered. Will add pic soon."
3.0,There's nothing really wrong with these socks but I'm just not overly impressed and certainly for the price I should have been overly impressed
3.0,Great seller.  Didn't like the look on me.
3.0,"very thin sole, Not up to par with my last pair which lasted 10 years"
3.0,"So this nightgown looks just like the picture, it's cute and lightweight and well made. I was disappointed with the length though. I bought it because in the picture it comes to the model's knee but on me that was not the case. I'm 5'9 and size medium and overall the size fits great it just comes to about 5 inches above my knee. If you're not worried about the length though, then it's a great nightgown."
3.0,The suit was too big for me everywhere but the actual cups. With the suit too large there was noting to hold the cups close to my body so they floated away and the fabric bunched up under the cups ruining the intended effect of the distinctive contrasting seams. The suit material is very stretchy so there isn’t any right support to the tummy area or any part of the suit. I’m 5’ 6” 155 lbs 34DDD
3.0,"I’m 5’10 so this is a little shorter than I would have liked. It fits pretty box-y and large on me. I feel that it makes me look frumpy.<br /><br />I believe on a shorter person, it will look great!"
3.0,"Do not use the shoes on hard wooded floors, These shoes are way too slippery, but overall it’s really cute"
3.0,"This dress appeared very cute and comfortable in the pictures and was very cute in person, but I was disappointed with the material it was made out of. Its made out of really stiff, non-stretchy, and non-breathable fabric that doesn't let you raise your arms above your shoulders. The zipper is really cheap and gets stuck really easily. On top of all of this mess, it's also a bit see-through, so you have to be careful with what bra you're wearing underneath. Its a really light-fitting dress though. It compacts really easily and well, so its good to take on trips where you have limited amounts of space."
3.0,Thank goodness I ordered the longest length because they do shrink about 2 inches. My pants are not dried in the dryer at all.
3.0,The length is to long for am average pair of pants. Very impressed with the company. They were quick to handle my return. The Pants are really nice. Great quality. Would shop with then again.
3.0,"As a skier, I have owned many spyder products with universally good impressions. This looks nice and fits fine. It has nice fleece inside. But, it is not up to typical Spyder quality standards."
3.0,"Waist cinches well with the belt, but the length is SUPER long. I’m 5’1 and about a size 16-18, so this is often a problem for me and I expected it to be somewhat long, however I’m going to have to wear this with very high heels or get it hemmed, and for $20, I don’t know if it’s worth it to get it altered. The material is somewhat stiff, but I don’t mind because it helps it hold its shape well."
3.0,Exactly as pictured cheap but cute
3.0,"Way big to be even remotely realistic for a costume.  That part I suppose is my fault since I didn't note the measurements at purchase.  Also, didn't come with the hole in it.  Just solid, so not really what is pictured.  Disappointed overall."
3.0,The dress was cute but didn't fit my daughters body right.
3.0,Not oversized if you are over 150 lbs
3.0,"The style of this lingerie is just what it looks like in the picture, however the color is not. I ordered green, which in the picture looks like kind of a sage green, but what was in the package is more like a bright aqua blue. It’s not an ugly color but it is not what I thought I was getting and I would not have chosen it. Also, in the the top of this garment gapes in the back. Not sure if this is because I am tall or because my butt sticks out too far or some combination of the two but it looks funny. Front is cute though and it’s a super stretchy material."
3.0,"These masks are too small for my face/head and it would be acceptable except the masks did not come with the thick white straps as pictured, they came with wiry, thin black ones that cut into my ears even at it's loosest. The fabric is soft and nice though."
3.0,one of them is broken.
3.0,Price is right. Middle metal is not Black metal. They put black color and not even finished. You can see unevenly colored and not finished end side. Just worth for price.
3.0,I love how soft these are and the fit. They do run pretty small so I wish I would have sized up.
3.0,"Decent quality, but it feels too delicate too wash properly, and it comes very folded. Better than I was expecting, but still cheaply made"
3.0,Bracelet broke the first time wearing it
3.0,Bigger than it looks. My pendant keeps falling off.
3.0,very thin.
3.0,I love the colors and I love the way it works in the night and during the day. However where the clips it is in my vision line and I’m not able to wear them it makes me crosseyed
3.0,"I liked the braclet alot just the clasp doesn't work.  Half the time I wear it I find it on the ground, so far I haven't lost it."
3.0,"I really like the size and fit of these comfortable glasses.  However, there is too much glare and I can see my eyes' reflection on the lenses."
3.0,It is not silver looking way darker looking.I would not have bought if i knew it looked like this dark.
3.0,Material was stiffer than other similar dresses I have bought will soak in fabric softener
3.0,Colors were off more like yellow than gold...
3.0,I thought it was a pair and that it was not a stud.
3.0,"Looks great, but bottom strap on loop broke off without any effort or tight tug. I would like a replacement as it fits nice on my wrist and looks very clean."
3.0,I am 5'2 and about 100 lbs. I normally wear a 32D but I mistakenly ordered a 32C so it didn't fit. If I had gotten the 32D it probably would've fit.
3.0,The color is cute and fit is good but the packaging is horrible which puts a permanent crease in the top of the shoe
3.0,They were nice and bright and what I expected in that regard but broke and fell apart easy. The kids did seem to love them though
3.0,fits strange...
3.0,Didn't like the strap
3.0,"The visibility is nice. However, the lens may fall off place easily. They are not right enough. Seem cheap."
3.0,link keeps sliding out of watch.
3.0,"Overall it’s been great-fits my 4.5 yo perfectly, it’s nice and comfortable.  My only issue with it is every pair looked unfinished at the crotch area.  I had to manually fold back the extra thread over the white (elastic?) and hand sew it down bc I’m not sure if I can cut it off without unraveling it.  It’s a minor issue that i haven’t had with other Hane’s underwear before."
3.0,Its nice but thinner than u think
3.0,not very flattering in the hip area
3.0,"my 5yr old is tall so the outfit isn't  long enough, but its still cute..."
3.0,Its fragile
3.0,"These bands are marketed as men's bands. The colors look to be men's colors, but the bands are far too narrow to be for men. They are very feminine looking.<br />If you're a femme man, you'll probably like this a lot. Otherwise, you'll be very disappointed."
3.0,Fall down
3.0,The gloves kept my hands warm in the chilly San Francisco air but were not able to work on my phone. I had to keep taking them off to take photos.
3.0,"My daughter loved this bracelet as a gift for her 10th birthday; however, the snake chain pulls her arm hair and she is not a hairy person! Got a replacement sterling snake chain for her and transferred the beads over which solved the problem."
3.0,Ordered this for my wife. It fit her perfectly but the material was too thin to her dislike.
3.0,"They are tough, but look delicate. Just what I was looking for! However, if you’re over 5’4”, order the next larger size. All their stretch is horizontal, not much vertical."
3.0,They are a little long for my wife.
3.0,"I’m an XL. This Tee Shirt fits like a medium. I would suggest buying a size larger than you normally wear. The quality seems good, but the sleeves ride up a little higher than I expected."
3.0,Pads not removable
3.0,It looks nice and everything but for me that I wear sized medium I bought size small and it is huge on me. Like I am wearing my husband’s shirt !
3.0,Good quality.  Tried it on and was too snug.  Returned item.
3.0,My mom said they were on heavier side and not which she’s used to.  She said they were really pretty though.
3.0,"Very nice for my grands, but definitely too long for them to play in."
3.0,"I really wanted to like these masks, but they’re simply too big for my 6 and 8 year olds. They’re constantly slipping down, which leads to a lot of face touching while out and about. I think they would be really great for ages 10 and up. The quality is good and we really like the colors - just too big for our kiddos."
3.0,"Positives:<br />My mom’s zodiac is a snake and so this captured my attention. I also love moonstones (even though this is synthetic). I find them mystical and luminous like a tiny crystal ball or snow globe. It came with silicone bullets in addition to the original sterling silver (butterfly) pushbacks. How thoughtful!  The earrings come in a gray velour pouch with a cleaning cloth. This makes it giftable. I usually prefer earrings inside a box though to protect the posts.<br /><br />Potential Negatives/Other Thoughts:<br />The post isn’t centered in the back so you have to rotate it. That was disappointing. This is a good size for my petite ears and head but it’s a little small for my mother. I would have preferred if the snake was yellow gold since that matches our skin tone better. The moonstone barely has a blue hue. I don’t like how the earrings' push-backs are smaller than the average. A little tricky to put on.<br /><br />Overall, I think it looks better online than in person. It’s still quite nice though. I think what bothers me the most is that the posts aren’t centered. I have a few pieces of jewelry from this brand Milacolato. While this isn’t a favorite of mine, it’s certainly not the worst of them.

3.0,"This little &#34;purse&#34; is made of nice, soft leather, it has a fair built-in wallet, however the main compartment is much smaller than I thought it would be. Unable to carry as much as I did in my other small purse. The outside zippered compartment is fairly useless. If you put hardly anything in the main compartment, it tightens the outside zipper pocket to the point that you can't hardly get anything into it. I have to put my small size cell phone in the wallet side. If I had to do it over, I would not purchase this item. I will have to use it basically as a wallet and place it inside a larger bag.  disappointed to say the least."
3.0,I have ordered these earrings before but just one pair and they were perfect. This time some of them were difficult to open and close and one of them kept on opening till it was finally lost forever. They appear to be kind of hit or miss.
3.0,The silver is too bright.  Makes the glasses look very cheap.
3.0,The ring part broke right when I gave this to my lady. That's the only downfall with this product.
3.0,SENT TO MY NEPHEW...HE LIKES
3.0,Well...I bought the XL size . I am 5'8 and 170 they went on but they are skin tight. They fit in the waist but the zipper is weak sauce and won't stay up...at all....even when I'm not wearing them. I'm going to return them. Too bad because they were cute and perfect length
3.0,"I wear a size 4 normally and a small or medium top. I ordered a sz large and it fits but i kinda wish I went XL for more shoulder room and sleeve length tbh. The fluffy portion of the coat is soft and cute, but I'm scared to ever wash it honestly bc I'm not sure this material will make it out ok. Def wouldn't dry. The lining is sad. Like really looks like the fake satin lining in a kids junk dollar store dress up purse. I wish it wasnt lined this way. I really want to like this jacket but I'm kinda saddened overall knowing its not going to hold up, the cheap clasp fell off instantly and the lining really upsets me."
3.0,looks kinda fake... but still cute tho!
3.0,"This is NOT the colors of the item I ordered. Online it looked more muted and rustic. But in person it is NEON. My camera can’t even capture it. I feel like it’s way more youthful than what I was looking for. Blue, brown, canary yellow and neon orange. Very disappointed cause it’s too young for me lol. I’m embarrassed to wear it in public. That being said it fits true to size. I’m 5.5 1/2 and 142. The shorts are a dream but zero tummy support. The top is weird. Cups are stiff and misshaped. You can adjust the straps. And that piece of fabric under the boobs is sewn wrinkled. Also you can definitely see underboob. I’d wear it around my husband or Kids but not to the beach. Does flatter my figure overall."
3.0,I had to attach the ears to a headband to work them. That is unless I wanted to lose a bunch of hair every time.
3.0,"Really cute, thin. A bit smaller than expected"
3.0,Too close to face
3.0,This bracelet is a lot smaller then pictured. It's more appropriate for a child. I was shopping for my 24 year old grandson.
3.0,"I wear a 2x in ""normal"" American sizes, but this 2x runs more like a 14-16. The size chart in the description is no help at all. The quality and density of fabric seems good"
3.0,Thin tee shirt dress but you can not see through it.
3.0,Hubby loves it<br />Could use some extra time on doing strings are hanging out everywhere words crushed together
3.0,Size down. Very deep v. Looks like a maternity dress.
3.0,Pants fit great and squat proof. The problem that I have with them is the waist of the pants falls down if you’re running or any high intensity movements. The pants are great for walking and low intensity workouts but I have to keep pulling them up 1/2 block into my run and every 10 steps after that...very frustrating. They are great for my low intensity workout days or just going around town but not running.
3.0,It’s rubbery and that’s not expressed.
3.0,I am a size 12 so that's what I ordered. The chest area is too big. I sewed it and it helped. The straps are a little uncomfortable around the armpit area. Very cute other than those things.
3.0,Quality wasn't too great.  The hook on the chain broke as soon as my son tried attaching it to his belt loop. The color was nice though
3.0,Cute necklace but tangles so easily
3.0,The color of my keychain was cream and grey instead of black and white.
3.0,"Las mangas están un poco largas, y no es tela de camisa casual es más gruesa"
3.0,"Its very pretty.  I usually wear between a 16 and 18 US womens size.  I knew this was 'asian' sizing, so I ordered 4XL hoping it would fit/ maybe be a bit bigger.  As I put it on, I could hear threads snapping as it was being stretched.  I am a curvy girl, and I wasn't even trying to get the top part over the 'bigger' half of me.  It was small in the torso, which made the straps dig into my shoulders.  There was also a lot of fabric for the straps, and it was awkward when all stretched out (looked like cap sleeves) but painful when all bunched together.  The nipple pads were awkwardly placed and really thick, and I had to remove them all together.  The under the skirt material is made out of this weird mesh fabric, and it is almost like a boy short cut (not flattering on a thick thighed girl) but because the torso is short, I was given a camel toe that I could do nothing about.  Normally, this wouldn't be so bad because the skirt was covering the front. WELL due to my curvy backside it looked like I was wearing basically a cheeky underwear bottom and no matter how many times I de-wedged myself, because of the camel toe up front, a wedgie was always in the back.  I am hoping to loose some weight, so this suite will fit because it is cute.  But I am regretting buying suites from online stores.<br />*Disclaimer<br />I have received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All of the opinions expressed within this review are 100% my own and are based on my own experiences with this product and I was not influenced in any other way."
3.0,Quite expensive for what this product is.  I do understand that power rangers products are more expensive than they should be.  My son was disappointed.
3.0,These hats are pretty good. They look good and overall great buy for the money. Reason for 3 stars is that after they got wet a few times at the beach they lost their shape so now they hang on the sides instead of having the nice rim. So I would say they are one summer use. But they were a good deal when I bought them so I guess okay to justify the one time use.
3.0,I love how this fits but it’s a bit see threw
3.0,"Received it much sooner than scheduled. The material is thinner than expected and it runs small. I am a L and ordered XL, it fits me tightly. No room for a sweater and since the material is thin I can only wear it in spring/fall seasons instead of winter like I had planned. Pleased with the quality, zipper works smoothly and the color is good. I like the style so I will keep it. I'd recommend to order 2 sizes up, I will do so if I order it again."
3.0,These socks are adorable but they fall down constantly so unfortunately I wouldn’t buy them again.
3.0,I bought a large after reading the reviews. I'm a D cup and could have gotten away with a medium. Was afraid it would run small but a large is a little too spacey.
3.0,quality is not great.
3.0,This was my first time wearing shape wear and I didn't like it. It doesn't hold well and the thing part cut me in the back. I'm not a huge woman but I am bottom heavy.
3.0,"Took forever to arrive. Cute shirt. Not what I expected. Its not like the picture AT ALL. Even the description is misleading, it isnt a v neck. I guess I should have known the description wasnt accurate since its a tank top and a v neck tee all in one. lol.  It's not even the type of shirt that would fit like the picture suggests. Its more like the pic I attached (Not the actual shirt but very similar fit). I still like it but only because it's see through. I can see my fingers!! I wasn't expecting that but I'll take it."
3.0,I wanted to like this. But the fabric was a little to thin and silky for me. I feel like the cross design sits oddly high.
3.0,"This dress is soft and beautiful, I love the way it feels. I was a bit disappointed though because mine came with a hole in the waist and the sewing job isn't the best.  I'm not sure whether to ask for a refund or fix it myself because it really is beautiful."
3.0,"A good hybrid case that works well, but the graphics on the case has mostly worn away leaving white areas showing. Good protection - poor paint job."
3.0,"One of the nose pieces was missing upon arrival. Other than that, they are what I expected for the low cost."
3.0,"The hat is really cute, but find that it runs kind of small. Doesn’t fit adult male head very well."
3.0,"I gave it a 3 star . I loved it, however the hassles snag one by one and totally shred after one use. I ended up tying knots in the group of hassles so it wouldn't happen. But this item won't last real long."
3.0,"I currently wear a 38DD and ordered the largest size.  The bust is a bit too tight, give the ""uni-boob"" impression.  Would say otherwise the quality and material was great."
3.0,It ran small.
3.0,"I think it could be really cute-  it has possibilities!  But mine didn’t come with the string to tighten the corset part-  as is, it looks kind of shapeless and sloppy.  I’ll update my review if I find a string to match."
3.0,Very pretty but I couldn't get the links.out to big it went back!
3.0,Size is not right.
3.0,I know it very well says cotton headband but $18 for this regular bandana...not worth the money. Youre just paying extra for the nike logo. Overall its just an ordinary bandana with a swoosh
3.0,The dress is an ok fit. I wish the material was of more quality. The stitching could be of a little more quality. But it was a good price for the value.
3.0,"The strap itself is nice, but it's too short, especially for a 26 mm strap. I can barely buckle the first hole. I think for most watchbands you want to be able to reach at least the third hole. I recently purchased two other watchbands and they were long enough."
3.0,Cute pattern of Disney villains
3.0,It is nice color but it is sheer and it has a weird seam around middle of shirt with electric in it.
3.0,"material is light, airy, feels great, but the lighter colors are really see-through. Not a problem if you like your thighs though. I've been using them to go about my day in the house and garden; helps keep the sun off and keep a bit cooler"
3.0,It's made from the cheapest towel the could find.
3.0,It's alright. Looks prettier on the pic. I guess it can be dress up with a nice sweater. Not what I expected.
3.0,"Bought these for my grand daughters Tea Party Box.  They love them. But the elastic neck straps to hold them on are too short and pull through the brim.  Not a big deal, I will probably just replace them with other elastic or ribbon."
3.0,I liked this dress but it was pretty long. I am 5'3 1/2 and this was very long on me. It was even a little long for 3 inch heels. I had to return. Otherwise it would have been cute.
3.0,"Nice but could be a bit longer and bigger. Once washed, they seem to have shrunk quite a bit but I like them."
3.0,The material is nice and soft. It drapes your body nicely and flows. Unfortunately the lining on the inside makes the shirt uncomfortable to wear. Otherwise it could be a top contender in my closet.
3.0,It was ok.. would have been nice in a box and pinned to something.
3.0,This mask looks amazing it is super cool and realistic. The only downside is the fact that it is so heavy. This mask is at least 2 pounds and all of the weight goes on your nose. Over all very uncomfortable but looks nice
3.0,Super comfy but material is really shiny. It feels like a mini moo moo . Will be a home cover up not a vacation dress
3.0,Does not pull well.
3.0,"The top is great and fits pretty well. However, the shorts are a little tight and small. I am 5'2 and top length is not an issue."
3.0,"I took a shot with this, assuming it would be too small, and I was right. It's not as stretchy as it seems but it does still go on. I'm 36C and to be comfortable I'd have to wear a sports bra with this, a normal bra would be too obvious because this is very tight. I normally wear a L-XL in shirts. Overall, I'm not very surprised, and not upset about it."
3.0,"I didn't hate them. But wasn't in love with them. Cute, I should have looked better at the sizing. But a ball went missing after a few days so I had to go back to my regular ones since these are a different size."
3.0,"These work ok, but they seem very big. I had to leave off the captive bead and overlap to ends to avoid looking like a bull with a giant (and misplaced) hoop. But it's cute with that modification. Or if your piercing is higher on your nostril. Or if you're an actual bull. (How'd you learn to read!?)"
3.0,Wore it one time and some of the elastic broke. Disappointed as it is not very durable.
3.0,Run big!! I listened to the reviews and went up a size and could have stuck my 8 year old in there with me. Band goes to the top of ribs.
3.0,"Great size, but busted seams after 4 months of use when traveling 1-2 times/month"
3.0,Shrunk in length once washed and dried
3.0,"I'm 5'1"" and 127 lbs. The pants go to the floor. The inseam I like is usually 30 or 31 inches. They are very wide. Yes I knew they were wide leg but because I am short they made me look like I weigh 200 lbs. Maybe for a tall thin they would look ok. For me, sending them back."
3.0,"Im short but the dress isnt that long, somewhat small."
3.0,Not very long lasting.
3.0,"Cute, beautiful girls shoe.  However, during the very first time my daughter wore these shoes three jewels came right off.  Thinking about returning these because now they are ruined.  They should really have been glued better."
3.0,stinky and very big
3.0,"D-rings are find, fasteners are total garbage.  If you buy them plan on finding a more robust way to fasten them to your boots."
3.0,Pretty much see through
3.0,These glasses are over the top large
3.0,really thick not made of leather made from some sort of plastic.
3.0,"The product is ok. The quality is not exceptional but for the price, it is a good deal. It fit in my mouth perfectly."
3.0,&#34;It's suitable for the waist size below 37inch. Total Belt Length: approx 115cm(45.3 Inch)(Include buckle)&#34;  according to my tape measure it's 48 inches  (including buckle and no stretch) ... seems to be well made ... i do like pants that have 4 way stretch but i'm sure about a stretch belt. seems to me that with a stretch belt all the pressure from bending/moving etc is now on the pants waist button/snap ... i have a pair of pants that the snap pops (no belt) when i bend down.. a regular belt will prevent it ..however the stretch belt just stretches and the snap pops open ...<br />i normally wear 36&#34; pants ... i found this belt too long (snug fit ) - way too much belt hanging out the 1st belt loop on adidas/underA/docker pants
3.0,"Love the style and material. The size isn’t correct, it doesn’t fit so I gave it to my daughter."
3.0,"Love the vibrant colors<br />However, the material is thin and quality is questionable"
3.0,little holes in first wash
3.0,"It was a beautiful wallet but the problem is the card holders. Very stiff and the opening is in an awkward position, putting in your card in the slots is scary I feel like its going to rip when placing my card in. The looks and all is very nice and it comes with a box."
3.0,It's bulky.
3.0,"I am a very typically an XL but sometimes a Large.  I ordered an XL and this fits me more like a M/L.  It looks like it is supposed to, but size up at least once."
3.0,"I should have gotten white since the dark blue/navy tends to absorb more heat from the sun than white.  Also when the hat was shipped (i.e., stuffed) in an envelope, it developed a semi-permanent crease in the rim/bill that was difficult to iron out.  Otherwise, it's ok."
3.0,the back fit was way bigger than the front
3.0,"I ordered an XL and it turned out to be a bit too large at the top but a little tight in the hips. (I'm 40D/37/45) I had to return it. The fabric was a good quality, the color was as pictured but just didn't fit my body type."
3.0,Love the dress! It’s so cute but unfortunately you can see right through the dress. Also the top part fits a little tight if you have large breast be careful!
3.0,"Im a size 12 pants, 36D bust; i ordered the 2XL and my chest feels TRAPPED! Its also very see through in the back. You would have to layer with nude camisole."
3.0,"I Like the color and style, however it’s loose and very long."
3.0,I love this shirt just wish it fit better/larger... I was hoping to wear it as a comfortable fitting pajama shirt but it's too small...
3.0,"Overall I liked this dress and received compliments. I’m 5’7, 124lbs so I ordered an xs which fit my torso well however the skirt was just a bit short and the cut outs rose pretty high on my leg. I’ll wear again but will be cautious that no one sees too much!"
3.0,The shirt is really cute. The material is thin and not as long or fitted as in the photo. It fits but it’s not tunic style like I wanted. It’s kind of that mildly itchy thin fabric.  I’ll still wear it... after I repair the hole in the back. They missed a spot sewing it.
3.0,Very pretty and fun wallets.  I bought a bunch to give as Christmas gifts this year.
3.0,fits small compared to other brands of the same size!
3.0,I got this for my great niece.  She wore it for about 2 hours before a dolphin came off.  It was not very expensive so I wasn't surprised.
3.0,Cute design but he chain kinks VERY easily and gets twisted constantly which is super annoying. I will likely go back to wearing my rubber band even at work and wear this chain only for dressier evening.
3.0,"IT said from 6 months, but it a bit too big for my baby. Very cute, but big. And the material is not as soft as I would have liked it to be.<br /><br />But over all, if the size was right, I would recommend it."
3.0,Snowflake too big. One of the stones fell out when I opened the pkg. They look cheap.
3.0,large and short little bit
3.0,"The dress was delivered in perfect timing but once I tried it on, it didnt really fit right.  I am normally a 18/20 for most dresses, I went up a size to make sure it would be too fitting in the stomach area. The top fit my 46ddd breast fine but the arm area was HUGE. You would be able to see right down the inside of the dress. Also the straps on the arm did NOT stay put, they middle one actually just flopped down to my elbow... I will return."
3.0,I am 53 and about 155 pounds. I bought a large and the bottoms fit perfect but the top seemed like it was a sizes smaller. I’m a 36B so it’s not like I have a huge top half.  I definitely cannot wear this without things popping out.
3.0,"I got tons of compliments on these and they feel very nice<br />BUT they are two sizes off<br />I ordered a large, when I normally order a medium...and they were still snug in my thighs<br />so truthfully I should have ordered a large (two sizes bigger than I normally wear)<br />FYI THESE RUN VERY SMALLLLLL!"
3.0,Love for the gym. Stays in place
3.0,"Purchased this to wear to work, I am a middle school art teacher. I love Klimt, however I could not see the nude figures on the shirt when I ordered it. I cannot wear this to school, very sad."
3.0,See through top with no liner. Fits extremely small. Should order up 1-2 sizes depending on how tight/loose you like your clothes to fit.  I wear a 4/6 with bust size 34/36.
3.0,"The necklace is a little cheap and gaudy looking.  I am not saying it wasn't as described by the seller, it just isn't what I thought it would be."
3.0,"The plastic is soft and it's hard to see properly when you walk, especially after you've washed it / wiped it and it has some creases. And the hat itself is not that big. I wouldn't buy it again and instead am wearing a face shield that's hard plastic and not obstructing my vision."
3.0,Not bad but Cheap quality
3.0,"POLYESTER top MADE IN CHINA. The fabric is VERY thin. Dry cleaning is recommended. (But, I wash it on the delicate cycle of my washer.)"
3.0,Great wallet lots of pockets little big but all around good wallet
3.0,"..I received the pants yesterday and immediately tried them on. I brought them for around the house and for running out real quick..I was expecting them to be a little thicker like normal yoga pants are but they are thin. Honestly they are really thin that you can see thru the top white part.  I did buy them a size bigger because I wasnt sure how they would fit and I didnt want them skin tight. Also, the fabric isnt as soft as I thought and read either.. I have very soft skin and these dont have that silky feeling I was hoping for..I think they are great for spring and summer weather. Definitely not fall or winter. And make sure to wear a longer shirt to cover the white part."
3.0,"These are just ok, but definitely smaller than expected. If you are in between sizes, size up."
3.0,"This shirt is very cute, however with that being said it runs rather large. It fits odd as well so even though it is cute it still spends alot of time in the back of my closet."
3.0,"The mask is adorable and I really want to wear it, but the fabric is not very comfortable and quite scratchy.  Maybe washing it will fix that, but not sure.  Also, I have literally dozens of reusable masks in all kinds of designs, but this one just doesn’t sit very well.  I think it would be better if it had a nose bridge to keep it snug against your nose and off your eyes.  If I wear the mask to where it covers my nose, it gets into my eyes.  If I try ank keep it under my eyes, it doesn’t cover my nose enough.  It’s just a strange fit."
3.0,I'm 5'9 180lbs and ordered a large. I'm returning and reordering a XXL because this is like a small in the US
3.0,The perfect dress but it fades in color each time you wash it. I wish it didn't fade. Fits true to size but the most perfect moment was the first time I wore it. After that it doesn't hold the same wow factor!
3.0,"This cap isn't going to win any style awards and it fits a little loose and sloppy, but it does the job. I take walks in cold weather, and this is more comfortable than earmuffs to keep my ears warm."
3.0,My daughter wanted it. A waste of money.
3.0,Too small. Boobs want to come out the top.
3.0,"The bra was too small and I had to return it.<br />I chose another bra in exchange and should receive it to,orrow."
3.0,"This product is not true to size,  runs smaller,  the plus size I bought would fit an xl girl"
3.0,"Although I kept these, I have not worn them. The quality is not so good. They weigh more than the band comfortably supports. They want to keep sliding down."
3.0,Fit in the waist but too length was too long
3.0,"This was awful for me. But I believe it could be great for some people. The top was just a piece of fabric, so you have to wrap it and tie it to wear it. This didn't go well for me. I don't think it was because the size of my breast, 36DD, I think I may have been too small for it in general. This seems like it would be better for plus size girls. I really think it work well had I been a little thicker."
3.0,"This came relatively quickly, and it is actually two hats in a single package. The wide brim fedora (which is the hat I was looking for) seems well made and the wool is nice and thick, but since it was CRAMMED into a shipping box that was way too small, the brim is out of shape and the hat doesn't lay how it should."
3.0,"It's a nice solid piece. I love the quality. It is however a wee bit short and hard to close by yourself, but once you get the hang of it, it's simple."
3.0,The tint is fine. Light weight glasses- however these are NOT polarized glasses.
3.0,Used for part of a detective costume for kid. Worked well. Hat is nice & sturdy. Had to glue the band some since it kept flipping up.
3.0,Happy. Black coating wears off with continuous wear.
3.0,I bought a  2x no where near what a size 2x would be couldn’t even get it over my head
3.0,it was shorter than expected
3.0,The reflective surface doesn’t last.  Already had to throw them away.
3.0,Won't sit straight and if I move it I'm afraid it will break but it's cute
3.0,Didn’t like quality of the shirt collar culled up
3.0,"I ordered 3 items 2 were perfect, unfortunately the other was a basic purple long sleeve, but ordered a two tone black and grey.<br /><br />I went through the refund process, only to find out I still had to pay $24 mailing costs.<br /><br />Not happy this happened, but can say the quality was good."
3.0,"They're cute, but the pull straps came off within the first week of using them."
3.0,"Tried them on but they are just too narrow for my feet, shame :(<br />The shoes looks great and well built..."
3.0,Its a very cute shirt however it is hard for the shirt to stay on and cover the chest area. I would suggest pasties.
3.0,"Nice, thick, and cozy. Great color, I got the apricot color in size xl. True to size. The reason for the three-star rating is it came with a snag on the sleeve and was package poorly."
3.0,It was larger than I thought it would be
3.0,"Lovely BUT narrow and stiff, making it too hard to get things in and out.  Had to return because it was unusable for me.  Pity!"
3.0,Very Very Large......gave it away
3.0,"While the hot is adjustable, it is not long enough on the sides so there is a gap between my hat and ears."
3.0,Wrong color. Big
3.0,Looks nice but the palm tree broke off after 3 weeks.
3.0,"It's very comfortable but tons of light still comes through the bottom part!! Not from the actual material, but the bottom edge of mask doesn't lay flush against the face therefore light comes through. Maybe it fits differently depending on facial structure."
3.0,This is not a heavy tactical belt. The material is about the same as a standard nylon belt.  The buckle seems heavy-duty and sturdy.
3.0,"There is nothing wrong with card holders. They arrived in a timely fashion. Personally, I would prefer that the card holders opened on the side as it makes it easier to pull out a card."
3.0,Too big for my tiny toes-pretty common for me. Simple and thin.
3.0,Fabric isn't what I expected.  Fits large
3.0,"The color is exactly as pictured. It fits fine and I like the length. I would have given it a 5 star except the crocheted band at the bottom is not as full as the fabric. Hard to explain this, but its like a towel where the decorative band shrunk."
3.0,Runs very large. Order two sizes smaller than you normally would. Fabric is comfortable and the colors are true to description.
3.0,The black one was my best purchase. The others were a bit off as far as structure. I have 4 and returned 2.
3.0,"So I ordered this about 5weeks ago for the 38mm.  I must say immediately noticed the feel of the straps.  Very light, cheap not leathery.  But it was still cute and hey it was less than 20$ Another thing I didn’t like was the color transfer 😩😩😖<br />I received a lot of compliments on the designs though.  Lastly,  after about 5-51/2 week the piece  that slides on the watch broke.  I didn’t wear the watch everyday and I haven’t changed it out until today...hence the review"
3.0,White was a little off white but it worked fine
3.0,These sunglasses were a little larger framed than I was expecting them to be and don't seem to fit my face quite right. I do wear them regardless though because the lens are dark and do an excellent job blocking out the sun. No squinting in the car at all! I suggest this product for anyone who wants a good pair of sunglasses at a very decent price.
3.0,"This is nice but I had to return because it does not fit a two wheel suitcase. Size was correct, however design is not exactly appropriate for all kinds of luggage. Fitted baggy and not particularly covering the corners (which is the most damaged area.. usually) . Guess nobody has two wheel suitcases anymore."
3.0,Fit is very small.  Material has no stretch
3.0,It bubbles up on the back of your weist
3.0,"It’s pretty, but strap is backwards, which makes it difficult to put on and take off"
3.0,To Big
3.0,pajamas are cute but they didn't come with tags. and it appears there are two dark spots/stains on the pants...most definitely cannot be new.
3.0,"Daughter was very sad they didn't fit, but it cost more to send them back than it did to loose money on them."
3.0,I'm 5'11. It comes down to my mid calf. Neck line is a LOT lower than appears on model. Other than that its a light breathable material. Happy with it despite the misleading photo on the model.
3.0,"Warm and actually comfy, but not as long as I hoped ( I am almost 6 feet and pretty slim ). These will not stay up looking on their own."
3.0,I love that I was able to find bibs specific to grandpas but for the price I think they should have been lined. Our lil guy drools right through the bib. Shipping was fast though...
3.0,It is not as smelly and soft as the SPONGELLÉ market for women.
3.0,Toys for Tots gift.
3.0,"This was perfect for my seven year old to give her grandma for her birthday. My daughter loves it and her grandma wears it whenever they are together. My daughter had it around her neck and gave my mom the grandmother one as a gift. When my mom opened it, my daughter took hers out from hiding under her shirt. My mom had happy tears.<br />The quality isn’t anything great but it was good for what we were lookin for. I didn’t want anything crazy expensive for my seven year old. They are happy so I’m happy"
3.0,The zipper is super uncomfortable
3.0,"The handbag looks nice, but once it catches a stain, it'll be difficult, if not impossible, to remove. I would not carry it to the ladies' room, in case I cannot find a dry spot to place ths handbag while washing my hands."
3.0,"Fits fine but, not very good quality."
3.0,Looked great but irritated my ears when kept in for a couple days. Great for wearing during the day though. I just recommend taking them out after each day.
3.0,"These are functional enough, but a bit hard and so slightly uncomfortable to walk around in.  Good enough for my needs of wearing while I take out the trash, but I wouldn't be so sure about wearing long term."
3.0,This tank top runs really big.  I am a DD and it is even to big for me.
3.0,You have to steam iron it
3.0,"These are quite nice but half of them I had to replace the clasp , which is a bummer."
3.0,The shirt was a little short to begin with and seemed like it shrunk a bit after I washed it. The pants fit perfect but I wouldn’t buy again.
3.0,Lunch box doesn’t stay on backpack well.
3.0,We bought these for Florida. Super cute suits just not great quality. The bottoms started to pebble after one use especially if you sat on the side of the pool. They were fun to have tho and for the price you pay I would get them again
3.0,I couldn't tell if it was perfume or something else fragrant. The tag was on. I washed it. Twice. QA people...goes a long way. Other than. That it's nice.
3.0,It looks nicer in the picture.Material was very cheap. We bought the matching suit for our daughter as well and the back could not be closed. It was t made correctly. But the price was really cheap so we got what we paid for.
3.0,"My husband loves it but is slightly disappointed. The latch broke a few weeks later. For the amount I paid, it shouldn't but I expected it to happen sometime sooner or later from reading the reviews but I wanted to buy anyway because it is an easy fix. But still though."
3.0,Wish it was a little larger fingers swell in summer lovely jewelry
3.0,"These pajamas look okay at first, but I found poor finishing on the seams and lots of loose threads.  I returned them, didn't think they'd hold up very well.  Okay if you need something inexpensive to last less than a year."
3.0,"They normally say when you're buying Chinese, Korean brands to go a size up and that's what I did. Well it is too large. I tried it on once, haven't worn it. The colour is more off white"
3.0,I don’t normally leave reviews but after reading the comments I felt compelled.<br />I returned my boots because they were too small. I ordered a size 12 and it looked like it was a size 10. Not even close to a normal sized US 12 shoe.<br />On the positive side the boots did seem like they had a decent quality. I hope this helps
3.0,"I Loved this shirt! But it was extremely tight around the arms and cut my chest off weird, almost like the top part of the shirt was sewn as a small but the bottom flared out perfectly for me which is hard to come by.  Ended up returning."
3.0,"very plain. without shape. Not what I expected at all, is wide and fits baggy."
3.0,"Se ve muy sencillo, lo compré para regalo y no me satisfizo, no lo recomiendo es sumamente pequeño. No le doy menos estrellas por consideración a la empresa que da muy buen servicio."
3.0,"Very poor packaging, it all came in badly printed cardboard sealed with glitter  tape. The gold is a bit bright or me but it didn’t react with soapy water so that’s good."
3.0,"This sweater is beautiful, wears great and washes well. Unfortunately, it’s prone to snags."
3.0,"...but still choker length on the shortest strands. The clasp is oversized and a little bit cheap, so I will be restringing this to make it longer and have the clasp be more flattering/ hang more smoothly."
3.0,It's cute as expected
3.0,Item looks to be well made however rims are to large for a small face
3.0,The size chart is misleading. I'm a female who ordered a mans medium and it fit quite snug when the size chart showed it should've fit atleast one size bigger than my actual size.. I'll be giving to my 28 year old niece who's a size 4.
3.0,"great glasses for the price, but they were a little smaller than I expected so I gave them to my sister and my first cousin. they love them so much they alternate turns with the blue pair. I'd recommend these to anybody who like aviator glasses except for big headed people like myself."
3.0,This is cute i wish i had ordered a different color than the one shown but they look great and accent my wifes back side very well
3.0,Fast shipping..item smaller than expected especially in the arm widths and i got a size up but it'll work for now. In process of losing weight. Other than love the feel!
3.0,it hurts I know sometimes after wearing bras for a couple of days they will break in and get comfortable but this one i haven't been able to wear for more then an hour.
3.0,"baggy, no shape, sleeves much too long.<br />i ordered Medium (usually order 8-9)<br />based on your size chart but the tag on this garment was M 10-12!<br />I love lands End and found this very disappointing"
3.0,The size chart indicated a size XL.  It's huge.
3.0,leather is good quality but the metal used for the chain is low quality. broke when pulled with little force
3.0,Update:  i can't wear this for very long.  The inside is wayyyy to scratchy.  Also the seams on the middle of the bra really restrict what you can wear out with.  Not my favorite.<br /><br />Was pleasantly surprised by this workout bra/actual bra. I think it's versatile enough to wear either way. I am a 36C the medium is true to size. I feel like it holds everything in place. It also feels very secure. The only thing to pay attention to is the seam goes across the middle of the cup you might not want to wear it with tight clothing.<br /> Other than that it works well for my purposes!
3.0,Earrings are cute but the pair I was looking forward to most is tarnished. Another pair is also a little lopsided. I would say 4/6 pairs are great. But definitely lacking in quality control.
3.0,"Nice fabric and colors. I had to return just because it was too large for me, the fitting wasn't like in the pictures."
3.0,"Delivered fast and on time. Slide is really nice, looks good. Size runs small. Seemed to run 1 1/2 or so size smaller. Luckily someone else in our house could wear them."
3.0,"Nice sweaters I was supposed to get these two sweaters in medium but I received two smalls a white one and a black one, Colors were right but sizes weren’t"
3.0,I ordered up but it was still to small. I had to return.
3.0,These shirts r made men's size so I gotta send my back or else wear it for night shirt of which I don't want to
3.0,"Ordered my usual size pant and they were too small. The pant was nice, just not the right size. if you order these, go up a size, or be prepared to send them back."
3.0,Liked the fit but don’t like the faded look
3.0,"I like how many sizes come in the pack. Good quality and value. Irritated my ears after a few days, though."
3.0,LE QUEDO MUY BIEN A MI BEBE Y SE VE MUY BONITO
3.0,I love compression socks but these aren’t comfortable as others and I have had two hang nails since using these and I never get hang nails. Also at the end of the day my legs itch and have indentions from the socks. They are the right length love the color just a bit on the uncomfortable side for me personally
3.0,"Was larger than expected and the buckle is heavy, so we sent it back."
3.0,Fits a little small and the material is thin so you can see through it.
3.0,They don't look bad but for sure they are going to shrink and fade fast. They took over 3 weeks to arrive but for the price I guess you get what you pay for and these are not much.
3.0,Shirt wasn't as big as I expected and shorts were huge!
3.0,"Vision through these is great -- better than my prescription glasses.  But I have a couple concerns; they cling tightly on the side of the head, this is good to keep them from falling off but extended pressure causes me to get head aches.  The other concern is fogging up; due to their close fit and little ventilation the always fog up on me so I have to wear them pulled out a quarter of an inch from my face to allow air behind them.  I am looking for a similar pair that does not have these two problems...."
3.0,"The shoe is easy for me to put in my son, and easy for him to take off by himself. My son loves water so these shoes get wet daily. They dry out pretty fast. I set them in the sun and they are dry within an hour. The problem is the velcro isn’t great. It always comes apart."
3.0,I wear between a medium and large. I purchased this dress in medium and it was over the top flowy. I had expected it to be slightly fitting at the bust and loosely flowy throughout - not the case.
3.0,very skimpy bottoms
3.0,My granddaughter LOVES them.  My daughter says they look ridiculous on her and she is afraid she won't be able to keep her from wearing them everywhere! heehee  Perfect gift from grandparents.
3.0,"I just received this, no idea if it will hold up. But it's shorter than advertised. My 38 was a full 3"" shorter than my Levi's 38"" belt, so I went up two sizes and will try again."
3.0,"If you are a woman that needs a lot of support in a sports bra, this is not for you."
3.0,We bought these for a party - big hit! They look fantastic *but* didn't fit about half the guys faces...too small!
3.0,"Perfect size for a woman, but it says “adult” costume, and an XL looks like a men’s small on my boyfriend. Way too tiny for broad shoulders!! Wish it specified that it’s only womens. Otherwise an okay last minute costume"
3.0,Quality is excellent but little small
3.0,Love this but one part broke off quickly
3.0,It fit as expected but did not flatter my body.  I will be returning it.
3.0,"The adult rain coat couldn't even properly fit my skinny 12 year old- especially the sleeves ( very short). I got 2 adult ones and 2 kids ones. The kids one will work for my 6 year old but not the 10 or 12 year old. One is damaged aleady.. I'll need to just throw these out. I ordered from another brand that was true to size and had not problem with that fitting as expected. Disappointing. I all 4 coats appears to be the same size. When I opened the 4th coat I confirmed it was not marked as a kids coat however the sleeve size appears the same on all. See picture of sleeve with measurement reference and as it fits on my son.<br />**Update<br />Although the packaging on the initial raincoats indicated Adult, they were actually kid's sizes. The company sent new coats out which were larger. The combination of black and clear didn't match the ordered coats which caused some frustration for the people I had ordered them for but at least they fit."
3.0,"I got this to wear under my regular shirts, to tighten everything up and conceal my labs. This does hold everything in but it doesn't hide that much. It is too stretchy to really hide anything. I will still wear under my clothes, but you can't really tell that much of a difference when I wear it or not."
3.0,"Just got the bag. It was almost a perfect bag except for one major flaw...none of the buckles have additional belt holes to allow for bag or pocket expansion. So as long as you don’t over pack it, it may work. There is plenty of room for additional holes, so why they didn’t stamp extras in is beyond me.<br />I’m going to travel with it for one week and see how it will go, but I’m not being optimistic. We’ll see. Stay tuned."
3.0,"Bought this to use for work - as I work in corrections - and literally it is so small! My fault, I didn’t read the dimensions. But y’all, I can’t even fit my boxed dinners or Tupperware inside! If you only use it for snacks it works!"
3.0,The bag that the shoes arrived in was cut open. The shoe has a cut from a razor blade or something.
3.0,Very cute shoes and quality seems ok considering price but seem at least 1/2 size to full size too small.  I'm usually between a 5.5 to 6 in size - I ordered a 6 and I can put them on but could not wear them because the length and width were too small.
3.0,Wish it could be worn with no worries of getting wet or perfume or what not.. a necklace is made to wear all the time!! What gives… my woman is scared to ruin it…
3.0,"I'm a fan of the Weekender chrono series from Timex in general, but this one didn't quite do it for me.  The color scheme is excellent, and for the price, the strap is quite nice.  But once I had the watch in hand, I realized right away that the hands should have a green strip that extends along their full length.  The black/or unpainted portion near the base of the hour and minute hands tends to blend into to the dial which reduces the overall legibility of the watch.  This effect is much more noticeable in person than in the stock photo.  Visibility of the hour and minute hands is the first criterion I use when judging any analog chrono and this watch  didn't quite measure up on that front in real world usage."
3.0,"So I love the color of these bags they look beautiful. They are smaller than expected but they’re so pretty, however the biggest flaw isthat there’s no base to the bottom. Most bags come with like a stiff piece of thin cardboard that you put on the bottom so that it keeps it flat but this one doesn’t have it. So anytime you put anything in it everything topples over unless it’s in a box. Think Louis Vuitton never full. You need to cut out cardboard and put it on the bottom to give this bag any type of structure. It’s beautiful it’s nice, it’s just lacking a piece of cardboard on the bottom that every gift bag in the world comes with."
3.0,"I really like the material these pants are made out of. The only thing that I have to say that's negative for these pair of pants is that after wearing them for a couple range and training days, and one or two call outs, the seat has started to separate. I still like them, however I am undecided if I'll get another pair."
3.0,went well with the necklace I purchased but they are definitely small. Great price though
3.0,Not a good fit... but they did refund my money so I have it 2 more stars
3.0,I ordered a XXL -I am 5’2” 260pounds and the jumpsuit does not go pass my thighs.
3.0,not my favorite
3.0,Not true to size. Runs small.
3.0,"They look great on but not that comfortable, the lenses need to be rounded more, their too flat."
3.0,"These padded panties do give you some plump to your back side although they do run a bit large, they are still quite comfortable."
3.0,"Nice color, I bought the blue. Washes well - cold/hung to dry.<br />I bought the recommended size and it was much bigger than expected. Sadly it looked like a maternity dress. Given the situation I was in, I made due with a fitted jacket over top of it and was able to pass it off for the event without looking like I was ready to give birth. Disappointing."
3.0,"Bubbling on lenses, quality control isn't great."
3.0,"I'm not sure if you can tell, but picture on amazon has what appears to be little disco balls with crystals at end of the threader. The earrings I got have a round crystal. Not a huge deal, but I wanted them to go with a similar style necklace and they don't. So they'll sit in my jewelry box or I'll give them as a gift. They seem ok for the price."
3.0,"The label 29, I supposed to be waist 29"", but fit like 27. I would donate it instead of return. The postage will cost $50 to send back that is more than this pair of pants. I like the style and it is cute, too bad."
3.0,"It's kinda cute but the picture looks much better than  the reality. It looks really cheap and the charm is very small. You need to be about 6 inches away to see that it is a cat pendant.<br /><br />It's still cute, but it's just not as pretty as the picture."
3.0,Jacket perfect pants small
3.0,"After three washings  the fabric is already knappy.  I guess that's to be expected in a world where we demand cheap clothes. Love the style and the color. Just wish I could opt in for a higher, more durable fabric...so true of so many clothes today...."
3.0,"This shirt is a little shorter than expected, and it also just looks like someone cut the fabric across the bottom instead of putting any kind of seam.<br />The fabric gets EVERYWHERE! I had little velvet pieces covering my other clothes after wearing it. It is pretty cute though and not to bad for the price."
3.0,"Colors I received were pink, cobalt and multi/print; not as shown in the picture above"
3.0,Appears it just be 2 pieces of plastic not carbon fiber
3.0,I really like my glasses and the case but I am finding that with the case it wont close properly but I must say that other than that well worth the money
3.0,"Not very attractive. But it is good quality. I get state pins for every state I visit, and other pins for landmarks or popular attractions."
3.0,"Very, very soft. Runs just a lititle small, so I will be line drying these. The actual quality is great and the color is rich."
3.0,"The headband came quickly (yeah!) however, due to how it was packaged, there is a crease through the middle of the headband which makes it unwearable. It is shiny so my 4 year old and 2 year old daughters like it."
3.0,"While the necklace was just as it is pictured, the charms are not secured well enough to keep them from falling off.  The little ring holding them on is not tightly closed. I would give it five stars if that problem could be fixed."
3.0,"Wore twice, Hand washed. But they already have holes in them. Accomodates about 8&#34; Length, A little small in the Potatoes/Beans area."
3.0,Doesn't fit a cup D.
3.0,These are too small for my 5 yr old.
3.0,"fabric is almost waterproof, so it has a strange texture... but the dress is adorable."
3.0,I was just appointed in the neckline. On the model it looks like it’s looser neckline but it is a regular T-shirt neckline which I do not like. I need to return it
3.0,"Cute, but......."
3.0,It is a good length...but different colors than the picture posted...the picture is more warmer color than the actual necklace
3.0,it does not stretch at all. It does runs small.
3.0,This product was smaller than expected. I got a 3x. I wear between 1 and 2x.
3.0,"He comprado sueter NIKE anteriormente en Large, pero me queda  un poco ajustados. Por eso compré este en XL y este me ha quedado demasiado grande."
3.0,"It's plastic clips on a nylon belt thing so, you have to balance the universe properly so your purses dont slide. As soon as that is done, it hold the purses nicely, when they're empty."
3.0,Wristlet strap broke quickly.
3.0,"Feels like a cheap china made material, im too lazy to return it"
3.0,"This shirt was ok. Didn't really flatter me, I felt like it made me look round and big. Returned."
3.0,"Good bag. Had to return it because I needed something bigger. But otherwise, good."
3.0,"Eh, it's an okay wig. For the price, I didn't expect too much, but it really doesn't have any shape especially not the shape in the photo."
3.0,Low quality mirror finish scratches really easily. Frames are OK.
3.0,"I didn't think it was possible, but there are actually so many pockets in this bag it's overwhelming! It is a good size to carry all the gear you'll need throughout the day, though (like your iPad, umbrella and a pair of ballerinas in addition to makeup, phone and the norm). The tiny flashlight that comes with it is a great idea for finding things in the bag in dim light. If you have a wallet, you don't need one. This bag has several individual  slots for multiple cards in addition to plenty of pockets for your change and cash.<br /><br />The purse arrived rather stiff and it's going to take some time to try to wear it out of the shape it's been formed into during storage and shipping. I would like the bag better if it were a more soft, supple leather but I don't feel the issue is big enough for it to be worth a return. I'm determined to break it in to soften up the form.<br /><br />The highlight of this bag is that it's spacious & great for running around the city with everything you'll need for the day."
3.0,"I like the shirt, the sleeves are too tight. I would love to exchange this, but I slacked on the window to send it back. I weigh 140 and wear a medium."
3.0,Huge on the face and far away from the face. Seems cheap as you expect.
3.0,"I usually wear a 2X and bought a 3X just to be sure it fit. It fit more like a large. Cute, but order big!"
3.0,"As I am a woman in her mid 60's I must wear a very long tunic to wear the leggings out but at home its not a problem.  I wish they were just a bit thicker but again they are fine for at home and running quick errands when not too cold.  They are thin enough to wear under jeans, athethic clothing, etc.  Some have threading hanging and have to be cut off but not a big problem--yet.  I have not washed them yet so don't know what will happen at that point.  I am 5'7 and weigh 128 lbs and fit but can see a larger person could also wear as the fabic will stretch.  Not sure if a shorter person could wear without some issues but maybe depending on weight.  Just about right for my height and weight.  I would purchase again."
3.0,"good quality , color, but to short for a Calvary stetson"
3.0,"I like the quality but it's on the larger side, I got XL, fits more like slacks, I have a 33 inches waist so not sure if the L will be too small. So far I guess they will do for lounging."
3.0,I really like the dress. i ordered a small which is my normal size. Everything fits but its really short. I monogramed the top and now just use it as a bathing suit cover up since it is so short.
3.0,"These lace tanks for the size that I ordered were significantly small.,<br />I ended up giving them to my Daughter. They are beautiful but judst run small.<br />Thank You ! !"
3.0,"It's a cute dress, and mostly comfy. But despite ordering a size up - I ordered XL, and am 5'5'', 153 lb. - it is still tight across the sleeves. That section of armpit to armpit is way smaller than you would expect for this size."
3.0,The hat was adorable but the Velcro strap didn't keep the hat on on the windy beach in Jamaica.
3.0,"Definitely can go on my head. I just do not want to sport a line across my brow for an hour after I wear it.<br />Very nicely done, just not my (61cm or 7 5/8) size."
3.0,Awkward fit; they are a little too long for me.
3.0,Top is very nice just very clingy I thought the shirt would be a little looser so therefore you can see all the creases on your back including your bra I should've returned it but it was too late
3.0,"Your sizing is off. I wear a 10-12 in all Columbia shorts like these. Your "" medium "" runs very small, could not even snap waist"
3.0,It looks nice and flatters my belly.  But the top part sits oddly.  It is made from a cheap material.
3.0,"I bought this because several reviewers said the fabric was soft. And while it's not the super cheap scratchy material, it isn't at all soft either. I bought the size recommended by the seller sizing chart and it was way too tight. Maybe if the elastic had an extra inch or two, I'd have been okay. It's cute, and flowy, and the included bow could be fun. I would call it very good costume quality, but NOT good quality for just regular day wear."
3.0,Worst pattern in person and one needs to wear tights
3.0,The metal is pretty soft and pliable. I would prefer if this was a little harder to bend but yet still adjustable.
3.0,"The lace applique on this is beautiful, but the netted material it's sewn to is very scratchy, and I don't think it will last more than a few wears. It was purchased to be worn to a wedding, so we are keeping it, but we don't recommend if you're looking for something to last."
3.0,Not exactly the highest quality but you do get what you  pay for.
3.0,"Not tight,looks way too big."
3.0,I would gave liked the bands to be fixed to the lights
3.0,These are adorable shoes but they arrived dirty and that was disappointing
3.0,I knew it would be thick but I didn’t expect it to be so long. It definitely doesn’t fit in a credit card slot. I placed it with my money.  Looks like I have a condom ring in my wallet too. A better design and use of the wasted space would be better. Maybe adding a slit for money or change and making the ring smooth? Not so practical but good to use while on vacation or something.
3.0,"I'm on the fence about this item.  My daughter has the same style swimsuit in a Speedo.  That suit is thick and has worn well for a year.  I looked high and low and could not find another Speedo (in stock and at under 40 bucks), so I ordered this as a &#34;filler&#34; until I hopefully find a Speedo or Seafolly suit.<br /><br />The good:<br />Style--hard to find a girls swimsuit that is one-piece and covers the entire back.  Modesty and sun protection are a must for me.  Cute design, but my 3 year old complained that she wanted a pink suit (no points deducted for personal preference.)<br />Sizing: surprisingly, the suit fits true to size.  I ordered a 6A and 4A assuming the suit would fit small and it would be Asian sized.  My 3 year old who just started wearing size 4 actually fit better in the the Size 4A.  For reference, she weighs 32 lbs and is 35 inches tall, with an average frame. Saving the 6A for next year.<br />Price:  less than $10--worth a gamble in my book.<br />Shipping:  Took a little over a week. Well before expected.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Suit is only lined in the crotch, my other Speedo is fully lined.  The lining is very thin in this area, making we wonder if it will become uncomforable over time.<br /><br />Some Questions:<br />Durability:  This suit is about 25% less thick than my Speedo suit.  The black does not appear see-through, but the sides are a little sheer. If the suit is tight on your kiddo, it may be too sheer when wet. The bottom of this suit got very pilled the first time it was used at the pool.  I doubt it would last more than one summer.  Again, it's not fully lined, so this may make a huge difference for you.<br />Sun protection:  I wonder about the sun protection.  The makers make no claims about SPF, so I would assume that there is very little SPF protection.  Thus, sunscreen still a must.  My kiddo didn't get burned under the suit, and she did have a tan line.<br />Zipper:  It's plastic but does not seem durable.  It is sewed in well.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!"
3.0,"Great product in the fact that it kept me warm and it was easy to use. After the first few days the ear part seam came apart. I would say you get what you pay for, this didn't break the bank so its great for a weekend winter traveler, but if you are using them daily you may want to find a product that is a bit more quality."
3.0,The rose gold wore off very quickly.  Perhaps my daughter should have removed it each time before bathing but that seems a little unrealistic.
3.0,"first, the positive. it's a nice soft/smooth material. i like the print which is also on the back.<br />However, it was much shorter than shown on the model. the front hem came to just under my shorts waist band (not low rise).<br />the first time i wore the top i took a 3.5 hour car drive. the bottom hem/seam snagged. i guess on the seat belt (?) when i pulled on the hem, gently, the seam snapped & unraveled. I dont know how it will now hold up in the washer. I just sent this flaw to the sellers in their feedback request so i haven't yet heard back. if i hear anything negative i will let you know."
3.0,"While the romper is cute, the fit just isn't right on me. Maybe my torso is too long, because it doesn't fold over at the waist like it shows in the picture. It's just pulled tight which makes it look awkward on me. I'm 5'7, 130 Ibs and bought a size medium. The color is beautiful and the material is soft. I am going to keep it to wear around the house this summer."
3.0,"Good quality materials but it's hard to quickly pull cards out of the slots. Also I would love if it had a snap to keep it closed--it just flops open with it's full of cards, passport and money."
3.0,Quick service however too small
3.0,"I am not very impressed with this dress. It is normal printed cotton dress. Will surely look cute on baby girls. I bought it for my niece who is yet to try it, so not sure about fitting. If time permits I would like to return."
3.0,Worn it probably a dozen times and the gold is starting to come off.
3.0,"I thought these earrings would be nice, but unfortunately they are just too long for me."
3.0,"I returned these watch bands because they were very loose on my wrist. They fit the Samsung watch fine, but didn't fit my wrist."
3.0,Nice dress very good for the summer
3.0,Very pretty. Got these as a lightning purchase.
3.0,Cute but VERY short
3.0,Unfortunately I ordered small not realizing it. Will donate these and order some larger ones
3.0,I liked that it's easy to clean it's easy to use. Lacks power won't crush ice and bottle is made I glass could break easily
3.0,"Cute dress<br />Fits to size.<br />But this is not burgundy!<br />Kind of sad!<br />We took family photos and all wore burgundy and black. I ordered this for my daughter and it was supposed to be burgundy, but as you can see it’s more pinky."
3.0,Pretty but much too dainty. The chain is a so thin it would not last very long. Not worth price charged.
3.0,Nice print but the nose wire is too thin and is not sturdy.  It feels like a thin paper clip was used for the nose wire.
3.0,"Bought this for my ten year old future geologist. She loves the shirt. Unfortunately after two washes (inside out, after a vinegar set) it was significantly faded, and I'm scared that the design will be unreadable before next school year."
3.0,"From a distance, one would not be able to tell that these are costume jewelry, but the chains are a significant flaw in the design. It's hard to make a chain that looks high quality, and they haven't quite achieved it. It also tends to get tangled depending on how much you're moving around. If you think you can deal with those flaws, these could work for you."
3.0,Fits good but doesn't look cute. .Maybe for someone else
3.0,"the fabric was really nice & substantial. The ear loops fit well, but it placed the front of the gaiter too close to my eyes so I had to return it. It matters how your ears are placed on your head related to where it will end up on your face & mine weren't placed correctly for this gaiter. They were made really well & I would recommend giving them a try."
3.0,"Way, way undersized for a 3x - waited a long time for delivery as it came from China.  Attempting to return two of the dresses I ordered.  The material is very thin and probably ok for lounging at home."
3.0,"These are okay sunglasses.  When I was looking for green aviators, I came across the picture posted.  I ordered what I thought would be very green lenses, like a pair I owned like six years ago.  Even as I type the review the photo on the left shows no blue on the lenses, like the photo has been updated to.<br />Anyway, disappointed about the color, because it was the only reason I ordered these in the first place.  I haven't seen that lens color in stores since my last pair.<br />The tint on them is sort of lilac colored and not very dark.  You can see the wearer's eyes, not fully, but enough to follow during conversation.<br />They sell the same color frames/lens at the gas station by my house for half the price, maybe look around before you buy from here."
3.0,"The scarf is a good value for what you pay for.  Don't expect it to be anymore or any less.  The fabric is not the best quality but good enough.  The only thing that I didn't like was that the fringes were only on 2 sides, not all 4.  Other than that, it was a good purchase.  Not sure if it will last that long though."
3.0,Large size
3.0,Black size Small. Very first time I tried them on and they ripped a hole in the front crotch. I ordered the right size and actually they may be a little big. I’m 5’3 at 137lbs. I do love them and they are super comfortable. I also ordered the gray ones which didn’t rip but also to me aren’t as comfortable and didn’t have pockets. I’m going to try and see this hole up myself and continue wearing them.
3.0,Like the other reviews say it smelled pretty bad coming out of the package and the lining doesn't seem very strong. I'm guessing the smell was from the material. It being in the packaging without any airflow. Once it's out of the packaging for a few days it gets better.<br />It works for what I'm using it for. I don't expect it to last very long but that's ok for the price I paid.
3.0,Ok product but I'll buy from stores from now on.
3.0,Site said they run small so my daughter who usually wears a medium ordered large.  They were still too small.  We had to return and get XL.  Her school colors are Blue  & white so this set was perfect match to go under school soccer uniforms. Really short in the arm length too.  I know they are &#34;compression&#34; material and fit but ran small.
3.0,The material was a little itchy I ordered a size large the bottom skirt part fit me but the top was too small there when I put it in there was a lot of side boob. Unflattering
3.0,"These are cute but they are NOT sized for women despite the size chart being in women's sizes. They are for teens, I guess. I am a small woman at size 4-6 mostly on the 4 end. The &#34;small&#34; was too small for me, and tight. I had to return them. I will try a medium."
3.0,"Love these rings! Unfortunately, I was only sent 6, not 7."
3.0,After one use the material started to get fuzzy but they are still usable.
3.0,Runs small. It is not as nice as it looks on web page
3.0,"they didn't fit my mom's legs, so i took them. they fit mine but i soon found the stuff the boot's made of kinda squeaks and can get itchy."
3.0,Cute but runs small. But a sizr up as it shrinks heavily after a wash
3.0,Too  small in the arms
3.0,"I had to return and order a different pair- these were for a small adult woman and they didn't fit. I see they are listed on other pages on Amazon as being just child size, but the listing where I purchased them specifically is titled ""Kids Adult"".<br />It seems like they would be very good for children."
3.0,The top of the dress looks like a slightly cream color  and the bottom mesh is egg white.  The color white is not matching at the top and bottom of the dress
3.0,These ear climbers are pretty but do not stay put.  This is my first pair so I am not sure if it is the design or my ears.
3.0,The waistband fit perfect but the thigh area was way to tight if I sat down it would have probably ripped
3.0,"A couple of the pairs are very noticeably tighter around the legs than they should be, I even ripped one of the pairs trying to pull them up (I've been wearing this Dr. Motion brand for over a year and had no problems whatsoever with my old socks, just wanted to get more since I liked them so much). I'm not nearly as happy with this set, but a few of them will work out and I will likely try this brand again in the future as these sets really are a great deal, and the socks that are better made really do fit great and are comfortable to wear all day."
3.0,"It is wider than it should be for the length.  It is warm, so I do wear it but not when I want to impress someone with my outfit."
3.0,"The item was nice but should come in sizes, simply too small for me."
3.0,Look cool and will help with the sun but there's no compression at all
3.0,"Cute, but EXTREMELY LONG."
3.0,They are a little tight with gym socks and a little loose without. Though I don't use them often the biggest thing I noticed right away was a lack of foot support.  Maybe it will change with more use but my old ones from another maker had good support.
3.0,Super cute.  Sent back for 2 reason. One to my surprise medium fit like a large.  Second the material didn't match the adar flounce skirt.
3.0,"There was a huge rip in my outfit, but they gave me a refund with no grip. So I would buy it again, but just a bigger size. The train was also extremely long. I'm 5'3 & it was dragging on the floor. This is definitely an outfit for a taller person."
3.0,"This would be a great costume to be a flight attendant for NASA. It's that kinda of weird flimsy material. The pattern is cute, but the piping is weird. The construction and stitching is good, but the collar is huge and the fabric is a hard no for me. Fit was true to size."
3.0,Hard for my 6 yr old grandaughter to pull on!
3.0,Very pretty dress but it was too small in the chest.
3.0,talk about unbearably hat!!!!!
3.0,Fits pretty good although the opening on top of the boot is kinda wide. Not for going in the snow just a nice dress boot.
3.0,"Like re-enforced top edge of opening.  But, footbox is too big for my foot length and the pillow cushioning is too soft and dies not support the foot strike while walking.  Would not purchase again."
3.0,Cute. It’s that kinda cheap shiny material but it’s still adorable under a cute jacket or with some ripped up black jeans.
3.0,stitching is coming out in numerous places and it has only been worn a few dozen times.
3.0,I is very cute my only issue is that the chain came tangled in several knots. It took me about ten minutes to fix and I was really happy that it didn't break because it was a gift for a co worker.
3.0,The brim is not as stiff as I thought it would be. It is a bit to large but t it is one size fits all. The material is okay. For the price you get what you pay for.
3.0,"Very nice lookin & loved the color but they felt like they were a full size smaller than I ordered and maye as a result, the footbed & not comfortable.  Return was easy however."
3.0,"Very thin fabric, also one that always feels like there is static and it's stuck to you."
3.0,The material is nice I just wish it had Little lite stretch or made true to size.
3.0,To big for a medium so will order smaller next time. Medium would be big for a small frame.
3.0,They run very much small than expected
3.0,I searched for a boys/toddler hat and this came up.  It's really to big for my 3 year old grandson.  It's really nice looking but bigger than needed.
3.0,This is a great shoe but My daughter my daughter is skinny And it doesn’t look right on her
3.0,"I returned this because the strings were very long and my daughter didn't like the way it looked when she put it on.  I thought it was a nice, simple rain jacket."
3.0,"Too tight, doesn't stretch"
3.0,Looks more boxy and didnt like the fit on me perosnally and it does look like the picture.  Quality is thin which doesn't bother me but the fit isn't flattering.  Could be just mt body lol but I usally wear a size small shirt and i have cirves in all the rihhr places. I assumed woiod look and feel better but nope.  I wouldn't buy again and think there are better quality and style as far as the way it's cut and sewn. Will try to update with photos to get better understanding of what I am talking about.
3.0,"These are incredibly cute and the material is so comfortable! The shorts are probably some of my favorites that I have to sleep in. They are a nice light material and have a drawstring so you can pull them tighter to keep them up or loosen them if you need to. The saying is adorable as well.<br /><br />As for the fit though, I guess I’m the unlucky one because I disagree with the majority of the reviews. I don’t think these fit to size. The shorts do. The shirt however, doesn’t. The one I have is extra-large. I’m 5’8 and 170 so I usually go with large to extra-large and that’s more than fitting. This shirt though just didn’t cut it. I wound up passing it to my 5’4” 130lb mother who fit it like a size medium. So, I have to disagree with the “fits to size” thing, at least for the shirt. It was just too short and if you aren’t petite in the shoulders size up.<br /><br />Other than that, it’s nice. I just can’t give you much of a review on anything other than the shorts, which I love. I’m kind of sad but it’s okay. I do love the shorts a lot!"
3.0,My wife said she liked him but has not worn them yet so I'm not sure LOL.
3.0,It is not the color in the picture and when zipped it is really fat. Credit cards are not easy to get in and out. I didn't like it and will likely return it.
3.0,"I was just looking for a good cross between pretty and comfy.  These fit oddly.  I had to get a large size and even then it was snug on bottom.  Normally I wear a small to medium, so it definitely runs small.  The top also tends to bunch weirdly.  Overall I'd say keep looking."
3.0,cheap quality fabric and make.  Not what one expects from the picture.
3.0,Supposed to use but looked cheap!
3.0,"The print is lovely; however, the dress looks as if it was hastily put together or the seamstress was a beginner.  The neckline, as well as the pattern is off center.  I have practically had to remake this dress due to the poor workmanship of the seamstress."
3.0,"They were a little thick for my taste. They might be good to wear in your first hole, but I bought them to wear on my second and third, so together they looked really thick and not to mention heavy! Sadly, I am returning."
3.0,The sandle had a neat look but it was a not as soft as it looked. The size was a bit big. We are returning at no cost.
3.0,"The engraving was small, could barely tell what it said without holding a flashlight to it. Very lightweight"
3.0,Sounds description wasn't exact looks like a small
3.0,Material was odd and not flattering. Sizing correct.
3.0,"Definitely not as flattering as on the model for an average size 10 woman. It's also pretty long so unless your 5'6""+ a Large will be too long. Decent quality."
3.0,"I purchased this dress in size medium because other reviewers stated that the dress ran small. I am 5'2 130lbs, 32C - the top was falling off of me. And, without a stiletto, it makes short legs look even shorter.  Not a good look for me. Otherwise, seems to be good quality."
3.0,"Very nice for the first 6 months then it begins to tarnish. Cheap enough where you can buy another, but definitely not made to last."
3.0,The color in the picture is brighter than the actual band.  Also I've only worn it for a couple months and the color is starting wear off.
3.0,Shirt fit as expected but was very thin and sheer. Will be returning.
3.0,"I purchased a large and it was too small, I'm 5'5, 145lbs"
3.0,"I ordered a 3/4 sleeve ""Olive"" colored shrug. I received a long sleeve dark green shrug. Not what I wanted to wear with a specific outfit. No time to exchange, so I will wear a one I already had. The one I received is well made and a nice fit; so I will keep it. Just disappointed for the outfit I had planned."
3.0,"Beautiful shoes, but very hard and uncomfortable even with inserts."
3.0,"I don't think there's any particular outstanding feature, they looked good but after a while I couldn't wear them any more, they started to hurt my nose."
3.0,"The product is of good, breathable fabric but is too big. I wear a 7 3/4&#34; hat so I have to wait wear this product over my ears to for comfortably, otherwise it pushes my ears out and bunches up at the top."
3.0,"I own a lot of packing cubes, and these are okay. The new material has a bit of strong odor, which could be common. But I have some really nice and of course more expensive packing cubes that do not smell at all even when they are brand new. I like the different sizes of the cubes, it is good to use them for different types of clothes. For example, underwear in the small cube, shirts in the medium cube, and sweaters in the large cube. What I like the most about this product is that it comes with a laundry bag. I usually use a trash bag to hold my dirty laundry during travel, but this one is so much nicer and it locks the laundry in the bag tightly yet still makes my luggage pretty looking.<br /><br />I also want to mention that the tags say no washer for these packing cubes, but because of the order issue I had to clean them. I put them in a garment bag and threw them in a washer, used gentle detergent, and set it as delicates cycle. The color went a little lighter after washing, but there was no damage at all. So if you are like me who has a habit of washing new products before first use, you can try washer just to make sure you use a garment bag, that could help to protect the cubes."
3.0,Ordered this product but received a slip by spanx. Didn't know they existed and loved it so I didn't return it.
3.0,My son says these are comfortable  but he will not wear them because there is no fly. Be very aware of that before buying and be sure that your needs are met by these.
3.0,"Kind of cheap looking, designs out of date.  The other ones I bought, Hisdern, were much better just kind of limited in designs - don't do paisley and all but 2 sets had paisley.  I will keep these Wehug but wouldn't buy them again."
3.0,Fits like a large I wanted a smal
3.0,Dress is comfortable and I got compliments however it is very short waisted to be careful if you are and average to tall person with LT. I kept pulling on it all day trying to lengthen it..
3.0,If you all READ the description it says the word is on the back of the shirt!!!!
3.0,"Didn’t fit, way to big"
3.0,Not much put into making this dress. Also it’s smaller then they say they are.
3.0,but....its broken twice already in the first month - fixable but annoying. Price is great - otherwise i'd prob give it 2 stars.
3.0,"I was hoping these shoes would be an easier to put on pair of support shoes.  While they are easy to put on and give pretty good support, they did not provide the support I get with tie lace shoes.  After wearing them for a few days, I started to have increased leg and knee pain.  Luckily they were on Amazon's Try before you Buy program, and I reluctantly returned them."
3.0,"OVERALL IS A VERY NICE NECKLACES,LOOKS JUST LIKE THE PICTURE.MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THE MATERIAL IS VERY CHIP,SO BE CAREFUL PUTING IT ON AND TAKING IT OFF BECAUSE IT MIGHT BRAKE."
3.0,"cute, but small"
3.0,"Its a decent mask, good detail. However, the it seems a little thin."
3.0,Did not cover my eyes effectively.
3.0,"This product lasted about 7 months before it broke. It held up pretty well, but the reversible buckle wore out. Not terrible, but not great either"
3.0,This set had a great fit (although thicker would be more flattering) but I ordered it in white and it was so see through. Everything on the leggings is see through below the band (the band is thicker and looks less sheer) making it super obvious that your skin and everything shows through. I should have listened to the other reviews. I have other white sets that don’t have this problem.
3.0,".....but way too long.  I am 5'8"" and with high, high heels, it still would have drug the floor.  If you are over 6' without heels, this might work for you.  It is truly a beautiful dress but there is no doubt you would have to pay as much or more for the alteration of the hem,  just so you won't trip in it."
3.0,Cute but too small for what i needed... but i like it
3.0,"Very pretty but, huge! Not sure if I will wear as is or take them apart and alter them."
3.0,The dress wrinkled easily and shrunk when I washed it.
3.0,It was kinda slow getting it but I think my husband will love it
3.0,"Really cute watch, don't put it on too tight, mine broke"
3.0,"After going up one size, they're still too small, so I am returning them.  Bummed out they run that small...not sure if I will purchase again"
3.0,"The silicone cover fits the keyless remote like a glove and provides good protection when the remote ""goes to ground.""  However, the shackle that binds the remote to the key chain is over-sized and results in a wobbly connection."
3.0,I bought this to wear with a rose gold watch and ring to have color coordination.  I was pleased with the outcome.
3.0,"I like these pants a lot but I just wish it was a little longer for me.  It definitely served its purpose as I wore it for Thanksgiving but I would have liked it to either be a little more on the skinny side or a little more on the boot cut side if not both. I would have ordered both styles as corduroys are very warm, in the fact that this is stretchy definitely helps especially for Holiday eating purposes"
3.0,"Quality/resolution is a bit lacking, but certainly still nice to hand up."
3.0,Like the color fits good material too hot for Summer
3.0,"Nice dress, but ok. Didn't like the material, it's a little thin. Other than that its good."
3.0,"Cute, but more for a child than a grown woman."
3.0,Way to small but beautiful skirt... My daughter loves it....So she inherited it.
3.0,"They are cute. But I don’t think these are women’s sizes, likely juniors. I ordered a size up and still too small."
3.0,"I loved the bracelet - it looked stunning but after wearing it two times, I picked it up one day to wear again and the bracelet fell apart.  However, I guess what can I expect for $4.00......."
3.0,"Not for big chested girls. I’m a size large with D cups and the bodice was waaay to small. Plus it was sewn flat instead of curved so it made a weird wavy line and smooshed my boobs ugly instead of flattering. I really really wanted to like this dress, and it would look great if I had smaller boobs"
3.0,"The suit itself is very nicely made and the material is great.  The colors are even nicer in person.  I ordered the size that was recommended online and it didn't make me look like I lost 10 pounds -- it just looked the same.  There was no compression feeling that I've gotten when trying on other Miraclesuits.  I am not talking so tight you can't breathe either, this had no effect whatsoever.  I am guessing that if I went down a size, it would have done what was advertised to do.  But the main issue was the underwire  -- that is the reason this suit lost 2 stars.  Even in a bigger size, the underwire sat so low under my chest -  it was useless.  At first, I didn't even realize that it was an underwire was because it sits so low.  I can buy a &#34;regular&#34; suit for much less $$."
3.0,"Bought these for a trip to Universal Studios - we didn't end up using them.  A zipper and a strap broke almost immediately.  It's difficult to get things in and out.  They are lightweight, making them comfortable to carry, but they just did not meet our needs for the trip.  I gave them to my daughters and they use them for their dolls."
3.0,"Sleeves are short, not a turn down collar. They mean it when they say sizes run smaller than us sizes. Cute pattern!"
3.0,pretty necklace but ribbon used to tie it is grass green and doesn't match at all so i am going to try and restring myself because i do like the beads.
3.0,"The product advertisement said designed in Ireland - It probably was, but what it didn't say was where it was made. When I received the hat it says made in China. I try to never buy anything made in China and would not have purchased the hat had I known where it was made. I think every product you post should have "" MADE IN "" right along with the product description."
3.0,My doctor told me to try compression socks for the swelling. I thought I’d try these. They didn’t help.
3.0,"A little disappointed, I ordered based on measurement photo. It was very short (at least 6 in off the floor) my biggest complaint however is the color. The purple is nothing like the photo. It is a pastel purple and I was hoping for the deep purple that was shown. Other than that, it is a great cape."
3.0,"Cut romper & it fits great, but what happened to the belt? The pictures show a belt & mine only came with a weird ribbon. I'm not a bow person so I would've like to receive the belt with the brown closure like advertise. If I would've received the belt, 4 stars"
3.0,"This was my favorite earring, the first pair I got was amazing, so I got a second pair the quality isn't the same at all. The piece that goes in the ear is thick and hard."
3.0,Not worth the price.  Granddaughter likes it though.
3.0,"Definitely not for larger women, it's cute but not very flattering."
3.0,I like this watch. I have had this watch over a year now and it still looks great. The band wears out quick but is easy to replace.
3.0,I have had this winder for about a year. The build quality of this watch winder is very nice. The wood construction and finish are beautiful. My complaint is that after 10 months the right side winder started making noise and has progressively gotten louder. Also the watch pads that the watch attach to fit very tight into the slots on the winder wheels. Inserting the watches into and removing them puts a lot of stress on the winder wheel.
3.0,This was a lovely dress for the price however mine came with NO tags on it so I suspect it was worn/used.
3.0,"I really like the design of these, the only thing I don’t like is that the ends that the post attaches to gets that green discoloration."
3.0,They are just OK. I don’t know where the memory foam is everything seems pretty firm.
3.0,"Giving this three stars because a couple fixes could be a great shirt. I love love the sleeves! The design is super cute and the length is perfect. The overall feel of the material is kind of stiff and uncomfortable, could be worse though. Maybe a wash will help. I also think this runs a little big in size, I’m 5’4” and 165 lbs with a 38DD chest so I usually wear a large but I think I could’ve gotten away with a medium here and it would’ve fit perfectly fine. I do like it tucked in the front, if not it’s way to flowey and unflattering. I’ll probably order another color in Medium to see if I like it better."
3.0,I will have to wear it like a shirt because it is too short for a tall plus size woman. I love the brilliant color but it is somewhat small.
3.0,I wear a large to XL in shirts and like t-shirts to fit looser so I purchased the XL. It is too small.
3.0,"I like the color and material but it is way to big for me, the top doesn't lay flat and me being a shorter person the dress ends at a weird point. I really love the petticoat under it, because it adds this character. I plan to wear it to a dance although I feel like its definitely not the normal style, that is just my self-consciousness. Rock it if you like it. -Em[[ASIN:B075WVXV8H 50s Style Vintage Wiggle Dresses Ruched Bodice Size XL BP105-9]]<br />Wish i got a large instead."
3.0,"They were longer than I expected, they're longer than my leg but thats a me thing"
3.0,The bows where more so golden then yellow but it still worked out fine
3.0,"They work okay, a little over sized and feel flimsy. I was supposed to receive one back pair and one tortuous pair. They sent two black pair."
3.0,I wanted to love this dress! The print was nice and it seemed casual but classy... but sadly it was way to sheer (see through). It’d be good as a beach wrap. For reference I ordered the dress in white.
3.0,I gave it a try and I was hoping it would fit. I personally can’t have the same size in top and bottom. I ordered a medium. The bottom fit just fine but the top was too small (34DD).
3.0,They where a gift fit fine
3.0,Great 80's accessories that I bought last minute for an 80s themed party. The package was missing the mesh gloves and the earrings are not a good material for sensitive ears but I wore the rest of the accessories and the outfit came together nicely.
3.0,"This skirt is pretty for a costume or something like that.  I'd order at least a size larger, but probably more like 2 sizes larger than you normall would."
3.0,Beautiful but infected my sensitive ears.
3.0,Flower broke off as soon as I opened it. After a little superglue it was fine.
3.0,"I purchased these gloves because they were at the right price point for me and I was looking for an all purpose glove.<br /><br />The gloves are made of a very solid material and are very durable.  I have used these gloves on rocks, trees, and other rough areas and have had no issues with the palms or fingers.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have with these gloves is that after the second use one of the elastic straps around the wrist pulled apart.<br /><br />There are not additional knuckle supports or pads but the palms are made of very durable rough lining.<br /><br />Good glove for tactical use, and general purpose but not the most high end of gloves.  They are a firm glove and not the most flexible but still a good glove."
3.0,These looked like very nice shorts but they rain really small in the waist. Back they went.
3.0,"It's a cute shirt, but it needs a cami underneath. The problem I have most with it is that after a few washings, the fabric pills badly and it clings to itself after it comes out of the wash, even if I pull it out before drying. If I had never thrown it in the dryer in the first place it might not have started doing that, but I can't put the genie back in the box."
3.0,Snap broke within a week of granddaughter wearing them.
3.0,Like the cut. Very cute but fabric is a little see through.<br />Definitely wouldn't wear underpants with a pattern on it with this!
3.0,The bag is absolutely beautiful but it has a horrible fish odor smell to it. I'll be returning it.
3.0,"The compass does not work, the needle stays in the same place where ever you point it at."
3.0,Pretty watch but very hard to clasp. It also likes to come unclasped.
3.0,Like the style but lenses are  flimsy and fall out freqently.
3.0,Beautiful bracelet. It did end up breaking the second day I wore it. Had to fix it myself and really close the lops so they wont break apart again. But other than that it's pretty.
3.0,"Online at amazon the bracelet looked really nice, but after receiving it the heart charm is discolored and is hard to read. The pearl like beads are nicely colored."
3.0,"They are good for the kids. They seem to hold up. They fit good on my 2,6,9 but my 11 it was kind of small."
3.0,The bottoms were looser than I expected. The top was actually a good fit. I would advise you get a size smaller or your normal size. I’m 5’1” and 135 pounds.
3.0,They are alright until a skull falls out and you are searching for the MF on the floor for hours or until it gets sucked up by the vacuum!
3.0,The material is odd
3.0,The color is perfect. The fabric is soft but REALLY static-y. Also it is not as long as I hoped and a bit more boxy.
3.0,"not made very well,thread comes loose easy within first use and wash.But I still use them and it works okay."
3.0,One of the black stones fell out with less than 12 hours of wear. Another stone fell out of the orange set with their second time being worn. The other 6 pair are doing well. I have had them in non stop for almost a week now with no stone loss.
3.0,It took forever to get here the design was not as the photo had shown the material was cheap and the has are goofy looking.
3.0,I love the colors.  Regrettably the case got a little banged up in the mail which cause some of the power to spill out.  Otherwise it was good.
3.0,Esta cómodo pero no me gusta porque todo el tiempo se atora ya que se recorre la correa
3.0,Was perfect for the event I needed it for but shrunk soooooooo bad after one wash and fell apart with threads coming off
3.0,I'm thinking this is for a child
3.0,The hat is good quality but way too small. We bought it for my five year old but it barely fit my 13 month old. The size said it was for a youth but didn't include any actual measurements. If it had it would gave saved us a lot of trouble a coue of days before Christmas looking for a cowboy hat
3.0,Nice but strap is too short
3.0,"Definitely a really pretty ring, I got the pisces one. It broke within a week but that was in part to it getting caught on my clothing. Also in part to the fact that I mess with my rings a lot and after adjusting it a few times it snapped in half:/ super cool ring though, very creative"
3.0,"These look pretty cute. Very happy with the look of the studs themselves. However, packaging is terrible and the weak posts were bent. See photo. I bent them sort of back to straight but they are not perfect. To note, no metal backs on these. Just rubbery backs."
3.0,"So it was very pretty, until it broke. I wore it for two days. On the second day the stone and cabochon fell off of the ring. It is very cheaply tacked on. I will fix it buy that was disappointing. But because its price was cheap I gave it 3 stars instead of 1"
3.0,Like! :)
3.0,They don't look quite as pretty in person
3.0,"I wish I could wear this shirt with capris or a skirt, but it's not really cut for that.  I find the fit somewhat odd.  I'm a large breasted somewhat chubby, tall woman.  This thing looks like a maternity top on me.  It fits a bit better in the chest but the front rushing takes the shirt from feminine to frumpy if paired with the wrong accessories and bottoms.  The red floral is cute and the ruffles on the sleeve add a nice touch.  The shoulder and sleeve cut might not flatter some.  The odd thing about the fit is the armholes.  While the rest of the top is flowy and cut large, the armholes are cut a bit small which causes the ruffles to rub at the inside of my upper arms.  Add in the fact that the quality is that great and you have a scratchy, baggy top that only looks cute when paired with somewhat shorter shorts.  That's when I get the overall baby doll look.  Honestly, this is overpriced for what you get."
3.0,"Too small,not as described!"
3.0,kinda small  and not the qulaity I would have liked
3.0,"I would not wear this watch, but nice for hubby."
3.0,My grand-daughter says I can't wear this unless it's raining.  I wanted it to block the sun at her t-ball games but she says &#34;no way&#34;.
3.0,The rubber eyepiece holder slides off with the slightest tension. Finally I just crazy glued them on and used the center clasps to put them on with.
3.0,"I purchased tan size small and it fits a little looser then I'd like. I'm 5'2, 126lbs, 32DD but i don't like the way it makes my breast look. It's perfect in the belly area to camouflage the muffin top but it makes my chest look matronly. The material is nice and seems like good quality, this just isn't for me! ... Just my personal opinion."
3.0,My daughter is almost 3 and wears 2T/3T sized clothing. This leotard fits her but I doubt it will in a year.
3.0,Cute jewelry I just thought it was going to be a bit bigger based on the picture. It was somewhat small for what I was going for but it is still very good. If you allergic to metals or anything but gold this is great to wear for the night. I typically can't wear costume jewerly without it starting to itch and bother me well before the party is over and this lasted all night 5+ hours. Very good buy for the price.
3.0,"I've purchased a number of really nice slim wallets, but they were never small and slim enough.  This wallet is the smallest and slimmest I've found thus far, which allows me to carry the bare minimum (license, car insurance, debit and credit card, and a few bills.  I'm sure I can put more cards inside, but that would defeat the purpose of buying a very small and slim wallet.  Also,  I really like the wallet .<br /><br />Update after using for almost a month.  The top edges of the wallet where the cash is stored began to wear, in which the material appeared to be coming apart.  I returned it for a refund."
3.0,"The product is not as picture in the description. I have added some pics so you can see for yourself. Pockets have no buttons, the buttons upfront are not hidden, and overall it seems of lower quality than what the seller described. It is still soft but somewhat disappointed by the misleading information."
3.0,These were so uncomfortable I had to send back.  They looked pretty cheap as well.  The blush/ pink was a cute color though.  I would have kept I'd they hadn't been so uncomfortable
3.0,Good fit but fell apart after a couple of wears
3.0,"The short of it:<br />These are bog-standard, over the calf socks. Quite comfortable, but I didn't find them any warmer than standard socks.<br /><br />More info:<br />First, the good -<br />The socks appear to be well made. They sit comfortably on/over the calf and do not feel over-tight on the toes. The toe seam is subtle enough to be unnoticeable when wearing shoes/boots.  These sox stretch slightly and 'pull back' against the skin to feel tight, but not restrictive.<br /><br />Second, the not so good -<br />I rated these three stars as they are advertised as 'thermal' socks, yet there is nothing in the construction different than a standard pair of socks you'd pick up at a big box store. I wore these outside on a cold Colorado morning, wearing hiking shoes in upper 30 degree weather and my feet got cold quick! These are not as effective as my thick wool hiking socks.<br /><br />Which brings up another point. These socks are not  terribly thin, but they are absolutely not thick. They could, however, be good for layering.<br /><br />Thirdly, the middle ground -<br />Looks like the product description is updated, which is great. Now folks will know what they are in for when ordering this product (I was amongst those that selected these when they were advertised as 'heated, app controlled socks - selecting the three pack did not change the description).<br /><br />Lastly, would I buy more/recommend? -<br />I can't in good conscience recommend these socks. They are not at all expensive, but the use seems too limited to bother with."
3.0,"I am not very impressed with these bags. They look cute but after our first domestic flight, it has so many scratches and it’s not of good quality."
3.0,"Very Cute, but sizing runs smaller, i ordered a xxl, fit more like L-XL"
3.0,This dress is nice. Only thing I disliked is the material but it's still nice (wish it was more a linen material )
3.0,This shirt was really cute but the split for the tie came up much too high and the top itself was pretty short and I’m 5’3”. I wore a tank underneath but it still looked/fit odd because the tank was much longer than the shirt.
3.0,"Came pre set with the day, easy to adjust the time on these. Pay a jeweler 10$ if you need the any links taken out. Save yourself the hassle"
3.0,"After reading the reviews, I decided to go up a size since most people said it ran small. I should have ordered two sizes up instead. I typically wear a large in tops and ordered the XL, should have ordered a XXL. Too late to return since I washed it :(  I did hang it to dry, too."
3.0,"Really like the watch. Slim, light, and accurate. Barely knew it was there for the first 3 months. Then the band became worn at the clasp and started coming loose.<br />Would give 5 stars for the watch but subtract at least 2 for the headache of a watch band."
3.0,it did not fit well
3.0,These rings are nice.  However the opening where the bead goes is quite small. I had to use pliers to remove the ring.
3.0,"My husband loves this wallet, but after 7 months of use 2 of the screws that hold it together are missing."
3.0,Love the band but it did not stay secured on the one side and I had to replace it.
3.0,Material feels great. Would have liked it more if selves were not as ruffled
3.0,"So I am 5’3 ~200 lbs. I had bought the size XL because I saw someone who was roughly the same height and weight had the XL and LOVED it. Well it fits great EVERY WHERE but my stomach. It’s tight. It goes super high wasted, which isn’t bad. But also gives me horrible camel toe. But I am going to keep these in case I do lose weight this summer like I Plan but also order a set of XXL. I love the material AND it has pockets."
3.0,Should order 2-3 sizes larger than what you actually wear.
3.0,I just purchased them less than a week ago and after one wash some already have holes in them. They fit and feel pretty good though.
3.0,"It's a fun and attractive bracelet. The blue stones are the color of the most vibrant blue topaz. It will definitely be noticed on the wrist; however, the quality is about what you would expect for the modest price. I would recommend it as wear for costume jewelry, but it won't hold up well with time and wear. Definitely not for gift-giving."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:756ba95ed2ce0cf7efd8b10c021f53d7]] I like the material. I dislike that it didn't came with the loop on the end like the video show 😒
3.0,"I didn't want to rate these because it's all about personal preference.  I didn't like the style.  I like Bib's.  I wanted a pair that went just above the knees and perhaps because of my size, it's not available.  I will probably just take a current pair and cut off what I want and have them hemmed."
3.0,Love these! I gave them 3stars because of the length. I'm 5'9&#34; and they come to just above my ankle. Would love them to be longer
3.0,I actually love this built in the beginning but about three months and it started falling apart. Don’t waste your money
3.0,"It's a good looking top, but unfortunately did not work for me because I got it for running, and it's is way too big and flappy to be effective in action. Better suited for yoga or lounging around."
3.0,The print was great as well as the material but it is really small. I brought a large and it was more like a small.
3.0,"I was really excited about this high waisted bathing suit. The bottom fits perfect, but the top is somewhat too exact. The zipper won't stay up. I guess it is because I have broad shoulders. But other than that it's good"
3.0,"If your child is just starting to use glasses, I recommend something more difficult to take off. The straps can be easily taken off from the legs, and so can the ear stoppers. If what you’re looking for is cuteness, these are super cute!! The girls love them!"
3.0,The bodice is extremely small. Not made for someone with a bust bigger than a B cup
3.0,Very cute. But very dark blue. It looked more black so we had to return it.
3.0,The sizing chart is off on this. I should have stuck with my normal size but the pattern was pretty in both color options. Was too big which was not flattering.
3.0,It's an OK top. It is smaller than what i expected it to be and the knot wants to roll up a lot but the pattern is cute.
3.0,"They are fantastic quality...but they are a little heavy so I find them slowly slipping down my nose and it gets a little annoying, I've tried adjusting the nose piece but happens regardless. It sucks because I love the style and look expensive. I still try to wear them"
3.0,"Esperaba mejor calidad por el precio. La banda elástica en la parte de arriba es bien fina para quedarse en su lugar. Cuando me doblo se baja en la parte posterior. De lo demás, quizás un size más grande al recomendado sería mejor. Yo uso size 12 de pantalones y lo escogí x-large según la recomendación de Amazon. Es tiempo de bajar de peso así que no lo devolveré. Espero les pueda dar más idea de qué y cómo comprar."
3.0,this umbrella does not tilt and it does not come with an outside tie to tighten it close when folded.  I was disappointed.  I like the size of it; but I'm stuck with it.
3.0,Item is comfortable but 2 bands came in cut
3.0,I like it a lot but the orange it’snt true clemson orange. It’s really bright
3.0,They're not very comfortable
3.0,"A really heavy resin mask. The holes that are cut for the nose and eyes needed to be smoothed out as they had really sharp pieces sticking out.<br /><br />The head straps aren’t really all that good. They’re light and flimsy and if you try to adjust the fit, they come apart. Mine didn’t “break”, but it’s nearly impossible for me to adjust the fit."
3.0,The material itself is very thin and it's a cheap quality sweater and it runs on the  small side. and the colors are not the bright look in the picture and  doesn't look like the picture colors :(  at all
3.0,"fits good,good coverage,but the straps dig in after a couple of hours."
3.0,Bought this to experiment with the size. I am 5'1&#34; (126lbs) and it is way too small. would cost too much to return so will just give it to someone much smaller than I am
3.0,"First of all the color and trim on these glasses I really liked then the arm broke. It just came lose and fell off as I was reading. I tried to glue it back on where it broke but it just wouldn’t fit right. It broke where the metal trim met the plastic. It happened on both pair of glasses. I wanted to replace them but then I reasoned it would probably break on the new ones too. Very disappointed because they were pretty, lightweight and the colors I wanted. Unfortunately the second pair broke after the return date."
3.0,"The dress was very pretty, but there was no zipper or buttons and it was to small to put over the head."
3.0,"way smaller than espected, also thin"
3.0,"Wow, much smaller than I thought it would be. The pictures looks way better than the real thing……I mean, not bad for the price though."
3.0,This was shipped from china. I didn't know otherwise I would not have ordered. The material is cheap; it is too expensive for a Chinese bag.
3.0,"while I hate to tear down such an awesome display of badassery, you can't really see through them that well......like i wouldn't ride my bike with these.  So yea, you end up being the most awesome patriot at the party, but you constantly walk into stuff and step on children......"
3.0,Not for long torso or large breasts...the waist sits unnaturally high. I am a 34ddd and I will keep it because it was cheap...but not what I hoped for at all
3.0,The bag did not hold up well as an every day bag for vacation
3.0,"Ordered a large. This &#34;junior fit&#34; shirt is actually ADULT size. Tried to buy it for my 10 year old, but it is too big. I hope to return it."
3.0,"I ordered the burgundy with ivory polka dots and received a black one with red polka dots.  It’s very tight around the thighs and butt area, but the bodice fits ok."
3.0,Earrings are cute but two pair broke just from trying to put them on.
3.0,"I had this less than 24 hours when I pulled it out of my purse, & the head had snapped off & was dangling from the wires that make the light/sound. I was able to glue it back on & it still work, but I realized I can’t just stick them down in my purse too late. Also, the sound sounds like a dying horse."
3.0,This was supposed to be a charm for a bracelet. It ended up being much larger than I expected. I would probably use it as a keychain charm due to the size. The quality is good though!
3.0,I was expecting this to be a smaller size for my neck but it is a cute product
3.0,"I found it to be to short, but my daughter loves it."
3.0,"This is a very cute design, but the skirt is extremely transparent and I can tell already that the material of the bodice will end up pilling after washing a few times."
3.0,Infant/ toddler sized. Runs too small.
3.0,Love the style and looks of the dress. Turns out that even XL is too small for me. Going to have to return this dress for a larger size.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:4c08c83bb896f849e1b9f38e37de69d4]] Here is what I think:<br />The back looks the best with this dress.<br />The front fit is a little awkward.<br />Sizing can be tricky.<br />Some extra work still needed to size and slim it.<br />It has nice material.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)
3.0,Me encanto muy bellos pero solo me duro 3meses pierde el color
3.0,These were too small and too narrow.
3.0,"It's too small for his high quality sunglasses. I thought I had the size right, but he loves the cleaning cloth and is keeping the box for a future pair of glasses. It's a very sturdy box and will keep a favorite pair of glasses safe."
3.0,Returning it. I got a M but it's more a S or even XS. There is no stretch to the fabric and no elastic in the waist. It has a zipper so there's no room for variable sizes. I see other reviews mention elastic so they're not all made the same. The top is too small as well. I will say it's nice to get a pink that's a true pink and not salmon. It also is a nice length. I'm 5'4&#34; I could wear heels and still have it reach the floor.
3.0,This hat isn't adjustable. Larger than expected.
3.0,"At first glance looks like a good product but 2 of them broke from the plastic that is used for tightening. One of them didn’t even last a day. They were still usable, so that’s why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1."
3.0,"I'm sure if you have watches design for a band like this, it'll work great. I tried it with my Casio which has spring loaded pins. It would work for a while, but then a pin would snap out and shoot off into oblivion never to be seen again. Partially my fault, I just thought this band would work with all watches. Just a fair warning --- it doesn't."
3.0,decent boots but the front narrows so much that the seams press against my toes and I can only wear them about an hour&#62;
3.0,Bought this for my daughters mermaid birthday party. She loved it!  Sad to say it lost its color with only two wears.
3.0,"If you are looking for key bag with regular size key, this bag is enough to have but if you have customized or oversized keys or even car key and key fobs then this is way too small for those keys, it won’t be able to hold it in plus some extra cards!"
3.0,Misleading this is not 925.
3.0,"The chains get twisted VERY EASY and it's pretty annoying to constantly have to untwist.( I'm a little OCD when it comes to twisted chains) The different layers are all attached to one hook so while there might be different layers, it's only one necklace. Otherwise, they are perfect additions to the wardrobe for any occasion"
3.0,Not as nicely made as it appears. I have extra lg top an small bottom. The bottoms are way to big while the top is too small.
3.0,Got this for my son who is a huge LOR fan..but the map is of UK and NOT middle earth
3.0,fabric is see through
3.0,"Usually I wear a medium. But these were too big in medium. I have ordered a small pair also. I can wear them, because they have a drawstring."
3.0,"I didn't like the fabric, but it's comfortable"
3.0,"Fit was true to size, color (tan) was true, but the point of the lapels go all the way out to the shoulder seams on the arms of the jacket.  Unusually large lapels just weren't for me, but rest of jacket was lovely."
3.0,"To be honest, it's kinda cheap looking, but it served the purpose of allowing my daughter to be the Michelle Pfeiffer version of Catwoman, which she insists is the only real Catwoman. She's almost 5, and it was a little big on her. It is supposed to be for adults though, so I expected that. I can imagine it would probably be really tight or too small on an adult though."
3.0,Sizing not even close.
3.0,"My daughter thinks this is a tab bit short and the material is a bit shiny. I disagree on the shinyness of the fabric, but it is a little short on my 5'3&#34; frame. I boughta large size because I didn't want cling, rather Iw anted the skirt to flow. I made the right choice. I paid full price for this item, so this is an honest review. Some of the pictures accompanying the reviews show really tight skirts...not actually so it you buy it large enough to fit, Lol."
3.0,Cute pattern and the bag itself looks sturdy but the handle drop is NOT 10”. It’s 8” at best. Very disappointing! I can’t place this tote over my shoulder and that will drive me crazy. If it had long enough handles I would keep this bag. Am returning it tomorrow.
3.0,Well made and very pretty! Just waaaaay bigger than what I was expecting! Almost humorously bigger! lol
3.0,Very large sweater
3.0,The breast area needs more material. I have to wear a tank underneath and I wish the length was an inch or so longer because I have thick thighs and butt
3.0,Didn't feel good rubs between toes
3.0,The medium is a smaller fit then other mediums.  I will have to return for a large size for this item.  Really like the feel and style otherwise. The large fits better.
3.0,"The waist-to-thigh area of the joggers fit normally, even a little baggier than I would have liked, but the calfs were way too tight to be comfortable for me, (6 foot, around 135lbs) also they looked kinda weird on me because of that, and I don’t have freakishly large calves or weirdly skinny thighs or anything like that. I gave them to my partner who is slightly smaller than I am and they fit fine for them though so it’s whatever"
3.0,U may need TWO sizes up on this one! It's cut small and has absolutely no stretch
3.0,"Update: ordered a second one and they sent it with one side missing.  Disappointing they would send out an obviously defective item.  Nice little keychain, foil design is bright and much better in person than the pictures.  I ordered a second one for my spare set."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:d966b49c3c05059b04b8c8ad53e40158]] It comes in a silk black tiny bag. The rings look like the picture and are very shiny. Sadly after 1 week of using them they do become rusty and darker, but you get what you paid for"
3.0,"At first glance they look good, but as soon as you pick them up you notice how cheap they are. I guess I already expected that for the 8 dollars. They fit nice but I hate the clasp, it's really hard to get open and close. I'm literally writing this review while trying to get the clasp to unhinge off of my nose."
3.0,It's a comfortable shirt however do not put in dryer even though it says you can.
3.0,They fell apart after a handful of uses.
3.0,The gloves didn't keep my hands as warm as I was hoping and the finger touch did not work as well either and I would have to take off the gloves in order to use phone.
3.0,Thought there would be more padding but nope!
3.0,"It looks great, but scuffs easily on the underside of the wrist.  Was able to adjust the size easily. Have received several compliments on it."
3.0,"A button fell off as soon as i opened the box, but other than that I liked the outfit it, however I ordered my size and it was too small so I would say order a size up from normal"
3.0,"I ordered small and it fits like a large. The feet are very thin, so don't keep very warm. It works though but will have to find something different for next winter."
3.0,Loved the product...just ran very small
3.0,It bends and it’s for a very small wrist
3.0,Does get foggy...tested on slopes...
3.0,"These are luxurious, feel incredible and boy do they have an amazing stretch factor. For reference; 175cm tall, 77kg, 82cm waist, 58cm top of thigh, 96cm hips, 79cm inseam and US men's size 9.5 foot. I could have easily been taller and/or bulkier and they would have still fit great.<br /><br />3-stars because while I do really like these, they started falling apart as soon as I removed them from the package. This is the second pair like this to do the same thing in the same place. I still wear them until they cannot be worn, but they should at least hold up to a few wearings before they start falling apart, right? Rhetorical question, of course they should.<br /><br />Like I said, I do really like these, but I'm torn...oh wait, so are the hose. :("
3.0,Too short. You lose about a 1/4 of an inch.<br />Update: I started using paper tips and that fills the gap. they work perfectly now. It was my fault I didn’t check the dimensions or read the reviews. Hope this helps anyone else who did the same thing.
3.0,"The mask is very nice. Fabric is breathable, design is quality. But the adjustments hurt the back of your ear after a while. I tried loosening them and that just makes the mask fall off my nose when I talk. Should have just used slightly short elastic bands instead of doing the adjustment part."
3.0,It's not a woow type  of gift its just something. I think I was expecting it to be much more them it was.  You can tell it's not too high quality.  So a bit cheap
3.0,"It seems like it should be a great idea, but after wearing the harness on my belt for a few hours, it had rubbed a raw spot into my side."
3.0,"Short was a bit small, but the shorts fit nice. I’m 132lbs, 5’2. I am busty so maybe that’s why it was a bit snug, but my arms felt like the hulk on it. Nice color and good cotton feeling material (not shiny)"
3.0,The shirt is really cute only Problem is after one wash the shirts faded and looks really old already
3.0,Turned my ear green!
3.0,"Very pretty, but only 1 ball screws off the bar. This wouldn't be an issue except the ridges in the middle of the bar won't allow the bar to push through my ear. Very disappointing, as I would love to wear this someday. Am I the only one with this issue? Or is 1 ball supposed to be permanently affixed to the bar? Doesn't seem right to me..."
3.0,The item works if your shirt is long enough to have a button below the belt line. I'm a bit taller so this has been a problem
3.0,"Needs a thin pad to keep foot from sliding. But they are a nice looking  boot, not too comfortable."
3.0,I bought these for my wife as a present and she said they pull apart too easily but she liked them aside from this.
3.0,Material was good but I’m 5”4 and 130 pounds and ordered a large and it seemed a little tight.
3.0,Wish the chain was longer but it is so dainty and pretty
3.0,"I loved the ring; the stone fell out the first time and I was able to fix it. The second time not so lucky. It fell out and yep, its gone."
3.0,"I was thrilled at the price of this purse, as I don't like paying huge prices for a handbag. If I'd written this review when I first received it, it would be five stars, b/c it is an absolutely beautiful purse. The detail on the outside and the charms that hang are classy and pretty. I got countless compliments on it. However, after about a month of use, most of the charms had fallen off, and the material in the outside pocket had come apart at the seams, so that I had to cut the material out b/c I was losing my stuff through the holes. Also, I'd like to add that I am a person that is typically very easy on stuff. My handbags usually last a year or so, and this is roughly the same amount that I spend on any handbag. So very pretty, but not conventional, it just won't hold up. I'm now looking for another new purse, when this one should still be my 'new purse.'"
3.0,"I purchased these shoes looking for comfort and to alternate something &#34;summery&#34; and cool with my Brooks sneakers (which get hot and are not much of a fashion statement when worn with more casual clothing and/or dress clothing). These shoes are comfortable, hands down. However, they are very bulky and have a huge toe box. They look too big on me, yet the length is okay. They definitely are meant to wear with socks, which I was trying to avoid for summer wear. When wearing without socks, the insoles are kind of rough. When wearing with the rubberized insoles sent with them, my feet stick to them and curl the insoles. I would like to see Orthofeet create a &#34;summer shoe&#34; that is this comfortable, but a little less &#34;orthopedic&#34; looking!  I will probably eventually purchase their tennis shoe when I need another pair because of the comfort and socks will be worn with them. It would also be nice for Ortho to send a removable fabric insert that can be laundered and reused, so this style could be worn comfortably and sanitarily.  The 3-star rating based on excellent comfort, but bulkiness fit, weight, and appearance."
3.0,Everyone is heading back to the office I needed some cute shirts and blouse is the right fit to wear with everything. The fabric is nice and soft but it’s a little cheaply made the crisscross is it’s open underneath your breast but he covers her so you can’t see it but you know it’s there.
3.0,Beautiful but runs very small!
3.0,It's ok. Rolls up very easy. Probably wouldn't purchase again.
3.0,The image is of a sportsbike with a full face helmet. Received a cruiser with an open face helmet.  It still a nice keyring but not what I ordered.
3.0,"Way too big... I usually wear medium, but it said to order 2 sizes bigger. They were huge!!!"
3.0,They didn't work for me but were great quality
3.0,O didn't know that I had to purchase a brick which is a energy supply. They were gifts but other than that they work fine.
3.0,"These worked fine when I first purchased them a year ago. I use ps4, PC and phone and it seems like the glasses don't work as well as they use to. To me. It could just be my pair. Great price tho."
3.0,"Love the design, fabric and inner liner are very nice and comfortable. However, this will only fit children, teens and smaller adults (women, smaller men with narrow faces) as the mask part is smaller and the elastic does not stretch anywhere near enough to fit a large adult male. Had to request a refund, as Amazon would not allow a return for sanitary reasons."
3.0,"Based on the pictures, I thought this romper was so cute and striking. Once it arrived, I was slightly disappointed by the tackiness of the fabric. I knew it was polyester, which I actually like, however the quality of polyester was cheap. Also the bandeau portion was thin and ran large. I will have to make adjustments to make it work. I do like the color combination and the fit isn't terrible other than the top being a bit too large."
3.0,The engraving is hard to read. I think thought the font would be more bold. But it is very thin and light which makes it hard to read. It also says it is adjustable but I dont know how to do it
3.0,Way too hot.
3.0,"I’ve been meaning to write this for a while. One of them turned a dark greenish color inside and out stains the sock in that boot green but not as much anymore.  I scrubbed the hell out of them and it looked blackish grey when wet and not as noticeable and then started to come back. I even wiped it down with some bleach on a rag hoping it wasn’t fungal or something but it did nothing.  No smell or anything to it.  My buddies still swear there is someone walking another green and black boot pairing in that I accidentally switched one with someone else but I only need them a dozen times a year and if they’re not on my feet, they’re in the truck.  They keep my feet dry and these things aren’t for a beauty pageant AND the price was right so it hasn’t bothered me too much - just weird! I’ll give them 3 stars for that."
3.0,Warm but only for a short time. Size runs big also.
3.0,"I saw this advertised online and decided to give it try.  The concept is great, but it felt kind of small around my mouth.  I felt somewhat constricted.  Unfortunately, it did not work so well for me.  However, it is a good quality product.  Lightweight and soft, jut too small."
3.0,"The dress ran large and the only sleeve was very baggy.  The lace part was pretty wrinkled from the shipping envelope when it arrived so I pressed it out and discovered it was see-through!  Maybe the wrinkles are there for a reason??  Had to buy &#34;nude&#34; undergarments to hide my unmentionables.  In a nutshell, the dress needed to be altered but when it was tailored to my liking it was nice for the price as long as there is added coverage underneath."
3.0,I was disappointed in the box that it came with. I have bought pretty of jewelry on Amazon and this didn't compare to some of the others. I don't hate it or love it yet. When I put it on I felt like it doesn't hang right. I feel like it keeps pulling to the side since the teardrop is so big. The ones in the pictures look perfect but mine does not. It is pretty so hopefully after wearing it all day tomorrow I will love it
3.0,As soon as I washed it the length went from just right to a little shorter than I like.
3.0,"I ordered the blue color and received light blue. They sent me a replacement which turned out to be another light blue. Now I don't have the option to get the blue in my size which is very disappointing and frustrating. Besides that the skirt fits well and is good quality I just wish they sent the right color. The buttons do jingle as you walk, which i could see becoming annoying."
3.0,The only thing tht I can think of right now tht I do not like about this product is tht the battery life SUCKS! BUT I  still like it😊
3.0,"Good band for good price. Disappointed that I did not receive my Pin Punch, and when I realized the band holder is the same width all the way around"
3.0,"The dress was stunning. I really loved it.  However, although it fit at the bust and waist, the back of the dress didn't fit properly, and I had to return it."
3.0,No es mi estilo
3.0,"For as expected but not cute in person, I will probably upcycle it."
3.0,The ties on the side could have been longer
3.0,For walking<br />Working out<br />Way too big
3.0,"It's a cute idea, but I had to pull it up to my ribs to make it fit. I'm a size 14 and 5'6 and it fit ok, but it definitely does not sit on your waist by any means. Bummed because the pic makes it look so cute :("
3.0,"They are lightweight and very thin, if you dont have multiple holes in your ears it kinda looks like your not wearing any earings"
3.0,"Ordered a small and it did nothing. Exchanging for an xs, so we'll see... I weigh 119"
3.0,Not compatible with fitbit sense
3.0,"They are cute, but not comfortable to wear.<br />(+3) stars for - sparkle factor, cute factor....and that they do not irritate my ears.  I have very sensitive ears even with silver and gold earrings, but  these do NOT itch, make my ears get hot,  or get icky.<br /><br />However, (-2) for the fact that the posts are so long that they keep poking me.  And that they come out too easily, the screws are maybe a tad too big for the posts. I have had to look for them on the floor several times so I finally just took them off to save myself the aggravation."
3.0,I love this Keychain except I have to put it back on the ring. My son loves it so I keep fixing it. Maybe make the chain stronger. Otherwise it's super cute.
3.0,"Magnet pretty strong, it's easy to adjust the length while you're wearing it, however it snags a lot as another reviewer said, and after over 1 month of use the band has discoloration already as shown in pic I posted here."
3.0,Did not fit right and only a small percent of the return is refunded barely enough for shipping. Good material
3.0,"Great product, but I ordered two and only received one. Item was delivered on May 20th. I am very doubtful the second one will be shipped. Disappointed!"
3.0,"I had very high hopes from this dress,  I was however disappointed with how it fits.  It is very short but I must say it is very sexy.  I had no other problem with it. I would definitely recommend this dress.  I am a medium so i would recommend buying a size or two up"
3.0,Like if bit a little small.
3.0,Yoga pants are good quality but run somewhat small.  I am not a large person but have more than average curves.  The pants worked out well for my daughter and was able to keep the yoga pants even though their purpose was for me.
3.0,This headband is okay. I thought it would have a little more weight to it from the picture but it's just a thin paper like headband with a strap. I don't think it will last very long.
3.0,fits more like a 7.5.  I purchased a 7.  Too flat.  I will try an inner sole for comfort and a better fit.
3.0,"I would give these beautiful lightweight earrings 5 stars if they had arrived unbroken. The style is elegant and beachy without being cheesy. They are plastic but they look much more expensive. As for the ""broken"" issue... One earring was fine - but the other needed repair. The pearl/post section had become unattached from the two shells. Basically the ""O"" ring had opened up. I used to make jewelry so I had the tools (ie 2 pairs of small pliers) to fix this so I repaired everything and I kept the earrings. Can't wait to wear them :)"
3.0,I like the style and the fit but  these 'brown' glasses are black.
3.0,the polka dots are disappearing :(
3.0,Will help with the glare. However was hoping for a better removal of glare.
3.0,"Very stiff, which I expect will resolve over time.  My only real complaint is that the tongue is not tapered at all and makes it difficult to thread through the loops on some of my pants."
3.0,"Ordered this almost a year ago still haven't used it. It seems a bit tricky. My big problem with this is you have to purchase two. Because one doesnt work,<br />unless i'm doing it wrong. So if you are like me that likes simple things don't order this lol."
3.0,This blouse has some cute details but an odd fit. The fabric is stretchy and silky. The dotted blue is pretty. I am partial to v necks. The ruchung tends to emphasize rather than camoflague flaws. The shoulders are to wide and Ihave broad shoulders. The blouse feels snug around the abdomen. The bell sleeves are cute but the abbreviated length is awkward. Potential not realized.
3.0,"It's a little tight, but super cute"
3.0,I intend to use this cute little dress around the house during the summer hot season.  I don't think I will wear it out and about because it is not of the quality for that.
3.0,"I ordered up in size because I have a large bust, but then the bottom area was way too big. VERY cute suit though, just made for women with smaller busts."
3.0,Beautiful but had to return. Too large for my face
3.0,So all in all I'd say it's well made and you pay for what you get...however the ribbon it comes with isn't exactly sturdy stuff...id suggest upgrading...even so I ordered a 6xl as a man who normally wears a 2 xl for a Halloween outfit...it worked but just barely
3.0,Cute. Just too big in the wrong areas 😁
3.0,"It’s a cute comfortable dress, fits true to size but I was disappointed when I realized both pockets had holes in them because the seam was not closed.  I’ll sew it shut myself but I didn’t pay to do that."
3.0,"Belts come straight WITHOUT a bow! You have to figure out how to create the bow-tie shown in the picture. I resorted to watching YouTube videos so that I could figure it out. However, depending on how big you want the bowl there’s not enough belt length left to create a nice bow-tie. Also, if there’s any tension on the belt then it unravels pretty quickly, so it would be better to go at least<br />1-2 size bigger than you would normally buy.<br /><br />On a positive note the thickness of the leather is good quality. So definitely great for the price!"
3.0,Very tin
3.0,The picture looks like cardigan but no buttons in front.I sew by myself.Anyway I like the color.
3.0,"This fleece lined pull over is ok for the off-brand it is. Cut on side seams bulges out where pockets are located so material is added to the hip area on both sides--instead of a straight hem it bulges outward on both sides. The bottom hem looks fine in the pics on the model but looks too thick and clunky/sloppy on. I paid $31 for the garmet and that's a fair price as it is soft and warm. However, from now on I think I will strive to buy gently used, high end brands when I really need something, especially warm clothes."
3.0,"When purchasing, you’re going to want to go up at least two sizes from what you’d normally wear when ordering. These shorts definitely run small and you’ll save yourself a lot of time returning and exchanging shorts trying to get the right fit. Also, like many products designed to hold your phone during activities, if your phone is in one of the heavier, impact, water resistant cases, the pocket will be to small to accommodate your phone."
3.0,"Very thin material, fits fine, belt is cheap, but its super hot in my state right now and the dress came with out a packet to absorb the moisture and the dress was in a plastic bag and it had mold on it"
3.0,Even though the material is doubled you can still see all the way through it.
3.0,"I think this is a nice swimsuit. But I don't think it works with my body type. I'm curvy with 34dd and smaller waist and thicker thighs. I am only 5'6 but my torso is long and legs are short. I love boyshorts and thought this was super cute. It actually stretched to fit in the chest. So I think it would fit most breast size up to DD in the size small or medium. The problem is my torso is loong plus my chest. So it pulled in the front and back too much. If I went up a size, it would have been too big in other areas. And something about it just didn't work on my body shape. I think it would work better with someone with a normal to short torso. It's worth giving it a shot. Just didn't work for me."
3.0,"Was cute, but didn't last long... Slipped off my toe in the Caribbean."
3.0,"(ignore bad sunburns). This bra has a really good stick to it, but it folds in the middle - maybe I need a smaller size? I just got my chest sized and I'm apparently a 34C but the C bra seems way too big. I'm returning it and might get a B cup or I might get another bra."
3.0,"The clamp is very durable and easy to use, but the actual wire on the ""ring"" is already starting to fray after a few weeks. It's not just aesthetics-- I found out it was fraying because one of the stray wires stabbed me when I picked up my keys! Not great."
3.0,it will break easy
3.0,Very delicate and easily bent. I may have to exchange them. It would be nice to have a fine next to the photo to compare size. Much smaller than anticipated.
3.0,"Super cute hat, great color, and well made! The problem; just too big.  The smaller size was such a price jump that I went without."
3.0,"it has paddings inside, however it is a bit small<br />and because you tie the neck and also the back part, it might be easy to untie and open"
3.0,"It looks just like this, but there are actually small underwires that dont fit.....quite right."
3.0,"The shoe laces are made with Kevlar, but after 1 day of use one lace is fraying, must be a bad one! we will see how the other one holds up the rest of the week before I give them a thumbs up or down."
3.0,Seems to be for a tall person.
3.0,"The quality of the hat is fine, but the embroidered bee patch was poorly put. It’s a pretty cheap patch that was clearly ironed on poorly."
3.0,It’s so big and sags at the top I hate it!!! I spent a lot of money to have it sit on my shelf. Disappointing.
3.0,The dress is nice but runs small and it's too short. I didn't want to return it so I cut it into a blouse instead.
3.0,The shorts were fine but not to my husbands liking.
3.0,A little tighter than I thought they would be. I don't have a big head 7 3/8th hat size.
3.0,Fabric was cheap and zipper was very cheap.  I would of kept if I though I could wear it more than once.
3.0,"Necklace was too tight around my neck. Will have to add some links to it. But other than that, it's a nice necklace."
3.0,"Unfortunately this hat is too small for my head, I do want to add that I don't have a huge noggin, normal sized with medium length hair. The main part that bothers me is the depth/height of the cranium part of the hat; It's kinda like the hat version of high-waters.<br /><br />This hat is better sized for women or kids, but for men, this hat is gonna be a hit or miss. I have a strong chin, and a strong neck, and me wearing this hat (low height, narrow bill/brim) makes me look like a pineapple.<br /><br />It's a shame because the color is awesome, It's just that it's small, flimsy and the brim is quite narrow."
3.0,"The camera has a tendency to tilt when mounted on a headband, and it doesn't help that the headband puts your camera at a strange angle to begin with. I had issues with my forehead blocking part of the shot as well, but your mileage may vary,<br /><br />On the other hand, as far as I know this might be the only way to mount a Contour camera on your head without wearing a hat or helmet, so if that's what your looking for this might be your best bet."
3.0,"I love the fit, the color, the light weight fabric (perfect for spring), the way they roll up and stay up for walking through the surf, and, of course, the comfort.  However, and this is a big however, they came smelling strongly of chemical.  Not a big deal, I thought, since I know that some fabrics are treated with pesticide, but, after three washings they still smell strongly of chemical.  This was not the case with the bootcut indigo Pajamajeans that I ordered previously.  I hope that this was just a fluke with this one pair, because I would like to go on ordering this product, but not if they are going to hang onto this smell!"
3.0,Yet to wear
3.0,The tshirt already looks like it’s been worn for years. I bought it few days and expected it to last for atleast few months.
3.0,Dislike that they tend to fall off face or hat while leaning forward.
3.0,"Love the look of the glasses, and comfort but the nose pad came out after one month of wearing.  :("
3.0,"I ordered these thinking I would figure out what all the fuss over lularoe was about.  Since these are made with the same blend of material, I decided to try them.  They're just ok.  I'm not all that impressed.  They're soft, but not something I'm going crazy over."
3.0,These are smaller than I expected. It's time to keep a measuring tape by my computer.
3.0,"My package color was not the same as ordered, one was a light purple which was pictured as gray;  plus the stitching was not done well. The fabric is thin and good for what I need it for. I usually wear a small for regular a top but ordered a large which fits like a medium. Great for wearing over a  top for cool morning walks.  I took the advise of other reviews."
3.0,They look cheap. You get what you pay for.
3.0,"A little too large, especially if bought for a child."
3.0,"The elastic broke the first day we got it. Even though that was a pretty easy fix, they are of not of the best quality. They also don't cost a whole lot, so if you just need some play shoes for your kiddos go for these. But if you're looking some shoes that will last them, I suggest finding a different pair. But they really are fine for play shoes."
3.0,It was to wide from the hips. I would've love the dress with no seem on the waist.
3.0,"The boots are cute, but they fit right on my feet should have ordered one more size bigger..."
3.0,Had to sit it outside to air out. The smell was awful. I’ve used it once and it was okay. Nothing special.
3.0,Cute if I were a trendy teeny bopper. Cheapish looking for an adult.
3.0,It was cute but was alley which I didn’t realize or like and it was way too small
3.0,The Hooodie looks much warmer in the picture but is actually pretty light.  It was very expensive and I expected a much thicker fabric.
3.0,Item was more for fashion than actually being useful as sports equipment.
3.0,"I have purchased several Elvis costumes, and this was the best looking with material that looked and felt like spandex.<br />Too bad that the Chinese tailors based the design on their body style because the inseam was perfect, but the chest size was so small that I could barely get the top portion to go over my arms.  The result was after one wearing, it had to go as the seams in the armpits split.<br /><br />Properly proportioned, this costume would be great.  I have since looked for other Elvis jumpsuits with this material, but have not found any for less than $500.<br />If you are quite a bit skinner than my mature body, upper body is shorter than your chest size would suggest, than this could be a great costume for you."
3.0,"Soft fabric, nice for sleeping but runs a size smaller."
3.0,"I usually wear small or medium. For this one, medium feels like you have an extra small. Also you can’t wear the t shirt out because of the side tag is way to big, looks weird...so I wear the t shirt I side my jeans to hide the side tag."
3.0,I ordered an XS and it was a tent on me! I read that other reviewers cut the bottom ruffle layer off and immediately saw why — so after I promptly cut that off and washed it — this dress became a cute tunic. It’s now too short to be a dress but I love the fabric enough to keep it. 3 stars because the fit is so massive and not true to size.
3.0,"Didn't like how it hung, but it was well made and the material was nice."
3.0,Very thing material but comfortable. Not see thrue.
3.0,2x for teens maybe.
3.0,"I love this suit! I just wish it fit me better. I wear medium 8/10. I’m a 36DD. I bought the XL, which is the biggest they carry at the moment. The bottom fits and I could probably even get away with the L. The XL top is too small for me. It covers my girls enough to not get me arrested, but it’s not remotely supportive or full coverage. I’m keeping it because it’s so cute and would wear it in an adult environment, like a Vegas pool, but certainly not for a family/kid pool day."
3.0,"The stone is beautiful, but the chain is so delicate, that the necklace wouldn't lay flat. We replaced the chain with a box chain, and now it is gorgeous!"
3.0,"I’ve had a few Maxx sunglasses and am familiar with their quality which is typically kinda cheap and lightweight but they look good and price is well, cheap. And these are also definitely “light weight” but feel lower quality than usual which is actually ok. In the past I’ve just keep buying them bc I don’t wanna lose or break a $100 pair of whatever’s. But these Maxx’s fit very loose. The arms don’t hug your head behind your ears so they flop around a bit and I wear all my sunglasses on my head a lot and these won’t stay put.  I wouldn’t buy them again but would give another Maxx style a try just to see if the entire brand is that way now or just this style. Hope this helps."
3.0,Good quality shorts. They are just a little short for my taste.
3.0,"It's okay for women with smaller breast, for me was to tight on top- acros where the lace is. Need to return."
3.0,The pictures make it look really fantastic. For the money tho..if you don't get it wet and be really tedious..you could get some usage out of it.
3.0,"I bought the 2t-4t according to the package sizing and the fact my daughter usually wears a 3t. She’s around 30lb and 38 in tall. I wish I had sized up more, she may be able to wear this less than a year before we have to get a new one. The material is nice. It’s a very basic, black leotard. Just wish I had sized up more."
3.0,Beautiful dress but it runs super small.  I sized up as others said and still it was way to tight.  I would go up at least 2 sizes.  I will have to return it unfortunately.
3.0,"I ordered two of these dresses, one in a size small, one in a size medium (I'm usually between a small and medium).  Based on customer reviews, it seemed a small might fit, and based on the size chart, my recommended size should have been a medium.  But both were too small.. the small would not have zipped on, and the medium did fit but was too tight around the midsection (not in terms of just being unflattering, but in terms of being so tight I almost couldn't move or breathe!).  My measurements: 5'4"", 34 bust, 28 waist, 39 hip.  I would size up if I were you, but also note the straps are really long and may need altering especially if you do size up.<br /><br />Additionally, one of the dresses I ordered had a tear in the seam when I pulled it out of the package.  That concerned me about the stitching, and while I almost considered keeping the medium, I thought it wouldn't make sense to try and wear a dress that's too tight with poor stitching (especially since I planned to wear this dancing).<br /><br />Giving this 3 stars because it was gorgeous and would be flattering given the right fit, and I can't say for sure whether the stitching was really that fragile since I did not wear the dresses beyond trying them on."
3.0,"Very pretty shirt, and the overall cut is nice. But... SURPRISE!!! When you pay for a cheap shirt, you get a cheap shirt.  It puckers out at the underarms (I hand sewed some darts at the seams, so it looks better now), and I noticed after staring at it for a while that one strap is slightly wider than the other.  At least the fabric isn't quite as thin and shabby as I expected."
3.0,"Requested a smaller size, waiting to see when get deliver"
3.0,"Looked super cute, but didn't even cover enough of my upstairs to take an appropriate picture. Cups WAY to small, and suit not quite long enough. If you have DD cups or larger, it going to be like trying to fit your boobs  in child's training bra. Had to send back. I even ordered a size up."
3.0,Collar seems to go a little too high up on the neck.  I tried to go a little outside of my style norms with this shirt but I can't quite make it work.  It just doesn't look right.  Maybe if I were a bit more muscular it would look good but my normal 5'10&#34; 170lb frame looks kind of stupid in this shirt.  I returned this.
3.0,"I really can't complain for the price; however, it is cheaply made. I would not buy it again."
3.0,"The details and size of the bag are nice. The quality of the bag is not quite as expected.  Just after the first month, an exterior zipper broke and the trim on the handle started to come apart."
3.0,"I love the shirt but the sizing is just too far off. I'm 120 lbs and the small is swimming on me, making me look heavier than I am. I'm disappointed to return this, since there is no XS"
3.0,Untimely delivery. Wrong information about given; however product is great
3.0,"The dress is fitted for a tall person. Nice fabric, but it was way too long for someone who is 5 ft tall."
3.0,"I purchased this umbrella for a trip to London.  The canopy had a weird smell when I bought it, which faded. No sooner did I open it that it blew inside out with the slightest gust of wind. I was hopeful that water would run off the waterproof material, but I was still stuck toting around a dripping umbrella. Additionally the wrist cord fell off so I had to carry it in my hand. All this after using it 3 times for no more than an hour total. Disappointing."
3.0,"very cute, but pendant connection to chain is very flimsy. hope my flower girls don' t loose the pearls."
3.0,"Size up if you have any chest at all! I’m a pretty standard size Medium with a US 34G bra size. I got this in a medium and the top was So Tight and fit like an empire style with the drawstring sitting right under my bust. That made it look like a maternity dress, so I sent it back. Maybe if you have a small chest or size up it would look better."
3.0,The fit is great. Watch the die.  The Die from the pants rubbed all over my red purse.
3.0,the elastic in back causes an open space in the front of the dress and it's very short.
3.0,I’m 5’7” and 180 lbs in a Large and it’s about 3” off the floor. Returning it unfortunately waits is nice and the top elastic is tight enough i wouldn’t have been worried about it falling
3.0,Higher heel than expected. Not very stable around the ankle And also uncomfortable
3.0,"I like everything but the zipper being on the left side. Expect to have to replace that, but it'll work for wearing to the job."
3.0,The necklace was pretty however the image itself was difficult to see. Eventually able to see briefly
3.0,Won’t fit over nose piece of your glasses; but otherwise would work—seems they really aren’t intended for this- but slick marketing ploy!<br />Cute
3.0,"Nice product, good for 32f and above, not below."
3.0,Looks great on model but material isnt what i expected....
3.0,I like the look but the arm stitch was not even.
3.0,"Leather is too stiff to be comfortable in my opinion.Decent quality clasp and good fit but, just didn't form to my wrist. You get what you pay for!"
3.0,"I’ll wear them for a party or dinner, but they’re too heavy to wear for more than a couple hours"
3.0,I would have given this a higher star but the material is so cheap. The fit is great. Especially over the butt. Full coverage. The shape is also off as well. Very boxy looking. Also the bow comes out/off. Weird. I'm sure that will get lost if you don't see it on. But the full coverage won us so we will keep it. Not sure we would buy again.
3.0,I thought I was buying new slippers... turned out they were used ....
3.0,"This dress was absolutely beautiful, it came in a protective plastic zip lock like bag.  My daughter wore only ones for her baptism, as the hours pass by the dress slowly started to fall apart. A couple of the gems popped off, the zipper started to become stuck, and the bow which saftey pins on completely broke, it started to get loose threads.  This dress is exactly for what it's made for to wear on maybe one or two occasions get some photographs and that's it this is NOT a long lasting dress.  The fabric was soft and it did wash easily. That is why I am giving it three stars."
3.0,very attractive purse for women!! quality is ok with this price!! very cheap
3.0,runs small I would say. my daughter size is 13 and I ordered these but they run small. very nice shoes though just order a size up
3.0,"These Mysandy Vintage Square Sunglasses in my opinion are more feminine looking than masculine looking. They have a bit more shine to them than I typically wear personally, the holographic all along the edges definitely stands out the minute you go into some good sunshine. Not for me personally... But others may love them, just be aware."
3.0,I don't like the feel of the cheap plastic frame. Sorry!
3.0,"Good color, but doesn’t fit as expected"
3.0,This was a very nice looking bag but it was huge. The size wasn't clear from the picture. Needless to say I won't be using that bag. I am so sad about it b/c I really wanted a tinker bell purse from loungefly.
3.0,"Good purchase for the money, but washing once a week has faded the colors tremendously. The fit is a little small as well, so consider sizing up."
3.0,Received my purchase quickly as promised due to my Prime Membership. For $20 I did not feel the value and quality was worth it. It was a gift and I did not have any other choice but to give to the friend I had intended it for. Some of the writing on the front was slightly damaged. But did not have time to return and receive a different one. I probably would not purchase it again cuz I did not feel the price was worth the quality.
3.0,"If you have small ears (I do), then please read all reviews and be informed. These cuffs are not bendable, so you cant manipulate them into a customized fit. Good quality, and the color and designs are very nice."
3.0,I wear a large but it was cut to small. But I love the style and the color.
3.0,"This is going to be a gift for my five year old grandson. I loved the idea of dress ups for a variety of careers, but the fabric is so cheap I doubt they will last any time at all. Very disappointed."
3.0,Neck hole is so small I had to stretch it some to try to get it over my daughter's head. The dress also runs smaller in general.
3.0,"I am in love with cross body bags, and will NEVER carry another type of purse again. My hands are free, and the pockets are precisely where I want. look for cross body bags that have a strap long enough to hang correctly on my body. Too short a strap and I feel like I'm in a straight jacket.<br /><br />I carefully read the strap lengths listed in the Amazon descriptions. I ordered it because I couldn't believe the low price on this one. I like the color.<br />This arrived in an unbelievably small wrapper. I unwrapped it and hung it in my closet to puff up.<br />Honestly, I haven't used it because I LOVE my current Kipling Angie Solid Convertible Cross body Bag. I don't care that it costs 4x more!<br />This bag is &#34;just OK&#34; and I'll probably end up donating to our humane society thrift store and buy more Kipling bags."
3.0,the stem on this is to short
3.0,Great shirt.  Order a bigger size.<br /><br />My daughter is an adult XS in most tops.  I ordered a Small in this t-shirt and it's like spandex on her.  Order up at least a size or 2.
3.0,"The print is not as pretty in person, but it's a good fit."
3.0,Cute but poor quakty and very small..
3.0,"ORDER TWO SIZES UP OR MORE!!! It’s a beautiful shirt- feels great, fabric is soft not itchy etc etc but the shoulders are too small and I am not a big person. I have to keep pulling the one side down which is kind of annoying but product wise it’s wonderful just order up!!!"
3.0,Designs have a rough texture but is still pretty.
3.0,"I wanted to love this, but it's too large. I took a picture with side by side comparison of one of my other faux septum rings. It's well made, but too big, even for large faces. I could've avoided this if I had read the measurements."
3.0,Section of bricbrack not sewn to blouse. Wasn't<br />overly impressed.
3.0,"It's okay. The material is too thick, and makes it look bigger than what you are."
3.0,Too big I'm going to see how I. Can return them. They are really pretty but too big for my lobes.
3.0,"This dress seems to be a children’s size rather than adult. I was so excited to wear this dress but it was so small I could barely fit it over my chest. It was pretty form fitting all the way down, not flared like the photo shows. Even though I ordered a size larger than I usually wear, it was way too small for me. Pear-shaped girls beware!"
3.0,2XX was more like a large in size. A bit disappointing.
3.0,The leggings. Are extremely large... It also loss a star because of my package issues... Was late. And not actually delivered to the correct address... Luckliy i was able to get it from where it was from....
3.0,"I like the quality of the bag. That said, the strap is in a weird place which leads the bag to tip forward. It doesn’t sit right."
3.0,"I loved this watch so much. The seller (not sure it's the same) was excellent and sent an entire kit after the band broke. The Moon Phase design is almost nautical and gives a minimalist yet sophisticated aesthetic that truly is an awesome price/benefit ratio if you need something catchy on a budget. The leather band also broke-in quite quickly (despite actually breaking). The downside? It's cheap. Once you start to look into the watch face, you see that it's cheaply made with a bright white plastic ring on the inside being a dead giveaway (i think it's used to give a sense of volume/size in the case). IF they made that ring silver or blue like the face, it would change a lot. The weight is super light and the band will break if you work too much with it, so be mindful. Wish this design was made into a better made and more expensive model. I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Until then, it'll be a fun memory."
3.0,I gave this three stars because I ordered a 3x and it looks like a large.  Way to small and very short.
3.0,Not enough support - returned for smaller size but still to baggy in the tummy
3.0,Very thin. Runs a tad small
3.0,very flimsy super thin
3.0,"I bought this umbrella for my 9 yr old. The description says the umbrella is easy to open and close with little strength needed. My daughter couldn't open it at all.<br /><br />The umbrella has a button, but the button is only for closing the umbrella. There is a small plastic part on the umbrella that you have to hold on to while you grab the handle to pull so the plastic detaches from the handle. Even I struggle a bit with this part because it's a bit tricky. Once you get past that part, it does slide easily and requires only a little bit of strength to fully open the umbrella.<br /><br />I had to return the item since I am looking for an umbrella my child can use and if she can't open this umbrella on her own then there is no point keeping it."
3.0,"Overall I was impressed with the quality of this product (in part because I was expecting it to be pretty poor and was pleasantly surprised), but I didn't think ahead about the fact that my glasses would prevent the face shield part from coming all the way down in front of my face. You can adjust the shield (with some effort) to stick out further and make room for glasses, but at that point it's no longer really covering your breathing, which is the whole point. Even with my glasses off, the plastic shield part is a lot more ""in your face"" than I was anticipating, and not super comfortable. The shield part is also too short to really serve its purpose.<br /><br />Regarding comments that the plastic shield part is scratched or cloudy — there is a protective film/liner on BOTH sides that you remove when you get it. Looks fine after that."
3.0,Didn't look much like the pic  Pretty but VERY small. Get what u pay for
3.0,"This is cute jewelry. My son was thrilled to pick it out for his mom and wrap it up for Christmas. I think that’s super cute, and she’ll probably wear it because he got it for her. Overall, though, the diamonds are specks, the ring is very thin all the way around, and I question its longevity. The price is very inexpensive so it’s not a major loss, but I struggle to see my wife wanting to wear this frequently (and she doesn’t have a lot of super fancy jewelry)."
3.0,"I ordered the largest size available, but it is too small. I ordinarily wear a mens size 11  shoe. Other than that I like the shoe. I can get my foot in just barely. My toes are pressed up against the end of the shoe. Width is fine."
3.0,I hope I will like it. I purchased it for a trip to Isreal.
3.0,"These are VERY snug and somewhat sheer, so you can see someone's skin right through. I fear wearing these for too long could cause some blood circulation issues. That being said, I guess these gloves were worth the price (very cheap)."
3.0,These shirts run way small
3.0,Collar is small
3.0,Soft but a little snug around calf. I like a looser band.
3.0,These are cute and comfortable but if you walk any distance with them they will rub the back of your ankle
3.0,The look is sleek. Automatic watch with a clear glass back. Leather strap is cheap and substandard.
3.0,"I ordered a women’s small, looks to be more like a medium/large. No tag"
3.0,So i decided i should write a review since there isnt any...so they are worth 9.99 i would not say more...they are definitely cute the material is not thin....they are veryyy cheaply made and i will definitely NOT dry these...I may even hand wash them...not sure yet...im 5'7 they come to my ankles...all in all i wouldnt pay 9.99 for them but i am glad i have them...they also prob wont last long but its ok there cute now
3.0,"I'm not in love with these. The size is much smaller than expected (I'm roughly a 6 and ordered a medium) so in order to zip them I have to wear them higher than I'd like which isn't the most flattering. The material is cheap and very synthetic so they don't look very nice, even if they did fit properly."
3.0,Fabric was too thin. You could see my underwear through them. They were super soft but I wouldn’t be able to wear them.
3.0,"Now that spring is quickly coming to an end, and warmer summer days are just around the corner. It's time to bring out those light summer sun dresses. These Bohemian handmade beaded bracelet for women and girls by Ishvaku are perfect accessories to match and catch a few eyes while shopping or a stroll on the beaches. The colors are so vibrant, earthy, gold tree charms, tassels and snake-like creatures with lots of ""gold"" theme very much like those you see in Indian Bollywood movies, so if you're into Indian cultures such as many Yoga practitioners do, you will definitely love this beaded bracelet. ON the flipside, considering the price of this bracelet, I was expecting a lot more than when it comes to the QUALITY! Seconds after I put it on my wrist, one of the circular gold piece fell off. So, though it looks great but you've gotta be very careful. Excessive shaking, typical in Indian dancing, half of the beads would fly off the bracelet.<br /><br />In Summary, I recommend for the accessory to your wardrobes, but you've gotta very careful with it. 🙁🙁🙁<br /><br />💯💓💞Recommended with CAUTIONS🙁🙁🙁"
3.0,"You can't tell from the picture unless you're REALLY looking closely, but the top zipper is PINK. HOT PINK. I bought this for my son to carry around sports stuff in, but he won't use it because of the pink zipper. Other than that, it is a good bag."
3.0,"The color, shape, cut everything on that end is great and I love them however I am going to have to prep my ears before wear, possibly even go up (currently 5/8"") because they're just so large. Pretty bummed that I can't just pop them in as they look awesome."
3.0,"Purchased this thinking it was similiar to a bandana from different seller.  The camoflauge pattern is what drew me to this product, along with the less expensive price from other purchase.  The fabric was more of a poly/knit vs cotton and that didn't work for me.  I returned item with no problems.  Otherwise, it's a nice bandana."
3.0,Wind and Waterproof for sure.  Will keep you warm on its own down into the 40’s.<br />Based on the material and craftsmanship this could be a $200 jacket if Major Design Flaw hadn’t put the pockets on the back.  Only having those high pockets in the front is way more annoying than I thought it’d be.  Also if worn with just a short sleeve shirt the material in the upper sleeves will irritate your inner arms.  Was going to return it but have elected to fill the pockets with survival stuff and keep it in the trunk.  It would be great in an emergency.
3.0,Too long for shorties (5’2)
3.0,So far so good and pins haven't fallen off or straps breaking yet but is cheaply made.  But runs good so far.
3.0,The box came completely damaged and opened. The frames inside were in good condition though. Very cute and comfortable!
3.0,"They seem like an ok shirt, but run small. I usually were an XL ordered a 2XL wanting it a little loose, but it fits like a large and a smaller large at that, hope they don’t shrink"
3.0,"I think that is not an original coach slipper. I bought 2 Couch slippers from a known store in Lynnhaven Mall, the quality of material are not the same."
3.0,Cute dress but somewhat small. My teen daughter wears size small in all other dresses but this was snug.
3.0,It's cute.  I'm large breasted and I normally wear a 2xl.  I got a xxL... I have boobage poking out and a fat roll.  I need to lose some weight for it to look better on me.
3.0,I returned this because the top fit a size larger than the bottoms.
3.0,"Nice shirt, son liked it washed it only once si don't know how it will hold up."
3.0,"What I got was decidedly not a medium despite what the size chart says. But it's a great, ightweight coverup so I'm returning the medium for a large."
3.0,"I have to say that xl is not a 10 size, is much larger.  The design is weird and does not flatter your figure at all if you are fit. Also i found the material stiff and wrinkled. I am giving 3 stars being soooo generous but i will give it away. Dont want it over me."
3.0,"I like the concept of these but it is a little annoying to get your key fob in and out of these. You have to place your key inside the smallest pocket in order for these to work and it's a little bit of a hassle to get it in and out. If you have the patience, I'm sure this will be no problem for you."
3.0,After I purchased these sunglasses they are quite a bit larger then they appear on the website.
3.0,"Nice leather, great color, significantly smaller than it appears."
3.0,These are not knee high socks.  They re too tight at the top to go to the knee.  But they are cute and will work with my Halloween costume.
3.0,"Love my exspensive earrings for a very low price! im ready for more, im hooked, thanku amazon for saving my family money!!!!!!"
3.0,"Oder at least 2 sizes bigger than usual. Very pretty, nice material"
3.0,Ordered the light blue hat - and while it is lovely and soft - it  was not Beanie Ponytail Messy Bun I expected as it did not have a hole for ponytails or buns.  It was to be a Christmas present and time was critical so I did not bother to return it but ordered another from a different seller.  Not sure where the mixup occured but definitely not what I thought I ordered.
3.0,"The description says there is a pocket, but there is no pocket. Very disappointing!"
3.0,"It looked fuller in the picture, but it's my fault because the description does say light weight. If you fluff it right it's not too bad, but for $12 I would expect something a little warmer."
3.0,It runs pretty true to size but it’s not normal sweatshirt material. It’s more polyester looking and the design looks ironed on. Probably why it can’t go in the dryer per washing instructions.
3.0,They’re good for the price. The lens get very smudgy though. These block the sun pretty well.
3.0,"I can squeeze into the top just fine.  The panties weren't thongs as I was hoping - but I should have assumed I'd get one or the other of &quot;thongs briefs&quot; even though picture is thongs.  Panties were made for a child....a slutty child.  I mean,  I am 5'6&quot; and currently about 115lbs (I tend to fluctuate every couple of years it seems) and I could get the panties up (victory!), but it wasn't really cute.  Luckily the color isn't cream/bone colored - it's more of a true white.  I have other lacy thongs that could go just fine with it."
3.0,"The sleeve and bodice fit short... the sleeve fit at the elbow not below, tunic length, not even close to what is seen in the picture.<br />I liked the and fringe, the material was ok.<br /><br />I’m 5’8 and a medium build, and ordered a large if that helps anyone make a decision."
3.0,"I like them but not love them, they're really small, and the part that goes into 6our ear is really long. They look fine"
3.0,Cute but pockets in pants make you look like you have large hips
3.0,This item is not as expected. It is not a true no show sock.
3.0,This is a super cute hat but it really doesn’t stay on your head.  It’s sort of expected with these type of hats.  I used them for a game and it suited the purpose.  The kids loved them too.
3.0,Shorter than I hoped for.  Blackberry is BRIGHT purple.  Maybe will wear them next summer
3.0,"More faded black than black, which makes it look older than it is. I have a pair of Beyond Yoga leggings in extra small and small and both pairs tend to slide down a lot. They are very comfy but not too functional."
3.0,It looks like a mans shirt. It’s ok.
3.0,"This item will work to lift mask off the nose, etc. It runs small & I doubt it will work for larger faced people. The ?hooks? at the sides don't seem to work at all. The item will just have to sit inside the mask."
3.0,These are not the regular purofort boots. Much thinner than the originals. Not a huge fan but they are a good cheap backup boot
3.0,Size 8 was a fine fit around the palm but fingers were too short and the wrist band part was loose. Feels cheaply crafted with quality material.
3.0,"I purchased these for a long air flight.  They weren't as much compression as I'd expected but not so firm they cut off circulation.<br /><br />I think these are best for long sitting, but maybe something firmer on bad days or days when you're on your feet more."
3.0,"The body part fit fine.  It is the straps, they are set wide, and the arm hole area is really small.  Yes the straps are adjustable but if you loosen them then the top doesn't cover your bra.  Just a strange fit.  I wear mine under things so I can still wear them if I loosen the straps but I wouldn't expect a top to have to be worn as an undergarment just so it could be worn."
3.0,"The holes will bend over time, making it impossible to get a good fit for more than a few months"
3.0,"For the price it is great, I had to take it to my jeweler to have the side attachment pieces removed because they bothered me.  We ended up having to solder my ring to the now two other pieces.  My jeweler was awesome enough to do a temporary solder, in case I change my mind later.  I would have wanted to have that knowledge before buying the ring.  I am happy with it now, it just took some adjustments."
3.0,The buckle is way to big and heavy.<br />The belt does what it advertises but the buckle makes it look cheap.
3.0,I like it but I thought it was loose necklace- but instead its like a hard based choker-
3.0,I give them out as gift too small for their hands
3.0,These don't fit my face as well as I would like. They are narrow.
3.0,"I love this purse. Unfortunately the strap broke at the seams after 5 months of gentle use. I expect a purse that I buy to last for years, but I guess this purse just cannot hold up to that standard."
3.0,Did not cover my ears
3.0,Quality is good but they don't stay put...they tend to go down and everything gets caught...<br />Wore them for 1 day and now they're lost<br />But maybe it would work on someone else... maybe my ears lobes are weird...
3.0,Pretty but not enough
3.0,Cute fun for moms who have lost or had babies.
3.0,Not at all like the picture. Color is completely different and materiel is stiff.
3.0,Easy to wear and wash. It was also the perfect fit for MLO. But the seams at the side came off too soon. That's the only reason I am giving it 3 stars.
3.0,"Love the design, but runs big, I bought S and it looks like a Large on me"
3.0,They wear out quickly!
3.0,"Cons:<br />way shorter than expected (more like a bralette than a crop top.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Super soft<br />Comfortable<br />Thick enough that the white is t completely see through<br /><br />Overall these will still work for pjs, workout tops, or as layering tanks but I probably won’t wear them by themselves like I’d wanted to."
3.0,Runs big.. can’t keep it over my nose. I don’t have a small head/face either.
3.0,Flattering but it’s made of cheap material.
3.0,"This review is for the pink zigzag color block top. The fabric is a weird kind of stiff fabric, not supple like t-shirt, not soft like a sweatshirt either, just more of a slick stiff feel with not very much stretch. No pockets either. Sizing was fine, I'm 5'5"" and 150 lbs, the medium was fine. But because it was so stiff and kind of shiny, I'm sending it back, I'll never wear it.<br /><br />Note: I also bought the plain purple one, and I LOVE it. It's a thicker t-shirt fabric, supple and stretchy like regular t-shirts, with a rich color. LOVE it. I'll write a separate review for it."
3.0,"I wanted to give these a higher rating. They are quite comfortable. HOWEVER, after the first wash, I noticed a hole/the stitching coming loose around the waistband on one of the pairs. I didn't bother checking the other pairs, but I imagine it is something similar. I was going to buy another set, but not I'm reconsidering. This is disappointing."
3.0,"Seems like decent quality, way too small."
3.0,"Definitely too large for my almost 2 year old. Just slightly too small for my adult head, but I wear it anyways, because it's warm and nice looking."
3.0,It works but fits a small head. I bought it for my grandson and it was way to little so ended up giving it to my granddaughter.
3.0,Fabric is very clingy; fit is somewhat unflattering for plus size body
3.0,I thought the texture would be more canvas:(
3.0,"The product arrived in good condition.<br />It is comfortable to use and looks good.<br />Downside : Wears out easily. I've used it less than a month and somehow a hole appeared as though it got torn off.<br /><br />Other than that, everything else is good."
3.0,I was expected little longer but it wasn't. And I bought it one size bigger.
3.0,"Would not buy directly from Kenneth Cole again.<br />They did not want to return item. Also, I found same shoe at the outlet for $30."
3.0,"These socks are very comfortable, but they are made for a giants foot.  It fits enough on my foot but it is too large, and my feet are big."
3.0,I needed one with 3 hasps.  I probably didnt read or look at the description well enough but this is great for one hasp bra's I am sure.  But did not workout for me. I kept it though and will give it to someone that can use it.
3.0,I previously ordered yoga pants from Fengbay.  I loved this brand.  I was disappointed in these yoga pants.  Material was thin and not as well made as above mentioned yoga pants.  I would not order from this manufacturer again
3.0,The size says 6-12 months. They size is a little awkward on both of my twin girls. Some parts are a little snug while the length of the sleeves are long. I found the material does not stretch easily while putting it on.
3.0,I like the color and the many pockets but i wish it were  just a little bit wider
3.0,Cute but caring instructions says to HAND WASH! Really?? I have never had a robe or cover up that I had to wash by hand! Had I known i would not have ordered.
3.0,Recommend if you have wide feet.  Next time I will refine my search for narrow or slim fitting for my foot.
3.0,it is easy to bring with you but it too”slim” that you can’t put too stuff in
3.0,Again these run small.
3.0,Made in China so buy a size or two bigger. I was able to find the same top made in the USA that fit way better.
3.0,Loved the dress but WAY to small...
3.0,Didn't know jacket didn't have zipper.  More description needed!  Also didn't look that warm.  Thank you anyway.  It was returned.
3.0,"Great looking shirt, im a 2X but it fits like a large. ..."
3.0,Not very Polaroid. Still get the occasional glare in direct sunlight. Would not recommend.
3.0,"Runs small in size. Very soft leotard, but stitching not so soft, which is what we were hoping for."
3.0,They're really cute but they don't quite cover my booty ... but then there's a lot of it. Cute it you don't mind low rise pants
3.0,Thought it would be more of a flared bottom but it's fitted. It's hearts not flowers. And fits a little snug. Still cute but not what I expected
3.0,Kinda disappointed
3.0,"Doesn't look like the picture. It's ok, but not worth what they're charging."
3.0,It changed colors after a few days
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:9c528a8972b2023815caf1b74df3f53d]] They recommend a large for me but it is a bit smaller then shown for sure, not loose. The large fits like a medium for me. I will spare you the photo. Fits snug. I will be keeping it because I'm loosing weight and will be able to fit into it once I reach my goal weight. Over all not happy with it being smaller but happy enough with it to keep it."
3.0,This item was returnable when i purchased it last week...just got around to trying it. It's slightly huge.<br />Good quality item overall. As described.
3.0,I wear a large in  Charlotte Russe and I ordered an extra large in this sweater I had to stretch it out to even get it to look like the neck on the model.  It's also short not even close to being as long you would have to order two sizes larger than your normal size for it to be oversized sweater
3.0,Natal has strong Hard grasp
3.0,It’s for a Halloween costume so I didn’t expect stellar quality it’s ok. Packed well and came in time. I wouldn’t wait too long because it sold out quickly last year and then it doubled in price closer to Halloween.
3.0,Top fits great but the bottoms aren’t even remotely close. I got a 2T for my daughter and the keg holes were huge and it was hanging off her butt.
3.0,Like it but it’s super thin and see through. But i don’t care bc I plan to wear it at the beach with a bathing suit underneath
3.0,"Es muy pequeno, pero buena calidad"
3.0,Runs extremely small. I had to order a 3X instead of XL.
3.0,Cute in the picture but its not that flattering on. Good chest and butt coverage but the fabric is kind of stiff and cheap. The bathing suit also came with Shein tags... they have the same one on their website for $13.
3.0,Arm holes are a bit gapey but looked fine regardless
3.0,"Like many products on amazon, this is fair for it's price. It doesn't look as nice as the photos, but, seldom is that so, I'm not surprised but it's still cute and good enough."
3.0,"Looks same as picture,  but much bigger then you would figure it would be."
3.0,"Does not fit the classic 3g version. The company did respond and let me know why it didn't fit. Still very disappointed. Maybe advertising a little different may help me and other distinguish the difference, as I have had no issues with any other brands on the fit of the band. The band itself was nice. The packaging was a little cheap looking. I'll give it 3 stars bc the watch band was nice."
3.0,The button fell off the second time wearing it. Skirt falls
3.0,"Beautiful bracelet! Lots of compliments, but it turned orange very quickly. Bummer."
3.0,I like that they have the non skid bottom.  I’m disappointed that they fade so much when you wash them.
3.0,"This seller was a bit sneaky in posting this as a picture of the top AND the pants.  It was more expensive than the other sellers I had looked at and I foolishly didn't read the description clearly and got only the top for a higher price.  I felt cheated b/c I paid a lot more and thought I was getting a package deal, but the description did say &#34;either&#34; jacket or pants.  (Look at other sellers who list the two separately and you'll pay less).  Lesson learned, look at the description more carefully and not just the photo.<br /><br />About the jacket itself:  I live in the mountains.  Along with the beauty in my back yard, comes about a zillion bugs.  Just a stroll in the yard will give me a ton of bug bites, not to mention gardening where I run from chiggers and what they call &#34;flying teeth&#34; here.  I am dressed top to bottom when I'm in the yard to keep the bugs away.  I was hoping that I could wear this with a tank top underneath (and the pants with shorts underneath) and be more comfortable in the heat.  I did do that and it did keep the bugs away, but boy was it hot!  Our mountain temps aren't usually more than 80 on our warmest days in the summer.  The netting fabric does not breath one bit and I was boiling hot after just a few minutes outside.<br /><br />For gardening I've gone back to using my long sleeve bug shirts and hiking pants, much cooler and still keep bugs away.  I also wear a hat with bug-proofing stuff in it.  I'll try this again when it gets cooler outside.  The only problem with that is the bugs usually go away when the weather cools off.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this again unless I was a camper looking for bug protection on cold days.  Definitely wouldn't recommend the seller unless they change their listing picture."
3.0,"Was very disappointed in this purchase. Ordered 2 sizes larger then I normally wear and was still very small and had to be returned. Returning this item was not an easy process even know they say they do returns. Colors were not as shown in picture, but were fall colors, just more brown then a spectrum of fall colors."
3.0,around the calves its a little large and does not hug my foot. maybe if i had gotten a smaller size it would work better
3.0,The tab was broke and we couldn't get it to work as directed .I'm sure it would've have been a great lock. I didn't have time to exchange it for another.
3.0,It runs too small!! Short and tight!! I got it a size up to have it fit loose but it fits way too small.
3.0,"Jacket was OK, actually slightly bigger than expected.  Hood piece is not lined at all, and had to find alternative ways to keep my head warm."
3.0,"Cute, but way too big, had to return."
3.0,Much smaller than I thought would love to get for my boys too
3.0,"Cute enough for cost, I’m 5’4 athletic build 36DD & bought medium because of reviews.  Material does not stretch, Top fit perfect pants too baggy and too long.  Mix and match would be best.  Returning.  Def cute for someone! Would still recommend."
3.0,Needs item size adjustment.
3.0,Very cute but small for a large. I expected a large to fit as pictured. I'm a size 10/12 and buy a shirt like this in a large. I like it but wish I'd have bought a size larger for a looser fit.
3.0,"The sculpt on the mask is quite good, but it shipped slightly warped and the paint job is... while not terrible not what is pictured.  Mask is mostly black with a bare minimum of gunmetal dry brushing.  I'm hoping I can reshape it with some heat and repaint it, but I would not consider it usable for my purposes the way it ships."
3.0,It really cute. But the cup in the bra does not fit properly. The wire in the top is straight instead of curving to the breast. I am going to keep it but will need to be altered.
3.0,Absolutely loved it…until a band broke 2 months later
3.0,"Good for the price, but was big on my 10 week old"
3.0,Beautiful dress but very small
3.0,The breast area is a little snug.
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress, its true to size. But make sure you follow their size measurements. I was inbetween sizes and went a size up. Should have stayed with the smaller size since its a corset style dress. Its a flowy dress with pockets! Comes with a a built in bra, i was not expecting that. In my opinion this does not look like a dress that was ordered online. Giving it 3  starts since It was returned because bride changed her mind on the color."
3.0,Small wrists only and on three bracelets you can’t read the message.
3.0,Somewhat small -  Tight
3.0,It was larger than I expected. It's still nice though. I should have just ordered a regular beanie instead.
3.0,"I ordered this 2 sizes bigger than mine, and it fits pretty snug. Also, not nearly as long as it looks in the picture.<br />It's still really comfortable and cute, just runs small."
3.0,"quality wasn't that bad. i saw people mentioned it run small.<br />so i purchased size bigger, it was way too big.<br />overall, design was fine. just buy expect size."
3.0,I ordered silver but got black... Still like the earrings but I didn't want another pair in black.
3.0,"I do like these pajamas. They are quite cozy. As to the fit, I am a fairly normal Medium or size 11. With these pajamas, the top runs a little smaller across the chest, but larger in the bottoms. A bit odd, as if a 10 top was put with a 12 bottom. In addition, there was an obvious ""repair"" of a small tear or cut in the pajama pants that was fixed with a buttonhole stitch over the small tear. It is well-fixed, but my fingers keep going to the knub that sticks out. You just don't expect this with something for which you pay fair dollars."
3.0,"My tape measure says it us 46” long (not 49” as described). The fabric has a pleasant feeling. I’m pretty sure its a mix, and not 100% silk.<br />I bought it for my husband who has a 17 1/2 neck. This tie is too short fir him. He would not be able to make a knot; and have enough tie left to keep it tidy inside his shirt."
3.0,"I wear medium in Zaful and have many of their suits. The bottoms fit as expected but the top was not for me. I’m a 32DD and felt like a lean forward would cause a “wardrobe malfunction”; I was barely covered. I would not trust it in a pool/waves. The squarish shape was also not flattering. Fabric was nice, soft. Bummed it didn’t work out because the top had decent support; just inadequate coverage."
3.0,I’m a size 5. I got a 6 but they were still too small. Okay quality for the price
3.0,"This dress fit beautifully at the chest, but it was very fitted at the waist. If you have a large waist, consider wearing a shape wear. This dress isn't hiding ANYTHING"
3.0,"They broke twice after falling four feet.<br /><br />Edit: I received a message from the seller telling me to get in contact and I would get a replacement or refund under the warranty. They sent me a new pair, one which seems to holding up."
3.0,"Glasses are good quality but much larger than they appear in the photos. They cover half my face. Polarization does NOT work well with electronic screens, which I knew before hand."
3.0,Runs very large. Order a size down.
3.0,"The sizing is a bit confusing. I am 5.7, 130 lb and got the dress in large. It was too large in the chest area, too much fabric flops under armpits. Perhaps I can get it in medium or small and it would be different but I did not love it too much to re-order it."
3.0,"Eh. I sort of regret buying this, but not enough to return it. It's flattering but it lacks the &#34;wow factor&#34; I was looking for."
3.0,"They seem to be good, quality shorts. Nice zippered pocket. Nice deep red color. I will be returning mine because the fit is so weird. They poof out at the crotch like they’re on backwards. (?)"
3.0,Its a beautiful purse but it's too small for me.
3.0,"I am 5'8&#34; and 200lbs. I ordered the XXL, and it was way too big. It was falling off. I returned it. If I order again, I will go with a large. The material was very soft. It was thin, but not too thin."
3.0,"Liked- price, comfortable.  Didnt like-the strap adjustment always sliding down. The straps don’t stay up on my shoulders.  At the six month mark the underwires started popping through, and the funniest thing- one of them had bumps where a really perky set of boobs would have nipples. Luckily the other five did not have this outstanding feature!"
3.0,"It is very cheap material! Totally see through! The picture looks high quality, but it definitely is not! Very disappointed!! The bottom layer stops before the waist line. The only reason I brought it was to wear it to work and church! It is cute, but do not waste your time or money!"
3.0,"Looks good, but it is made with very cheap materials. I can tell it won't last long."
3.0,Love the length and shelf bra. Side seams split open after a few washes
3.0,"Satin-y material like a nightgown, had no real structure, did not fit well or flatter me."
3.0,Paint starts to chip after two weeks on the keychain no crazy movement just starts to come off over time.
3.0,"item was ok, just not for me"
3.0,"Nice, not what I was expecting. Not as sparkly as I had hoped."
3.0,"5'4"" 122 ordered a small fit everywhere i just dont like tight band at top i fit it nicely other places just not my band style to painful for working out"
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:e0efe862eb51579ada560f18659aaac0]] These are perfect for people who need or want an arch in their shoes. I got these for my mother-in-law who wears a size 8 normally. She has issues with her feet swelling so I ordered an 8.5 just to make sure she had the extra room for her swelling feet. She really likes these sandals, the comfort, arch, and everything about them. UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE WAY TOO BIG! I WEAR A SIZE 11 AND THEY ARE ALMOST BIG ENOUGH FOR MY FOOT. THE PICTURE ATTACHED IS MY SIZE 11 FT AND THIS SIZE 8.5 SANDAL. I would almost guess that the sizing is for men, not women as stated in the description. Great pair of sandals, but size according to these being in men's sizes, not women's."
3.0,A little disappointed. They look kind of cheap. Not what I was expecting.
3.0,too small but loved the coat
3.0,This was a little small for my taste but i gave it to my sister and she loves it.  Go up a size to have a better fit.
3.0,"Some of the earrings were shaped odd, I had returned a previous order because the posts on a pair were broken. On the other package I received some of the metal were faded"
3.0,I like the size and simplicity of this bag. It's lightweight and works really well for me. The only negative feedback I have is that it does shed some and the beads drive me crazy. They uare not anchored and flop back and forth all the time. I tried to glue them but the glue didn't hold. Other than that it's a great bag.
3.0,these rings are very small. they make them look big in the pic but they are disappointing in person
3.0,"This is the second one I have bought, warning it shrinks when washed. Super cute cover up thought I'd buy another one and a little bit larger size but it's still shrimp to I even used woolite so it wouldn't shrink but it does didn't even dry it hung it up to dry and it's still shrunk."
3.0,"Unusual neckware of faux fur for a glamourous vintage look.  100% polyester, dry clean only.  I think it will be perfect for a fashion forward young lady."
3.0,"Good looking bracelet for men or woman. Made well and can adjust to fit any wrist. Did not help at all for wrist pain, but still looks nice."
3.0,"Started out buying a 2XL. My gf is 5'5 and curvy and I read some reviews saying buy larger size if you're curvy. So my gf is normally an XL so I bought 2XL. They were humongous. Too big too long. The 2XL was so big that we went down to L. The L was way too small. So my thinking is now go XL..which is her true size. The XL and the L are the exact same size. We even laid them on top of each other and the sweatpants were exactly same size. So I go to the sizes for the 4th attempt and I finally notice..there is XL and then there is 1XL. So I purchased the 1XL and it was the right size for her hips, butt, thighs etc..but they look like they are about 3 inches too long. The challenge is finding the correct length for the sizes above a L. My gf doesn't care because they're just lazy pants and the extra length helps keep feet warm. But it was a nightmare trying to size these sweatpants. Other than finding your true size in these..everything else is great! My gf would probably give these a 4 star, but she wasn't dealing with the purchasing and returning and return labels etc..I gotta take half a star away for that part as well."
3.0,"Relativamente sencillo y no es muy seguro ,ya que no se adhiere muy bien en el lugar que se lo ponga"
3.0,"I bought this as a present for my mom. I like the wallet's features and size, and it was packaged in a nice box that would be ideal for wrapping. Unfortunately, this wallet really smells bad. I saw the seller's answer to another complaint about this which said it could be the glue used in the process, but I think the smell is coming from the wallet itself. Granted, I'm really sensitive to smells, so this might not bother other people. (In fact, only a few of us have mentioned the smell in our reviews.) I googled the problem, and saw several articles about sealing the wallet in a box or bag with a new box of baking soda.<br /><br />As it turns out, my mom doesn't need the wallet after all, so I will be returning it."
3.0,If you like tights for pajamas you'll like these. I don't. I like my pajama bottoms loose fitting for personal freedom and comfort. The top is great -- sleeves are plenty long and the body is roomy. I like the neckline without a collar. I don't need pockets in my pajamas; these have pockets in both the top and bottom.
3.0,"Like the sock fabric, but they were too small for my large calf.  I could not get them on!  I ordered the largest size Amazon listed X-XL, but too small.  Sorry, I really wanted to like them."
3.0,It's way to big a M might fit a L or even a XL
3.0,Not really needed as the glasses I ordered came with a protective case.  These were pictured with the glasses so I assumed none were enclosed
3.0,"It is very pretty, I actually ordered two.  Love the material and how it feels but unfortunately it came smaller than expected.  I would suggest to order one size higher."
3.0,Needs to be longer design
3.0,"The purse is really cute. The size is great, the quality is right for the price....BUT...the SMELL! Oh the smell! There's a terrible fishy smell coming from the purse that almost makes me feel I'll. Really hoping it airs out soon. (Also worth noting that one of the zipper pulls was missing....it looks like it may have fallen off during packaging or something)"
3.0,"I was really hoping that the lapis would look more like the picture, with blue & green (I ordered it to go with a blue tie), however, it was mainly white with just a little bit of blue :("
3.0,They will not stay up
3.0,Super fluffy but sheds. Comfy casual and stylish.
3.0,Won’t close all the way
3.0,The product is very decent for the price. The flower design is great but two things. First the diamonds are less Shiny  and the size of the earrings is quite small.
3.0,A little see threw due to cheap fabric
3.0,OVERPRICED!!<br />I was under the impression I was getting multiple. User error for not reading.<br />YOU ONLY GET ONE!<br />Too expensive for only one strap.<br />I just received it so I can not attest to the quality at this point.
3.0,Did not compare to other ear grips I have had in the past.
3.0,Bed need to be a little bit longer
3.0,"This dress is so cute, but the arms were a little tight. I had read reviews and saw that it ran a little small. I ordered a whole size up for my daughter and the arms were still tight (and her arms are not big at all). We are still trying to decide if we should return this dress or just get it altered. The"
3.0,Colors are nice and material is nice.  They are very tight fitting and make wrinkles on my face because they are so tight.
3.0,I love this but only lasted 6 months
3.0,Se empaña con la transpiración
3.0,Buttons are not very secure and chest is kinda small.
3.0,The chain is very cheap. Product is made very cheap
3.0,These catch lint so bad it looks like you rolled in it.  Have to use a tape lint brush just to go out.  Another color may have been better
3.0,Runs big. I got a small and it's just too big. Wish XS was an option.
3.0,It's very flimsy and more of like a trash bag material.
3.0,Fits smaller than expected- looks great on.
3.0,Shrinks too much.
3.0,"Very cute , collar keeps flapping up but cute"
3.0,Bands' color wears off easily.
3.0,"Returned, tight in hips"
3.0,"The sizes are accurate. My 5 yr old wears a 4-5 so I purchased one of each size. They are about the same in the waist but approx. 2 inches different in the length.  The material is good/well -made and the style is nice, (like the zippers @ the ankles) z the price is good however, I purchased white and they were completely see through. I contacted the seller and he/she could offer no advice except to return them and get a different color."
3.0,My item arrived with a hole in the right pocket. Disappointed in that- otherwise they are a little tight (measurements aren’t spot on) but still comfortable to wear on errands in Tx heat!
3.0,This mask looks awesome and is a good width for an adult face. The nose is a little narrow and hurt after wearing for a couple of minutes. It felt like it was pinching the nose.
3.0,"Definitely runs small... I'm normally between a medium or large depending,  so I ordered a large and it is very tight. material isn't fantastic,  though very pretty. Needs a slip or nude underwear underneath if you don't want your panty color to show... all in all, it's so so... Just need to lose a few pounds before I wear this...wish I sized up."
3.0,"I Really like the bag’s size, fabric, and backpack straps.  But, the zippers are not well made and the straps are flimsy. I attached the shoulder strap and it broke as soon as I put it on my shoulder. The snap closures easily fall off the straps. I put them on to cinch the bag and one fell off after I released the clasp. I lost it and now only have one working cinch. I’d say it’s a good one-time use bag, but the quality isn’t there to support long-term use."
3.0,A little disappointed the coloring is too dull
3.0,"The belt doesn’t sit well, the sides stick out too much when you wear it."
3.0,Looks and feels cheap. The gold is too yellow.
3.0,This bag is ok. I like that I can switch the shoulder. It's cute and has tons of pockets but is slightly too small. By that I mean when you put stuff in the different pockets the bag doesnt have enough allowance so it actually doesnt hold as much as it could.
3.0,"I was expecting more fullness to the petticoat, but hopefully when worn under the skirt it will give the effect I was looking for."
3.0,This is a very nice vest but make sure you watch the size.  It did not fit me and I returned it
3.0,came ticking. Battery lasted two months
3.0,But good for shorter term wear
3.0,Beautiful fabric. Not seamless and too small for a 22.5 inch head. Not very stretchy.
3.0,My 10 month old daughter had a Farm Day at her daycare and this outfit was a hit! I loved the fit of the red overalls! My only critique was that the white shirt kept riding up and didn’t fit well. I wish it was a onesie. For other wears we switched it for a plain onesie and the outfit was perfect!
3.0,"Not what I excepted, but I will wear them in the house"
3.0,This purse is tiny! Like palm sized. You can't fit much of anything inside it. It is very pretty just wish it was bigger.
3.0,"Very large but I was expecting that, and I do like the oversized fit. The shirt got holes throughout after drying it the first time though."
3.0,It's not exactly what I expected but I don't want to go through the process of exchange so I will keep it
3.0,This is such an awkward outfit... Fits well and is so soft but it's just awkward.
3.0,A bit too tight
3.0,Cute but it breaks easily
3.0,"Not bad, but not great, either. My biggest issue with this dress is the fabric, which is a little too thin and lightweight for a body hugging style and becomes kind of see through when stretched. The other smaller issue is the fabric around the neck not being properly sewn, just sort of cut, and while the neck and chest part can be arranged in a way that it does not show, I'm sure it would have been possible to do it right. The style is otherwise great and will be flattering on most body shapes. No issue with the sizing, either, I ordered an XL, which I normally get, and the dress fits as expected. If the fabric was a little thicker, I would be giving this 5 stars, despite the issue with the neckline.<br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my fair and unbiased review."
3.0,"Its cute, but its too small for me."
3.0,"Ordered this product for a preschool Easter party. Product arrived late, so I was unable to put in my favor box. It has the made in China stamped under the cross. The cross seem to be made from a metal like material. The punchout of the cross is pretty sharp. Too sharp for a preschooler in my opinion."
3.0,This is tiny and was too small for the intended body piercing originally bought for (my husband’s nipple). This seems to be more eyebrow piercing size. I returned this item to get a larger item.
3.0,"These shorts just wadded up between my legs, providing only a very bad feeling , and no padding at all."
3.0,"The lenses themselves are nice and the overall shape of the glasses is flattering. My main complaint is that they let in a good amount of sunlight from above making them less than ideal for outdoor activities on bright days. I feel the need to wear a hat when I wear these outside, but they are nice for driving. Also, I often use sunglasses as a &#34;headband' to keep my hair out of my face and found that these did not stay put."
3.0,Super cute and so many options
3.0,Not for big breasted busted the buttons
3.0,I really like the shirt. I just wish it wasn't so narrow towards the bottom. I'll still wear it though.
3.0,"The watchband is terrific, great fit and excellent design. The supplied watchband pins are TERRIBLE. Too thin, too short, and the band comes off the watch easily. I am ordering the Suunto pins, mine were damaged and could not be reused."
3.0,The first one I received had make up on it. I don’t wear make up so it’s annoying to get something damaged already. Also it fits like a male small. I believe the ones they’re selling as female are actually male size or unisex size or something. Not worth the money at all.
3.0,Wasn’t really comfortable on the back of the head. Granted I wore it skiing and had a helmet on. But the sound was alright. Would give it a 5/10.
3.0,"I am five feet tall and 95 pounds. I ordered the xs and it is very loose. The shirt is not 3/4 sleeve as pictured, but long sleeved, a bit too long."
3.0,just more casual than I thought
3.0,"I'm 5'7"" 145lb and I got size 11 because I'm usually an 8 or 9. They fit okay, no muffin top but the waist is fairly low. The crotch area has a weird bulge/extra space that is not remedied by pulling them up (immediate cameltoe). Thigh still squished out when I sat. The back has kind of a weird darker patch of fabric surrounding the belt loop. I'd recommend going 2 sizes bigger if you're looking for any extra room. Overall they look nice esp paired with fishnets."
3.0,Soooo cute but cheaply made. It got. Small hole in it from normal wear in tear on day 1 :( but it fit perfect and is so cute
3.0,beauticul  set  with tjhe smaller stone  and that looks  REAL  The two  caret  stone is so large it does no look real! I bought the
3.0,"I have a 31"" waist and 42"" hips. I ordered a large, per the sizing chart above. They were way too big around the waist. I'll either have to exchange them, or wear a belt to keep them up. Other than the inaccurate sizing, the fabric and length were nice."
3.0,I love Prada glasses but did not like this one because it was made from wood
3.0,I weigh 100lb and I’m 5ft. It was huge on me so I had to return it. However  it was very cute just like the photo.
3.0,Way small. The holes are even too small for a needle
3.0,"Cute, just a little too big so it kept twisting around."
3.0,POCKET NOT REAL
3.0,"Cheap fabric, but what do you expect! It was perfect for a night out."
3.0,I love them but I bought one size up and they are still to tight for my liking. If you want them baggy or loose you need 1-2 sizes larger.
3.0,"Very cute, just smaller than I thought it would be."
3.0,"The pants are far too low, even with the measurements listed. You WILL need to alter the rest as the straps are too long. E6000 and velcro straps should do the trick."
3.0,Comfy for a hour then they start to creep where they dont belong if you get my meaning.
3.0,"It's a good parka, just wish it was a little larger for comfort."
3.0,Can't beat the price but faded after about 4 months.
3.0,Not a bad little sweater. Ordered a size up and still too small
3.0,"Wasnt that impressed, looked cheap.  I returned it."
3.0,Very thick hot fabric
3.0,"The colors are very nice and vibrant, but this is very short and fits like a shirt and comes just below the waist rather than the hip-length that I was hoping for."
3.0,It's cute...  just a little small...
3.0,"Very cute dress, but it is 3 inches shorter than another La Cera dress I have, which makes it too short for me (I'm 5'10&#34;). Unfortunately I've already washed it (didn't dry it, so that's not why it is too short)."
3.0,"quedo corto de tiro, solo para mujeres pequeñas"
3.0,"The Qualety is bad, but for kid it is ok"
3.0,Love the way the shoe looks - but very uncomfortable.
3.0,Pants look amazing and are good quality. Unfortunately they ran smaller then I was hoping. They &#34;fit&#34; but were not comfortable. I ended up giving them to a fellow Hufflepuff.
3.0,"The colors are far more muted in person than they are online, as a warning to potential buyers! If you're looking for super bright saturated colors, this probably isn't the right band for you.<br />The band does function perfectly, and fits comfortably, hence the 3/5 stars. The pictures just shows something a bit more brilliant in color than what I received."
3.0,Lose the color fast
3.0,It's really cute but the silver started chipping off and it's kind of a weird fit. But cute if you only wear it for a few hours here and there.
3.0,I ordered a pack for myself (fits as expected) and a pack for my cousin (who's a six Misses 16) which did not fit comfortably- too small.
3.0,"Starting, this watch looks excellent and it keeps time. Unfortunately, it is made of plastic (possibly I missed this in the description). I ordered it for an adult. Secondly, the light and the sound do not work - only the time works. I see this is a manufacturer flaw and not the seller's flaw. I would order from this seller again without reservation. You can't always win the Superbowl."
3.0,I’ve ripped the butt seams in both my pair just by squatting so if you do a lot of squatting go a size up
3.0,"Great material, feels very nice, but these are more like knee socks than thigh high stockings"
3.0,It's a like tight for my boys.
3.0,"Just wore these from NYC to China and back. First time I used compression socks, they worked great."
3.0,It is cute and went along perfectly with the British baking themed gift I had put together. It arrived quickly with no problems to the product. I did not read the description and had I known it was plastic like lined on the inside I probably would not have purchased this. It made the apron very stiff to put on but I guess on the flipside it’ll help prevent damage to you clothes underneath.
3.0,"I got this for a friend who had to have a Nike bandana, and he hardly ever uses it.  Unless you absolutely must have a &#34;Nike&#34; bandana, this is hardly worth the money."
3.0,"Good, but one of them had a hole in it."
3.0,Bag has a weird smell.  Doesn't go away.
3.0,"So cute! but a little bit small, only 4 o 5 small eggs fit in there, the size of a ping pong ball."
3.0,"Update: the seller is sending a pack of size small at no charge. This is noted in their product description if sizing is off. I will update the review when they arrive. Until then, I'm using wardrobe fashion tape on my heel to keep them from slipping off.<br /><br />Original: The concept is great, but the end result is poorly sized and made rendering them absolutely useless.  I wear 8.5-9, so I ordered medium.  They are much too long.  They slip off my heel every 10 steps which defeats the purpose of buying them.  Additionally, the silicone &#34;grips&#34; on the heel are nearly 3/4 of a inch below the top of the &#34;sock&#34;...much too low to do any good at all.  I am very disappointed given the cost. The one thing that I love about them is the padded area at the ball of the foot.  Perhaps I'll cut and sew them to shorten the length, but that won't fix the poor placement of the silicone grips. Overall...disappointing."
3.0,Very nice quality ponte knit leggings in a delicious shade of blackish brown. But I had to return them because they seemed uncomfortably snug. I’m 132 lbs and ordered an M.
3.0,"Great detail, but sadly small !!"
3.0,Good product from what I can tell. I wanted an earring set for my 7 holes in each ear without being pomed by studs. I was able to squeeze these thru a few holes but I didn't want to have stretched holes. So I took them out after a few days.
3.0,"Overall the product is decent. Not worth $25 though. The nose adjustment inside was in the middle. It floats around so I had to move it to the top. The size is good for a smaller face, which I was unable to use these. I would not recommend until they fix the nose adjustment and make them slightly bigger."
3.0,Quedan un poco ajustado.
3.0,The spyglass itself is really small. I gave it to my five year old to wear.
3.0,"They are adorable shoes, but the bows fall off really easily. My daughter lost her shoe bows to one shoe 2 weeks after getting them."
3.0,I love the look but the shoes run small not true to size and very uncomfortable
3.0,"NOT 6mm maybe 4mm. The one on the far left is the new one, tiny... next is a 6mm, right one is a 8mm"
3.0,"I like them, just wish both sides had the beautiful color!"
3.0,This product is really beautifull..I loved this desing but the glitter was littlebit powder type thats why i couldn't give five star
3.0,"The fabric was cute. By the measurements on the ad I should have been a large, but I could have fit into a small."
3.0,"These are great glasses for the money, but I have no idea why they packed the dark yellow lens with these. YOU CAN-NOT USE THAT LENS OR THESE GLASSES IN THE NIGHT-TIME. If they packed a clear lens with these they would be five stars!"
3.0,has a hard time stay on my ear. even when I adjust it. most of the time I have to wear my hair up and even then it still falls off.
3.0,simple<br />smells like cow and metal
3.0,The elastic knot loosens and need to tighten it every now and then.
3.0,a little uncomfortable and a little too small
3.0,"My bra size has not changed yet... so I bought accordingly. They fit snug but comfortable. Baby is due in 3 weeks. If my milk comes in and they get any bigger these bras will definitely be way too small as they fit like a sports bra now... am waiting for the company to send me the correct size and I will change my review! Good material, comfortable otherwise... would recommend getting a size bigger than what you need."
3.0,"It was shipped quick. It does look like a very nice belt. the problem is that it's supposed to fit 41 to 47"". it only measures about 39"".  I don't know if there is a sizing problem or just packaged wrong. Overall a good company. they promptly issued a return"
3.0,This item is wonderful in color. I like the thin material. Why does this green garment have a blue/teal neck trim? This is not good. I did not receive a return packing slip so I can return the item. I'm not happy.
3.0,"OK, at first I was impressed with the structure, how they felt, the fact that they went below my boat shoe but still felt great and covered mostly underneath without showing. Quality is an issue, one sock tore at the end edges first use and others aren't doing well, but I'll have to see how some hold up next season. The silicone around all the edges was great through, this sock won't move at all"
3.0,The belt arrived on time however it was not boxed in the original packaging.  Since I purchased this as a gift this was a problem for me.
3.0,"Not bad, especially considering the price. They work... But, are made of a softer metal than name brand version."
3.0,"Good design in a way, but I do not agree with the fabric nor the sleeves, too short.  I would not buy it next time., price does not amount the  quality of the product.<br />Thank you!"
3.0,Definitely not high impact. The padding moves all over the place. The fit is smaller than expected. It doesn’t hold me in at all.
3.0,really should have thought about the size and not judged the size from the pic. much larger than i wanted.
3.0,"This purse has a lot of useful compartments. The shoulder band loosens up on it's own very easily, so I'm always having to adjust it. There's a little extra, loose threading inside.<br />Less than a year after purchase, the side zipper stopped catching and detached from the purse."
3.0,Very small had to return.
3.0,Its plastic...not metal ugh. But it is cute and come ls with the link removing tool.
3.0,"These shoes were great for my sister in laws wedding, but they have an awful smell that lingers for months even after you air them out.  The shoes were fabulous the smell not so much, I would not be purchasing again."
3.0,"I’m not returning it, but the color (safety pink) is not the same as the picture and it had like white specs mixed in the color. It’s more of a sweatshirt I’ll wear around home, not a trendy fashion sweatshirt."
3.0,The gloves had a nick in one of them
3.0,It's a beautiful dress but it runs very large and fits funny. Unfortunately I had to return it.
3.0,Runs big. Cute dress in concept but the other side of the ruffle is unfinished/the raw side of the fabric. Retuning for those reasons
3.0,"They need to be a bit shorter in length, so the flared ends touch ear, I ordered 2g, they don't sit well in ear, one will sit more back and vise versa.<br />You should construct 2g like 0g more squaty in length"
3.0,I like the design and material. The are larger than normal.. so a size down would be wise. I don’t like how they include a black one in every option.. so if you want other colors you have to get another.. also over priced in my opinion should be no more $20 max!
3.0,About a size and a half smaller than it should be. The other things I bought from Hurley were true to size.
3.0,"The hat looks cool… Like really cool. BUT the word villains under the brim is misspelled “Villians.” 😩. I bought it as a gift, so I was pretty disappointed. Other than that, it’s a nice hat."
3.0,Very cute but won't stay on.
3.0,"I did not like the way it fit. The base of the body seams were right where my knees were, making it awkward to walk a normal stride. My hips were cramping up from the abnormal gait. These must be designed for very tall people and at 5’5, I’m obviously not tall enough. It also took 8 AA batteries and it still didn’t produce enough air to keep the head up. It was cute as a bug, but between the drawstring cord to snug it tight enough to hold the air in and the way it kept slipping down, it is not comfortable for walking in a parade or doing much moving around in."
3.0,They are ok...the material on the bands are not very wide so the pattern on them doesn’t show enough for me.  I might return these.<br /><br />They fit nicely and the patterns are nice but they barely show once placed on the head.
3.0,"Daughter loves it but my wife had to patch some holes up that were found while trying it on, I believe it was at various spot along seems."
3.0,"Shoe is super cute and looks as expected.  The light up part one the white ones, one shoe did not light up and the gold ones after one day, no longer light up but the shoes are super cute still."
3.0,I like the middle and of the suit and the attached shorts. Those parts fit me well. The arm holes seem not as stretchy and as close to my body as I would like. Adjustable straps may be the culprit.
3.0,This is okay - it's a lot of bra (for me) & the padding is kinda awkward & uncomfortable. I sent it back because it just wasn't quite right for what i wanted to wear it under.
3.0,The hat is a bit small for my head but it does the job.
3.0,"I really liked this dress, but it is so short!"
3.0,"They look awesome, but socks are thin and the ankle elastic portion is too tight. I am average size and don't have thick ankles. They look good though! Very cute but I won't purchase again..."
3.0,the product is fine and I like it but i get a wrong size
3.0,"I like them, but just a little small.."
3.0,Very pretty material but runs small.  I'll keep it but they need to make this a bit bigger.
3.0,This very cute and made pretty well but it is definitely not one size fits all. I’m a size 14 and it was too snug around my midsection.
3.0,They helped a little bit but not as much as I would have hoped.
3.0,Too small to look right.  Nicely knitted.
3.0,Nothing out of reality!!!
3.0,"This sweater has a strange, shiny look and fuzzy texture. It also arrived smelling very strongly of chemicals. I see this often in reviews and don't normally notice it, but I definitley did for this one. I washed and hung it to dry which helped the smell and texture, but I'll be honest, I haven't even worn it yet because it's so strange looking and feeling. I'm pretty bummed because it looks so great in the pictures and would be perfect if it were cotton or something."
3.0,It fits well on my daughter but had some writing on the inside with permanent marker that can be seen on the outside of the costume. Tried hand washing but writing would not come off so it definitely has to be permanent marker. Also One of the ears isn’t sewed on correctly leaving it with a hole. Daughter needed it for spirit wk at school so could not exchange In time.
3.0,Wasn't as pretty as my old one from the 80's but still a nice bracelet
3.0,"I love the way this looks and feels! Good quality material and the belts fit fairly well.<br /><br />The only problems I have is that it's missing a leg strap :( I may see if they'll just send me that part:I can't return it bc con is coming up soon.<br />Also some instructions would be nice, though a few youtube tutorials did help a bit."
3.0,An ok shirt if you love wearing a short sleeve shirt.
3.0,"The description on Amazon.com says 100% cotton. I just received the shirt and the label says 70% cotton, 30% polyester.  Be aware before purchasing.  I now can't trust any of the ""Life is Good"" descriptions no Amazon.com."
3.0,"This wasn't what I expected. It felt like a bathing suit more than a top. I was hoping to wear it under shirts as a bralette, but it was too large and the straps felt like it would break. I ended up returning it. They gave me a full refund, which is why I gave them a 3."
3.0,"Pretty , but they were very dark so you really had to look at them up close to see what they were a picture of"
3.0,"I really love the glasses but they arrived crooked. When I placed them on the table, they were obviously crooked and were wobbly. I’ve tried to mess with them to get them to straighten. It’s helped some."
3.0,just as described. a little thinner material then i expected ( almost like cheap pantyhose)
3.0,Looks as advertised and of good quality. Find hard to remove or insert credits YD etc. Not real pleased with money clip .
3.0,Smaller than appeared. Works great
3.0,Runs WAY small but so cute!!
3.0,"I know, they are three times the price (there were 3 pairs in this order) but I would rather spend the money on the injinji.  but in truth, I haven't owned my injinji long enough to see how long they last."
3.0,my wife (an RN)  told me the compression was great but the heels wore a hole through on each sock prematurely
3.0,Not compression and really doesn’t stay put while doing boot camp style workout. They are nice and long but overall just ok.
3.0,The only problem (which is a huge problem) was that it was hard to see the time.
3.0,To short and skirt is to full.
3.0,I ordered 5/6 for my 3 year old thinking I could get at least a while of wear out of it. It barely fits her and the material in the back is quite thin. Also fits her mid thigh. I got it for $8 so I can’t complain but I won’t be keeping it .
3.0,"Ordered 2 sizes up, still snug. Material is stiff any scratchy. I didn’t wash to see if it will get better. I am going to return them."
3.0,The size is perfect and the color is fun. I hate the fabric. It is comfy firbaround thr house but it's so thin that I feel almost exposed. It feels like I'm not wearing anything. Maybe that's great for smaller chested women. But that I am not.
3.0,"46b ...ummm its tricky to get this to work without getting my nips caught up in the mix. however once in place that thing stayed in place throughout the entire day, then throughout the night (slept in it) and even part of the following day. I aint mad!<br />Worth it....just a bit tricky ..and im sure no matter what size you are, youre gonna have to figure out the best application techniques for you."
3.0,"This top was not what I was expecting. I got the grey, it's blue and not at all grey. I thought the material would be a soft jersey fabric, but it feels like a kids halloween costume. The neckline is very high and weird. I'm 5'3&#34; and 125 lbs, I got the small and it is very loose with long sleeves."
3.0,"This is a good costume.  My 7 year old loves it.  The problem is the mask, the eye color is red instead of pink-like the rest of the costume.  I also prefer costumes with removable gloves."
3.0,"This pendant is very, very thin, like paper. Looks kind of cheap. I was disappointed, I have to say."
3.0,I bought the wrong size and had to ship them back.  They were nice though.
3.0,This shirt fit well everywhere but the chest. I normally wear M-L depending on fit. I have a small band large cup bra size and this shirt was too tight across the chest like it needed just a bit more fabric across the chest. I really like it but I am going to pass it on to a smaller chested friend.
3.0,Is a nice watch. Easy to read but extremely hard to adjust band. Took a long time to figure out the instructions
3.0,"It fit well at the chest, but was very loose in the waist. The belt that comes with it is nearly impossible to get tied and wrinkle free. The material feels cheap."
3.0,I should’ve got a smaller size it looked like a grandma dress on me 😂
3.0,"Lots of card slots, material feels very soft. The only thing I personally dislike is that the id holders have a mesh cover, not clear plastic. Good buy for the money"
3.0,my son loved the watch.
3.0,"The band is about an inch shorter than normal, but not a big deal for me as I have small wrists.  But the loops are made such that the material overlaps itself and is then one-stitched and hot glued.  The glue was done sloppily, and the overlap is uncomfortable."
3.0,No crank to open and close.  Pole doesn't fit standard stand so have to wedge something in to keep it sturdy.  Quality ok
3.0,Little tight if you have a big wrist
3.0,"The sleeves definitely weren't long enough. I usually always get XXL just for the length of shirt and length of sleeves. This shirt was short on the sleeves. Other than that, it's a nice shirt."
3.0,Need to go up a size
3.0,"The wallet is definitely slim, but maybe too slim for my taste. As the wallet breaks in you can see distinct lines from the edges of all cards and even the edges of a bill that has a corner folded over. The design is really nice with the three commonly used card slots, and a pullout tab for you less used (stacked) cards; but again the leather on the outside shows the outline of the pullout tab. Overall I'm happy with it, but for the price I would like to see slightly thicker leather to hide the outlines of the contents."
3.0,LOVE these but they break too quickly. I'm on my 3rd pair.
3.0,Looks a lot shinier in the photo but still really pretty! Was delivered on time!
3.0,Adorable dress but not for American women. I wear a size 6. Since this came from China I decided to order a large. Wouldn't fit around hips or boobs. At all.
3.0,"Here in my area this time of year with lots of humidity, 40 degree weather and a face mask diverting my exhale I am not sure anything will work when I walk inside This product wasn't as good as the Zeiss stuff my optometrist sold me.  Maybe there is a learning curve on amount to apply."
3.0,I love the dress but it's too small. How can I exchange it for a larger one?
3.0,"Size true to reviews, but a little loose at shoulders.  Because the fabric is stretchy, a dark shade and good quality, I could have done better with a size down.  I kept it because I would have to pay return shipping.  I'll wear it, it's really a striking dress."
3.0,Sole very rough and shoe not comfortable to walk in.
3.0,"Pretty, but cheaply made."
3.0,Nice dress but I expected it would be lined!
3.0,Really cute but my daughter keeps pulling the velcro off while she’s walking so I have to keep adjusting them
3.0,suggest you get 2 sizes over what you normally wear if you want baggy
3.0,[[VIDEOID:e063e356889ea0a5ab740e78525fa00a]] Gloves dirty
3.0,"XXL says 48 chest and 45 waist. I wear a 42 chest and 36 waist and this coat was too small. I couldn't button it. The rest of the fit was ""ok"" if I didn't gain an ounce. Unfortunately they don't have a XXXL"
3.0,for the money okay
3.0,"looks good. always looks better in the picture, but nice."
3.0,The fist time I wore this toe ring it came of and I lost it in a swimming pool. I could never get a solid griping fit. . It was pretty while it lasted ..lost the 2nd time I wore it in the pool on vacation
3.0,These shorts don't dry! I was expecting quick dry but after an hr they were still very wet.
3.0,Exactly as advertised.  Two rings with one detachable for car key/valet service and attractive.  Did add more bulk to the already sizable stuff on my key ring and added to the lump in my pants pocket.  Ended up detached and languishing in my desk drawer.
3.0,Every time i charge it for 2-3 hours when i turn it on  then the batteries are dead
3.0,To little in back
3.0,Too small to slip over my hand or wrist without a struggle and then the band pops off.  I consider myself as having average size hands and wrists but I guess not.
3.0,Larger than expected and I gave them to my daughter who wears a couple sizes bigger than myself.  Works great for a straighter shape and very comfortable.
3.0,Great price but you get what you pay for. After a few washes the button popped off. It is still wearable and not noticeable too much
3.0,In less than a year it fogged up....Trying to send it back to get it repaired.......
3.0,It’s alright for the price. Was a little big in the front.
3.0,THE STONE ACTUALLY POKES INTO YOUR SKIN
3.0,"Cosplay for the kid, cute but cut for a slender body. We got the largest size offered and still was a bit too small"
3.0,Fragile.
3.0,Followed recommended sizing guidelines and found these to be tight around the leg openings. one more size up may have been a better fit.
3.0,These are pretty sad quality. Opened the first pair and they broke. Have been VERY careful with the others and they seem okay so far...
3.0,Not long enough if you have a long torso! Fit is great other than that.
3.0,Even after adjusting to shortest length still about 1 inch longer than most other brands I have used
3.0,The shirt is tight in the breast area for a 3x. Love the fit otherwise.
3.0,"I ordered these shorts for my tall boyfriend, 6'7&#34;.  I was searching big and tall, and this popped up.  I should have triple-checked, but no way are these things for tall people.  They fit in the waist, just not a good length for him to wear anywhere but outside around the house.  The shorts were a good looking short, just wish they had tall sizes."
3.0,"This sleeper is absolutely adorable on my daughter.  The fabric is soft and the colors didn't fade in the wash.  The footie size is also more realistic than other brands with huge feet.  This is especially important for walkers (my daughter is off the charts tall and walked at 10 months).  On the downside, you can't put these in the dryer, and the zipper isn't as sturdy as i'd like it to be.  It does run a size smaller, but i was prepared for that after reading a previous review and ordered accordingly."
3.0,I'm a size 14 and I bought this dress in a large. A medium would have worked better since the dress has plenty of room. I just see myself wearing this dress to lounge around the house or to run a quick errand.
3.0,"The long shoulder strap broke right away. I fixed that. Then, the hand strap came undone. I bought a new rivet and made it work as well. It is pretty, but the inside feels like sandpaper and the straps are not made well at all."
3.0,I put them on and there ok I wish the lens were smaller
3.0,"I really did like this design, but unfortunately I listened too much to other reviews and ordered a size up. For me, I needed my regular size. I did return this item and re-ordered the correct size."
3.0,It didn't fit like i wanted it to
3.0,"This shirt is cute but kind of awkward. Each color (black, white, stripes) is a different piece of fabric stitched together so where each one meets there is a seam and is kind of awkward."
3.0,Cute but cheap feel to fabric. It is more of beach attire. I would not wear this to a party. I love the look but party clothing should be with better fabric. Very nice fit for my summer  beach vacation.Over priced  beach dress.
3.0,Love it but the color but I’ll keep it anyway
3.0,"Love this concept, but these are not very well made. The screws keep backing out, and I had one of the lens crack."
3.0,"These would be five star if the seams of them hadn’t already started to come apart. Great fit and feel, but I’ve only worn these a handful of times and they’re already falling apart."
3.0,You get what you pay for. They are cute but aren't going to last long. Very light weight. I will wear until they fall apart because they are fun.
3.0,"I usually wear a xlarge. I went up to a XXlarge. The shirt fit good, but the pants was way to big. Its a good thing that I know how to sew. Oll be taking the pants up"
3.0,Ordered to a PO Box but they shipped UPS which made for a bit of a hassle... nice hat but only fits on the smallest setting and I usually wear a large so be prepared for that. Color is also brighter than in the photo for the pink... .. .
3.0,It's dated 2015.
3.0,Got a hole in the pocket after a couple washes. Not very thick. Good for spring or fall.
3.0,Tiene un huequito la tela
3.0,"They feel a bit thin, not sure if that means they will wear out quickly. They fit well and are comfortable!"
3.0,It's cute and all but I only wore it about 3 times before the chain broke. I can still use it as a decoration at least.
3.0,Rubs tooooo small
3.0,'This bracelet was not what it appeared to be on Amazon and I won't be buying this again and the stretching is so weak
3.0,It is a little to big and I consider my head as average size. :)
3.0,"The main reason I really love about this bag is with a lot of zipper pockets. It is the right size for my every day use and the price is afordable. The bag is light and material seems to be durable. The only downside which I would hope they can improve is their packqging way. I can understand how they want to save their shipping cost with smaller package, however, folding a good size bag in the very tiny box with so many zippers on are not really a good idea. I found all my zippers got stuck on where the fold lines are. Zipping and unzipping are not smoothly as how they shoud be. I will need to use two hands or with some force to zip and unzip. Will give it more days to try and see if this problem can be corrected for time being."
3.0,Cute but kind of bulky
3.0,"Dawgs size 8 fit me perfectly. These in size M are too short but to go up in size would be too long and too wide.  In addition, if the bottom of your foot is moist, you will slip out of the shoe too easily."
3.0,"It was a good fit, color was good.  Wish the pockets were deeper."
3.0,"Very small in circumference.  My daughter is very petite, 5'3'' and weighs about 95lbs and is very snug on her."
3.0,"I order these for my grandson who refuses to wear a winter jacket in MA. Keeps him warm but sometimes the zippers break.  They are warm, look great."
3.0,thick fabric and not breathable. The print started to peel quickly.
3.0,Haven’t received this yet. I’m hopeful it will come soon as it’s cute looking
3.0,"I guess ultra light means ultra light. When the visor came it arrived all crooked in the front part of the visor. As I was manipulating it to straightEn it, I noticed how flimsy it was compared to all the other visors I own. It didn’t help that it was sent in a plastic bag instead of a box. It’s very nice looking, of course, and it’s lightweight like the name says. I have no idea how long it will last. That’s why I gave it 3 stars."
3.0,"These panties are of good quality but are too small, especially after washing.  The size I bought is my normal size."
3.0,"It’s ok for kids bday party, not for adults and very cheap made."
3.0,"From a distance this is a beautiful watch, however if you were to closely inspect it you will find flaws. It's pretty but made with very cheap materials and will wear out. So if you are just looking for a cheap but pretty watch that you can bang up and not worry about then this is it."
3.0,The material is very cheap even though it fits nice etc.. zippier gets stuck as well.
3.0,The arms on the shirt were shorter than expected. Prolly need to size up.
3.0,Very disappointed.  I was looking for a summer cotton dress.  The ad says it is 100% cotton.  The tag on the garment says it is 89/11 Nylon/Elastin but that can't be correct.  It feels like poly/rayon to me.  It is certainly not cotton.  I washed it and it is staticky.  Cotton doesn't get static.  Cotton dress...FALSE.
3.0,Average shoe
3.0,The stone is a very dark green.  More like a stone than a crystal.  Not sure what you are looking for but I was looking for a crystal.  I like the adjustable cord but it wouldn't stay where I adjusted it too.  It kept loosening up on its own and then the one side would be longer than the other.
3.0,Very disappointed with not having both cup pads in bag with bra. Only one was enclosed with bra. I’m hoping this will be an easy fix. Other than that it is very pretty and soft and I think will work fine once pieces are complete.
3.0,Would have been perfect but its huge! I ordered a small and its about the size of a large. I am 5'4&#34; 125lbs
3.0,I luv it.  Wish it came in black also.
3.0,Like a tee shirt not a sweater
3.0,I love me toe ring
3.0,"it is what it is, a costume. I was actually searching for a real dress made out of quality velvet, But this was all I could find. Its a cheap costume. No worse than any other costumes out there."
3.0,Si me agradó pero la talla viene pequeña
3.0,I’m 5’5” +/- 135 pounds. The large fit me well but was a little loose. Good for layering. The latch’s on the front have a strong hold for a lot of movement.
3.0,It's ok pants to small
3.0,If you are between sizes order up a size. They run small!
3.0,"Quality is not great, but the style and fit are as expected."
3.0,"The fabric of this lightweight Henley shirt is comfortable and silky. It states on the tag that the top is 95% cotton and 5% spandex, but the texture feels more like a synthetic. The six functional snap buttons at the neck mean you can leave some buttons undone. I found the top well-made because the seams were even, and there were no loose threads. It hit me at mid-hip length (I’m 5’2”.) Care instructions show the piece is machine washable and dryable.<br />The only issue I had with the top was the sizing. I usually wear a small, sometimes a medium, but I wear a large in this Henley. This large fit me snugly, too. A smaller size wouldn’t have worked. If you usually wear a medium or large, you might find that the available sizes are too tight."
3.0,It works fine but is loud.  I can not keep it in my bedroom because it keeps me up at night.  You know the old saying you get what you pay for.
3.0,"nice style and color, fits well, comfortable. However, arrived without the tie for the cowl neck = poor quality control"
3.0,"I like these shirts, they are just a bit small to wear to workout in. Was looking for something a little more flowy."
3.0,"Well, I hate to ruin the party, as I really wanted to love these pajamas and give them as a Christmas gift, but honestly the stitching flaws are multiple . As you can see from my photos, I would be embarrassed to gift these to someone. So, I’ll find a relative or friend who might want them. They feel super silky and soft and I’m pretty bummed out on the quality. I’m sure it’s a hard fabric to work with, but still …  So, it seems like most people love these,  but this is my experience."
3.0,"I liked the eye, but the chain is too dark."
3.0,See the long sleeves in the picture?  They are exactly as shown.  Somehow I missed this.  I know people like that.  I don't.  Gave it to my son's girlfriend.
3.0,The quality was good it just kept falling off my neck
3.0,3.5 stars. Still getting used to the fit which is somewhat snug at the toes and feels like slight pressure. The toe box for be a little deeper.
3.0,Fit was bad
3.0,Comes in Asian size.
3.0,"I received only 4 of the keychains. I ordered 5. And instead of a 5th keychain, i received a cheap hat instead. What is the meaning of this!? Now I'm one gift short for Father's day!"
3.0,"I had thought this had a velcro backing to put on my husband's hat. It did not and I sent it back. If you need just the patch, it is nice!"
3.0,Don’t recommend.
3.0,"For being plus size, the waist band digs a little too snug for me"
3.0,"bought 3-4T for my 2 and a half yo, barely covers her butt and it barely buttons around her waist. I bought this last month so I dont know if shell be able to wear for Christmas"
3.0,Looks like it was made for a little girl
3.0,"I bought these going they'd offer me a little more modesty when I go to the gym, since i wear shorts and a tank top.  I ordered them in XXL, thinking they'd surely shrink once washed.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I opened the package.  These things are pretty tiny.  I am currently a size 10/12, and they fit me like a WOMAN'S XL would fit...which, I guess in men's sizes would equal to somewhere in between a medium and a large. And that's before washing!<br /><br />Also, the cut is really odd.  As a woman, I obviously have much thinner shoulder widths than most men. These actually seem to be cut too narrow in the neckline/armhole region.  In other words, if you have ever seen the back shoulder area of a &#34;racerback&#34; tank top, that's kinda how these are cut both in the front AND back.  So, since they are cut narrow there but then jut out and are cut straight in the stomach area, they look really frumpy.<br /><br />I know I'm a female buying a male's item, but this isn't my first time trying on unisex clothing, so...yeah. The fit is weird.  Given the narrow cut of the shoulder width and the small size of the items overall, I think these were definitely made in Asian sizes--which are often 3-4 sizes smaller than US size.<br /><br />The good:<br />The material is great.  Not at all flimsy or light, has a great &#34;hand&#34; to it (in other words, very soft...before washing, as i can't yet say how they'll feel once they shrink and the sizing is removed).  It's quality knit fabric--something I do actually know a bit about since I've been sewing apparel for thirty five years."
3.0,"It was made poorly, the strap has a flimsy plastic price which came apart while I was trying it on. Cute dress, was big for the size. I ordered a small. I'm 5'2"" I weigh 110 lb. Maybe have an extra small option, and better quality plastic for straps<br />I gave it 3 stars because I had to return it due to the hardware being flimsy and breaking."
3.0,"It's cold this time of year in the Pacific Northwest, so I hoped this would be good to hold off the winter chill. It actually looks really cheap, like a low end stuffed toy. It does feel warm, like, sweat-inducing warmth. It made me overwhelmingly hot and sweaty, then itchy. I just can't recommend this at all."
3.0,The shirt was nice but I ordered a medium and received a large. So I had to return it. But the quality seemed good.
3.0,"Cute sandals, but the shoe is way too narrow!"
3.0,"I got it sooner than expected! but as soon as i tried it on, the seams ripped. other than that it's a very pretty product and the price is amazing! i will order again but i suggest that you order a size bigger than you are because a medium doesn't fit as well as it should, and i'm not very big."
3.0,"This pants are nice,  I tried them on and they were very long, had to hem them up.  Now they are perfect, ordered a medium, 5""4."
3.0,I ordered Large sized n it is way smaller and won't fit on me. The item is nice though
3.0,Not bad for the price. The padding is kinda bulky.
3.0,Fabric was thin knit. I usually wear a size 6<br />andedium was too small
3.0,"Skirt runs small, the waist on the medium is 12 inches. Fabric and cut are ok, a little on the longer side."
3.0,I really liked the product but make sure you order a size larger. I had to loosen the strings but I finally got it on.
3.0,"Very nice quality, but did not fit as expected! Size up!"
3.0,Not what I expected but I still like it
3.0,This is much heavier than it looks.
3.0,It was missing one small gem...but I think I only notice...and the price is great...fun piece.
3.0,The color is not rose gold. It's more like a yellow gold with a faint hint of rose. The clear stones are unnaturally large. These are unique earrings and aren't terrible to look at so I gave them 3 stars rather than 2. Just don't expect them to look like the picture.
3.0,"Comfortable and good quality pant. Length was much longer than expected compared to images shown. I am 5'6"" and bottom of pant legs bunch up several inches at ankle. I will have to hem the pants to fit as shown/desired."
3.0,Not the best quality. Overpriced.
3.0,Runs pretty larger.  Also didn't look as cute in real life vs the pictures. They have a little bit of a trashy look to them
3.0,Brighter then I thought.  Style is nice. Style is nice unhappy with the color.
3.0,I loved this shirt but it runs way small. I was so disappointed because I was looking forward to wearing it the next day.<br />I need a large BUT if I order a large then the neckline will be way too loose fitting . It's like a boat neck and they show the model with long hair that covers the neckline up. There shouldn't be anything covering up any part of the shirt so buyers can see everything they are getting.<br />I really wanted to love it and I would if it fitted right.
3.0,The nightgown itself is adorable but we're incredibly disappointed because we ordered a purple nightgown for a specific reason and it's pink.
3.0,"While the cut of the dress was cute, the material was very thin and showed bra lines and such.  I bought it for work, so I had to return it."
3.0,"I liked the dress. I ordered xl. Still a little tight on my ""fupa"" with shapewear but i will reorder and go up another size. Rose color on me i didnt like so i will order another color."
3.0,"it isnt very snug around my head, I only use them when i wear contect lenses and driving. so thats why i kept them. I feel these were made for heavy headed guys because the sides barely touch my head. its the first time I bought sunglasses for men and had this problem. You cant beat the price for them though and since they are for driving only I can live with that."
3.0,Quality poor. Looks cheap
3.0,Beautiful little dress...but very short and extremely small.
3.0,"Es demasiado elástico, tuve que ajustarlo con modista- costurera. soy 36 , talla 8  compre Large y no cubre bien, pero igual es ancho se expande. La copa no cubre bien.  Si eres como la modelo te debe ajustar uno pequeño."
3.0,If you have big breast this is a no go....everywhere it fits great but it's to small in the chest area
3.0,"Really awesome design but one leg is longer than the other, by a lot. And its a weird fit uptop"
3.0,"Bought a large for my skinny, petite daughter and it barely fit her.<br />Can we come to some kind of agreement in the clothing industry on sizes please?? Otherwise what.is.the.point in putting sizes??"
3.0,"I ordered two sizes up from my measurements because it said it ran small, but it still wouldn't zip."
3.0,The fabric content is very shiny and cheap looking not Happy at all 😡
3.0,Light weigh is jacket Perfect cover-up not good for warmth But perfect accent
3.0,This shirt is super cute and the fit is amazing. Would have given 5 stars but the hem is on the outside in the front of the shirt. So disappointed
3.0,gift but did not fit like nomal size M should
3.0,"They were cool and cute, brother in-law wanted terminator glasses, couldn't find actual ones so got this, could tell he didn't like them though. completely plastic."
3.0,"I was so excited to receive these toe rings. Unfortunately, after day two of wearing them, one of them had broke, and the other one's rhinestones fell out. Disappointed."
3.0,"Was all set to give 5 stars because of the molded cups. I hate removable pads. The second time I was putting on, the strap seem ripped from the loop attached to the back. Guess I’ll sew it back together myself."
3.0,"I would have given a better rating as these are super cute and I got lots of compliments on them! They are easy to carry around and fold down, they fit nicely in the cart while opened, and hold heavy items making them easier to carry a lot at once. My only issue is that the insulation part ripped off after only 2 months of (heavy) use! For the cost of the two I would have hoped for more durable insulation material."
3.0,It has a very strong plastic smell
3.0,I sent this back to them because the stone is gone out of the necklace & there was no ring they send it back to me Why I don't know that either
3.0,These are adorable house shoes but definitely run quite large. I have trouble walking in them bc they are too big. They are actually really comfy and cozy otherwise and would order again in a smaller size.
3.0,Very pretty but runs small. I would order a size up to be on the safe side
3.0,JEANS ARE CUTE BUT THEY RUN VERY SMALL. I ORDERED A SIZE UP AND STILL TO SMALL
3.0,Great gloves but can’t be used with a touchscreen
3.0,"The sleeves are quite short so I opted to send it back. It's a cute shirt, but you need to be aware that it's more of a 3/4 sleeve than a full sleeve."
3.0,Very fragile. Was only able to wear once
3.0,The top fit as expected however the bottoms were kinda large and wasnt that stretchy material I expected.
3.0,I loved this shirt however the white color was see through and it defeats the purpose of a cool shirt for summer if you have to wear a tank underneath
3.0,"yes they are X-Small, a lot smaller than I expected."
3.0,"Fits overall, except where the toes and the feet connect. I still experience some sliding, so I would actually recommend going with the ones where your toes are exposed."
3.0,Cute skirt but more of a burnt orange than red.
3.0,I’m usually a small but I had to return mine to get an extra small. I’m 5’8 and have really Legs so I really liked that these actually fit length wise.
3.0,Nice quality shirt. The fit is wrong
3.0,"The cut is nice, fits as expected but the fabric is not soft, it's kind of rough and scratchy."
3.0,It’s a very nice casual dress. I’m a petite woman.<br />Cheat 32”<br />Waist 25”<br />Hip 34”<br />Height 5’-8”<br />Small was very loose. I took it in and it fits perfectly.<br />I can sew so I knew how to remove elastic gatherers at hip and replace. If I didn’t know how to do that I wouldn’t have been able to take in the dress and maintain the style.
3.0,"I am 5’9” and normally wear a size 11/12. I read reviews that says this fits larger so I got my normal size. It arrived and fits my body/shake but is short in length. So I would have to get a size larger for length. Otherwise totally cute in person, nice and comfy material. I just wish it didn’t have footies because this would have been great and I wouldn’t need to return"
3.0,"Not for ""you know what"" club."
3.0,"Great color and stretch material.  However, this runs extremely small.  No amount of stretch can make this top fit.  Item was returned."
3.0,These are jus OK. Not optically clear like Oakley brand. Kind of foggy.
3.0,Hat was too large
3.0,Not sure they should really be described as &#34;cat eye.&#34;
3.0,"these are prettier then picture, they are very heavy though"
3.0,Cute shirt but the material was not as soft as I would have liked
3.0,The glasses don't shield my eyes from the sun the way I thought they would. I have some cheaper ones I bought at Walgreens and they are much darker and work better but they don't look as good as the Barricade glasses do.  Also the Barricade glasses broke after wearing them for a week.
3.0,They are ok 👌
3.0,Did not for well.
3.0,Faded print.
3.0,I got this as a present for my son he wears a medium or large and his neck is 16 I got him a xxl and the neck was still to small. The material felt cheap and plastic like. The pattern was beautiful though.
3.0,Fit fine.  Color good.  Starting to pil.  Elastic on edges is fraying too.
3.0,My grandmother loved it.
3.0,"I just couldn’t make the left and right side brim to match, so it didn’t look like I am wearing it crooked. I did wonder what would happen if I folded like it said I could for travel (like 12 hours in a trunk during flights)"
3.0,The design was fantastic it just came to me wrinkled.
3.0,Size is much smaller than expected. It is missing the button from the top/back that holds the top part up. Now I have to go buy a button small enough that fits the loop om the other side. Otherwise I love the style.
3.0,"The dress is beautiful but the sizing is definitely off. I ordered a size 10-12 and it was much more like a 6-8. If you have a larger bust, it may not work for you. The buttons are also very weak and I feel they would pop off with one wrong move.  Another fair warning is I ordered the yellow dress, and what I recieved looke different from the picture. Much more beige and less yellow."
3.0,Wrong size was sent but I didn’t notice until too late. Colors are nice.
3.0,"I returned these, they were too big and pretty cheap looking."
3.0,"Shirt runs small, pants run big"
3.0,Rubber grips over ears keep falling off
3.0,"Cute bathing suit, but the cup size is the same regardless of the size you order."
3.0,I ordered it for my grandson for Christmas I like the fact that they are water less  and suppose to be comfortable
3.0,"Gloves for snug, but when I tried them on there was already a hole in the side. I just had to stitch that up and I haven't had a problem since."
3.0,Material is very hot. Feels like plastic.
3.0,nice for the price paid. one segment was a little off center
3.0,It's OK but very cheap looking. Will see how long it last.
3.0,It was great for around 2 months but then the tab to hold the access strap broke off. Even without that it still works and feels a lot more comfortable than the original band.
3.0,"Well, as others have said, if you can keep them on your feet, they are great. I tried all 3 pairs this week and went 0 for 3. None of them stayed on my heels, including one or two that didn’t even stay as I walked from my kitchen to my car.<br /><br />I’m hoping that I can shrink them or something so that they will stay on my heels. Otherwise they would be awesome! Didn’t show at all with my shoes which was awesome.<br /><br />I actually liked that there isn’t much in the bottom, only over the toes and the heels. If I wanted a whole sock, I’d wear one.<br /><br />If I have any success keeping them on my heels, I’ll update my review!"
3.0,The gold leaf belt broke the second time i wore it; It's held together with glue. Other than that the belts look as expected.
3.0,Little tighter than I like but they will work.
3.0,Received this bag today and unfortunately it looks like it's been poorly made. The bag is not symmetrical. I am returning this item and getting the olive suede bag.
3.0,Very cute but very small. Hoops are so tiny that it’s hard to put them on! Going to gift them to a child.
3.0,"They are OK, but I prefer a fully closed foot and a color that does not show wear with the first wash. I would not order them, because of that preference and because the white starts getting grayish when washed.<br /><br />Price:  At ~$15 for a 2-pack the price is reasonable (not a bargain).<br /><br />Color: The white is a true white out of the wrapping, but has started to get slightly off-color with washing.  This is a risk with white tights. The dark color from my black dance shoes does not come out either.<br /><br />Sizing: The XL (or womens S/M) is a snug fit for someone 5'4"" and 110lbs.  They look tiny, but but expand tremendously.  So ... don't be concerned if when you open them you think you were sent the wrong size.  They are sufficient in length and snugness to stay put well.<br /><br />Style: I prefer a full sock on the feet vs the open pad, but it is as shown on the website."
3.0,"This sweat shirt is comfortable and very cute, but EXTREMELY small. I ordered an XXL after reading other people’s reviews, and it fit my sister who ususally wears a small or medium."
3.0,was an okay tankini.
3.0,Reasonable in terms of quality and similarity to pic
3.0,"It is a nice - it looks like the picture, but the fabric is thin and paperish feeling"
3.0,Does a good job. The only thing I wish these did a bit of was airflow. Heat by its self doesnt reduce what's gonna make the shoes smell after drying out.
3.0,Item is very pretty. I am not pleased with the quality of the link chain.
3.0,Kind of tacky in person.
3.0,"I love the actual purse, but it showed up with two different stains right on the front around the metal rivets. I was able to get most of it off but there’s still a big stain front and center on the blue flap."
3.0,"The dress is okay. Not the worst but not what I was expecting either.<br />1. The “slip” under the dress is like paper towel consistency as opposed to being actual clothing fabric.<br />2. The “girdle” is part of the dress, not a separate thing so there is no back to it... which is sad because from behind the costume looks silly. I’m going to remedy that by getting some sort of shawl to hide this issue but now that’s me buying more things to make the costume look better<br />3. The fabric for the top is nice. It’s soft and very stretchy so if you got a bit of meat in places ya wish you didn’t, this won’t resist you which is great.<br />Was this worth the price? In my opinion no. I’ll be altering it in the future."
3.0,"Great colors, but not cotton.  Slippery and very thin material."
3.0,"Very pretty choker. It is just a bit deceiving in the photos and measurements for the neck size. I bought it for a 12 y/o and it was not even close to being a choker on her. Also the loop in back to secure it on was very very small compared to the other pearl you have to loop through it. It was hard to get it latched and even harder to get it unlatched. She was disappointed that it didn’t fit correctly.  None the less, it fit my adult neck as a choker nicely. The pearl is a nice color. Neither one of us has worn it so I cannot give a review as to how wear and tear is on the actual pearl."
3.0,"This is a great shirt! I ordered it in blue, and liked it so much that I ordered it in white. The white, however, almost looks light purple."
3.0,"The size of my ring finger is 5 and a half, so I ordered a 6. The ring that arrived had a tag on it that said &#34;Size 16&#34; and it fits on my pinkie, which is a size 4. I have no idea what size chart they're using, but whatever it is it's not what I was expecting."
3.0,i love it except for the non-adjustable chain which is really really long
3.0,Way too big for me but came quickly and are very nice
3.0,Run small and designed for short wasted people. Bottom of blouse it’s just a couple inches below the waist line.<br /><br />Tank top does not come with the blouse you’ll need to add your own.<br /><br />Will keep it but will not be a stable item in the wardrobe due to sizing and lack of length
3.0,Cute style. Runs small  horribly horribly wrinkled. Major ironing needed. Not even washing it helped
3.0,It was great for my Halloween costume. But very difficult to breath in and talk in. I work in a medical office and am use to wearing masks by now. But this one was difficult. But was great for my costume.
3.0,It was a great deal protects my watch but it’s already starting to turn yellow. Not sure if I culprit but I have owned a clear watch in the past and it didn’t turn yellow.
3.0,"I have bought 2 pairs- one is great, the other is super see through. LOVE LOVE LOVE the green ones. I'm a legging snob and will pay good money for good leggings. These fit perfectly, have compression, don't ride down, and are squat proof. Feel like expensive leggings. I have some cellulite on my legs and butt and so I can almost never get away with wearing much besides black leggings without it showing through, but these light green ones hide it. I'm 5'6 145 pounds and got a medium.<br /><br />The black ones, though, are super see through and will be going back. Disappointed and unsure of why these two leggings are so different."
3.0,"It looked pretty solid for the price. It worked perfectly for my costume, and they did not fall out. They were easy to fit to my mouth.<br />They did alter my speech and make it difficult to pronounce some words, but it was fun overall. My gums started to get sore after about an hour of wear, so I had to take them out for a while.<br />Everyone was a fan of the look."
3.0,The frames where smaller than unwanted. I also thought the tint was brown not Yellow. But they’re cute
3.0,This belt stretches and stretches
3.0,These earrings are nice but way way to small
3.0,Cut small my son wanted it to be realy lose it's not it said I would get it Thursday few days later it said Friday so I left the house on Thursday and got a message that it was delivered.
3.0,They fit but they were really hard to get on because they weren't wide enough for my feet and they were uncomfortable to wear  so i had to send them back.
3.0,Cute top but you might want to order a size or two larger than what you would normally wear.
3.0,Wasn't expecting a spandex material. Size up because it is a little tight in the armpits. Other than that it was as described.
3.0,Very stretchy material and I where near as long as pictured on model. She must be 5'3 or smaller for it to be that long.
3.0,"I ordered these to wear at my outdoor wedding ceremony to wear with 4-inch stiletto heels. I was very disappointed when they arrived and I realized they were much too wide to fit around my heels. The product says they &#34;fit most heels,&#34; but they won't fit anyone's heels in the wedding party."
3.0,Okay quality.
3.0,ok...not great.  was a gift.
3.0,What is not as thin as described. But good watch though.
3.0,They fit ok but not great on my bigger arms.
3.0,"The fabric is not cotton, holds in body heat and slides up into my eyes."
3.0,I am not gonna say it is a bad product but keep it in mind that the bottom runs big and the top runs small. Not a comfortable suit.
3.0,Great weight but way too tight for me. I’m always an xl for loose fitted T-shirt’s. Unfortunately there is no bigger size. My bust is approximately 44” which fit but any shrinking would’ve been too match and the waist was much tighter than I’d wanted.
3.0,"These socks are just okay.  They are cute, not very thick and made for smaller feet."
3.0,It fit but I returned it bc I was expecting the bottoms to be tight like joggers and they were loose.
3.0,"The slippers are very comfortable, but they are hugh and very wide.  If you wear a size 9 shoe, I'd order the small.<br />I gave them to my husband who has extra wide feet and wears a size 11.  I had ordered the medium for a woman's size 9-10.5 and men's size 7.5-8.5."
3.0,I’m a size C cup and my breasts were busting out of the seams. Otherwise it fit perfectly everywhere else. I ended up giving the dress to my daughter.
3.0,"Picture looks more of a true red.  It is more coral red (more towards orange spectrum)  Purchased this for my wife because she was looking for a red necklace, needless to say she has to wear it with salmon or orange color outfits.  Good quality necklace, color is not RED!"
3.0,"This dress fits as described, the color was lovely, and it's comfortable but the fabric is like a thin T shirt and I didn't love the drape.  It just wasn't flattering. You would need to wear this with leggings or tights because it's too sheer without."
3.0,The circumference of the band is snug.
3.0,"Nice top, but I will only be able to wear it with high waisted pants. It's ok."
3.0,"I wish I knew if it was doing anything, I'm just not really sure. Nice quality, relatively slim"
3.0,I had a problem handling them due to size of backing
3.0,"I loved the cut and the color, it fell just right at the ankle, but I could not zip it past my chest and based on previous orders and the basic knowledge of my body it should have fit!! I was sooooo disappointed because it was beautiful!"
3.0,"Not sure why the product tag at the collar was cut off.  If there is nothing wrong with it, I should be able to see brand and all other information."
3.0,"These are very cute shoes that fit as expected, but the little metal piece over the bow fell off on the first day of wear, it wasn't too hard to put back on, but I felt the first day was a little soon for them to be falling apart."
3.0,El producto no es de mala calidad por el contrario me gustó mucho. Le doy 3 estrellas porque no me llegó la talla ni los colores que pedí.
3.0,"I would give it 4, but you'll need to order at least 2 sizes larger than indicated"
3.0,its more like a crop not a tank top
3.0,I love these but oh my goodness!!! They don't breathe!! My whole face was sweating profusely because these masks don't allow your face to breathe. I can only wear them when it's cold outside.
3.0,Disappointed Quality Not sturdy Enough LENS A BIT TOO BIG
3.0,Returned...extremely tight elastic...difficult to navigate over body parts.
3.0,"The dress is definitely cool and comfy and the pockets are what sold me.  Fabric has slightly more sheen than I'd prefer but this would be less an issue if the ""Army Green"" color was a closer match to the image I see onscreen.  The one I received is several shades lighter.  Since I favor a darker army green, I already have several items in that color and this dress is a much lighter shade than any of them.  Another downside is that it seemed to acquire a vague stain in front upon first wearing that did not wash out.<br /><br />My wish would be a similar dress, with pockets, in mid-calf length or longer, with optional sizing for *petite* heights, but haven't seen one like that on Amazon."
3.0,"Pros: This mask works great!  I ran 4 miles today and haven’t breathed as easily since before I started masking up.<br /><br />Cons:  it doesn’t fit and is extremely uncomfortable.  I have a normal to small size face, and bought the large.  It was way too small.  They will let me return it, but because it’s worn, I would get half credit.  So $40 + $6 shipping, + $6 return shipping, I am out $52 and would get $20 back.  Seems like they know you will be unhappy and structure this to put the cost on you instead of standing behind it.  There are lots of other masks that don’t cost so much.  They might not work as good, but at the price I wouldn’t recommend risking the fit."
3.0,"These headbands are cute and worked for my 4yo Christmas spirit week. However, the elf hats flop forward a little bit and seem a little too heavy."
3.0,It is not stretchy so not as comfortable as other ones I have.  It is kind of stiff.
3.0,"Super cute & just what i wanted , but i had an allergic reaction and couldn't wear them for more than a couple hours"
3.0,"Product good, but much delayed delivery."
3.0,"Runs incredibly large and long, big arm holes. I bought an XL, I could comfortably wear a medium in this. Thin material, which is what I wanted. I'll wear it around the house."
3.0,"Love the syle if the suit. HOWEVER the I'm big at the bottom and smaller up top. The bottoms fit perfectly, but I have to figure out some way to make the top fit smaller. You should be able to mix and match the tops and bottom to fit your needs. I'm going out of of town and may have to find another suit to wear."
3.0,Needed a little bigger one even though I am only a C cup.  Buy one size up from what you think.
3.0,This is Robert's wife.  I'm the one that ordered the tights.  I have several other pairs of CW-W tights.  The fabrication on these tights are thinner.  Not my favorite pair of CW-X tight.  Probably won't buy them again
3.0,There was nothing wrong with these glasses except for the description. They were described as small round gold glasses. They are actually more of a medium round rose gold. The lenses were too big for the costume look I was trying to avhieve.
3.0,"I though the socks were OK for the price.  They are not thick at all, just average.  One note through, that these socks are large in size.  If you have a size 10 or bigger these socks would fit you but anything under that wouln't fit well at all."
3.0,Material is a bit on the thinner side
3.0,They're nice but don't really like the texture of the bags though.
3.0,I went out and bought a measuring tape to make sure i ordered the right size and theyre too large. Why isnt there an antislip strip on the bottom?
3.0,These were very good for the money but they are just too small for adults (which is what we needed). But they fit the little kids we gave them to perfectly!
3.0,Way too tight on the face. Headband doesn’t stay on properly. was quite disappointed in this set.
3.0,I like that it uses filters<br />I like it’s color<br />I dislike that it does not stay in place when knotted only the back<br />The slick fabric easily slides<br />It is hot<br />ear straps might help<br />Doubt I will wear it
3.0,"I had order XL but received a small, luckily it was my daughter-in-law’s birthday so I was able to add it to her gift. Cute for a younger person anyways."
3.0,Its a cute little bikini but the top does not help your figure... Its okay for what you are buying so I would recommend this item to someone with a skinny body or thin back.
3.0,Hoodie is too small for a 4x
3.0,Measured my child’s head per the sizing chart. Chart shows the hat will fit my child. The hat is a little large and lose on my child’s head.
3.0,"This was way to small for a large man.  They are pretty clear that it doesn't fit normal US sizes so please be careful ordering.<br /><br />That said, the customer support people were very nice and promptly offered a refund so I would recommend ordering if you are looking for a low cost jersey, and small enough that this will fit you."
3.0,Absolutely WRINKLED from packaging--hard to iron the pleats!!!
3.0,These were cute but just didnt like the way they fit my body..i need lower waisted pants to feel comfortable and these kinda felt to short in the crotch area...but they were well made and really adorable.  I sent back
3.0,I had high hopes for this necklace but it just feels cheap. I love costume jewlery but this let me down. In the picture this looks just a little more solid than what i recieved. And while wearing it there is no way to get the necklace to lay as pictured. Most likely wouldn't purchase again.
3.0,the mask was good but it was huge on my 14 year old daughters face if it would have fit her right it would be a good mask but I saw in another review that it fit there six year old maybe the masks have size differences but it was way to big on her.
3.0,Fits a bit larger than expected. I would order a size down ... totally cute tho!
3.0,Like the logo but pretty sure the description said 100% cotton. Seems more like some kind of polyester blend. Be wary.
3.0,"This shirt does not have a lot of structure due to the tissue weight material. It fits overly loose, and I think, unless I wear a jacket or a sweater, it looks very frumpy. I probably could go down two sizes and still fit. The only reason I am not returning this is that I like soft shirts. I can also wear it around the house to clean, because it feels like a nighshirt. I have not washed it yet, and I think it will shrink over time."
3.0,"So I bought these because I going shelling a lot since moving to Florida and my feet were getting torn up on big piles of shells. I was super excited to get them but, the excitement was snuffed out pretty quick. I was very careful about the size I ordered because as most of us know it's pretty pointless to return anything online unless it's over $20, since the majority of the time you pay return shipping. So when I put them on I was pretty bummed that they were at least a size to big. When I got to the beach and wore them for the first time one of the insoles kept slowly creeping up the back of the shoe until it was flapping in the breeze. So I kept taking it off and shoving it back in. When I got home I decided to take out the insoles and that's when I noticed they had 2 different insoles. So I definitely got what I paid for!! My bad, hopefully others don't make my mistake."
3.0,The fit around the arms is just too big. I’ll have to wear layers when wearing this top as to not expose myself. I should have retuned it but missed the return date.
3.0,Can't really see that this is helping on my rides.
3.0,Super cute!! Don't seem to hold together well but you get what you pay for I guess...
3.0,"It runs big and it's extremely long . I'm a small and I'm 4-11&#34; tall  , the small fits like a medium! If they had an x-small maybe it would have been perfect."
3.0,"I like the product. It is very cute, but does break easily. My broke with in a couple months. I didn't have it on every day, just when I didn't have my case on. Still a good product though. :)"
3.0,Bought this for my friend it would not stay on her head but it was beautiful tho
3.0,I really wanted to wear one of them and it fell apart. So disappointed. Waste of money.
3.0,"I was hoping the shade of purple was a bit richer.  I was trying to match it to a sweater but there was not enough plum in it. The actual colors are not a good match to the picture provided.  Having said that, I like the size and they are not too heavy so plan to keep them."
3.0,"Like the color , runs big"
3.0,"It came a surprise to me with three rings not one. So that being said it’s definitely a cheap made. It’s cute, but it doesn’t have the chiseled band as the picture shown."
3.0,Even after washing the lace in this nightgown is very irritating. It is on t h e smaller size.
3.0,"I was surprised to feel how soft these were.<br /><br />I purchased 3. 2 were gifts and the black based one with the cream geometric pattern one was for me. It looks and feels much more expensive that what you pay for.<br /><br />The reason why I give it 3 stars is it has very excessive shedding. I happened to wear it to a Christmas event draped over one shoulder of my black suit. It looked great. Then as I turned my mom said, “you have lint all over you”. My suit was clean so I was confused where it would come from. Then I lifted the area where the scarf was and it looked like I dipped half of my jacked in a bin of loose Labrador’s retriever hair. I couldn’t eve take it off at that point because it was so bad.<br /><br />The lighter ones might not be as noticeable on similar tones clothes. But since this is black with contrast cream, no matter what you wear it over the contrast of both of the colors will be very noticeable.<br /><br />I wanted to love this so much. The designs are beautiful (thanks to Hermés),  The price and feel is great. I would have loved to give it 5 stars but the shedding is so much that I can’t wear this scarf over anything."
3.0,you have to wear something under it as the arm holes are way to big and you can see everything.  Gave it away
3.0,Too small my girl use it like shirt
3.0,"It’s super cute! I think I’m going to return it because it’s way shorter and wider than I imagined, I got a large on a whim because it was half the price of the others and just isn’t the style I was hoping for, nothing wrong with it other than just not what I was expecting, it’s thin but comfy!"
3.0,It was cute but way too big and bulky. Maybe it just didn't fit my face.
3.0,"Adorable, but read the size chart, measure, and go up at least one size. My 21 month old wears a 6, we got a 6.5 since it said they run small, and although she can wear these, a 7 would have been much better. Any chance the taupe will come back in stock so we can reorder?"
3.0,"Fast shipping and works great. Only reason preventing me from giving it 5 stars is the umbrella doesn't click into place easily when opened. I have to mess with it a bit and find the right spot. Other than that it is a decent size, closes great and stands in its own."
3.0,Mystery fabric for a dress that is definitely NOT appropriate for “semi-formal”.  Don’t people understand what basic things mean anymore?
3.0,"I am looking for something to replace my 2 current hydration vests for many reasons. I bought this one mainly because I wanted to try out the collapsable bottles and the fact that it is lightweight. I will say that it is lightweight. But that's about it. Oh, it did hold my iPhone 8 (barely and without the case) in the zippered pocket. That was almost a plus until you realize that you won't be getting your phone out fast at all. The fit was not very good. It seemed long on me. With the bottles in the front it hung down almost to my waist so very uncomfortable. I didn't use a bladder because I didn't need one so I put my jacket in the pocket when I got hot. It barely fit. Wouldn't have fit anything in the back pocket if I had a bladder in it. I really do not recommend."
3.0,I guess I am a xxxl run really small
3.0,I could not write one sentence to describe this product. It is so wide it is like it is made for a football player. The cup would fit on my head. The suggestion for size does not work for me. I never send anything back  I just try to find someone to give the product to.
3.0,thought they were bigger but still nice
3.0,Order size up - slightly tight.
3.0,The pants were shorter than I would have liked
3.0,Too big & very very thin.
3.0,not my favorite fit
3.0,Don’t stay on the frame I’m my eye glasses and I had to see it on but it still came off
3.0,Not a fan of the pattern up close .
3.0,"Good color and nice length, but the lining material felt cheap. It seemed like it was the same stuff they make kids costumes out of in mass production."
3.0,I was excited about this black and white outfit but when I pulled the top out and put it on I noticed what looks like red lipstick on the right breast cover up. The pants fit great hides my Mommie pouch. Will be requesting an exchange for an in used outfit
3.0,"The quality is good, and I would have liked this dress if it even came close to fitting. I ordered one size larger as per the reviews. I'm a size 10, 148 pounds, 5'6&#34;. I should have ordered an XL. The L is way to small around the middle."
3.0,"The material is a little thin, not what I was expecting"
3.0,"It's a very cute jumper, but the top runs large.  I am not well endowed and have a hard time keeping the top portion from sagging down."
3.0,"I like the looks of the earrings, but trying to fasten them is a chore because they post moves around freely."
3.0,"The nose pieces are narrow and thin and after a few hours of wearing them, leave noticeable indentations that are quite painful.  Otherwise, they're good."
3.0,Nicely made. Pockets non functional. The reason I bought it. Hopefully I can make pockets so I can use it for what I bought it for. Something I can us for pockets.
3.0,"This is cute ,you can breathe easily through this material.<br />Started to come apart, in the stitching.<br />Used it less then 10 times .<br />Its priced right i would recommend for a special occasion or for traveling 😷✌"
3.0,"These sunglasses look pretty nice but have some pros and cons.<br />Pros: look nice, block out sun<br />Cons: make a creaky noise quite often due to being plastic, feel kinda cheap around the lenses because they feel like they pop around."
3.0,"As face coverings go, these ones are lightweight and will do the job of covering nose and mouth especially for those who find masks a bother. They have cute patterns and stretchy bands that do not rub skin behind the ear uncomfortably. They do not provide any extra filtration since it's just two layers of fabric. But something is better than nothing."
3.0,Nothing much to this boot. It was ok. There was not too much arch support.
3.0,It was a bit snug for my body.
3.0,The shirts were a disapointment. They lace was poorly stitched on. Very sloppy. I made w fold on the edge to hide the lace. Looked better the top was different from the one in the pic but still cute. It is long
3.0,The buckle broke as soon as I tried it on for the first time. Very beautiful though.
3.0,"This sweater is nice enough for the price. Color are pretty. The reason for only three stars is that, based on the picture, I expected it to be longer.  I am 5'7"", and it comes just to my hips, not longer as the picture shows."
3.0,"That's what she said. lol<br /><br />But seriously this clip is very tight fit and doing cash exchanges at the grocery store is not fun. It takes a lot of effort just to squeeze bills into this thing. I say only use cash if you want to make a one time massive wad of cash transaction with someone, and let them have the clip as interest to show you appreciate their business.<br /><br />Cards on the other hand glides through this thing like butter. It can fit 4 standard sized cards without bending the actually metal. Very easy to slide through your cards, pull out the one you want, do the transaction, and slide it in from the back.<br /><br />Cards/cash combo is not good as the resistance from the dollar bills lessen the functionality of the clip<br /><br />The clip itself is made of high quality material. Very nice to look at as it's very classy and visually appealing<br /><br />Also it comes with a small clinch pouch<br /><br />Overall not exactly what I call a money clip, rather a quick access card clip.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a honest review"
3.0,This picture doesn’t really look like the dress . It’s similar but definitely not the same . The material and color is the same and I still like the dress but there is no Seams around the bust .
3.0,"These are not the best sunglasses. They are oversized, but so much that they keep falling off my face. The nose pads don't help at all and constantly slide off my nose. The color is nice, but wouldn't wear these as actual sunglasses, more so for fashion than eye protection. The color is nice and the shape is ok, just wish they weren't as oversized as they are and actually protected your eyes from the sun, since they are not polarized."
3.0,"do not like the material, it's look to fake"
3.0,Was a heavier material than I expected.
3.0,It really hard to put on and take off without constantly adjusting the buckle.
3.0,"I normally purchase Buff headbands but I loved the color of this full sized headpiece and I couldn't pass up the incredible price. The fabric is not what you would expect from Buff and the fit is tight. Otherwise, the product is basically the same.  The color did not disappoint."
3.0,"This product was purchased for my daughter.  The socks come in various colors, which are nice. However, they are cheaply made and thinner than they appear from the picture."
3.0,It's cute but not good fit
3.0,Shoulda got a bigger size but I’ll stick this one out
3.0,"The watch is nice!  Bought this for my teenage grandson and he loves it.  However, the watch band is too small for him.  The watch band was too small for my daughter and granddaughter also.  We are now searching for a watch band that will work with the watch.  The sad part about the band not fitting is, the fact, that it has the bat symbol on it and we can't find another one like it.  Once again, the watch itself is nice!  Just be aware of the fact that the watch band comes short, therefore it may not fit!"
3.0,"Its orange, not blaze orange. Not sure if it will be legal to wear for rifle hunting in Colorado. Stitching is not great as you can see in the picture.  I will send it back."
3.0,SUPER CUTE purse but a little disappointing. It  had an odd smell inside ... I had to leave a dryer sheet in it and one of those mini salt bags inside for 2 days to disguise the smell but even so I’m afraid the smell is slowly coming back
3.0,I have this to my boyfriend as a Valentine’s gift.  It looked great and he really liked it but it broke the first week.  He’s been gluing back together weekly because he wants to keep wearing it.
3.0,"Decent yoga pants if you don't want to fork up the money for quality yoga pants from retailers such as lululemon. They are slightly thin which I don't mind especially if I'm doing hot yoga. However, I did notice certain body parts were more visible in these pants if you know what I mean."
3.0,"It was too large, I gave it away ."
3.0,Maybe a wood one would have worked?  But they are more expensive.<br />These are about an inch short.
3.0,Cute  ut runs really small and I read the measurements properly
3.0,This sweatshirt is cute but runs a little large. I love the smaller sleeves and wished they were long enough to have a thumb hole for extra coziness. It would be cute if it came in other colors as well.
3.0,"I didn't care for this.  I am 5'9"" and felt the sweater part ended too high, felt like I was wearing a half shirt style that did not feel age appropriate for me, nor professional.  I also felt the material was thin and cheap feeling.  Because the sweater part was so thin, it was obvious it was all one piece sewn together, which I didn't care for.  I live in a warm climate and was hoping this would work instead of wearing two long sleeve shirts, but in the future I will stick with buying two separate pieces."
3.0,runs small. Fabric feels a bit thin.
3.0,Fit's good on my disabled son.
3.0,"Runs small, a medium fit like a small, may be even an extra small. It's definitely sheer, and I'll wear as a swim cover up, wouldn't work as a dress. Cute and comfortable, fit was flattering."
3.0,"It is exactly what I wanted but... it is much too narrow for a large faced wristwatch 22MM and the band is quite small, I'm guessing 16 MM."
3.0,"I ordered one each of this brand (MY KILOMETRE) men's swim gear. 1. the Swim Brief. 2. This Swim Trunk.  and 3. the Swim Jammer.<br />I love the Brief and the Jammer a whole lot.  Each one certainly gives Speedo a run for their money, a high quality Swim garment for a reasonable price.  This trunk doesn't seem to be of the same quality as the Brief and the Jammer, The waist doesn't fit well, feels like it's just a string around my waist, and tends to roll over.  The legs curl up.  Maybe it's just me, or how it fits my body, but I have had other Swim Trunks that fit, feel, and look a lot better than this one.  I had thought the design pattern would look good, but I don't like how it looks when wearing it.  Again, to be fair, maybe that's just me, but I try to be fair and factual on these reviews.  Quality of construction seems good, but I don't like the ""cut"" (or construction design) of it.  I see most other reviews really liked it, so you may like it too, it does look great in the picture and the price is OK."
3.0,"I normally steer clear of products that don't have many reviews, but thought I'd take a chance on this one since the suit looked so cute.<br />This is a halter that ties in back.  I am somewhat midway between a size 12 and a size 14 and ordered the xl which is listed as a 14-16 U.S. size.  It fits as expected  not too tight, a tiny but loose but the 12-14 would have been too small.<br />The description states that there is a tummy control lining, one reason why I purchased it. there is NO tummy control lining, no tummy control at all. If you have a little tummy bulge the tummy bulge is going to bulge....just saying.<br />It is NOT a push up as stated in the description, there are no under wires, no bra, just 'cups' to cover the girls.  Push up implies to me that there should be some kind of lift, like a bra or underwire etc. nope, nada, nothing.<br />There is no elastic around the back to keep it in place and I would imagine that once in the water this is going to be an issue.<br />The bottoms fit fine and I have no issue with them, the skirt hits about 3 inches above my knees.<br />I haven't worn it in the water yet, but plan to bring a back up just in case things go south so to speak.<br />And be aware, even though this is listed as Prime it is coming from China and I received it a little over a month after I ordered it, so not sure why it is Prime.  If you want this suit for an occasion order early!  Overall it IS a cute suit but if you are ordering for the 'tuck and lift&#34; or the fast shipping, this is not the suit for you."
3.0,Beautiful ring but missing a diamond chip
3.0,"It does not expand at all, about all you can fit in it is your phone and license."
3.0,This dress is very pretty. Too bad it's so poorly made. The fabric is very thin. The seams are poorly and incompletely stitched together. Bought twice. Returned the first one due to zipper not completely sewn to dress which left a 2 inch hole in the side. Second one did not have a hole in it but the zipper is so cheap it's nearly impossible to close and open.
3.0,"The one size always gets me, I have a medium sized head and the glasses are on the large side, so I look kind of stupid while wearing them... They do look nice, and they're nice quality. They just don't fit people with smaller sized faces/heads"
3.0,"I was so excited to order this but what I received was not shiny, bright sterling silver as shown in the picture here.  Mine is grey, so I am very sad.  The seller did send a cute little pair of pink stud earrings, so that was sweet & I love pink, so I am happy about that."
3.0,"The color and size is great, but it's a really good thing that there are 12 pairs because the back is very lose and the earrings fall out often.  I've already lost 2 pairs this week because of the lose backing. They do look very nice though"
3.0,The costume is great although the zipper did not have a stopper at the top so it fell off immediately upon inflating.<br />We had to sew a stopper onto it. The area where the fan inserts is poorly designed. The attachment piece for the fan was placed haphazardly within the packaging and was almost thrown away due to there being no instructions for the costume and its pieces. The costume works great now that we<br />fixed it ourselves although we should not have had to do anything to a brand new costume. The costume is too expensive for the poor craftmanship.
3.0,"Purchased and wore while pregnant. It’s a bit cheap And see through. The fabric stretches out of place. Not the most flattering but you can work with it, hence the 3 stars"
3.0,The bag is beautiful but too flimsy for frequent use.
3.0,It’s was really pretty just couldn’t stay on my watch
3.0,"Quality is good, but even with me being a small guy the medium size is still kind of tight. Is I'd recommend going up 2 sizes unless a small is normally a little big on you then a medium might fit alright."
3.0,"While lovely the time it lasted, it discoloured badly after a few weeks of use."
3.0,"The bracelet is nice, very tiny. But I was mostly disappointed that it came in a box without the Happy 19th Birthday card as it is in the picture. That was important for the gift."
3.0,It gets dirty.
3.0,I really liked the material and the fit of the shirt but unfortunately mine arrived with a hole in the back.  I was going to return it but it became a hassle so I kept it to wear around the house.
3.0,Was part of a train conductor Halloween costume. Perfect for this Grandma who passed out candy without scaring “the littles” of the neighborhood.<br />Whistle looks the part but it didn’t fully whistle. Had a rattley sound as if it was possibly broken.
3.0,"I really like them, I was just hoping they would have been alittle bit bigger"
3.0,The colors weren’t as bright as in the picture and runs a little bigger than size. I should have ordered an xs
3.0,I’ve been in a medium for 3 or so months but I wanted to be certain they’d fit so I bought them in a large and they fit but I have a big butt so they’re very tight around my butt & hips and pretty loose around the rest of me. Happy I didnt get a medium
3.0,Good quality and price.  So fr so good. Real leather and denim.
3.0,Not crazy about the shape but big and warm
3.0,Several of the charms are pretty loose. They do not stay closed and could easily lose a pearl. Not bad overall. But not great.
3.0,I'm short (4'10). Pretty long on me
3.0,"It was cute, but it runs small; I would order 1-2 sizes up. Don't dry! It shrank up to a toddler size!"
3.0,it looks nice but I was disappointed when I saw how bulky it is.<br />It started wearing off after a month of use so I had to purchase another wallet. I have to be honest. There are other brands of vegan wallets who will last longer and are way more confortable to put it in your pants.<br /><br />Click the button if this review helped you at all. :)
3.0,Very comfortable just stretched out to fast for my liking
3.0,Pretty but smaller than your average belly ring . If you have artificial nails you will especially need t help with screwing on the top . If you have larger fingers you may need help . It is small . If you are looking for a belly ring that has a closer fit to your body that won’t snag on things etc … have a smaller frame and regular size belly rings are somewhat large for you …. this one definitely will suit you quite well ..
3.0,This can be worn to a costume party.  I bought it for a semi-formal roaring 20's party.  It looked a liffle cheap for the event I was planning to wear it to. It also was a little sheer. It is a pretty dress though.
3.0,"Not sure how I feel about this.  I work in a bar so thought this would be perfect.  One is too thin, so I wear it with two bands.  The colors are nice as pictured.  I might've also bought it one size too small because it does leave a mark around my finger."
3.0,I think they say “naturally faceted” to state they might be non machine made and done by hand but not sure if these are “natural sourced” gems I included a photo to show the off color of the ruby I am pleased just felt the product over all was a 3/5 star.  They are heavy pieces.  Light doesn’t really pass through the stones either.
3.0,"Liked this purse, but the zipper pull fell of within a few days of use. The Strap is very long."
3.0,quality by 3
3.0,These earrings are very pretty.  I was looking for some lighter earrings and these are very heavy.  I am not able to wear them.
3.0,"Nice product, great colors. Very tight around the neck."
3.0,"It didn't fit my lip, it was too big. I use it as a ear ring still love it."
3.0,"Takes practice to figure out how to wear comfortably. Once it’s wrapped it needs to hang on your shoulders, hence the need for shoulders on the broader side. It hangs nice like the ad shows  but on the back side it hangs low so it’s not for warmth per say, more for a fashion statement"
3.0,Nice soft light robe. Seems welll made but doesn’t’ hang well. Looks a little sloppy. Feel like an old house wife in it.
3.0,"Ran small, but bright colors & a great shirt. Would have kept if fit."
3.0,"I love the material and color is spot on.  It is a 3 star only because it fits significantly shorter than pictured.  I love the duster length and am 5'11, this hits me about 3 inches above knees"
3.0,It fits really weirdly. The top is too big and the bottoms are too small. I like the bottoms though.. I can make do.
3.0,"I ordered 2 colors of these sweats in a 3x,the grey and dark green.  The grey sweats fit perfectly.  However the dark green must of been missed labeled because they would not go past my hips.  Thinking it would fit my mom I gave them to her and she said they were tight on her.  I am just glad one of them fit me.  The ones that do are super comfy or me even with going a size up."
3.0,"There seems to be a thing with ""thinner"" and ""lighter"" fabrice claiming to be ultra warm, but honestly, nothing is as warm as a good thick woolen cap.  However, they don't tend to be as stylish.  Here's where the Under Zero hat comes in.  It's a halfway between stylish and warm.  As a result you have a moderately stylish looking beanie hat but it could stand to be a little warmer (especially if you have short hair).  You'll look good, you'll look great in fact, however you won't want to wear it to the arctic.  The fit is great, the look is great, if that's what's important however."
3.0,"Arrived as expected however, I just opened it to take with me tomorrow night & the back is dented. Disappointed it's damaged."
3.0,"It is comfortable and durable,  however the glitter is basically brushed on. Completely gone after a day or 2. If you want glitter spend an extra few bucks. But if you're fine with just a solid ring, this is good for the price."
3.0,"The fabric was soft but sewn together poorly. When wearing I felt like the lines weren't even or straight. Nice bright colors, but missing good QC."
3.0,"Cute and fits well, but light on the compression."
3.0,Once they are clicked they fit toooo small
3.0,"All of these Ever Pretty dresses look very nice and seem to be of good quality. However, they are not made for women, they are made for teenage bodies. Their size 14 or 16, is actually a 10 or 12 in a women's sized dress. If they expanded their line to include actual women's sizes, the dresses would be great! They are very pretty!"
3.0,Odd shaped. Can't seem to figure out how to make it look right. Seems like it is designed for a very small neck.
3.0,Quality is a bit low.  It did arrive earlier than expected though.
3.0,"Definitely needs ironing after washing, Edged curl up."
3.0,The words are only printed on one side and wasn't as easy to read.  It is cute for the price and a costume jewelry.
3.0,It was supposed to be rose gold... it looks more like regular gold to me. The necklace is beautiful.. but not what I was hoping for..
3.0,"just ok, i wish it has a different kind of closure like a button or clip on"
3.0,"These are huge! Ordered for my 2 year old, and my four year old wears them."
3.0,The product was a good value but most of the bags had strings loose or hanging.
3.0,"These socks came stuffed in a Ziploc bag. There was no original packaging.... just makes you wonder a little if they are really what was advertised. Other than that, they seem ok"
3.0,"Stretchy, stretched to fit my long fingers. The dye in the gloves stained my fingernails black. Hand wash them first to get the excess dye out before wearing."
3.0,"I was hopeful that these inserts would stick well to the inside of my dive mask, but unfortunately no matter what I tried, I could not get them to remain in place.  When I tried them on actual glasses, they seemed to work much better, however, they would not stick to the plastic mask.  I think it would be unfair to rate them as they were not advertised for use in dive masks so I will leave that alone if Amazon will permit?"
3.0,LOVE THE JACKET! Babies feet just seem squished in it. But other than that it’s great!
3.0,"Cute ring,  but not so comfortable on the finger.  Maybe it's just the cut out style."
3.0,Nice band but it un clips on its own
3.0,Cute but soooo small
3.0,Like the style of the ring. However it turns finger black.
3.0,The style wasn'the what I expected. It did look like it was made very well.
3.0,"This is a pretty and dramatic is a great way, it also fits just like I expected, however its VERY thin and the fold over part it not tacked so it must be rearranged to keep it looking the way it's supposed to"
3.0,"Love the color - the fit is great - super easy and comfortable. However, the pockets always pop out and my me appear larger in the hips than I actually am."
3.0,"it's a bit small on me, but it was easy to change and seems pretty solid. just a bear to get on though. the designers made the loop it passes through ferrous. so it wants to grip it and not pass through when you're trying to get it on your wrist. it's not easy one handed and itd be an expensive watch to drop. I'd pass on this one folks."
3.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; 130lbs with very broad shoulders, so I went with the XL so that I could wear something underneath since a lot of the reviews say it's a thin material. It is VERY thin, but not papery or uncomfortable. It fits my arms and shoulders great, but not being even remotely a bodycon dress the rest of the fabric makes it look like I'm wearing a bag. There are NO pockets which I feel this would benefit greatly from, either on the sides or front with all of that extra space. The bottom is also unhemmed. It's just a raw edge of fabric where it was cut off, and not entirely evenly at that- the dress mostly falls a bit above my knees as in the picture though. This could have been a great piece but between the cheap, thin material, and everything else it's like whoever made this got bored after making the sleeves and went &#34;ehh, just leave it.&#34; In fact the only reason I'm not leaving less than 3 stars is because I know how to sew and I can hem and add pockets myself- I shouldn't have to, but I can."
3.0,"I love the fit of KF94 masks, but these are much thinner than the brand I ordered previously. These are the thickness of basic surgical masks. They don't seem to filter out allergens. I still wear them for quick trips to the store -- very easy to use and comfortable -- but not dicier situations."
3.0,Not as many beads as pictures so there are gaps - seems to be good quality though.
3.0,"I ordered an extra large. The robes came in an extra large package, but the robes themselves are a small. I wanted to return them, but I don’t have the time to go all the way to a ups store to send them back. I gave three stars instead of one for a few reasons.<br /><br />#1) they are made with really great quality.<br /><br />#2) I have bought sith robes from this company before and was very pleased with those.<br /><br />#3) it was just a small delivery error. People make mistakes, and it’s not like I’m running short on cash at the moment.<br /><br />I’ll probably give the robes to my little cousin when he’s older"
3.0,"Ill-fitting at the top. If you want it to hang off the shoulders, order up. For sure this shirt dress is not for someone tall."
3.0,These are thin and overly stretchy. Might as well not be wearing anything at all.
3.0,"the material of ELLAZHU Women Summer Off The Shoulder Dress A-Line Maternity Dress is thin and kind of see-through(so you need to wear something inside as my opinion) but it fits well in summer day. the dress comes up above my knees, I am 5'8"". the dress is really boxy and open shoulders style, so it cools down some of the heat in hot days. since the materials are kind of thin, it gets easily wrinkles."
3.0,"I got the black graphic designy one.  Cute dress, good fit and length, but it faded after the first wash."
3.0,I wear a 12 and ordered a 12. It is a bit snug around the ribs. I think if I would have gone a size bigger it would be too big though. I guess I will just have to lose a few lbs
3.0,"This are supposed to be able to withstand a childs inquisitive hands.  My daughter has popped the lens out of one pair, which I cannot get back in, and has stretched the arms on her other pair and those will no longer stay on her head.  I cannot find anywhere to contact the seller to ask about these issues and what I can do to fix them."
3.0,The clasp part of it is beginning to unravel :/
3.0,I like them because they have pockets
3.0,I ordered red. These are gold/yellow & green.
3.0,Beautiful dress. My daughter is a size 0 and a size small was just perfect. I’m a little worried about when we launder it if it will still fit but she needs it for a special event ASAP. Waist is very very tiny!
3.0,"It is made of very hard plastic, a little uncomfortable to wear."
3.0,Wish it was thicker.
3.0,Good standard industrial barbell. The gold started coming off after awhile so expect to have another silver stainless steel barbell after a few months.
3.0,The strap material is just ribbon material which is not what I expected. If you're taller than 5&#34;8 don't even bother. If you have a long torso it just won't work. the ankle wasn't as tapered at the pic. Overall its a good buy for short individuals. The fabric seemed nice and sturdy.
3.0,"Very soft, fits fine, but material too clingy for me.  Will probably wear it around the house only.."
3.0,"It’s nice, but there’s pocket flaps on the front with snaps on the flaps, but no pockets. There are pockets on the sides but fake pockets on the front where I wish they would be..."
3.0,Very soft and small. More appropriate for a preschool aged child. My 7 year old was not thrilled with it.
3.0,"Okay, fits so small and over priced for the quality but it’s ‘adidas’ so I guess you should expect that."
3.0,This shirt is reverses.  Buttons on the left side.  The photo is a mirror image.  It is extremely difficult to put on and take off since the buttons are reverse from every other men's shirts.  I do not recommend this shirt.
3.0,"This QingFang unisex polar fleece beanie is very warm, made of good materials that will keep you warm - if it fits. And that's the problem with one-size fits all.<br /><br />In this case, it's too big for my head which means it's probably going to be too big for most women. I can't complain about the polar fleece since its equivalent to other products of this type I've purchased in the past. It's all man-made materials but there's no scratchiness to it as you'd expect from polar fleece.<br /><br />For those with average-to-large head sizes, you can probably make this work. For me, it's just too small."
3.0,Advertised as short but description stated long. I only looked at picture since I already had the blue one n did not read description very disappointed since I wanted short one
3.0,This will be a dress to wear in the house. Flimsy material.  Do not feel comfortable wearing out and about.
3.0,"While these are Uper cute, unlike my other pull-through earnings, they slide out easily and I’ve come close to losing them multiple times...now I wear with a backing which defeats the purpose."
3.0,It’s ok product
3.0,"I ordered an XXL and XL as I was worried about fit in chest and arms since I'm a curvy gal.  For reference I'm a size 12-14 in jeans, depending on cut and a 36D in chest.  The XXL definitely fit better in the chest and arms however the bottom was very large on me.  Therefore I went with the XL.  Although tight through chest and arms, still stretchy enough to make it work.  I got it to wear under jackets/vests/kimono type things with skinny jeans. The bottom is still a little large on me but works fine under skinny jeans.  I will not be drying this item in the dryer as if the top shrunk much more, it probably wouldn't work."
3.0,"Approximate measurements: Black size Medium<br />Chest: underarm to underarm 24&#34;<br />Length: front shoulder to hem 27&#34;, back top of collar to hem 30.5&#34;<br />Shoulders: across back sleeve seam to seam 19.5&#34;<br />Sleeve length: underarm to cuff 19.5&#34;, shoulder seam to cuff 25.5&#34;<br />Waist: across banded hem side to side unstretched 18&#34;<br /><br />My husband wears size large in basic t-shirts, fruit of the loom, Haynes etc, and the medium jacket fit well. Loose enough for easy movement but not so baggy that it looked oversized. It's a light-medium weight jacket, more than a windbreaker but less than a medium weight. The softshell outer fabric is a cheap version and more like a water repellant polyester or nylon style. I think the softshell fabric has a thin lining/backing between the actual lining because it has an almost 'puffy' feel to it. Due to the style and fit it's definitely a men's jacket but like other reviewers have noted, the zipper is backward so it zips like a woman's jacket. It came out of the plastic packet with a chemical smell which I'm hoping will go away after washing. Overall it appears to be a cheaply but fairly well made jacket which will be good for fall and possibly early mild winter with a sweater. I rated in 3 stars, it lost stars due to the cheap style softshell, backward zipper and would have looked better with basic black or grey lining."
3.0,Its exactly what it says it is but its just a little cheap looking. I will be returning it and purchasing the smaller one.
3.0,"Please order a size down, it runs big.<br />Great fabric and came fast via delivery."
3.0,Was a present for my husband. Wasn’t exactly as described. Not as many slots as stated for cards. Had 10 and not the 13 as described. No block for his card protection as described. The color and quality were as expected. Disappointed that it wasn’t exactly what was described as those were the 2 reasons for picking the product.
3.0,"It fits right, the length is just right on my 5'3 frame, I love the pockets (the reason I bought it), but the material is slightly itchy and uncomfortable. I washed it assuming it may be a starch-like chemical but it isn't fully soft.  Too bad, otherwise I was hoping to order this in other colors."
3.0,This gown is very pretty. I’m sure I would have enjoyed wearing it. The problem with this item... a large fits like a small. Very disappointed
3.0,"Works very well on more loosely woven material, the point isn’t small enough or sharp enough for more dense. It is easy to use & very attractive."
3.0,I ordered a 2x for my husband and it was to big size down
3.0,"These are quite pretty.  The lace is NOT cotton as it melts when heat is applied to press them.  I completely melted the lace on one that I had embroidered for a gift.  Needless to say I was glad I had more that I could make another, but pressed it with VERY LOW heat.  They are pretty and pretty good quality, but not 100% cotton."
3.0,Pretty color. Leather was surprisingly decent quality for price.
3.0,"These are okay for light to medium use, but it would be a good idea to check the installation before putting the pants on.  When energized, the clips still move laterally and vertically.  It seems that they depend on the top seam of the pants to keep them installed.  I have only used them on jeans.  In 4 days of use, I had to adjust them often, but so far have only had one slip off the pants."
3.0,Bought a US 7 as that is my Doc Martens shoe size. A size US8/UK6 would likely have worked better. I don't have the shoes I was going to use with these so I didn't need the insoles anymore and returned them. 5 stars for comfort.
3.0,Cheaply sequined but great fit!
3.0,Refuse to give me a refund unless I return the shirt at my own cost but shirt is way smaller than labeled.
3.0,I love the style but I ordered red and ended up with purple. Not sure what happened but can't send it back so now I'm stuck with a color I don't like.
3.0,"So cute, but broke after a week."
3.0,Can I please still return this item? It doesn't fit and I have no use for it.
3.0,I wanted something elegant but not so small. This was perfect. And I recieved many compliments!
3.0,I wanted this for my daughter and I to wear but the black one was way too big. It's more for a man's wrist. It started out black and mine turned blue when I put it on but it hasn't changed since. It also doesn't come with a sheet telling you what the color means. Quality is good though
3.0,They don't really look like the picture but they are still really cute
3.0,Unfortunately the material is too thin and extremely see thru
3.0,Much longer than expected
3.0,maybe I read the measurements wrong but I expected the large one to be bigger
3.0,"I liked it while it lasted, the main piece is a bubbled image of a flat picture so thats kind of cheaper but for what it is and the price its okay, it broke for me a couple months into wearing it but i cant say thats not my fault so meh."
3.0,"If you find that you yourself have a bigger head than most this cap might not be the best option. I love the design, the quality is good, but it is too small. if you are familiar with your cap size, I wear a fitted 7 3/4 cap and this one barely fits on my head. the problem mostly comes down to the snapback system puma has implemented into this cap, it just does not seem to lock correctly. Usually you can rely on the last hole or two on a snap back to competently old a hat together if you have a bigger head, here you cannot. cap will fall off your head often and will unlatch itself if you wear with the last two hole punches only. Like I said earlier though this is a pretty good quality cap, its really nice, but as for me I can only have it as a wall piece as it is too small."
3.0,Loved the design but my only problem was that some of the bracelets strings came a loose.
3.0,"Overall the sweater is made nice. It’s a little thin, but I knew that from reading other reviews. Only thing I noticed was that in the stock photo, it shows black and white sleeves and I got navy and white. I bought it because I loved the black and white, so that’s a bit disappointing. I’ll still keep and wear it!<br />I got a medium for reference and it’s still oversized"
3.0,"Lux Jewelers is apparently Palm Beach Jewelry.  Box and earing bag are both Palm Beach Jewelry items.  The earrings are pretty but certainly not red&#62;  Just arrived today, will decide by Monday if I will keep them or not."
3.0,"My daughter loved the suit. But with 2nd wear the stitching around chest is coming out which is why I rated a 3 star. Never been washed yet, only rinsed and hung to dry."
3.0,"Use the shoulder measurements from the sizing chart and the fit was just fine. If I'd used the 'bust' measurement it would have put me into a completely different size... The pattern looks nice.<br />The headline description for this product needs some serious editing - at least some punctuation. Yes I could wear this to the beach. For yoga? Not so much. For work? A bit too casual. The shirt is a ""button-up"" not button down - there's not buttons on the collar. The biggest issue is the fabric. Listed at 65% Poly, 35% Cotton. The thing to remember is there are many different kind of ""Poly"".  This shirt has a very plastic feel to it. On the plus size, it's be great for a BBQ (wipes clean) and is stain resistant.  But not really a fan"
3.0,"I returned this item. I am 5'4&#34; and a 36B and I ordered a small. I liked the fit of the dress, the length was perfect. I did not like how the bunch fit in the middle, this made the dress uncomfortable to me."
3.0,"Item is somewhat smaller than I expected. I ordered the &#34;7.5-9&#34; size and my foot is right on the edge, and I wear a size 7.5 in shoes. Definitely glad I did not go with the 6-7.5 option or I would have had to return or exchange these."
3.0,"I loved the biodegradable concept but after using the mask, it's very thick and raspy when in use.  Not hard to breathe but the feel is heavy and not very comfortable."
3.0,"Shorter than expected but I’m usually between a large and xl and the xl is a little big but I’m sure it will shrink in the wash. It doesn’t look like the picture though as the cross cross is much higher. The material is just cheap T-shirt stuff that stretches immediately and doesn’t form fit st all. If it did, it would not even cover mid thigh. It’s maybe 2” above my knees and I am 5’4”, 165.  I wanted just past my knee."
3.0,Well it showed up with a seem fraying.  -I am 5 foot 6 and weigh 115 pounds.  I ordered a medium. The swimsuit I found to be a little short in the torso and tight around my hips.  The bust was much too large for me. I am a 32A.<br />It is so cute. I really wish it fit and was made better.
3.0,"I reached out to the vendor because the shorts did. It fit. I need to return and can not find a slip, no response from the vendor."
3.0,"Not quite as supportive/stablizing as I expected for larger chest size, but very good and comfortable product."
3.0,Good fit.  The pink isn't flattering though for me. I'm short with thick legs so it emphasized it. Fits as expected & material was ok
3.0,Quality is ok. Good for people who wear glasses as it doesn’t blur the glass with smog. Quality could have been better
3.0,"too small,thought the other pairs from the black were silver, not white, should not have assumed"
3.0,Broke fairly quickly only for light use...plastic bands come apart easily howevet it is very pretty
3.0,"The leotard is made of heavy, good quality material.  Has a very good feel, but was totally too small for our granddaughter.  Her normal clothing is size 12 - 14."
3.0,This suit is made for a short torso. Didn't fit mine. I sent it back. was looking for something modest as I am 54 now. Ended up shopping swimoutlet.com and title 9. I highly recommend both.
3.0,The shirt is nice however it is extremely thin and transparent . An under blouse is required.
3.0,"These socks doesn't stay fixed, the look is fine but when you wear it are comfortable at all"
3.0,"Cute but even after sizing up from my normal 32B to a 34C, the underwear were wayyy to small, though the bra fit"
3.0,Solo algo ancho de cintura
3.0,"I love the fit of the pants , baggy and comfy. I don’t like how they lose their softness and turn pilly and staticy after a few washes. Haven’t worn the shirt."
3.0,"Got these for my husband who has been working outside alot.  I figured brown socks would be a good thing.  They are ok.  Very thin and have a few loose threads inside.<br /><br />The ankle is tight - these will definitely work better for thinner folks.<br /><br />Over all, they are ok.  They probably will not last very long since they are so thin and not supposed to be machine dried but should work for the summer."
3.0,I feel like this item was used already because it was dirty and had a rip. Also the tights dont fit at all. Super small
3.0,"it is cute, but definitely super cheap. It broke at the chain when I was trying to put it on."
3.0,It’s ok it’s hollow and looks dirty on the inside I suggest buying something a little bit better
3.0,"The sock itself seems structurally sound but it is way too tight for anyone who doesn't have skinny legs. They were great on my feet but even turned down, were constrictive on my ankles and I couldn't move them up my leg. Also note that there is a &#34;right&#34; and &#34;left&#34; letter ID on the sock to insure correct wearing. Unfortunately, I tried these on and decided to return them one day outside the 30 day window, so beware! Other than this, I have no issues with the item or seller."
3.0,"Very soft material, really like it.  The only reason for the 3 start is some of the stitching is very off and crooked.  The ripple on the front door the chest area is not even, one side is really pretty with ripples and the other side is flat no ripples."
3.0,Very comfortable but buttons do not stay buttoned. Buttonholes too large for buttons. Price and fit were great but annoying that it will not stay closed
3.0,pretty nice hat but cheap hatband.
3.0,To big for my head
3.0,"wasn't crazy about the matterial, and I would have gotten a smaller size."
3.0,"Love the color, but unfortunately can’t wear this dress unless I’m ok with flashing people since the buttons are real. Maybe use it as a beach dress with a swim suit"
3.0,The bottom of the bottoms is very loose. It looks more like shorts than a swim bottom. The quality doesn’t feel great. We love Bluey so we’ll still wear it but wish there was a higher quality suit
3.0,I liked that it was made of great material and that it had compartments for my cards.  Unfortunately it did not fit my phone it was just a hair to small and it just wouldn't fit.  I'm sure that it I read the description better I would have noticed it was for a Z3 not a Z3V which is mine and I guess that one little letter at the end makes all the world different.<br /><br />I did receive this item at a discount or free for my honest review.
3.0,The only problem I have is they are way too long for me.
3.0,"Came damaged, in two pieces. Very disappointing, at least I can wear bracelet."
3.0,i paid less than $3 for this scarf. for that price its ok. its width and length is comparatively low.
3.0,Beautiful but a bit uncomfortable while sitting.
3.0,"Wristband: Looks great the first week.The paint starts to chips off.  It's cheap, only lasts for a few months.<br /><br />Plastic Cover: I used it for a year. Problem with it is that once you get it a little wet or event sweat doing workout, liquid gets between the glass and the plastic. If you don't mind cleaning it every time it's does the job of protecting the screen"
3.0,"I bought this based on the picture.  The top appears to peak at the top of the busk and curve under the breast area.  Unfortunately the top is completely straight across.  I wore this a few times to check the fit.  Around is perfect but the top is frustrating. For the narrowest part to hit at my natural waist, the top comes up too high over the bottom of my bra and smooshes me instead of lift under the bust.  I wore it pulled down lower but then the shape hurt my hipbones.  The sides have little bubbles like the pattern piece was curved but the binding wasn't long enough so they tried to cup it.  Overall , the quality of the fabrics and construction is great but that shape throws the fit off most unfortunately.  I wish the top curved down more like the picture."
3.0,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I189G9S/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1
3.0,"I bought this skirt in red for my 4yo. The color was great!!! I purchased this skirt because it looked really fluffy in the photo, but unfortunately the skirt was not as fluffy as I hoped. It also has a white lining which shows through on the upper part of the skirt. My daughter did like it but it just wasn’t what I expected. Probably wouldn’t buy again. Size is as expected with room to grow."
3.0,😑💵 expensive but attractive enough to meet the expectation
3.0,"I love the bag because it has multiple pockets. However, after using daily for about 5 months and the liner started to tore apart.  I am sad with the liner quality."
3.0,"Really cute water shoes, but the sizing for the infant/toddler size 4 is off. These are a bit tight on my little one who wears a size 4 in every other shoe."
3.0,"The essential oil turn to yellow color the charm, and smells a little the metal  mix with aroma"
3.0,"They're beautiful and I got a lot of compliments on them, but the back zipper makes them torture to wear.  I still have sores on the backs of my ankles and it's been 2 weeks since I wore them.  On the night that I wore them, I finally had to unzip the back in order to be able to wear them any longer.  I wanted to love them, and I can definitely handle being uncomfortable for beauty, lol, but these were very painful. If it wasn't for the back zipper, they would've been lovely, but that design needs to be addressed, it's definitely flawed."
3.0,"I don’t know, but something is wrong with the design of this slipper, my husband fell twice , and the second time almost broke the leg. It is soft , comfortable, but dangerous."
3.0,Shirt runs small.. Buy one size up.
3.0,"Over all product it ok, feels cheap but does the job"
3.0,"These glasses look great, fit well, and are comfortable. My 3-star rating is based on the lack of scratch resistance on the mirrored lens coating.  I am pretty careful, even anal, about protecting my glasses, iPhone screen, etc. But before a week had passed, there were two “scratches” that appeared on the outside mirrored surface of these lenses. I know they are pretty inexpensive, but the coating is as durable as wet paint. Someone looking at you wouldn’t notice any imperfections, but the wearer sees them clearly."
3.0,"I really liked the style of these pants although the material is kind of cheap. The jeans fit good but the minute I bent down or over or sat down the chains popped. Within a couple of hours wearing them all of the chains were popped.  I am 5'8&#34; and 140 lbs. on the slim side, I normally wear a size 5 jeans. Being the crafty person I am I went to Michaels and bought some more chains and put them on considering the fact that I have to sit and bend down. You would think the designer would consider that. Will send a picture of my remade jeans soon."
3.0,This dress came fast. Cute but too small.
3.0,Good quality but holy crap it's small! It's Chinese sizing so even their 2x fits like a l/xl so if you normally wear a 2x it won't fit just fyi
3.0,"Very small around the chest, I am a 34-D and ordered a large. Couldn’t get it over my shoulders."
3.0,Not as cute as it looks in the picture. They weren’t short and cute...kinda looked frumpy and tight in the butt/hip area. A little disappointed
3.0,Product as described but it IS NOT made in the USA. Made in CHINA. Do not claim US maker unless it is....
3.0,"Material is not great and it is not really the same shape as on the picture. I would return it, but it's too much hassle and the price is ok, so I'll just keep it."
3.0,"I purchased the long sleeve, red floral print blouse. I was so excited when I placed my order.  I had even considered ordering more in different colors, but once I received the blouse, I changed my mind. It looked so amazing in the photos, but I was disappointed when I received it.<br /><br />First of all, I received the wrong size. The blouse I got is one size larger than the size I ordered. The sleeves were long enough, but I was swimming in the rest of it, so I would suggest going down a size when ordering. Secondly, the color is not red, but a dark orange. I like orange so this was not an issue for me. I just wanted to warn people that this blouse is not a true red. The pattern, which looked so nice in the photos, was also disppointing. The drawstrings on the blouse are tremendously long. They hung past the hem of the blouse! The material is scratchy polyester that reminds me of a ""grandma"" blouse rather than the stylish boho blouse I was anticipating.<br /><br />I am sad to say that this blouse just didn't work for me for so many reasons. Planning to return for refund and have no plans to purchase others."
3.0,"It is easy enough to get on and off, but does not stay on well enough. It is magnetic and pops off if you are not careful."
3.0,Rides up legs.
3.0,"I don't know why these are mislabeled. The tag on the socks says 60% wool and 39% nylon. That is not even close to 90% wool. So I am disappointed by this.<br /><br />Having learned all of that, I will say that the socks are a nice pair, thin enough that I appreciate them. The colors are rich and the sock comes up just above the ankle. They are comfortable with a bit of extra padding at the toe and heel. Not too much, but just enough. They look small but stretch quite a bit."
3.0,came with a little chip :’(<br />seeing as these run very small you can tell easily<br /><br />no gift bag
3.0,It's ok at best.  After about a month it started loosing its clarity.  My 3 stars is probably generous.
3.0,"It's fun. It's conversational. And yes, it's definitely Klimt.<br />But you should know that this is not a fine quality tie. It's not super cheap to the point of tacky, but it is a novelty tie."
3.0,"The fabric seems fine, quite heavy weight cotton/?nylon The inner label is blank, so I don’t know what blend it is. The sewing is mostly okay, but the pocket linings are stitched  to the main pant in a few places, by mistake. One button came off immediately by pulling a loose thread. As I only paid around $12 I kept them. I would not pay any more, though! My son is a small to medium, and fits a 32” Target short. These worked in a large. The length is well above knee, as on the model"
3.0,I liked it when I purchased it. But within 3 days it just stopped working
3.0,"These seem to be pretty tough frames which was my main interest, but there is a problem with the Amazon site because they come +1 to +3.5 diopter, but no where can you choose which strength.  So, I went pot luck and received +3.5 which is stronger than I need, but tolerable.  Please fix the site so we can choose which diopter we need."
3.0,"OK, could be better."
3.0,"The shoes fit as expected and  are very attractive. However, the shoes keep lighting up without being turned on due to where the on/off switch is located. The switch keeps bumping against the ankle and the shoes turn on by themselves which is very annoying."
3.0,Bottoms fit great but the top is more cropped and kind of big. The fit is just not what I expected.
3.0,I like it but wish there were black patent handles to match.
3.0,"Beautiful, but the stitching is flimsy."
3.0,Hate the material on the inside. I didn't care for the white strings on a blk suit
3.0,"Firstly the gloves came with the stitching open as you can see from the picture i have posted.<br />The material itself is very thin and the glove has no padding at all, something I would expect if I am using it for fishing so if i hold a fish, that should help in preventing the fish fins hurting you.<br />Maybe they are good only for protecting you from the sun but otherwise not very practical!"
3.0,"The fabric is light weight and have nice color, but if you have sensitive skin I wouldn't recommend it. It's not my favorite but it will do. For the reference, I'm 5'3 and 129 lbs and I ordered size small. The arm length is a little short for me but I wouldn't order size up because it might be too big for my body. So, it's ok cardigan but I wouldn't buy it again."
3.0,It broke too easily.  Good while it lasted
3.0,"Comfortable  fits and works like it suppose to in the sun , tough enough for outdoor activites."
3.0,I got these for my son (11) because he really liked the designs and wanted a bandana style face mask for school. They were one of the first things that popped up when I searched amazon for kids masks. THESE ARE NOT MADE FOR KIDS! They are HUGE! I even tried them on myself and my husband and they just fall right off our faces. I had to sew elastic into the back of all of them just so my son can wear them and so I can wear them. Once I made them fit they work pretty good. My son says they are way more comfy than a standard face mask and a little bit cooler to wear. The colors are bright and they feel nice. I thought they weren't supposed to have stitching in them but they do and a few of the strings are broken after only a couple days wearing them. I washed one in the washing machine on delicates just to see if it would hold up and hung it to dry the colors did not fade and it didn't damage the mask.
3.0,I hated that amazon put the seam in the middle front... the dress would be a keeper if wasn’t for that... donating it...
3.0,It's OK but CHECK SIZE BEFORE BUYING. These seem to be for kids. Doesn't fit me well as I'm in my 20's and I'm 5'11&#34;
3.0,The material is not very resistente :-(
3.0,I’m really not impressed with this bracelet. I bought this for my fiancé for Christmas.<br />The bracelet feels and looks cheap. It’s very stiff
3.0,"I expected these shoes to be more supportive, they were listed as orthotic sandals. They were over all cheap and flimsy."
3.0,"I like the color, I like the material and I like how it fits me perfectly. However, it doesn’t provide a lot of protection from wind or rain. I live i the Midwest where it gets pretty windy this time of year. I still felt cold when I wear this jacket.<br /><br />Another thing I am not a fan of is the inside pull string. I can adjust the length to fit my waist but it just kind of dangles out from under the jacket. I will have to tie a bigger knot to keep it inside."
3.0,"This is very cute, but it is a small piece of fabric and won’t provide much coverage for curvier women. I usually wear size 4-6 in bottoms and it is more of a cute accessory rather than a coverup on me."
3.0,"It is cute and easy to put on but if you have small/thin wrists, this might not work for you"
3.0,Colors very different from the pictures.  Fabric and construction is what I would expect for the price point. My only complaint is the colors. They are very bright.
3.0,"I bought this Taiwan imitation of the U.K. Underwater Kinetics wetsuit...<br /><br />AND<br /><br />the U.K. Underwater Kinetics hanger at the same time, both from Amazon.  If you had them side-by-side, I believe you'd pick the UK model with your eyes closed.<br /><br />This one works okay.  Strong enough, but clearly lesser quality--mine arrived warped and with &#34;flash&#34; that I had to trim away with an X-acto knife, because of the hurried molding process they evidently use.  Lastly, the &#34;depth&#34; of the hanger is thinner on this version.  I prefer the way my suit hangs on the $1 more U.K. version."
3.0,Wore out super quickly
3.0,"We felt the &#34;emblem&#34; was extremely cheap looking. Other than that, the shirt fit well."
3.0,"The jacket is really pretty, lightweight and can pack up to nothing but runs  very small."
3.0,Great material but kinda sad about how the chain keeps coming undone. But with a little maintenance and rewire still a great chocker.
3.0,I'm sending these back because the straps aren't adjustable.
3.0,"cute top with a good fit, but very thin (need a cami or tank underneath) and arrived very wrinkled - obviously can't be ironed, so i had to wear it the first time wrinkled because wrinkle release spray didn't even help. hopefully it holds up after being washed."
3.0,"They would be great for the beach, but a bit to dark otherwise. Noce construction."
3.0,"It is a little large in the shoulder area, but maybe thats just because I am petite. The criss-cross portions are a little odd.... and you can see inside the shirt on the sides."
3.0,HUGE!  Get TWO sizes smaller!  Not too flattering if you carry extra weight.  It's not fitted like the picture shows.  Very ballooney.
3.0,The top is nice. The bottom is a stranger material kind of makes it look cheap.
3.0,"Mine came with several small holes that had been repaired with a thread that was not the same color.  They're very small so hardly noticeable, and repaired well.  But still, it's brand new, it should not have patchwork.  Otherwise very comfortable skirt."
3.0,Looked nice I did not open the package and will be returning not the right gold color for my dress.
3.0,"It’s pretty cheap, if I wasn’t into costume jewelry and macabre pieces I’d hate it."
3.0,Very nice stone...chain is very thin. Won't use afraid of breakage.
3.0,This pants was too short on the crotch to waist and it was short above my ankle. I had to pull it down to fit snug on my butt to get it to hang just below my ankle. I wore a long camisole inside and long blouse over it. The size would have been perfect if not for these issues. I loved the swing and the room. I wear it in the house only now. The way I had to wear it was uncomfortable but I did get compliments...
3.0,I thought it would been a little smaller didn’t realize that it would be so big it’s nice very pretty but a little bigger than I thought
3.0,"Ordered a Large.  These were so small, I couldn’t get them in my feet at all. Had to give them away. They look comfortable, but I wouldn’t know. Extremely small, so order at a min, 2 sizes larger."
3.0,They show an adult modeling this dress but the fit is much more suited to a 10 year old. We gave the dress away.
3.0,Runs small. Size up or u will regret it
3.0,"I agree with the other reviews that it is pretty long. But since I'm 5'9&#34;, it works fine for me. It does runs a bit small, especially in the arms, so maybe order a size up."
3.0,Not as loud as I thought.
3.0,The clip does not swivel and is metal covered with a piece of plastic tubing.
3.0,Good enough for now but would definitely look into different ones in the future.
3.0,The nylon is okay but the color is awful
3.0,"Great little earrings that go with just about everything but took way too long to get these!  If you're looking to get these quickly, do not bother ordering!"
3.0,"These clip on sunglasses fit pretty well over my Ray Ban classic glasses.  Because my Ray Bans have the black frame these look like they were made for my glasses.  The seem sturdy and I think they would &#34;stay put&#34; without any problems.<br /><br />These get 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 because of the following:<br /><br />1) They are VERY dark, my eyes are sensitive to light and these seem dark to me... which is fine, I guess, if you want dark but for me these will be relegated for use only if I'm outside on a sunny day, and maybe only if it's sunny with snow on the ground (they are that dark)<br /><br />2)  They style of clip on is not the old school hinged clip so you can flip them up or down as needed, so because these are so dark, you have to remove them (and put them somewhere in a pocket or something) if you go inside (or even in your car) for a minute making them less user friendly.  Because the clip is so strong it is not easy to get them on and off one-handed like the old-school clip ons"
3.0,The band with the hook was way too big. Had to modify it to make it work.
3.0,"Cheap speaker makes the sound quality pretty weak. It's good for a goofy gift, but certainly not impressive."
3.0,I wish I would have looked at the photos closer (extremely closer) to have noticed that the hat is covered in sequins.
3.0,Color was totally off too light.
3.0,Very Cute shirt & fit  but unfortunately the string slides too much. I would have to sew the string to the material to keep it up on my chest and even on each side. Otherwise the material slides so much the shirt would fall down in the front😲.
3.0,Do not put it through the dryer!
3.0,you get what you pay for. simple as that.
3.0,Sticker peeled off on first washed.
3.0,"I bought the red one and the white one. They are completely different dresses. Different material, the white is so sheer you'd have to wear it as a beach cover-up or be ok with everyone seeing whatever you wear under it. The straps are thinner than the red dress and it's WAY longer than the red one. I'll use it for the beach/over a swimsuit, but beware, it is not the same dress in a different color!"
3.0,They were a little squeeze around the stomach but overall cute
3.0,"Three stars because of the material quality, it's a little poor, but the color is amazing, better than in the picture."
3.0,"Runs too small, but great fabric! Mostly cotton."
3.0,The bracelet is great.  Even thought I enjoy the challenge of trying to identify what some of the other beads are represent other than planets it would be nice to have a cheat sheet.
3.0,"The arms are awkward, but otherwise the fit is ok.  The fabric is not very soft, which I should have expected at this price. I can say that it's cute enough and the light green color is pretty!"
3.0,I like the one with the big silver triangle. The other two look like cat collars. I thought these would be really cute but all of my friends were laughing at me and said I looked like a cat.
3.0,I am 5’3 and 117lbs.  I ordered the x-small bc they said it was comparable to a size 4. The waist way a tad tight but I assume after wearing for little bit would loosen up. Quality of the fabric was awesome. Very well made.  BUT they were So long.  They were about 4 inches past my ankle so they went all the way to the arch of my foot.
3.0,"My daughter loves these shoes.  After wearing them a couple of times, the heel strap broke where it connects to the shoe.  I contacted the company and they sent me another pair.  Unfortunately, the same thing happened on the replacement pair.  My daughter doesn't seem to mind and wears them anyway."
3.0,It was nice while it lasted
3.0,"Bracelets, the colors I got were  not the greatest, received pinks, which I don't wear. no Blue ,is what I wanted.  they are nice but no I am stuck with colors I wont wear."
3.0,"Pkg arrived on time and glasses were well protected for mailing.Tortoise shell coloration is supposed to have a mottled appearance. This is to be expected. These came with even blend of brown and amber on one eye and the other eye was 90% brown giving the wearer a bullseye appearance. Very odd looking.<br />This seems like a quality control issue and these never should have been allowed out the door.<br />Contacted the seller. Waiting for return approval.<br />UPDATE.Seller approved return, however does not offer free return. if i had simply changed my mind I would gladly pay shipping. This is a  defective item. Seller contacted. Awaiting response.<br />FINAL UPDATE: Seller explained that they'd missed my first email. I was provided with a postage paid  return label. Resolved."
3.0,"Cheap material but i like the idea of the top. I can wear it inside my pants like in the pic but the material sucks. I usually wear med/large, got a large and it was still a bit tight."
3.0,The actual wing is not the same color as shown.
3.0,Better than average but is it worth the price?
3.0,I find the temples quite short for my head.  The optics are ok.  Workable but not perfect.
3.0,Not bad.. but don't expect premium feel...
3.0,Very cute but the horn fell off the headband
3.0,I like the hat but it needs more support on the top of the hat. Other than that it’s ok
3.0,"I was thrilled to see that the size chart recommends measuring the proper way (your band size should be what you measure under your bust- after all you wouldn't measure for a belt and then add 4 inches!) I come out as a 33. I ordered the M in these because my bust size (E-F) would have been too big to go with the S. This is an unfortunate mistake on the part of the sellers, because when the band size is correct the cup size for most women is a D or higher (in the U.S. we think all D cups, for example, are the same, but a D cup on a 32 band is a different size than a D cup on a 34 band.) Of course, when ordering I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and hoped it would work out alright in the end. My first time trying these on I was pretty pleased. I could tighten the hooks up to where they needed to be under the bust (the band on the S would have been better).  The band felt comfortable and I had a nice fit in the cups after swooping and scooping. The plunge style complemented my bottom-heavy breasts well. However, after washing (on delicate, air-drying) and wearing for a couple hours the fit was not as good. I started to get a double-boob in the cups. The piece of boning on the sides that's supposed to give support to the sides of the breast and hold them in was bowing outward. This resulted in the bottom of the boning digging in uncomfortably and giving me an extra bulge on both sides. This piece of boning definitely needs to be made of better quality. (The rest of the bra I found to be good quality.) Overall, having women properly measure for band size is a real opportunity for them to give a fantastic fit, but they failed to follow through in making sure the bras were made accordingly."
3.0,It fits great but the loop that holds the band doesn't secure the band very well.
3.0,Runs big. Really loose at the legs and falls off at the waist.<br />Cute though.
3.0,"Like the lift and that it’s comfortable; however, started ripping near the shoulder/clasp band within 2 weeks."
3.0,Must be for a small head. Was tight for my big head.
3.0,this compression was too much and the legs were covered with the diamond shaped pattern of the socks.<br />the color is beautiful but the comfort was terrible.  Sorry
3.0,"I ordered these for Christmas gifts for my friends. I got them and started to add monograms to them.... but when I got to the green ones, they were HALF the size of the other head bands. Like they could fit a small baby doll head. I thought they would ALL be the same size... well, the green was isn't........... So, I had to go out an buy 2 head bands...."
3.0,Very good material. But sizes were short for two items.  Hence two stars less. Lucky if you get all five with correct sizes.
3.0,I like the gloves however I find that it’s not very easy to use the touchscreen with them on.
3.0,"The item has ""WATCH"" in the silicone...looks dumb, never wore this"
3.0,Runs small for a size 7 in Toddlers.  Definitely size up.
3.0,This is a very cute dress. However it fits tight and not the loose looks as shown on the model in the picture. So if you are curvy in the hip area expect a tight fit. Also the sleeve are not the relaxed fit as shown either.
3.0,"Very pretty sports bra for sure.  I need something very high impact as I ride dressage on large moving horses.  This didn't seem to quite have as much support as some of the others.....there was a bit more bounce than I would like.  However for the price and cuteness, I'll keep it in the rotation."
3.0,Cute but directions aren't too clear
3.0,the shirt was fine the shorts was smaller then i thought
3.0,smaller than I remembered.
3.0,Handle is tearing off after 6 mos. Of use.
3.0,It's okay for the price we paid.
3.0,"i'll start with the fact that the one they sent was obviously used - the tag had been removed, etc. i was willing to let that slide (although, yuk!), but then i tried it on. forget what they say about the size. order one size larger, at least. i was so happy to finally find a 100% cotton sweatshirt, and so disappointed by the fit. Jethro Bodine sleeves, too snug in the shoulders, too short, etc."
3.0,"The dress is obviously not all cotton, but I like the color.  It’s become pajamas because it shrank up super short—if you are petite this will fit you perfectly!  As a 5’6” woman the proportions are completely wrong."
3.0,"The size chart us completely off. Had to use the extender, even though I fell within their recommended size range. The cups are also pretty small- I had the dreaded quad boob after 20-30 mins of wearing it (unfortunately after I already left the house). Also, the “sewn in” pad, only has a single stitched point in the bottom. You will still have to fish around inside that stupid little hole in the side to flatten the padding. So, now i’ll have creasy, quad boob when I wear this because the padding in stitched in but not enough to stabilize it while washing it. Another dud of a bra! 😒"
3.0,3 out of 5 stars because the costume part was great but the fan was defective which made the costume not work. Purchased this for my daughter for Halloween trick or treating. She was so excited for it but by the third house the fan made a pop and then a horribly loud grinding sound and stopped blowing enough air to keep the flamingo inflated. Even with new batteries the problem persisted. Sadly we had to figure out last minute changes for my daughter to have a costume. The only issue I had is with the fan. The rest of the costume seemed fine for the short time the fan actually worked. You can buy replacement fans for these but the cost is over half the cost of the costume. I don’t feel like I should have to do that for a new costume so I will likely just return it. Would have been nice if it could have lasted the whole night. We’ve had other blow up costumes in the past that worked great for multiple years.
3.0,They must have amazing photographers...the colors are not nearly that bright. Imagine this with dull green instead of bright sparkling green. Looks like an old man's tie.
3.0,"The chest portion for me was too small.  The slip is pretty short for me (upper thigh).  I am 5'7"" 180 lbs"
3.0,I only had it on for a few min and it dug into my skin and left a line.
3.0,"Update: I am deducting a star due to the flap starting to crack after a year. Granted I use it all the time but I am seriously disappointed given the price point. I am deducting a second star for the complete LACK of customer service. I've contacted the company twice with zero response. Lastly for the cons, I am unable to clean it, nothing will remove the dirt that has gotten into the texture (I've tried windex, shoe cleaner, leather cleaner, moisturizing soap and simple green). I still not convinced this is leather.<br /><br />I think my favorite aspects of this purse are the color (neon yellow) and the unique shape. Otherwise, the price and actual functionality is disappointing. I decided to keep it since it's a statement piece but I question if it's really leather. It sure as heck doesn't smell like leather. My zipper also won't open all the way unless I pull open the opening, the zipper alone goes only 90% of the way which is annoying.<br /><br />Overall, I like the look and feel of the purse but not for the price. I also didn't look at measurements prior to purchase (which I am not deducting a star for) but it was much larger than anticipated.<br /><br />I started with 5 stars for the novelty of the color and unique shape but based on every other aspect, this is more of a 2 star product/brand. I no longer recommend it unless you simply want an occasional statement piece."
3.0,These were too small for my daughter. I kept them but she won’t wear them.
3.0,"Unlike the preview pics, interior of fabic on his oversized shirt is white. Very annoying and distracting on the long back piece and the oversized collar... can't be hidden.<br />Arms are very long.... hand past my fingertips.<br />Clearly an irregular, the drawstring for the neck is on my right shoulder. Would be kinda cool if not for the excess white fabric showing.<br />Whatever size I bought is massively too large, even on my fat body.<br />Probably going to return."
3.0,"Updated after 1 week.<br />I give it 3 stars now, compare to 1 star.<br />After the suddent death after 2 days, i gently knock on it. It came back alive. Then died again. Repeat several times.<br />I think the battery is lossen or something like that. Now it's normal.<br />PROS:<br />- Overall this is a nice watch with large display<br />- It's also light so movement with your hand is easy.<br />- The design is sporty<br /><br />CONS<br />- The viewing angle is limited, you have to twist your wrist at the right angle to see it<br />- IT'S DEAD AFTER TWO DAYS (i recevied it in sunday and in tuesday it's dead)"
3.0,2 holes in knee. Thank u
3.0,Love these! But I am giving them only three stars because of how small they are. You can’t tell how pretty they are from far away
3.0,The stones were very cheap looking like plastic. P
3.0,"Quality was great and did not look cheap at all. The only con is, what does one do with this? You can't use it to play guitar, you can't put it on a chain, and you can't really stand it up. I did not really think this through when I bought it. Perhaps you can try framing it? The little box it came in was fine for presenting it, but overall, I felt bad for how hard is it to dis[play or enjoy."
3.0,The top of the suit offered no support. I am a 34DD and it was not a good fitting top.
3.0,"Still looking forward through it,"
3.0,"I definitely recommend ordering a size up in this dress. I typically wear size 12 (or Large) but ordered the XL since I knew the style would be body-hugging and I didn't want it to be too tight. I was glad I went up a size because the dress fit beautifully overall and was very flattering. The print is very pretty and the colors are bright, however, I noticed that the flowers instantly fade if the fabric is stretched too much. For me, this occurred across the bust. Fortunately, the ruffle covers the bust nicely so it's not really an issue there but if you are particularly heavy around the midsection or thighs, just be aware that the more the fabric is stretched out, the lighter the print will appear and the dress may end up looking like it's too tight on you. Order a size up and it will be much more flattering."
3.0,I don't remember this one can't fine it at home
3.0,They faded and it's not so easy to adjust as I tought.
3.0,"Didn’t have luck with these particular earrings. First arrived  mishaped, one rattan earring was bigger and not round compared to the other. Replacement order arrived the same (misshaped) and broken. Was bummed, ended up returning both."
3.0,"My son was Harry Potter for Halloween, and we couldn't find round glasses anywhere locally.  These looked like they'd be decent costume glasses and the price was right.  Sadly, the round lenses are HUGE.  Like, clown huge. Ridiculously huge.  The glasses themselves seem well put together and that they'd be a decent prop, but if you're getting them for a Harry Potter theme, you might want to look elsewhere."
3.0,"This product came all folded up small in a cloth bag.  I didn't know what it was when I first saw it.  The leather material is pretty strong smelling when you first take it out of the bag, but the smell gets better after a bit.  I do like that it has both zippers and snap clips, that help hold everything in it.  I do not like that the handles seem so short, as it's hard to hang over your shoulder and still be comfortable underneath your arm.  The material seems to scratch easily, but it is pretty soft and pliable. It has ample space, but not overly big.  I received a discount for reviewing this product and giving my honest opinion."
3.0,"This is a great dress! Love the color, fabric and built-in slip. Unfortunately, the waist area fit more on my ribcage. I am 5'6"" 125-130LBS and ordered a small based on reviews. The top is slouchy (on me) making it look too big (34B/32C). Length is a bit shorter than I was expecting hit my fingertips when I put my arms down. The dress is too cute to return so I am giving it to my Niece."
3.0,"I Don't like the small sequin. #preference,  the skirt is well put together it's a keeper."
3.0,dress is a lot more flowy than shown on model
3.0,"Somewhat small and uncomfortable. Im a 36 b/c and is wasnt big enough around my torso. The cups are fine and it looks great, besides the elastic digging into my back and under arms. This was a one size fits all and i have found similar item in s m l sizing which i would order next time in large."
3.0,these were a lil small than what i had expected.  I ordered these two sizes bigger than recommended just to be sure but they were still small. The overall product though looks amazing
3.0,Nice fit.  Too sheer.  Perfect red for Christmas and Valentinesday!
3.0,smaller then I thought it would be.
3.0,"Material is tshirt thin. This dress is light and airy. This dress may work best as a costume.  May Definitely dress this up with a wide belt. If you are looking for quality flare, this one may not work as Pictures appear as fuller skirt.  Has some pleating in skirt.  Comfort is a plus!  Fits as expected on size."
3.0,"When I tried to put these on my eyeglasses, the clips didn't fit correctly, so I tried to bend one of the clips slightly to get it to fit better.  Unfortunately the clip snapped off, making the sunglasses unusable, so I can't judge how well they would have worked."
3.0,"The image in on the product says Veteran on the back.  In reality is just says US Army.  Great looking cap, just a little disappointed."
3.0,"I'm 12 weeks postpartum, and I purchased these in medium (my usual postpartum size) and the purple/blue color. All other ""medium"" shorts I've purchased recently have fit me perfectly, but not these. These are TIGHT, especially around the waist where the waistband sits. The waistband cinches my waist, which then makes my hips flare out on the sides in a really unattractive way. Sure, they flatten my tummy, but not my hips! I'm not sure if I just got the wrong size or if it's my shape or if it's the cut of these shorts, but these are NOT for me.<br /><br />I've worked out in these at home a few times; I wouldn't wear them out of the house right now. When working out, they stay in place at the top, but the bottom of each leg rolls up a bit, so I find myself pulling them back down often. I do really like the material. It is lightweight and wicks sweat nicely. However, between the sizing, the fit, and the riding up, these would be a pass for me in the future."
3.0,Its good but the yellow dress is see through.. I wish the fabric is a little thicker
3.0,"It was just ok.  VERY thin material.  I'm 5'6 and pear shaped.  This didn't make it past my hips and it was also very short.  It was more of a tunic length.  The cut was a little odd, I thought it would be more flowly at the bottom like in the picture, but it was just a straight shape all the way down.  Returned."
3.0,Way too small. This is not a necklace at all. They are more like prayer beads. Beautiful but very disappointed.
3.0,Not very comfortable for a long period of time. The material is not soft and the small piece of fabric covering the zipper irritated my skin. Also there are only 3 clasp at the top of the girdle under the zipper. The girdle would give a better shape if the clasps went all the way down to cinch in the stomach. In the end this can be a sexy looking under garment but if you want something to shape and smooth this is not it.
3.0,"Everything is great about the product except that the nose pads fall off and get lost. Can't find replacements for them anywhere yet. Glasses are too uncomfortable to use without them. Threw two pair away. If you get them, make sure you glue the nose pads down first thing."
3.0,These were super cute but the Velcro on the right sandle only lasted one day
3.0,The beads themselves are very nice. The cord that makes the extenstion is not the same color and there is a milky white plastic piece attached that doesn't seem to go with the piece. You can not tell that that is what the piece is from the picture.
3.0,It looks jus like it does in the picture but it feels very cheap.  The pearl looks like its make out of plastic.
3.0,I ordered large which is the size I always wear. When I tried these on they were super tight and not in a good way. So tight that i would have to go up about 2 sizes (XXL) to get the right fit. I will be returning these.
3.0,This is a beautiful dress and I love the material BUT if you are at all &#34;well endowed&#34; this dress makes you look like your legs attach to your breast. Sadly I will be sending back
3.0,The white shirt is bright white. The suit is more off white. I ordered a 10 and its definitely more a 12-14. My 11 year old would need the 8. The suit material was better than expected. At this price I figured it would be see through and it is not. Pants came unhemmed and are elastic waist. I am ordering a size down as I need it for a themed event and the price is good for this type of thing. I would not order this if it was for a wedding or formal event.
3.0,Unable to get it over my foot. Am returning
3.0,"Looks nice on, lays well, its just shorter then it says."
3.0,"Do you need sturdy long shorts for an upcoming adventure? Do you need pocket space? Are you a a huge person? Do you think the color you select is only a suggestion? If you said yes then these are for you!<br /><br />The shorts are well made with Velcro on all pockets and ample size pockets. This fits *LONG* in the inseam, the legs completely cover my knees while sitting. Standing up they're probably an inch below my knee.  Unless you're a person of unusual height they will be extremely long.  That said, they fit me just fine.  :)<br /><br />The catch is that the color is of the shorts in the picture is *VERY* off from the actual product.  The package clearly said stone, but the shorts themselves are a *VERY* light beige... Not grey/stone at all.  I noticed this as a common theme when ordering &#34;ChoiceApparel&#34; brand clothing, the pictures on Amazon are not true to the final product."
3.0,I like how this product looks but I had an allergic reaction to the metal so my ear started hurting and swelled up.
3.0,"It's ok, the fabric is a little hot.  It's good quality but just a little hot."
3.0,"So this is a nice little wallet, and I stress the word LITTLE.  My cards fit so tight in this thing, that I about have to rip it open to get them out of the slots.  Had they given just an 1/8"" more in the slots for the cards to slide in/out more easily, this would be perfect!  With arthritis, it's hard to grip and pull cards from a tight slot inside a wallet."
3.0,Beautiful hat but I was dissappointed that it's not sturdier. This is a Dri-Fit hat meaning it's made of very thin material so it doesn't keep its shape.
3.0,"These are enormous on my small female face--they are kind of &#34;boxy&#34; looking. However, they cover my glasses and serve the purpose of giving me some privacy and protection from the sun."
3.0,"cute shirt but ran very small, super tight"
3.0,"This scarf is massive, which isn't so much a problem (I should have read the size specifications) but it also shed quite a bit. I would not reckoned buying this."
3.0,Didn't look like I thought they would.  They are okay.
3.0,"If you looking for a assortment of earrings for everyday wear that you won't cry if your loose one, this is the perfect set!!!!"
3.0,Smaller than stated size.
3.0,Smaller than the size.  Need to size up by 1 size.
3.0,"My normal method of cleaning shoes would be to soak the shoes in a bucket of water with some laundry detergent over night then gently scrubbing or using the water pressure out of the hose to clean the sole and fabric.<br /><br />This ""no scrub"" detergent sounds great and has many positive reviews, unfortunately, my results weren't as positive.  I soaked the kids' sneakers and some crocs for two days (didn't have time within the first day to rinse them off) and did not see any improvement after rinsing and drying the shoes.  In fact, they look exactly the same as they did before they went into the bucket of detergent.<br /><br />The one positive, is the shoes smell better than before."
3.0,"The material looks more cheap than the actual picture and definitely not as flowy. Still, for just being at the beach, it serves the purpose. It is definitely not a dress that I would take to dinner or somewhere else than pool/beach. I am curvy, so it might just be that its not meant for us curvy gals!"
3.0,The jumpsuit run small or rather maybe I run too large. 5’4” 175 pounds and the large  does not look like the model on me. It’s soft material and I really really wanted it to fit me nicely for my vacation but it is not.  so I’ll put it away perhaps I’ll find someone who weighs less
3.0,Fits really nicely. However this material makes you sweat way more than others. Even if your not working out. So if you want to loose weight/sweat while wearing this for casual wear it’s what you’re looking for.
3.0,"These insoles fit well and feel supportive. But they do squeak with every step... overall, a decent insole. I just like them to be a little quieter!"
3.0,"Detail in knot is very less than clear.  Pendant is good weight and a good value at the price.  Did not care for the necklace, a double slip knot, which kinda looked cheap and took away from the pendant."
3.0,I wish thes sunglass companies would use a human model to reall get a grasp on size. These were so huge.
3.0,"Runs super small, very cheap material, not a swim suit, which I didn't buy it to swim in just a costume. Wish the ""Baywatch"" patch was real not a screen print. Would like the option to just buy the swimsuit part of the costume and not all three pieces. The material is paper thin so is see-thru before putting it on. Once the material is stretched it may not be fit to wear in public unless you wear the jacket & shorts over top. Also the stitching isn't very good or strong.<br />I've bought 2 of these costumes over a few years I was heavier the first time but bought a medium because most of what I wore was a medium I think the only thing I could of maybe worn was the jacket. The swimsuit didn't fit my torso I barely got the straps on my shoulders and there was no way I could wear this in public the crotch of the suit about split me in half and the shorts were no help. It made me feel like Chris Farley in Tommy Boy, ""big man in a little coat"", I'm only 5'2"" and my weight at the time was about 135lbs. The second time ordering was just about a year ago I'm still 5'2"" but now only weigh 120 so I ordered a small and it fit, oh but I did make sure to wear a bra underneath and also skin toned tights for security of my delicate bits.<br />Hope this helps, good luck."
3.0,The silver coating rubbed off within a week on one side and now looks copper :-/
3.0,"Good quality glasses, but if you have wireless charging iPhone, the metal case won’t allow for wireless charger."
3.0,"The pearls are lovely.  Unfortunately, one was separated from its post.  I will re-glue it and wear them.  But what a nuisance!"
3.0,"You get what you pay for. The frames are light and flimsy. The lenses are thin plastic, arrived dented but it easily snapped back. Overall they’re ehh..."
3.0,The right shoe was too large around the ankle
3.0,"It is very low cut in the front. Read, I am going to have to shave or consider waxing before wearing this in public. Was going to return, but it is a nicer material and ok for a Belize vacation."
3.0,"Overall, the dress was nice. I loved the print. However, I found that the midsection didn't &#34;hide&#34; my belly poof but accentuated it. I think the cut just was not very flattering for my shape (more pear shaped)."
3.0,"Son pesadas, las compre una talla mas para evitar que el steal golpeara mis dedos pero igualmente son tan duras que no son nada cómodas. Tengo turno de 12 horas y en 7 horas ya mis pies piden auxilio."
3.0,"Eh, they're ok at best."
3.0,"Great dress, but ran large."
3.0,"I initially ordered the XXL Tall in this jacket and it was much too large.  I immediately returned the item pre-paid by Amazon.com and got the XL Tall size.  Although this size is passable, it is a tad snug.  Too bad there isn't something between this manufacturer's XXL Tall and the XL Tall.  But my real problem is that it is not a Tall at all.  It seems to be a regular length although the label reads &#34;XL Tall&#34; right above the Made in China imprint.  I purchased a Columbia XL Tall jacket from Amazon.com a month ago and hung it back-to-back in the closet to the SCOTTeVEST XL Tall and the SCOTTeVEST jacket is a good four (4) inches shorter than the Columbia jacket.  And it's not like I am 6'6&#34; or the like - more like 6'1&#34;.  I report, you decide for yourself.  Dr Steven Stanton"
3.0,"The dimensions are much smaller than listed, so we will be returning the tiny bag."
3.0,I like the colors.  I can never get the right size. Every brand seems to be different in my size. One of my shirts came inside wrapped in a plastic bag. The other two were not. It made me wonder if they returns.
3.0,Kind of a cheaply made device but after three passes my watch is running just fine. Beat going to the jeweler.
3.0,It is a little different than I exspected.
3.0,They're ok but they scrunch my toes up in my shoe.  I only have a size 8-8.5 foot but when wearing shoes they bunch up and are too small.
3.0,Looks great. I have an issue with it though where as it's hard to get only one card to come out at a time. It makes at least 5-7 cards come out at once!
3.0,The colors of the stones are pale. I have had other earrings with this design and they matched the photo. This one doesn't.
3.0,"Comfortable shorts.<br />Expected different material & the 7"" was too short for me."
3.0,"Its a cute dress, the material is thin and see through. The pic makes the fabric look thicker"
3.0,Kind of tight in the thighs.  Something that can be handled.
3.0,Snaps wont stay snapped.
3.0,"The size was correct but the material is toooo light weight and doesn’t hold the structure or really fit properly, it gives the appearance of a saggy crotch."
3.0,I’m 5’10 125lbs and usually get a medium for a slight fit. I got a large to take care of any shrinkage but the large is tight! Afraid to wash it 😣
3.0,Bought for an outdoor Monster truck show but the noise level was still very high. Didn't muffle as much as expected
3.0,"Just received the watch. It looks nice; but , there is nothing on the watch saying Swiss movement.<br />I am going to keep it on the watch winder for a couple days to see how it functioning. Cross the finger. Hopefully I dont have to return it"
3.0,"mine was short, but i ordered one size smaller due to reviews saying runs big which it did just not long enough"
3.0,"Daughter tried this on for a possible theater costume item, but everything showed through, including nude-colored undergarments and her belly button. No go for us."
3.0,"These are comfortable and have a nice hue. They sit close to your face, which is good for blocking out the sun when it's higher in the sky.  My question: why are these called Floats if they don't actually float? I'm keeping these regardless, but I really thought that with a name like that they would actually float."
3.0,bad smell
3.0,"Ratcheting mechanism works great, and the belt length is easy to adjust with only scissors.  However, the buckle scratches easily, which creates very noticeable white marks on the completely black buckle.  I tried to touch it up with paint/marker, but it still looks bad. I have 2 other brands of ratcheting belts that seem to be higher quality, so I'm donating this one.  I won't name the other brands, but I'm sure you can figure them out with a quick internet search."
3.0,Colorful and clear picture. Side bands seem to short.
3.0,"Advertised as 13-14, but seemed more like 11-12."
3.0,Time will tell if this is as durable as I would like
3.0,"It's pretty good, but the loop that the charm is attached to is too small to get off the necklace, so you can't switch out the charms. I don't really mind because I have other chains that I can use, but it's pretty sucky that you can't use the chain you bought. Unless you only wanted to wear the American Idiot album cover charm. However, I bought it because I liked the heart like a hand grenade one, not so much the other two. The chain itself is nice, and the charms are great, but together they don't really work."
3.0,The Purse is pretty sturdy however one of the side straps busted. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and 5 months later it's busted.
3.0,I like the design of the shirt.  Is a little smaller than I had hoped for.  The fabric is not as soft as I thought it looked.
3.0,The shirt was well made but was too small even though I allowed for that based on past experience with clothes made in China.
3.0,Nice dress and fabric but I'm 8 months pregnant and normally size 12 so I ordered a large after reading that it runs big and it's HUGE. Size down two sizes. I have a size medium dress from this company that fits much better despite the fact that I normally am an XL and am very pregnant.  Otherwise very cozy dress
3.0,"The top I thought would fit because I have DD breasts but I’m about 110 lbs, the bottoms are way too large and the top stretches and on the sides it has a gap between the swim suit and my armpit/breasts."
3.0,It finally got cold enough to wear my jacket and noticed that the zipper does not work 😕
3.0,"Beautiful looking boot but too narrow,I need wide width my feet swells"
3.0,I bought this for an Irish friend but she thinks green would have been more appropriate.  It is nice looking but larger than I thought.  It i not cheap looking but it is just not beautiful like a swarovshi product would be.
3.0,This was supposed to have a 4 leaf clover which I loved because of the added connection to our ancestry but when it came out had 2 hearts on it instead so I was disappointed. I didn't have time to return it because it was a gift for my daughter before her musical. She loved it anyway.
3.0,Light compression works great as a undershirt or if you don't want a super tight tank
3.0,It fits tight and looks bulky on my head.
3.0,Handle broke already. Only had it a few weeks.
3.0,"I can't tell them from the very high dollar ones, can you?"
3.0,"I wanted to love these, and have been looking for this sandal style for some time.  Unfortunately, as some of the other reviewers have stated, the toe peg seems to be a little off.  The toe peg is not soft (it almost felt scratchy) and it is uncomfortable.  I don’t have wide feet, but my foot seemed forced to the outer edge of the shoe due to the strap placement.  In just the few steps I wore them inside, I knew immediately they wouldn’t work.<br />The footbed was comfortable, though not as much arch support as I’d have liked; and I had no issues with the ankle strap.  Overall, the Olukai Eheu sandal is a nice looking shoe, but it just didn’t work for me."
3.0,"I wanted to buy a shirt that would moisture wicking during the summer under my regular shirt. (Yes, I wear an undershirt in the dead heat of summer).  I have yet to have a hot day to try that out.  But overall feel is decent.  It is NOT a true compression shirt.  But had a fitted feel to it.  I bought large and typically wear a large (I understand that going smaller would compress more, but why not make the sizes like that if compression is in the name, like UA).  The shirt feels smooth and fits right under a t-shirt with no issues.  I can see this being a tighter muscle shirt for the gym.  Not sure if this would cut it for some of the other comments on hiding love handles or moobs.  I gave it a 3 because of the compression part, but plan on buying more if they hold up against heat."
3.0,Too wide!
3.0,I love the shirt but it was a size too small. I normally wear a medium but I should have gotten a large in this shirt
3.0,Hola paisanos. hace días compré unas chocolaticas para mi niña y las pedi talla 9 UD (americano) y cuando me llegaron no le quedaron a la niña eran chiquita y la caja decía talla 23 EU / 7US. No entiendo sus tallas o esbun error lo que me enviaron. expliquenme para hacer bien en pedido por que si quiero unas para mi hija. vivo en USA. Gracias.
3.0,Loved the style. Showed too much cleavage and too tight at waist.
3.0,The color is too cold.
3.0,I gave it 3 stars as it catches in things. I managed to rip it off my toe the 1st 2 nights I wore it. If you can remember to take it off & put it back on again its a cute ring.I have been wearing it on my little finger where I can close it together . Turtle does still catch some.
3.0,"I will probably end up returning this dress.  The fit is very odd.  The fabric isn't bad...it's a heavier knit that helps camouflage some bumps and would probably work fine with the right undergarments, but the top was just not a good fit for me.  The sleeve portion was very tight and did not want to lay right no matter how I adjusted it, and the bust portion kept rolling and I was afraid I'd be exposed.  I'm not sure what type of woman this would fit.  If you are busty or have thick upper arms, I'd pass, although some other reviewers seem to have been able to make it work."
3.0,Purchased for a 12 year old. Quality was very cheap.
3.0,"I returned it because despite the reviews and measuring myself, the one I got did not fit on me the way it did on the model. The material is cheap, and to me, not worth the price. I ordered a medium and I am 5'4&#34;, 140 lbs., 33&#34; waist, 38&#34; hip, so I thought this would be roomie and cute looking! T'was not :&#60;"
3.0,"Looks good for a while, but doesn't last.  For the price you can't ask for more."
3.0,Fit is very snug which makes them difficult to put on. They tear easy when pulling them up because of how snugly the fit and because they are mostly nylon they do tear easily.
3.0,Very cute- just a lot of glue is noticeable on the bracelet.
3.0,Not us I have expected
3.0,"being a jean dress i should have order a nother size, but it was XL..it just ran small."
3.0,"I got the white and blue patterned sarong and enjoyed the look, but strings began to come off soon after wearing a couple times."
3.0,I wish the longer &#34;shoulder&#34; strap was detachable.  I had to cut it off and leave the chains dangling.  I ended up using the chains as a convenient way to attach my keys but would have preferred a detachable shoulder strap.
3.0,"I bought a small in these, and they were so small, I couldn't get my hand in.  I would guess they were a youth medium, or a very very petite small.  I couldn't find them in another size, so I sent them back.  They looked to be nice quality gloves, and I would have loved them to work, but nope!  Returning them was quite easy.  Amazon just keeps getting better!"
3.0,Super cute hat!!<br />But its made weird cuz the tip in the middle front is super pointy. Maybe it just needs to be worn in. Idk. But its cute!
3.0,"Let me start with how cute these are! I really do love them!<br /><br />However, though they will keep your pants from falling off, they have a bit too much give for functional suspenders. Plus, the clips are a little hard on fabric of the pants. I'm already seeing some fraying on my jeans."
3.0,"Lots of stray threads that need cutting, and definitely needs to be ironed. Fits pretty well though the legs are a bit stiff near the crotch. The white shirt also had a gross stain on the neck area… looks like blood or hair dye perhaps? Not going to be using that either way. Looks okay though for the price."
3.0,"I'm with the other reviewers that have criticized this ring for the issues that it has with regular keys.  The shape just doesn't work well if you're going to use it like a regular keyring.  However, if you're going to use it with several smaller group keyrings attached, it can work quite well.  All that being said, the construction and the finish is quite nice."
3.0,Love the purse but for the price the zipper on the middle pocket. And I wasn't even using that pocket
3.0,"Doesn't need slip, fabric crunchy."
3.0,Active duty marine and it did not hold up when wearing my kit.
3.0,The vest did not fit.. it was super small.. other then that all the other stuff if good..
3.0,"I ordered my size, and it is tight"
3.0,I have the original Becky sunglasses and Love them so I figure I would love these too.  Unfortunately these fit a lot different than the originals and looked big on my face.  They are too front heavy too so they slid down my nose.  I really wanted to love them but I am returning them to buy another pair of original Becky’s.  Love Diff though!!
3.0,The end of the sleeves are very tight not comfortable around the wrist. The color was as shown and pretty comfortable but material has no give to it.
3.0,The sleeves have a weird fit and its a bi long for a crop top but other than that its okay.
3.0,"ok for around the house and maybe run to the store, don't love."
3.0,THIS IS A COMFORTABLE BAND AND VERY EASY TO PUT ON BUT IT IS VERY CHEAPLY MADE AND IS SO CROOKED THAT IT LOOKS AWFUL.  DIDN'T PAY MUCH SO WON'T RETURN BUT I'M GUESSING IT WILL ONLY LAST A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE FALLING COMPLETELY APART
3.0,A bit too big for me so if you like big you'll like these....
3.0,"See color less yellow, but only help little bit with antiglare."
3.0,"As expected, not cheaply made at all. Wit was a bit big though. Arrived on time as well"
3.0,I wanted to like this swimsuit. I ordered a large but it felt like a medium. The top is cut really deep which is a little more than my liking. The trunks to fit tight.  I normally where a large in bathing suits. Im a 29/30 waist a 36D bra fit. I'm so disappointed i wanted to love this suit. I wished I read the reviews prior to purchase.  I hope other see this review and consider maybe  a different size.
3.0,"The shaft is so short! Almost too small to fit. While I appreciate it being shirt enough that it doesn't poke out if my nostril, and  it looks great, it just hurts every single time I put it in."
3.0,Not a good choice for me.
3.0,"This dress is cute. The material has an almost quilted/home decor fabric texture, with a paisley-ish design, similar to drapes. I will note that it says dry clean only as well as wash cold. I washed cold delicate and still had lots of threads come loose. I hand washed. Hung dry both times.<br />*UPDATE 5/20/19- have washed and dried several times now with no I'll effects."
3.0,"It is a super cute dress, but the size of the dress is way too small.  I ordered an XL due to the fact that these dresses usually run small, but this dress would not even start to zip.  I am a size 10 and wear a comfortable large.  My measurements at my ribs are 36&#34;.  According to their size chart, I should order a small or medium.  I ordered a 2xl for my mom and there was no size difference.  It's too bad the sizing is so off because it is a super cute dress!"
3.0,Feels kind cheaply made.
3.0,"Super cute and nice quality, but way too small. So disappointing! You'll love these if you're a tiny girl."
3.0,They scratch easy and are hard to clean the smudges off. If it wasn’t for that they would be a decent pair of glasses and I would give it a higher rating.
3.0,Looked very cheap. Not what I expected.
3.0,"Beautiful frames, but it’s a little heavy"
3.0,It was too big for the hairstyle i was wearing.
3.0,"This dress is okay! Way too long and big than I expected. I ordered the white one, it is somewhat see through. For reference i am 5’2 140lbs. The sleeves fits fine and everything else is huge!<br /><br />THIS WOULD BE GREAT as a maternity dress!"
3.0,"I have a large chest and a longer torso, which doesn’t help. But this shirt was still shorter than all my other shirts. If you have a shorter torso, this would probably be fine.<br />The material is thinner. The white material was pretty see-through, so wearing a nude cami/bra is a must.<br /><br />Overall cute. But I couldn’t get past the length, so I had to return it."
3.0,"It is too big and too long( at least on me). It may look nice on someone else but definitely not not. I am 5,1&#34; 115 and curvy hips and this dress does not complement my body what so ever. The top seems two too large while the bottom makes my hip and butt look like a hippos behind. I still think the dress is beautiful just not on me."
3.0,"This is cute, but big for my average sized face."
3.0,"Okay, does not hold a lot of stuff."
3.0,This dress is very cute and true to size. Just beware that once you wash it and dry it it's going to shrink - particularly in length.
3.0,this is VERY sheer--far more see-through than the image suggested. can only be worn as a cover up over a bathing suit or something like that. It is basically the thinnest chiffon you can imagine.
3.0,I really wanted to love these. They look so sparkly and fun. My daughter is 6 and wears the 10. The fit was great. But when the shoes came they look really cheaply made some of the &#34;stones&#34; were rubbed off. The shoe has a pretty big heel for a child that young. I was very surprised. The bow on the side just doesn't work. I was not very happy. But my daughter wore them without my knowledge lol so no returning. Well see how fast until they fall apart.
3.0,"The front is cut funny and gaps a lot on the sides. Also there is a center seam straight down the front instead of the back. I tried the dress backwards, and discovered it fit much better. The straps are attached the wrong way, but I don't think it is all that noticeable. Have worn it flowing in the daytime with sandals and with a black patent belt and heels at night. And love having big pockets!"
3.0,"Beautiful color, nice material but, confusing on how to put it on ."
3.0,I order a 9 toddlers for my daughter. They fit like 9 1/2 and the color was a more of a cream than white but they worked good for Easter.
3.0,I ordered a size up and it is still way too small.  The material is knitted but it is quite stiff and not very comfortable. More of a basic cowl neck sweater than off the shoulder.
3.0,Pockets are hard to get things out of!
3.0,"This hat certainly looks unique and stylish. The material is not very high quality. The shiny part sort of has the feel and texture of a plastic trash bag, only less durable. I like the silver threading around the front."
3.0,The fabric seems quite thin. Very comfortable though and true to Kerrits sizing. Will be good for summer riding as long as the fabric holds up.
3.0,You get what you pay for. It is soft and comfy though.
3.0,"Stiff material,  buttons aren't as cute as photo.  Dress worked for the costume of Alice in Wonderland, but I was hoping to wear the dress again on its own. I won't be doing that. Decent price,  just wish the details of the dress were nicer."
3.0,"It's quite sheer, which is okay for me cause I have a strapless nude bra that makes this wearable. It fits funny though, if I had a smaller bust it would probably fit better but for a 34D I feel like even in a large this tank is structured for a woman with a less curvy figure."
3.0,The gold one was a big gaudy but I figure it wont be long till i scratch it and move onto the next pair. nice buy a suppose
3.0,not as thin as I had hoped for but it's still a good quality alternative to the normal bike wallets and chains.
3.0,The screws come out fast so they fell off before one wash.
3.0,They are very comfortable.  The reason for 3 stars is the upper material is wrinkled.  I hope they wear well.
3.0,As advertised. What you see is what you get.
3.0,Just not crazy about it.
3.0,"Had a hole in them within 2 minutes from my 3 year old trying to pull them up over her knees. Very cute, but a little fragile. My daughter just turned 3 (big for her size) so maybe these are better for older children that take direction well.  Very cute, may buy again once she's older."
3.0,"Very comfy! I’m 5’3 145 and ordered a M; but could’ve went with a S. Reason for three stars is that after one wash it faded tremendously! I can no longer wear it out in public, but use it instead as a lounge garment, when at home. So I probably would not recommend this product."
3.0,"I love this shirt but it is huge on me.  I generally were a size small in shirts, my pant/dress size is 4/6 and this shirt in size small is so big that it doesn't look good.  I even washed it to see if it would shrink at all and it did not."
3.0,The color was much lighter than indicated in the photo. The skirt length was perfect but should have a slit in the back - not easy walking in heels with a tight pencil skirt. Dress size seemed to run small for me.
3.0,"I bought this for my Girlfriend. When it arrived the color was fantastic, vibrant. She's worn it twice, hand washed in cold water twice. The first time the color faded and the second time the covering fabric has torn in 2 places. I realize the price is low but cannot recommend."
3.0,So the material is heavy and nice but these zippers!  I ended up replacing the gown zipper with wide elastic and it worked great.  About 20 minutes with the sewing machine.  The look was fantastic.  The granddaughter and I went to the musical Frozen.  We had a blast being dressed like Elsa.  But as I said zippers are an issue and the proportions were weird.  But the material was good to work with.
3.0,Looks nothing like the picture. It technically fits as far  as size goes but it looks more like a tennis skirt than shorts. And they are very stiff. I have a nice sized rump. You definitely couldn’t tell in these “shorts” they do ship quick though. That’s the only pro
3.0,Looks good. Card slots are tight and hard to insert cards. Don't  believe  I would order this brand again.
3.0,"Runs pretty small. Seems well made, but order a size or two up if your busty."
3.0,waist band kind of cheap
3.0,This was a gift for my daughter Way to big
3.0,"first wear and ripped pocket, larger than expected"
3.0,"This was made of a thin material and the sleeves are really short. I was expecting more of a sweater thickness but it is almost see through. The material is super soft so it makes for a good sleep shirt. Also, the black of the heart faded to a washed out black after one laundering."
3.0,"Vibrant color, thin material yet the dress is still cute. I end up giving mine to a friend bc it runs small"
3.0,It's too big to wear comfortably
3.0,"This is a tiny piece& fuschite is an exceedingly soft mineral. I therefore carry this, rather than wear it."
3.0,The pin was great - but the metal backs were lousy.  I purchased 3 pins and needed to replace 2 of the backs.
3.0,"The magnets didn't hold so well, kept coming apart and eventually a piece got lost."
3.0,"These are really cute. They're a good size for kids and have ample storage inside. They do feel durable and they roll quite easily. However this came with scratches and scuffs on it. I can't possibly give my nephew this and feel good about it. He wouldn't care or even notice since he's 3, but I would and do. So I returned them."
3.0,"When they finally arrived, they are nice enough. They definitely feel like cheap yarn and arent very stretchy though."
3.0,I return it.  To many flowers in this case
3.0,"The color and pattern were spot on with the picture. The problem was that one of the seams ripped as soon as I put it on. The fabric is thin and the thread is either too weak, or too rotten. I am a plus-size woman - about an 18-20 in Dressbarn sizes so I got the 4x in this shirt - and the fit of this shirt was okay. Maybe a bit small in the bust, but everywhere else was a good fit. I just wish it were a shirt that would last for more than one or two wears."
3.0,The sticky stuff starts to not hold as much but I don't know if that is normal
3.0,"I ended up returning it because I was looking for a more fitted sweatshirt and it was a bit too large despite my ordering a smaller size, hoping for a tighter fit. There's nothing wrong with it if you want comfort, but it's not especially flattering."
3.0,They're cute but the opening in the back is a little big so they feel pretty loose and have popped off a couple of times.
3.0,The straps along the back where snapped into place. The shoulder strap that these snapped into was too long so this caused the front top to hang way too low causing some issues.
3.0,Not great quality but good enough for the Halloween costume I bought it for.
3.0,"Well, they just don't feel the same as normal earrings. You can feel the metal tryna go through your ear, and its a little painful. They also fall out occasionally and you might lose them if you're not careful"
3.0,I ordered the size 8 and it fits same as all my size 7 rings. The stone is a good size and very pretty. The metal does not look silver...it is very yellow tinted. Not sure if you can see in the pics but on both sides it gets orange (almost burnt) look. So that is disappointing. If it looked like sterling silver and fit right it would have been 5 stars.
3.0,I was only able to zip up this jacket once out of 10 times. Otherwise I would have liked to have worn it. Please note it has outside pockets only.
3.0,"Definitely like the actualy chain, but was disappointed with the little plastic closure thing that actually holds the chain onto the side of my glasses.  I've found that the plastic does NOT hold tight and it keeps slipping and sliding. Sorry."
3.0,Ordered XS (my normal size in just about everything) and they were uncomfortably tight.
3.0,Fits quite tightly on my average-sized wrists and contains an in accurate number of beads. But it looks very nice.
3.0,Product is smaller so def go up on size. Quality of product is thick and seems good the only thing is that the padding on the back WILL stick out giving you a very odd duck tail/lip don't even know how to describe it. It does the job but you will be embarrassed to ride in public!
3.0,"Truly adorable dress. Ordered a medium and it fit perfect on my body, except the hem was high and laid across my breasts instead of underneath them like a typical A-line (it also had no elastic which made it very uncomfortable placed there, and I am not large chested). Have to return, sadly."
3.0,Love the fit but doesn't stay on. The bottom opens often.
3.0,"UPDATE: I have added a star to reflect the very relentless kindness the seller has shown to refund my money and send me a better product, and overall to ensure a happy customer. I still in good conscience cannot say this is a good product (read below), however the seller has mentioned a better tank coming out in a month. Perhaps this will resolve the issues below? Stay tuned.<br /><br />OLDER REVIEW: I really wanted to like this top. Unfortunately, this is a bizarrely tailored piece, with armholes that extend to the chest but are short underneath, and a too-short torso length. Even with my short torso, this didn't work. Additionally, the fabric is clingy--not tight--just clingy and feels flimsy. Even in a different size this would not improve the very strange tailoring and the cheap-feeling fabric."
3.0,"Got this formy daughter and I. The idea is cute and I've been looking for a similar design for awhile now. I put them on when they arrived. There is just too much string. It hangs out in an unsightly way. Cutting it is not an option and the string doesn't lend to knots that will stay put, every knot eventually came undone. I'll keep looking."
3.0,The size was smaller than the tag so buy a size bigger than what you need.
3.0,Bought the same hat in yellow and this fits quite differently. The yellow one fit perfectly. The gray one is huge.  Therefore I received inconsistent sizing (quality control issue?) depending on the color purchased.
3.0,"On a few sets I had double of the same number, so it would go 1,2,3,3,5,6. They are also pretty tight and from what I read they don't stretch out. I will update this review after a week of wearing them."
3.0,"The rings are cute, unfortunately some of them don't fit.."
3.0,I like the way the covers fit; they do not look anything like the picture.
3.0,"The coat fit as expected, but the upper arms are too small."
3.0,They are good for my line of work but they roll and I ripped both pairs of them
3.0,"Cute, fits well. The white fabric showed through the pants as it stretches which makes it look like a dark grey and not black"
3.0,"I like the necklace but the earrings are junk. The clip on the necklace does continue to come around to the front of your neck, which is a nuisance, but it's cute."
3.0,"I like it, the style and the length is just right. I just don't want the material used."
3.0,"This raincoat was much thinner than I expected, an the graphics appear a bit cheesy in person, but I was able to pair it almost exactly with the Shopkins Rainboots sold by the AccessoWear store. Overall, I am satisfied. It is still a super cute rain jacket."
3.0,"Its not Crystals thats for sure, more like a clear bead. If I could figure out how to get it on my wrist that would be helpful as well. Its very pretty but its not crystal just clear beads."
3.0,Way to large not sure how they get the measurements but they are way off.  I was so excited I found a beautiful coat for a great price but was disappointed when it didn't fit right.
3.0,I liked the sparkle but necklace is difficult to put on by oneself  to put on.  You would need someone to help you.
3.0,It is nice for the price but it took 37 days to get here (2 feb-10 march)....so order it 1 1/2 months before you need it
3.0,"My first impression upon opening the package is poor quality as I see long loose threads on the outside, inside and on the waistband of the shorts.  On the plus side, I like the more square, higher rise fit.  The fabric is a heavier weight and there are pockets on the side. The drawstring waistband is thick and isn’t too uncomfortable, although I am not sure why the elastic is so thick and heavy, especially if there is a drawstring.  I typically wear a XS/S and am 5ft 115lbs.  I got the S and there is a little extra fabric in the stomach area, but overall, the right size. I like this short for a relaxed, kick around type of casual short."
3.0,I am on my fourth hat this winter season. I love the item however the sound / bluetooth in each hat failed within six weeks. I bought another one today as the convenience outweighs the expense
3.0,Product excellent but received only 4 pieces instead of 5.  :(<br />Otherwise would have given it a five star.
3.0,It is a bit small even for an extra large.
3.0,Me quedo un poco justa.<br />Producto de calidad aceptable para su precio
3.0,The design is too bright and plastic like.
3.0,"I bought this for my son for Xmas. He wanted something that had his birthstone (citrine) in it. I like that it symbolized good energy. The concept and quality is good however, the one that he received looks nothing like the photo. As a matter of fact it is quite feminine. Too feminine for my 17 year old son to feel good about wearing. The spiral wire in the middle is in the shape of a heart instead of round as pictured. A bit disappointing."
3.0,These fit nicely into my Sketchers although they are not as soft and comfy as the ones I buy at the day spa.  The price is good but I'm not sure how they will hold up after a few washes.
3.0,These glasses were a little to severe in style for my taste. There were definitely large enough but the gold tip on the end was a little to costume for me. However they do seem well made and sturdy.
3.0,"came within a week which is a plus! however, ordered a L - tall, im 5’9 and 180lbs. too short, length hit above ankle. i do find the top to be flattering, VERY flowey around whole bodice. comes with two belts, a black leather flower thing and a chiffon belt that matches shell. debating between altering it myself or returning."
3.0,"wore for a Hawaiian themed party, they were very cute but beware they shed A LOT"
3.0,"I like the idea. But, I wasn’t that pleased with customer service. I measured correctly and ordered accordingly. Placed a call twice and no one answers, just voicemail. I’d probably order again if they had a longer options."
3.0,Calidad media
3.0,"I have big boobs and the elastic came up to the bottom of my breast, instead of my waist."
3.0,"From stock photos this dress looks like it might have some flow and be loose, but this was not the case. I found that it fit more like a body con dress- way too tight- despite the fact that I sized up one size (see photo). I ordered a size medium but am a size 4, 5'2&#34; and the length was great. The material is a little thin, but not quite see through. Fairly easy nursing access, if you just pull the top flap up, but I have a feeling it's going to stretch out quickly.<br />I plan to keep it wear in the fall when I can pair a cardigan over it but there is no way this postpartum body is wearing a dress this tight.<br />If you found this review helpful, please mark as helpful!"
3.0,"The panels are really good especially at night with glare. However, it is very difficult to open or fold these, very stiff."
3.0,"It's pretty, and I will hang it in my car. It is obviously painted, nothing ""natural"" about it. But for $0.99 I am not complaining!"
3.0,I ordered the heart one but I received the wrong one. The one I did receive is very pretty and it’s very nice!
3.0,Nice sweatshirt. Runs small especially if you are bustier. Size up if you like your sweatshirts on the looser side.
3.0,Top runs small pants fit as expected
3.0,"Let’s get my primary criticism out of the way: I’m not sure what I was expecting for the price, but (as shown in the pic) it seems like the tongue is already worn and will like spread to complete unraveling after some use. Otherwise, great looking boot. As noted throughout the reviews, step it down a size from what you normally wear. I can actually see how the sole could split because it’s solid, unlike a standard rubber sole. Still, so long as you aren’t using  these for daily work boots (manual labor), I could see them lasting. Also, they are surprisingly comfortable, but like another reviewer noted, they feel more like a dress shoe on the arches."
3.0,"I am 5ft tall, 38DD bust, normally wear a size Large, 150 lbs.  I ordered the color black in size Medium.  I ordered a medium because I did not want it to be too loose fitting. Unfortunately, it fits like a large and it is loose. So I would say this fits a little larger than what was expected. In the picture the black color looks like it is trimmed in white but in person the trim is grey which looks like I have already washed it in hot water and the black blead onto the white. Also, I am five feet tall and the length falls to my ankle. Which is what I expected for me."
3.0,My error to $
3.0,Shirt is smaller and shorter than I expected. Love the material.
3.0,It's okay.  I will just give it away. Can't return it back.
3.0,I ended up making a few adjustments to it. but its a pretty dress and I would say worth the buy
3.0,Looking for a dark blue color but got a periwinkle/sky blue. Fit great and feels smooth on the skin! I'll try the other color.
3.0,received this from hubby. nice butterfly pattern but only one one side. nice clean edges and fringed ends but opposite side has no pattern. you can see the pattern on opposite side but be aware the beautiful pattern is one-sided.
3.0,The quality is bad when you are looking through sun and cell phone.<br />The Frame is good.
3.0,We really liked the toy overall but the overwhelming smell couldn’t even be washed out in the dishwasher we had to return it
3.0,The setting is nice.  The stone is not all red.  Mine is half red and fades to yellow.  Metal had worn from silver to copper like color.  It turns my finger green/black.  Just to busy to return it so I will live with it as is.
3.0,"It appears that this no show socks are hit or miss.  Either they work well, or they do not.  In my case, I found that the back slips off too easily.  I suspect that the slippage has something to do with the way my heel is formed, because many reviewers indicate that the socks stay on well for them.  However, at least one reviewer indicated that while the socks stay on while wearing shoes, they do not stay on while sleeping, so it appears that these socks are predisposed to coming off.<br /><br />These socks have to be the lowest cut socks I have ever seen.  I have several pairs of dress shoes and these socks disappear in every pair of shoes that I own.<br /><br />The socks are soft and fit well on my size 10-11 foot, which I would expect.<br /><br />Our rating of three stars is primarily due to the socks slipping off the back of my foot.  We understand the concept of super-low cut no show socks.  These socks are really low cut, to the point where they like to come off the back of my foot.  The socks stay on better with shoes, but, at least for my feet, the socks seem to like to slide off with relatively little encouragement.  We thought about rating these socks two stars, but decided that because the socks seem to stay on better when wearing shoes (it appears that the tighter the shoes the better for sock position), and because they are soft and fit well, two stars was overly harsh and negative.  Even so, buyers should consider how defined the heel on their foot is to determine whether the socks are likely to stay on their foot.<br /><br />Good luck!"
3.0,"I would have given this a strong four stars but when my jewelry came, a part of it was broken. I found the claps and had to fix it manually. Other than that, I would definitely order this again."
3.0,"Beautiful but, the chain at the end of the wings looked bad! It kind of reminded me of a little girlsomething bracelet for a vending machine.  The only thing that that looked good was the wings and the pearl!"
3.0,I do not like this material.. at all. It’s cheaply and I’m afraid to wash it. I feel like it will shrink. I ordered 2 sizes up and it still fits a little snug.
3.0,"Recently purchased these for the cute style and the bonus polarization, received what I ordered and do love the style and how decorative they are (there are cute gems on the ends of the behind-the-ear portion that make them a bit more fancy), but they are in no way polarized. Very misleading title for the product, but what you receive does look like what's advertised."
3.0,"I actually like this hat but it’s way smaller than most other hats I have. I had to put it on the last button to even fit on my head comfortably, where I normally sit on the 3-4 buttons.<br /><br />If you have a smaller head this hat is probably fine"
3.0,"Being a lady &#34;of a certain age&#34;, I was looking for a flattering suit that would also manage larger breasts. This didn't do it, but then neither did any other suit. I solved the problem by buying a sports bra to wear under the suit, and cut out the completely useless bra in the suit. Probably because of that, this tends to bunch up around the underarms. But I made it work."
3.0,It was so wrinkly. The colors were as shown
3.0,"I'm 5'2' 120lbs, the medium size fit well. The stitching was a bit messy on a part of the dress (see pic). The material is not see through. After washing it takes a good day and a half to dry if you leave it to dry flat which is what the directions say. Overall disappointed in the stitching but it was a good value so I just hope it doesn't start to unravel there."
3.0,"Out of twenty individually wrapped &#34;piercings&#34;, 9 fit. The rest were too small, but they arrived with no damage. It's a bittersweet purchase."
3.0,"I would assume that how these fit and how much compression they give will depend a lot on your calf dimensions relative to your feet.  With only 2 sizes, there will be a large variation in how much compression you get (and how tight they feel).  Based on shoe size, I got the L/XL, but my ankles and calves are clearly smaller than most, so I suspect I get a lot less compression (and easier to put on) than a guy a foot taller and weighing twice as much.  That works for me, but might not for you.  And, of course, they come up fairly high and I have to fold over the top."
3.0,Fit big in the bust area. Low cut v.
3.0,"Not bad at all, but be aware that these are flat knitted gloves. There is no handedness to them so if you have very small hands you will have wrinkles at the thumb base. Also they are extremely NOT one-size-fits-all if you have XL hands. I'd say these are nowhere close to one-size-fits-all. Won't buy these again, no way no how."
3.0,"these gloves will grow in a few weeks. so if you order a size larger than usual, they will be loose on your hands. i handle lye and grease at work so im not sure if thats making them stretch way out or not. any scientists out there have some input? before that, they were my all time favorite gloves."
3.0,"I absolutely love 90 degrees yoga pants!!!  I love the compression fit and how it stays on right.  I never purchased any of the leggings that had a side pocket until now.  I was traveling last week and felt that I needed a pair that I could put my phone in. I was disappointed in the way they fit. I purchased two and they both were rolling down, had to pull them up several times a day which defeated the purpose of my purchase.  I did not experience the same with the other leggings (without the side pocket) which was great!  I wish it was better and I'd give them a better rating since I own a number of pairs from the same brand.<br /><br />The material is thick and stretchy and I absolutely love that they are NOT see through!  I just wished they didn't roll down."
3.0,"It was smaller than I thought, but pretty."
3.0,It's ok...but it's slightly too small making it a little uncomfortable to wear for a long time.
3.0,Color significantly different
3.0,It stains easy and starts to pill after a few wears. Super cute tho!
3.0,Too small in the back of the boat of sharp rip my shirt
3.0,These are all around a great buy for littles. My only complaint is that they are smaller than anticipated. My son is 4 & they’re a little small on him.
3.0,As soon as they got wet ..stretched out and couldn't wear them ..disappointed
3.0,"Such a cute bikini outfit, but beware it runs very small. Looked at size guide…. I ordered a XL (cuz I’m only top heavy) and it literally looked like it took 2 of the cups to cover someone 1 boob!! I’m mean seriously it was an XL!! The cup size looks like a AAA cup"
3.0,Med fit more like a large; & lg to xL in the ; sending back to try the small
3.0,I like the cardigan but not the collar...
3.0,"like the shirt, and i always buy large, but this is WAY to small"
3.0,Good for the money. But smaller than I thought. And I thought the metal piece hung on the earring hook but separate from the feather. The metal attached to the leather.
3.0,I have been told it's hard to figure out what they are. They don't look like sharks.
3.0,They are cute but the adapted they give for the back of your head does not hold the large straps they have for the ears.
3.0,"The dress itself is beautiful, however I merely have a b cup and can not button up any of the buttons. I imagine anyone with larger breasts won't fit in it at all"
3.0,"The sizing chart seems wildly inaccurate.  I usually wear a 42&#34; or 43&#34; chest measurement for suit jackets.  I purchased a pack of the medium size shirts and I was practically swimming in them.  There was way too much material for me.  Granted I usually prefer slimmer fitting shirts, especially for undershirts.  Other than the sizing issue, the t-shirts seemed fine."
3.0,"It's a nice dress, fits well, I just hoped for a better quality fabric, even at this price - the fabric was very disappointing."
3.0,Waaaayyy smaller than I imagined. Isn't wide enough to home unfolded money. The color is much softer than pictured which sucks.
3.0,"The picture of color was incorrect. The light denim is shown under the medium denim option and the medium denim is shown under the light denim option. I didn't know which information I should rely on when I ordered. I choose the medium denim option with light denim pictures, and I received medium denim skirts. The skirts itself are very comfortable and stretchable but the zipper is too rough to use. The quality was not so great as I expected."
3.0,Would have kept if the inseam were longer
3.0,"For $25 it’s not a horrible quality. It doesn’t go see-through when wet (though I didn’t get it in white, so idk if that would. For reference the back is unlined, so I suspect all white would go see through when wet. The front IS lined, though) I am usually a size L but based on the size chart I ordered an XL. It’s a bit looser than I would prefer and should have stuck with a large. Idk if most people know this but swim material stretches when wet, so it’s usually better for them to be a bit tight rather than too loose... also as a larger chested woman I felt like the ruffles on this were too big and added too much volume on top. This would probably be very flattering for someone heavier on the bottom than the top, or with a smaller chest size. However, I trimmed the ruffle to about half the width and like it that way much better. Also, the way the ruffle is sewn in, it flips up very easily which shows the white side of the fabric. I plan to add a few quick stitches on the shoulders to try to keep them down. Overall I didn’t expect an amazing piece for $25 And from amazon but it definitely has that mass-produced and not always super flattering look to it."
3.0,"well, not as good as I thought, doesn't fit well"
3.0,faded on first wash
3.0,"The material is a little costumey to me but it's cute. Runs a little small on my bottom half, fits good up top"
3.0,"They are very pretty earrings but the quality could be better. The &#34;diamonds&#34; in them are a little loose and a few of them are slightly bent. But you get what you pay for! The designs are really nice and I like the rubber backing, they made it a little more comfortable on the ears. I really hope they do not turn my ears green though!"
3.0,"Doesn’t always line up properly, so you end up looking ridiculous"
3.0,One garter broke the first time I wore it. I guess if you don't make it them that tight they'll stay together.
3.0,The fastening system was great. I was very disappointed with the quality of the fabric. It is more like a cheesecloth rather than sturdy cotton you see in most quality aprons.  The hat was slightly smaller than expected. It wasn't the same as pictured.
3.0,"Thin but soft enough... you can tell it will not hold up, it will pill but it will be good enough for one summer."
3.0,The fabric was just okay and the color seemed faded. Design is cute.
3.0,"Only okay, a little a skimpy.  More a bow than a fascinator."
3.0,It's okay.  In reality it looks like a nurse uniform.  Not as sexy.
3.0,"Just what I expected, looks great"
3.0,Small. White fades.
3.0,"i love the fact i finally found 22g; and that the assortment was pretty descent. but i have a very small nose, usually i have to cut/trim down my nose studs, even my nose screws, its just too much in length to be comfortable for me and not poke out like i am growing a branch from my nose.<br />anyway, although these are the perfect size, colors, price etc.... i can't trim them back (too good of steel) and have had to coil it around so much it feels very large inside my nostril while wearing it.<br />still cannot find the perfect 22g nose screw that is completely bendable."
3.0,Cute but came apart ar the seams.
3.0,Look beautiful on me but port quality
3.0,"Fragile, but pretty."
3.0,This wallet is well-constructed from good-quality leather and holds everything you could possibly need it to. But the completely unnecessary snap increases its size from just very large to ridiculous. It's constantly snagging on things when I try to get the wallet in or out of my pocket.
3.0,"A lot smaller than expected. I assume someone got my order wrong, BUT they are nice overall."
3.0,"I love the look of these sunglasses; I also like that they are polarized. However, the lenses only lasted for about 1.5 years before air bubbles began to appear on the edges of each lens."
3.0,I would've given this dress 5 stars except for its overwhelming neon colors -- an 80's throwback print.
3.0,"I thought I would love this, and splurged on it at $26 compared to my other chemo beanies which mostly ran around $10. The fabric is very pretty, but the fit is odd. It fits my head okay, but the way it hangs doesn't look like the photos. I'm going to go to the Shari Rose website and see if they have any advice on how to make it look like the pictures."
3.0,"Material is good, but the making needs to be more careful. A lot of loose threads."
3.0,I liked that this was a great value buy.  I bought them in size 0G.  The steel double flared screw tunnels were better quality than the silicone tunnels.  One of the blue tunnels (which was one of the pieces I was looking forward to the most) was missing the back piece to it.  The silicone tunnels were of less quality in terms of irregular shapes and some pieces of rubber sticking out at the ends of the flares to make it look like they were not made well.
3.0,These are not maroon but rust colored
3.0,"It's a weird shiny type fabric, probably great for dust and dirt flying around or riding bikes in the dirt. Definitely not a medical mask, but it will get you into a store without being turned away and it doesn't seem to be too hot or restrictive which is what I needed."
3.0,"Does fit as I expected, I ordered an XL and the bottoms were too small and the top was too big, the top isn't form fitting at all, also the top doesn't look like the first picture shown at al"
3.0,"This pendant has to be worn front facing, because the casting on the back is not at all attractive.  The band is very simple, coarse material.  The item is fine.  Nothing special, I think I would have paid less for it but I'm not happy or unhappy."
3.0,I love the way this looks but it's very stiff and kind of uncomfortable. I wrapped it in rubber bands for a couple weeks before I was able to wear it because it was so stiff. I don't think I would buy again.
3.0,"I got a size 8 and it was only a tad too small in the bust area which sucks cuz it fit nicely everywhere else. (5'6, 160lbs) I could pull it off but i don't want my bra peaking out in between the buttons from a side view. The Apricot color looks more yellowish than in the picture. The picture looks more on the tan/brown side if that makes sense. It fit everywhere except the bust area and my bra size is a 36B sometimes C. If you're in the same weight and height range but with a smaller bust, this dress will fit you perfectly! I need a nursing dress otherwise I'd buy a dress with non-functional buttons"
3.0,Good product for the price but not really able to wear due to the mold of the plastic frame not being straight. Will try and heat up and slightly bend frame back.  I've bought other styles and everything is OK with those. Will buy in future.
3.0,I got this I wanted to cut it to style it but it’s not a regular T-shirt it like a polyester. It is an ok shirt. The design is good.
3.0,Too big I need a 21X12X12 or something very close to use for a gym bag.
3.0,I bought these for me.. but will have to give them to my great granddaughter that is 3 years old.. they are very tiny.
3.0,"If you are not riding a motorcycle, they are great.  On the bike, the wind flips them up making them completely useless when they are most needed."
3.0,Is really kool
3.0,The socks were smaller than expected. Not as soft as I would like
3.0,"This dress was very cute. I did, however have to return it bc it didn't fit me. I have a big butt and it was just too tight on my bottom half. I could have gone up a size but then the top would have been too large."
3.0,They are so bright and sparkling.  The stone fell out the first day I tried to wear them. I was able to put it back in due to the wires being so flexible. I don't expect them to last long so I will enjoy the sparkle while it lasts.
3.0,Fits well put pills pretty easily.
3.0,"Nice thin shirt. It is see through, but not enough that you need to wear a shirt underneath it. It is comfortable, and has held up to my dogs jumping on me when I get home. I wear it as a work shirt mostly because it is a bit boxy and unflattering for my taste."
3.0,"I have wide feet, so expected them to be snug.  I had to remove the insole to get my feet in the shoes.  Can only wear with thin socks or no socks on.  The ankle area is really tight.  They work well around the house in the morning before the heat kicks in."
3.0,"This wristlet looks very pretty, better in person. But the tassle and the loop fell off within a few days. I've been using it as a clutch since then."
3.0,Was bigger than expected and also it looked like it was made from really cheap material. Not bad but was really hoping for better.
3.0,Low quality. Returned
3.0,"I got the size I wear and it’s too fitting to wear now! It’s made good, good color, good material! I’d just go up a size unless you like it fitting and not allowing for shrinkage once you end up washing it as well!"
3.0,buy it 2 sizes bigger than you wear...at least.
3.0,"I bought the matching shoes.  They do not match each other.  But, I missed my window of time to return this, so I am holding on to it as a gift for someone eventually.  It's really cute, it's absolutely a clutch/ purse.  Not small enough to be a wallet, or large enough to be a purse.  Cute, although not impressed by the notice that says it may contain Lead."
3.0,"A good design, but I had a higher expectation about the shoes material, taking into account the price.."
3.0,What is shown is so much larger than what I received. This hat would fit my 4 yr old grandaughter as pictured.
3.0,"material pills and snags easily, will by cotton next time around."
3.0,"Was disappointed in size, when it said flowy I got it so that it would not cling to me, I’m 5-9 and lift weights so not a twig and It was skin tight."
3.0,Runs very small need to order 2 sizes bigger then whats needed.  Other then that they are made well and very fast shipping
3.0,"I wear size large. Ordered this shirt and an Amazon Essential Linen shirt, the Amazon fit perfect, but this one was way too tight, specially the sleeves. Had to return."
3.0,I like the design but the jumpsuit runs big
3.0,Not bad for the price however at times the fit bit will want to pop out
3.0,The hat is fine but the clear shield that I received has wrinkles.  It was made of soft plastic.
3.0,This were not all purple like the picture. The top and bottom of the mask were white.
3.0,Theyre super cute but the strap for your big toe digs into your toe and gets uncomfortable.
3.0,"These are very soft, comfortable shorts with great pockets. Unfortunately, they are too baggy in the crotch. Fit great everywhere else!"
3.0,"It is a little tight, not a lot of boob room. I ordered an extra large based on the size chart and other reviews. The material is thin and feels cheap. Looks cute. This would be fine for like a photo shoot or a Halloween party. I wouldn't wear this all day long in public."
3.0,"I was disappointed, for a product that is x-large, it sure is small.  I was expecting it to expand to a more round shape when filled.  It is totally flat! very little storage.  The product is made very well.  but to small."
3.0,"Cute dress, but the medium is huge all over. Bust, sleeve length, wrist elastic, and waist elastic are all too big."
3.0,These are pretty but to big to actually wear.
3.0,Lace felt to stretched out
3.0,"It’s a thin material, cool design but it’s definitely not a warm sweatshirt."
3.0,"Very light weight earrings, might be better for children. I fumbled while trying to insert and dropped the 3mm one, still can't find it."
3.0,Kinda fragile
3.0,Pretty but runs small in the chest/back area.
3.0,"This product has an odd fit, they don't look like the picture.  I'm going to keep them for gardening, or for staying at home."
3.0,they just tarnish.
3.0,Doesn't really change colors much.
3.0,"It is nearly impossible to find supportive comfortable footwear that isn't either hideous or extremely expensive. This plain design is easily dressed up or down, and is quite stylish. Its afforable, and appears to be well made.<br /><br />Comfort is lacking though. (For reference, I wear high arch supports in NB tennis shoes at work,  and Clarks Cloudsteppers thongs the rest of the time)  These have a solid sole, but it's too thin to absorb shock when walking, and it's not squishy enough to be comfortable.  The appearance of a high arch is medium at best, and my feet were aching after primarily sitting through a day long barbeque. The feel of the sole is smooth and velvety, but not comfy enough for me.<br /><br />For regular feet, these are probably incredible.  For plantar fasciitis, sore heels, or high arches in need of support, these lovely wont be your cute go-to replacement for your ugly, expensive, comfortable orthotics... at least they aren't for me. They are better than heels though... ...so the next time I actually NEED dress shoes, these will be rummaged out of the back of my closet, but probably not before then."
3.0,This looked great but was broken as soon as the package was opened. My wife was planning to wear this for Party but at the end it was disappointing.
3.0,"The sizing was way off. My daughter is 5' 1"" and 102 lbs. We offered 10-12 and they fit like capri pants in the legs and the waist was 5-6 inches too small. The belt was so big that it could fit Santa. We definitely will be returning."
3.0,"Ordered beige/tan. The scarf I recieved was light steel grey. Returned it based on being sent the wrong color.<br /><br />Observations from the few minutes of handling, the material was very soft and light/airy. Nice feel. Sparkles did get all over my hands. Very fine like metalic makeup or lotion glitter, not gritty like craft glitter."
3.0,Didn’t fit my body like model.
3.0,They are wonderful sunglasses. Does not look cheap. But lense scratch easily
3.0,Looks better in pic on Amazon.
3.0,way too big.......I bought this particular hat because other reviews said it was small....at least adjustable..... it's not...it's big....good looking....made nice...but big
3.0,"I just purchased this product to move from silicone to this just to try it out. I'm a 2g. Well not all the gauges are actually the same size. I lined them up & you can see a difference. One of them kept falling out. They stay for awhile but kept falling out. & when I mean one of them, I always put two different color gauges in so they weren't the same color. My holes are different sizes. All in all they stay in well when it's the right size & you cant feel them, they are not heavy."
3.0,"The purse is a nice size. I thought it would be leather, but was a burlap. I didn't like that so I returned it. If you return it you don't get credit back on your credit card. They give you a gift card."
3.0,I  was excited to get this in wine however when it arrived it was red. I haven’t worn it yet as I think I may look like Mrs Clause or an Elf. I love the lace but since it’s advertised as wine that is what I expected. Not sure if I’ll brave it and try to wear it or if I’ll return it.
3.0,"they were super big for my nose and kinda fit funny, the magnets were also sort of weak."
3.0,"Cute dress, stretchy with some give. However, it does run small. Get at least a size up. It fit as a medium for me (5'7&#34; and 140) but completely smushed my chest because of how tight it was. Wish I went up a size!"
3.0,"Update:<br />4.14.2017<br />In less than 3 weeks of use The bag now has a rip in one of the inside pockets. Taking one star off. I still like the bag , but not sure of durability for what I need.<br /><br />So far this backpack has lasted. I have something coming up and I think this bag will serve its purpose. I'll update this review either way. I am not sure if I'd like this bag if I were a long time  hiker. I am happy as a new entrant into the travel/hiking backpack space. It is work day tested in hopes that my experience will duplicated during the travel weekend.  This purchase was made with the intention of never going over 20 pounds. Please keep that in mind when considering my review.<br /><br />4.30.2017<br />I've had to staple the bottom of the inner pocket. Too close to my trip to order another bag. Removing a star.<br />What i've carried - Laptop, head phones(small in top pocket), workout sneakers in bottom compartment slid in protective sleeve , shorts, t-shirts."
3.0,"Was excited to get this and have as a spring/summer dress. Envisioned it dressed up with heels or with white tennis shoes for a casual look. I will be doing neither.<br /><br />Material is soft and comfortable. Top and empire waist are stretchy. But, this gave me an unflattering ""boxy"" look. Ordered my usual size, Medium, and while it fit ok (form fitting vs loose) the length hit an odd spot on my legs.<br /><br />Will be keeping and giving to my teen daughter as it is cute dress and color."
3.0,"These are fantastic tall socks.  They are not thick and made for soccer so we will use them for under boots in the winter.  The fabric is soft and they are stretchy.  After a few washings, they still look good."
3.0,"My oldest has a thing about scorpions. He had seen something like this at a retail store one day and liked it very much. When I found this one here in Amazon,  I was pleasantly surprised that it had the glow-in-the-dark feature. He was very excited when he received this."
3.0,doesn't fits to my kids as i expected it's too large
3.0,The necklace is very pretty but much smaller than it looks in the picture.
3.0,I failed to read that they were leather and thought they were made of an acrylic material.  They were very lightweight
3.0,This jean is more for like a curvy women size 16 it was not a size 22 i wear a 18-20 that y i bought size up but i did not go over my butt.
3.0,I ordered an extra large and to me it seems like it’s a 2x
3.0,"Not light material- both good and bad. Good- may hold up longer, bad- too heavy to comfortably work out in the heat. Good fall/winter short? TBD"
3.0,Ring sticks to far out on finger.
3.0,It will work!
3.0,Plus the lenses fogged up and I had to keep pulling them off my face to let air in to remove the fog and when I do that with my onion hands then my eyes burned anyway
3.0,"I wanted to love this, but unfortunately it was too small. Too bad, as it matched the earrings I got perfectly."
3.0,Child wore 2 times and it's starting to peel on top.  Don't buy.  He only wore them in the pool.
3.0,Jacket is nice but doesn’t include power. Thankfully I had a extra portable phone charger and that works
3.0,"They are nice for the most part but almost always split at the bottom when putting them on, no matter how gentle I try to put them on."
3.0,"One of my chains arrived broken and I'm not too happy about it, nor do I want to be inconvenienced by having to return it..."
3.0,"I wanted to love these jeans. From the front they are super cute. Fit like expected. However, from behind... well, there is no behind. They were just not flattering to my backside. I definitely don't have a flat butt either, so these jeans were putting in extra work to make it look nonexistent."
3.0,"Didn't come in the typical Pandora box, makes me think it may be a &#34;knockoff&#34;"
3.0,Looses feathers easily so be very careful handling. Hoping it makes it until our show in one piece! Just okay.
3.0,Feathers were all off when taken out so I don't know where they came from. And there was a hole right under the left arm. Bit I did wear it after fixing it. Only gave 3 stars because of the hole and feathers off of it.
3.0,"Touch screen ability was not detected, having tried many times I still couldn't unlock cell phone with the gloves on. I love how warm they keep my hands main reason for purchase."
3.0,It is just big enough and very thin. You will have to wear something underneath to keep warm.
3.0,"Cheaply made, even more than expected. Keeping it, but would not reorder."
3.0,"The dress is to small.  I normally wear a Size 4, I ordered a Size 6, and it's still to small.  I'm going to give it another shot and order up another size.  I'm a 33.5 bust and 36 hips, 5'8&#34;, 128.5 pounds, 28/29&#34; waist.  I'm going to try the Size 8 and see how that works for me."
3.0,Pensé que era mejor el material
3.0,"The description says swing dress, but the material and shape is all wrong for a swing dress. It’s a nice fall dress though"
3.0,These are very high wasted compared to the picture shown and they fit baggy around the legs. I have thick legs and these shouldn't be as loose as they are. Useable but not what was described.
3.0,product is nice just doesn't fit.
3.0,"The umbrella looks great and seems to be pretty sturdy, however the auto tilt functionality does not work with ours. There are no instructions included so I had to do some research to find out how this is supposed to work. Apparently you're supposed to keep turning the crank to raise the umbrella and then it will begin to tilt. This does not happen. Our crank gets to a point where it will no longer turn and the umbrella never tilts."
3.0,The watch is nice and still working but during the first week the button fell off without my knowing.
3.0,I'm giving the party hats a particularly a 3 star because they broke way to easily!
3.0,Do not work according to what I hope or by description.
3.0,"Dress is cute but not very soft. Also, this size ""fits"" 0-6mos...This dress swallows my 3 month old. She weighs about 11lbs."
3.0,"The stainless tunnels are nice and fit well, but the silicone tunnels are a little longer than I would have liked. They hang out of my ears more than any I have ever tried!"
3.0,"The reviews I read said this ran small, and that was no joke.  I'm 5'4&#34; 120 lbs, so I ordered a large, and not only are the sleeves too tight, but this would never be considered a mini &#34;dress&#34;.  I'm nervous to wash it, as I'm not sure how much more of the shirt I can afford to lose.  If you plan to buy this shirt, go several sizes up, especially if your arms aren't model-thin."
3.0,"For the price its good,its sticky and you need to learn how to work with it,add some water to make it less sticky"
3.0,"The charms are great, BUT the rings have a hook that doesn’t allow some charms and beads to fit over. And once you try to pull it in a straight position it breaks off."
3.0,"I received these sunglasses yesterday and was slightly disappointed. First of all, my seemingly normal sized glasses dont fit nicely inside of these glasses therefore they are constantly sliding down and requiring readjustment. Secondly the arms on these glasses are a somewhat brittle feeling hard and slick plastic. Because of this they dont hold onto my head very well and slide off easily. It would be nice if they had rubberized arms to help them hold onto your head better. These glasses feel like they are worth $7 and I expect these to break before summer has ended.."
3.0,Ok... It was a little shorter than I had hoped
3.0,"This device was great, until the magnets came out of the plastic case. Should be a quick fix with a super glue."
3.0,"I loved this bathing suit UNTIL I washed it, the blue bleeds into the white causing it to look dirty. I was super disappointed because it fits so well and is perfect for water sports. Great coverage but can only wear once after washing."
3.0,"I love the color and it seems very durable, but I hate the way it clasps, it really awkward to put on."
3.0,"Order was not complete, some earrings were missing.  Not worth the hassle of returning.  But over all cute."
3.0,[[ASIN:B01AIOBS62 Eason Eyewear Men's Designer Tear Drop Aviator Sunglasses 64 mm Brown/G15]] As for the design and quality I will have to give these a 2 thumbs up. They are very lightweight but yet are still sturdy and a great quality. The tint on these sunglasses is excellent for glare reduction and blocking the brightness of the sun. The main drawback I have is that the frame is slightly bigger than a normal pair of sunglasses which makes them look too big for my face. It is nice that they come in a silky cloth pouch to keep them in for protection and the included mini cleaning cloth is nice to keep them free of dust and light smudges. This product was purchased at a discount rate for the purpose of a true and honest review. I in no way received any type of monetary compensation for my true and unbiased review.
3.0,"The pant did not fit skinny, they had a fit of slim.  If you are looking for a pant to fit tight at the ankle as shown in the picture, these are not it."
3.0,"The material is soft, silky and stretchy which makes wearing these leggings a nice experience. I don't think we should rely on pants to flatten our tummies. In my opinion,, diet and exercise is the only way to go.  I knew they would be very tight so I order a larger size even though I am a medium. The tightness on the waist is extreme, unhealthy and unnecessary."
3.0,I gave it away after wearing it once.
3.0,It’s actually really nice but it’s already broken .. does not lock anymore
3.0,"Cheap yarn used for this - rough.  Ordered an XL and could<br />fit about 3 small children in it, besides myself!"
3.0,Material is bad not much stretch and I got a 2x based off measurements and still didn't fit
3.0,"The print is not as nice as the photo, it looks kind of cheap. The fit is good except shorter than I wanted. I am tall so it would probably work well on an average height person. Too short to wear alone and too long to wear with leggings. Returned."
3.0,Wife thought that the face could have been easier to see even considering the relatively small size of the ear rings.
3.0,Did not fit as in the picture and the color was not the same as in picture. The yellow in picture was rich and more golden than yellow.  The item sent was pale yellow and too light to be flattering.  I squeezed into it.  Not worth price.
3.0,Beautiful dress unfortunately the white is completely see through so I had to return it
3.0,I ordered this bag in rose gold to match my accessories but I received gold when it arrived. It’s still cute but not enough time to return for the rose gold since my event is on this Saturday.
3.0,Very short and thin
3.0,They look elongated
3.0,The flower was definitely more yellow than the picture shows.  I was expecting something closer to the picture so I was disappointed.
3.0,I normally wear a medium and that's what I ordered. It was too big. I would say order smaller size. Material is thick but I just didn't like how the dress looked on me.
3.0,"Arrived damaged. Open by hand without sharp object.  Outer packaging intact so came from the manufacturer in this condition.  Beauitful print, lightweight non-clinging material."
3.0,"Great quality, not likely to easily snap. Comfortable on my wrist and really like them!!<br /><br />Buddha snapped right off the necklace"
3.0,"I've been buying Harringtons like mad lately trying to find the perfect one, and this one unfortunately wasnt it either. The cut one could call 'traditional' (very very baggy and amorphously shaped), the mandarin style collar was abnormally large, the sleeves aren't  raglan, and mostly, the sleeves were WAY too short. I have fairly long arms for my frame so I'm used to making concessions when it comes to arm fit, but these seem sized for someone with short arms in relation to their frame. I can say 2 very positive things about this one however; The shoulders fit (I have abnormally broad shoulders, back, and chest, its a herculean task to find a jacket that fits that area of my body well), and for $35, the quality was pretty surprising. The zipper, the lining, the outer shell, like the jacket is made well. I couldn't find a 'Made In' label anywhere on it, but for the price that shouldn't be a concern. If you like a fuller fit jacket and wouldn't be a betting favorite in a boxing match due to superior reach, this may be the jacket for you."
3.0,Nice sweater and color. Only thing is that it's lighter than expected. I have the same sweaters in different colors and they are heavier compared to this one.
3.0,Very Pretty but too large for my 5'0 small frame
3.0,Skirt had noticeable lines from being folded that did not come out and definitely cheap material but served its purpose as an outfit for family pictures.
3.0,"I've purchased this brand for years (10 plus).  However, the ones I received were twice as thin as the ones in the past.  Not sure if it was just these in particular from Amazon, so I bought the same brand but from different sources.  Sadly, all were the same.  I will not buy these again."
3.0,Nice. Will still prefer the all stone once.
3.0,"Glitter will definitely be all over the place, about 1/2 size too big so we have to wait for her to be able to wear them."
3.0,"What attracted me to this ring when I purchased it was the beautiful mix of colors vibrantly in the resin or acrylic pour. I loved that it had bright pinks and purples mixed in with the shades of aqua and teal. What I received is a comfortable ring just as described, but not nearly as vibrant and without all of the colors in the photo. The rain is more of a murky swampy bluish green swirl with flecks of whit and hints of orange and purple (depending on how you hold it in the light. Overall, it is a cute rain and I would not sway people against purchasing it. But I would say purchase with caution knowing that the ring in the picture is much more visually appealing than the ring that you will receive."
3.0,It's a nice dress a little tight on the arms.
3.0,I’m 5’4 and these were not a good look AT ALL. Bought them for working out and ended up not wearing them at all
3.0,I loved the colors but it was shorter on the body than appears in the photo
3.0,"These are a great value-BUT, without the nose wire it is next to impossible to keep  them on your kids face. They are definitely cute and well made, but not at all secure on their face."
3.0,The scarfs were just ok.  They are very thin so you will be able to see your hair underneath and lots of bumps if you have braids .
3.0,Beautiful but the center stone fell off before I could put it on
3.0,I bought this product and loved the sunglasses. Only 2 weeks later my son sat on them and broke them. So I went to my previous order and ordered me another pair. What came in was NOT the same glassed. They weren't even close and very big! The ones on the top are the original purchase that broke. The bottom pair is my reorder from the exact same place as the first order. They will be going back even if they want to charge me $4 to return them.
3.0,"The tshirt material is kind of scratchy, not soft. The shirt was also a fitted shirt not a regular tshirt. The fit was too large for me."
3.0,They were nice while I had them.  Put them on went out and I returned home they were no longer in my ears.  Don't let anything touch them or they are gone.
3.0,I bought the green leggings and was completely obsessed so I bought this grey camo pair - unfortunately they started pilling after my first time wearing them - 20 minutes of use at the gym. I gave 3 stars because one pair I love and one pair isn’t great. They are soft and comfortable leggings but I wouldn’t use for any vigorous exercise. Maybe just yoga and lounging. So bummed about this pair being damaged as I would’ve likely ordered many more as they were restocked.
3.0,Cord stretching song doesn’t return to regular shape I’ll have to replace
3.0,"I have another pair, the same size, the same brand, but these are slightly smaller.<br />If they fit, they would have been fine.  Size small b"
3.0,"I like the style of the shirt but the color bled during washing and my other garments were affected. I haven’t had that happen in a very long time. It fit well, was delivered on time and is comfortable."
3.0,"If you are looking for real waterproof, this is not for you.  There are other comments complaining about this detail and others saying it is waterproof.  For those campers out there you will be familiar with tent material and how it keeps water off of you inside the tent as long as you don't touch the inside of the material...this is like that.  In the long run if you are in a downpour, it will keep you mostly dry, but not completely.  On the positive side, if you only need really good water resistance (drops do bead and run off visually) and want a good looking coat that is super lightweight, then this is a good choice.  I was amazed how light it is and how stylish it looks on.  So it depends on what you are looking for.  I was looking for waterproof to replace a previous jacket that served me well for years and needed to be retired.  However, I might keep this just because it is such a nice coat, super packable for trips, and looks great."
3.0,"It was cute for the first wear, then it shrank. If only I had known....."
3.0,I like the fit of this tank but it is too see-through for me to be comfortable wearing it during my Yoga class.
3.0,Like the fit and colors are good but definitely collect lint very easily.
3.0,Cute jeans but smell TERRIBLE! I have washed them twice and can't get the smell out. The holes hit about the knees so they look a little awkward.
3.0,Fits very tight I'm a large n got 3X and it's tight.
3.0,It looks like a warm winter jacket when it is a lightweight one better for the fall or spring
3.0,This was a shade smaller than expected. Be aware of that when ordering.
3.0,These socks fit as expected.<br />They are warm but don’t seem to be warmer than any of the slipper socks I own.<br />These just don’t have grippers on the bottom.<br />The inside fabric is very soft and cozy but it does make my feet slip inside the sock when wearing the socks without shoes.<br />These socks feel like a cozy blanket for your feet.<br />Nice warm socks but my feet get hot in them like I was expecting.  The product images show flames coming off of the socks. These get as hot as you do under a fuzzy blanket.<br />Make sure you wear shoes larger than normal with these socks as they are thick!<br />I ordered these socks in black and grey and they appear to be a periwinkle blue - not grey.
3.0,I like the mask but elastic for your ears pop very easy from the mask.
3.0,Meh.  They are cottony and hold on to sweat.  That is my bad for not paying close enough attention to the description.
3.0,its loose in some areas but other than that its a fine dress
3.0,"To me, this item fit large. Even if they had a small I think it would be too big as well. There's a lot of extra fabric in the stomach and hip area of this shirt. I'm 5'8, 120lbs. I had to return it sadly."
3.0,"I purchased b/c I needed button up for an upcoming surgery. Fit well, washes well. Wrinkle factor is really bad. That’s the only big drawback. So if your wearing them and you don’t iron them you look unkempt"
3.0,"Foster Grant doesn't need to worry about this knock-off.  It's cheaper, but well packaged.  The flip sunglasses are oversized, so will cover yours.  They sharpen and yellow everything.  How good they are for night vision, I'm not so sure.<br /><br />The flip portion is separately provided as well, so you have a spare.  There is a polyester cleaning cloth and a clear, semi-soft plastic case.  That's why I bought these at Amazon, rather than Walgreens, for the same price (the Walgreens retail version is better quality, but excludes the cloth and the case for the same price).<br /><br />Since I don't drive at night much, it will be awhile before I report on usage.  Usage might cause a re-rate, upward."
3.0,"I owned the first version of the Element half zip and thought it was better than this one.  I wish they made it the same way with the same materials.  My old one had a softer feel on the inside and that makes a big difference for me since I typically wear this over a Tshirt and my arms will be able to feel the half zip.<br /><br />Really that's the only I didn't keep this item.  Everything else is good about it, great fit, good style, high quality zipper, breathable material that helps keep you warm without making you sweat."
3.0,Like but turned color
3.0,I love it but it doesn't look like it does in the picture I m a little disappointed in this
3.0,"Oh my goodness these socks are absolutely the softest yet, but oh my how this chenille sheds, and sheds, and sheds, and sheds - too bad, because I wanted to buy them in every color I could find..."
3.0,"very cheap looking don't buy it, picture doe not look anything like it"
3.0,Didn’t like the fact that the band was thin for my Apple Watch.
3.0,Very tight at bottom of sweatshirt and shoulders prominent
3.0,The leather is stiff and not supple as The picture seemed to indicate
3.0,"Like the jacket... just it runs small even in extra large.  Didn't fit across the chest ( I'm 38).  The material was fine, and just what I wanted a simple light weighted jacket.  Just wished it fit.<br />Passing it on down to another family member, for I hate the hassle of returning. especially online stuff."
3.0,"Ad should state that this cap fits a STD 6"" sch40 & 80 pipe (maybe some others- cast iron,soil:  Polyethylene, IPS ??)  ID is 6 5/8"" not 6""...without defining the pipe type/schedule one could only assume the ID is, as stated,  6"".  It will not fit most types of 6 inch pipes."
3.0,THEY RUN SLIGHTLY SMALL AND SHRINK. BUT THEY ARE CUTE AND SOFT.
3.0,Shoe is a little on the small side.
3.0,"Be careful, you may break it if you don’t handle it gently."
3.0,"While of really interesting look and no doubt good quality, I find these boots not particularly comfortable with one problem that seems persistent for the Bug products - if your toes hit the end of the shoe (or are big), you may feel discomfort as the ends of their shoes tend to be very hard.  Perhaps one may be better off going a bit larger size?  For this product, it matters to put it on first.  On the positive side, the color and the material are really commendable."
3.0,Wish they had an xsmall.  I'm 5&#34;4' 116 lbs small frame and it's huge on me.
3.0,Purchased this for my husband's 44mm Apple Watch Series 4. It does not fit.
3.0,It is so pretty 🤩 I was excited when I got it especially after sleeping with it two nights in a row and it not turning my finger green. But of course after the third night I would up with a green finger. 😞 I did not shower with it!
3.0,Beautiful but.... broke after 3 weeks. Won’t buy again.
3.0,No tienen mucha calidad
3.0,"I followed the size chart and this product is still too small. It does not fit loosely whatsoever even after I sized up one size ""to be safe"" if you have thighs whatsoever, beware. The lace is SO tight I have to basically pull it up and make the shorts like underwear to be comfortable to use.<br /><br />If you're a smaller person, maybe like a true US medium or smaller, you may love this. The quality of the velvet and lace is very nice, the size is just way off. I'm a true L-XL and bought a Xxl and it was still much too small"
3.0,Ear ring breaks
3.0,It's just OK not thrilled but will probably keep it as it will go well with other outfits. Material is thin.
3.0,It works after it was washed kind of not wearable. Its OK but quality was a bit low
3.0,The socks are very tight!
3.0,It will cost an arm and a leg to buy prescription shades. Sun Shield Sunglasses does the job and U don't have to take a second mortgage.
3.0,The show fits tight for wide width.  I will need to wear socks to hopefully stretch out the width.
3.0,"Crappy quality, but decent I guess.. I used it twice then got another wallet from somewhere else, Walmart’s wallets are better."
3.0,The purse itself is a soft leather. I’m kind of disappointed with the material of the handles and strap. They cheapen the look of the purse.
3.0,Gift for my 4 year old son.
3.0,Is nice. Had a couple of nice comments' BUT.....the clasp for this bracelet is not very well disigned. Every time I put my hand  in a pocket it came undone. 2 times it fell off. I had to put glue on it to keep it on.
3.0,"This is a cute style of dress and it fit nicely.  Fabric seems to be of good quality.  However, it is more of a nude color than khaki.  I’m send information this one back and purchasing a different color."
3.0,The color is darker than the picture showed.  Not too crazy about it but I will wear it.
3.0,"It’s not what I was expecting, however the description was not misleading, I just misunderstood.<br />I did not try to return it. It was delivered as promised and I had no problem with delivery. It’s not the most comfortable band I’ve ever had, but it’s making due for now"
3.0,"After coupon codes, I think I paid $3/pair. Unfortunately they looked nothing like the pics.  They are printed images on a flat piece of mdf? plexi?<br />Still not hideous, just not nearly as cute or 3D as the listing. I wouldn’t have been thrilled if I paid listing price without coupon codes, etc."
3.0,"5 seconds out of the bag and one of the eagle pendants fell off :'D I do like the chains themselves, not too heavy and not light either."
3.0,Fast shipping and everything was great except the hat came with a tear in it. Material is super soft and everything fit my 1 year old great!
3.0,"Band is a lot lighter than the actual picture represents, it's more of a nude/faded blush pink color. It feels soft, it was easy enough to change the band and its fits well. Now let's see how well it holds up."
3.0,"Glasses didnt fog for the first 3-4 days, i thought awesome, no fogging up then boom they started to.  So now these glasses are just like all the others i have.  You get what you pay for."
3.0,"I received my tiara last night, and it was so wide it almost looked like a straight line. Material is bendable, but at the cost of rhinestones. I used this for an elven queen costume. I got it on sale and that's the only way the price was justified."
3.0,Need a clasp to keep watch from sliding off the arm.
3.0,"Super cute but runs larger than the sizing chart<br />Ordered an XL - will re order as a L or maybe even M! Other than that decent quality, stretchy material & dope print! Will size down"
3.0,I am 5'8&#34;. I already knew the jumpsuit would be a little short. It comes up past my ankles. I think I may be able to make it work with shoes that come up past my ankles...like a sandal bootie. I will keep the jumpsuit but I don't think I'll be purchasing anymore since it doesn't seem I'll be able to find one that comes in a tall size.
3.0,"Cool socks, suuuuper small. Definitely not ‘mens’ as my 15 yo could barely pull them over his size 9 narrow feet."
3.0,"This hat doesn't look right on me. In order to actually see anything, I have to put the back of the hat pretty far down on the nape of my neck and with the big brim, that basically makes it look like an old-fashioned bonnet. Nope! I can flip up the brim and that's a little better. It looks pretty cute on my little kid and she can wear it because it does have a nice adjustable tie string to make the band tighter, but it looks nothing like the photo. The brim is way bigger."
3.0,The clasp is pretty flimsy and broke on the 1st time I wore it. It was inexpensive but is very cute!  I got my money's worth with all the compliments I received while wearing it! I would order again and keep in mind it's basically a one wear item.
3.0,Be careful ordering these shirts. They seem like a nice enough quality just order at least 3 sizes larger. The sizing is way to small.
3.0,These bands are decent.  They don’t form fit like other bands and are a bit stiff.  They nice for a color change.
3.0,Nice looking. Don’t overfill or won’t snap. Credit card holders are hard to get cards in without squeezing<br />Otherwise good wallet
3.0,This dress is very cute it it is very very short. I got the 4-5yr size and it fits my 2 year old perfectly but it was far too short for my almost 5yo to wear.
3.0,I have very small hands and the triangle portion of the bracelet sits somewhere about 3 inches below from my wrist because the chain is so long. Also triangle is smaller than expected. Looks okay. I like the adjustable ring though. I'll probably take some pliers and remove a few links of the chain so it's not so long.
3.0,These glasses work as advertised they do adjust To each Eye Which is good the only drawback is that the design of the glasses them selves is very flimsy and very cheaply made other than that they work as advertised
3.0,not in love with the material
3.0,"Bought the green dress last minute to wear to a wedding. The material is a little odd - a bit like an old T-shirt: very comfortable and soft but color is off/faded. It doesn’t look new. No pulling, just faded. This is why I gave it only 3 stars. Gorgeous fit tho."
3.0,Dress is snug in the bust area. Fit is flowy and cute but then tight in the bust and therefore doesn't lay right. It then makes the straps lay funny. I am a size 12 and a 38 D I ordered a Large.
3.0,"The lens isn’t as smooth as shown in the product photo, you can see it’s a bit pinched at the edge.<br />The tips of the frame legs are very sharp, and scratches my scalp every time I put the pair on."
3.0,close cut
3.0,"Runs a bit big, size down, not very flattering."
3.0,I ordered a Medium thinking small was going to be too short and length wise it fits perfect but its a bit on the loose side too. Looks really nice as long as you wear with nude underware since the fabric is very light. Over all i like it and feel very comfortable with it
3.0,very pretty but it already ripped after wearing it once and came with a weird smell:(
3.0,Both hoop earrings each came unglued right off the bat. I should have done an inbox video. The only good pair of earrings is the weird shaped ones which I paired to a halloween dress and yeah I needed them otherwise I wouldn't have bought.
3.0,"I tired to tie-dye this shirt, I bought it thinking it was 100 percent cotton, or made or cotton at all, its not. all the colors washed out to the point where i could barley see it."
3.0,"This really is a beautiful piece of jewelry, a real  one of a kind, signature piece. It looks like the picture and it is a very substantial size.  However, the clasp is flimsy. I will take it to a jeweler to be fitted with a better clasp and then it should be fine."
3.0,"The fabric is a nice mid-weight jersey/cotton blend feel. However, the dress is very, very short. I am usually a small or medium, but I ordered an XL to make sure this dress would be long enough, but it was still barely past my butt."
3.0,super cute dress but the small was too big! (I'm normally a size 4) oh well..
3.0,"I was disappointed that it looked like an old comforter or quilt in person.  I should have paid more attention to the description and also to the strap length.  I like to be able to put the bag over my shoulder, and this bag is kind of hard to wear.  It's a 3 out of 5 star because it is roomy inside, had nice storage, and from a distance you can't tell it looks like a blanket."
3.0,"Bought this for the Huawei Watch 2 Sport edition. I'm returning it because it didn't fit. Not the designer's fault, so I'm not docking any points off for that. Just know if you're looking for a band for the Sport edition, 22mm bands will not fit. Overall though the watch band looks nice with vibrant colors and is a nice material"
3.0,Doesn't fit like measurements said and doesn't look like picture.
3.0,I HAVE CURVES AND THIS DRESS DOES NOT WORK WITH THEM. 5'1 132LB. NICE BUTT AND 36DD.
3.0,"The material isn’t all that great, but for the price I won’t complain lol"
3.0,The band seems cheaply made which makes it hard not very soft and due to that it doesn't sit on your arm exactly right. The face because the arms and face are similar in color it is hard to see the time in different lights... But for the money it's a decent watch for a kick around weekend wear.
3.0,A little on the thin side. Best save for summer.
3.0,Not really impressed with quality but could be worse.  You get what you pay for.
3.0,Lovely my girl friend really loved it
3.0,I was a little disappointed in this band. It seems a little dull and stiff.
3.0,Glasses are cute but bigger then I expected. They also feel a little cheap like they could break at any second
3.0,Beautiful great size good quality faded after 4 months and it also broke.
3.0,The springy things were off on some of them but they work
3.0,I use this dress for a cocktail and got plenty of compliments.
3.0,I was very excited to receive this. The screening was uneven but not enough to raise a stink over. Last night I spilled soda on it and put it in the laundry. More of the words washed right off. So disappointed. 😕
3.0,I used these a couple of times and then threw them away. It was a wear stick. They rippled. It’s was bad.
3.0,Loved this shirt until it was washed once. It’s now a belly shirt and not something that I would wear. Even in a larger size I don’t think it would address the shrinkage problem in length.
3.0,Decided to keep it
3.0,Doesn't look like picture so had to return it..wanted for a dance..
3.0,color ok  price is right
3.0,These worked temporarily. The boot tore through the plastic and they didn’t stay up. They rolled down until it was taking itself off
3.0,"The product is well made and attractive. My only bone of contention is that the description explicitly states there is a steel underchain for tight fit on any pair of biker or western boots. This is not true. In fact, in the photo, there is no steel underchain shown. The underchain would go under the boot and in front of the heel. Apart from that misrepresentation, the overall feedback is 4 stars for a good product and prompt delivery. Last bu not least, one of the links broke, and so I have to open another and re-attache, or just tuck it onto the bootstrap until I'm done riding...my new rating on the quality dropped the overall rating by one star."
3.0,Was good jacket. But had to return it because the front zipper was not working.
3.0,Thankfully went with large and not extra large is huge. Very soft material but definitely need a belt or take in. Wife wears about a size 14 and this is very big
3.0,"It's just eh. The quality isn't that great, and the little frays hanging in front of the shirt were all twisted and knotted when it came."
3.0,They looked like a toy
3.0,"The purse is cute and seems well made but it would have been even cuter had it not arrived almost totally flat.  It took a few weeks to get here and by the time it did the box, and purse, were pretty much ruined.  If it can survive the shipping it's worth it."
3.0,"I thought they should come in sizes,  I like them to wear when I’m wearing a tank and need to cover my arms when I’m out. I tuck them in my purse."
3.0,This necklace is very brightly colored.  Wasn't what I expected
3.0,"Difficulty in setting the time, date, etc..."
3.0,This Set of pearls is beautiful. I really wanted to give it 5 stars but the clasp on both pieces is extremely flimsy which means I won't be wearing them much for fear of the clasps breaking.  Such a shame to put such a flimsy clasp on these pearls.
3.0,"Nice dress but definitely better in picture. It was not as flattering as I thought. Bought a medium and fits as medium. Also, I've worn twice and already fading."
3.0,The calf’s were toooo huge<br />Returned
3.0,The dress fit perfectly and was pretty but it looks like a nightgown and was made out of fabric that felt like a nightgown. I sent it back because I would have felt like I was wearing my pajamas to a formal event. It does seem to be well-made and it was pretty.
3.0,Quality was nice and bottoms were so comfy and cute. The top was ENORMOUS though! I'm 5'10 160 pounds and a 35 B. I wish they sold the bottoms separately! I ordered a medium per their chart.
3.0,They fit OK but shrink in the washer so they don't go to the knees after a few washes
3.0,"My first impression of this is how terrible it smells.  I hung it in a closet to let it air out, and now everything else in the closet is also unwearable.  Chinese fire retardant???  My only consolation is that I bought this after Christmas, so maybe if I leave it to air out for 11 months it will be tolerable to wear by December.<br /><br />Other than that, it looks like the jacket in Spirited, and the size is right for me.  Medium, and I'm 5'10"" 170 lbs."
3.0,"Looks cute and fits well, though buyer beware, it is a print t-shirt despite the appearance in the product image."
3.0,A little big but very cute its a lot thinner than it looks in the photo
3.0,"Cute dress for the money, but tassels continually fall off."
3.0,nice cut but fits too small in the waist area; I ordered an XL
3.0,"This was very inexpensive and it is very inexpensively made. I bought for costume for a stage performance. It worked great for that. I was surprised that it is a non-tarnishing silver. For the price, that's good."
3.0,"I was specifically looking for 15mm tapers/plugs, I don't mind getting the 16mm but I chose 15mm when i tried to buy and im not sure what happened but i got 16mm plugs, I cant rate them outside of that bc im not to that size but I'll be keeping them anyway since I'll be stretching to that size anyway. but the sizing is def off."
3.0,Nice set of costume jewelry rings.  The smaller ones I gave to my young grand children.
3.0,"The shirt fits as expected, but the color is nothing like the picture. Its pictured as more of a hunter or olive green, but is actually a bright kelly green. The material is a soft t-shirt material."
3.0,Be sure to check the sizing chart - sizes are not per US standards.
3.0,Not as long as in the pic.
3.0,"I have to wear socks to make sure these stay on my width B foot, which is not why I bought slides.  If you want loose shoes due to sensitive spots on your feet or edema, these would work.  If you have a medium or narrow foot, might have to look elsewhere.<br /><br />These are super comfortable and supportive in the foot bed."
3.0,"I've been using this case for about one week now.  It's okay.  The novelty of it being able to stick to the mirror wore off pretty quickly, especially after I was on Facetime with my daughter.  As one would expect, buildup occurred on the case and wouldn't you know it: the phone fell off the mirror into the sink right after a teeth brushing session.  I was done with the case after that happened.  I'm not a phone dropper, so I cannot attest to the amount of protection this case would provide if the case failed often to stick to a surface.<br /><br />My previous case had the button covers sticking out so it was kind of difficult for me to adjust to the ones on this case as they are recessed.<br /><br />Overall, it's an alright case.  Sleek and clear, decent protection for short falls.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
3.0,Pretty necklace. But I’m worried about the rubber stoppers breaking.  Which would make the necklace useless.
3.0,"Great quality, but not true to size. I bought a XL to fit my husband loosely but it fits like a medium."
3.0,"If the product had fit, it would have good. Instead I had to go shopping. Thank you"
3.0,The watch is very nice for the price. I have very small wrists and the watch is too big for me. I wish it were smaller because I really like it.
3.0,Cute! Smells awful and I was hoping it was a bit bigger. It's pretty small.
3.0,Item was left on the step not handed to me. Other then that good deal.
3.0,"This is a very flattering dress; however it is not true to size. It is a size smaller, I got a Large and it fit like a Medium. The white part also gets dark when worn, I'm afraid the black will stain that portion when I wash it... I do recommend this dress, but it will not slim you rather it will focus your trouble areas."
3.0,Order two sizes up. Cute but not true to size.
3.0,Cut small. I have bigger breast for my frame so that is kind of my problem.
3.0,"The touchscreen tips only worked for about two weeks, and then stopped working.  They are warm, though."
3.0,"The part that flaps down does not STAY down. Mine kept rolling up. I wore it to a wedding & it was so embarrassing, people kept offering to fix the shoulder part. Other than that it was comfortable & looked just like the pic. I'm 5'6 about 170 lbs."
3.0,"I really like the concept. The glasses are quite sturdy. They have thick rims and are heavier than anything I've ever had sitting on my nose. The flip-up sunglasses are attached to the frames by two magnets which are probably strong enough to hold them in place if you don't do something silly, like running. I rarely (I did once) read books on a beach in bright sunlight. I did, however, visualize myself driving to the grocery store on a sunny day, being able to look at my car's instrument panel displays, flipping up the sunglasses in the store, and being able to read labels and prices. The problem is, to use the reading area of the glasses, I have to bend my head back at an uncomfortable angle. Perhaps other people might not find that a problem. For me, I think I'll stick with my lightweight, aviator-style, polarized sunglasses and use my usual reading glasses on the tip of my nose while buying groceries. Otherwise. I believe it's a good concept that just needs refinement."
3.0,Its what I expected in some ways and in others ways its not. Nice packaging comes in a clear plastic zipper bag for storing. I think this strapless self adhesive bra would work best when wearing something that already has a built in bra or a halter type shirt or dress that has a high waisted band under your breast area. It is also to small I ordered a D cup and I'm more like a full C cup. I had side breast coming out even though I applied it as far to the sides of my breasts as I could. Seems you could wear it more than once and just reapply the plastic cover that covers the inside sticky part of the bra cups. On the plus side it does push your breast together for a nice cleavage. Just don't wear it with out some sort of other structured top or dress over it.In the picture of the product it appears to me she is also lifting her breast up which is not how it works when worn by itself alone without some other type of support. It does not push up it does however push together your breast.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.
3.0,Had to return this because the material was not what I expected.
3.0,Flaw in one of the lenses
3.0,"I ordered US(14-16) size based on reviews and it fits like a Medium, 36D chest.  Fabric is pretty and soft. It does not fit off the shoulders as pictured but still is a nice sweater."
3.0,"My nephew liked his glasses because sonic was on the case but, he would have liked them even more had the sonic character been on the frames."
3.0,"Fits well and very comfortable, but very cheaply made"
3.0,Very cute baby shoes just a little big.
3.0,Ok I like how it looks on me but it will not stretch when I sit so I feel uncomfortable if I stand i look good its a little tight the material is itchy though not soft
3.0,Very cute too but fit is smaller then expected. Disappointed.<br />It's long and very cute just way too small
3.0,"I am having a hard time rating these. There are some aspects I really like but others I do not and I'd not pay $99 for pants I am on the fence about.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />They are comfortable, overall. I wore them for a 3-mile walk (not a hike) and then to do some work-from-home on my laptop. They didn't pinch or bind or bother me for the hours I wore them. Though, they don't have a lot of stretch so sitting in them for long periods wouldn't be super comfortable.<br />The moss color is a really soft sage green.<br />They do have a little bit of stretch to them.<br />They are very lightweight.<br />There are two slit pockets in the back and one has a zipper to it. You can't fit much but maybe your car key or something small. Two pockets and a tiny pocket in the front. The pockets don't stick out--the pants are very compact and streamlined.<br /><br />The Fit:<br />I am 5'2"" about 116-117 and fit. These Woolly Clothing pants fit me well except at the waist--I have a small waist so I'm used to this but these are $99 pants. There's no belt loops to keep the back from sticking out. However, they didn't slide down my body either--I didn't have to keep pulling them up; they stayed put. The legs felt tight at first but as the day went on they loosened up. They fit me well in my hips and behind--in fact, they are flattering in their fit other than that waist that doesn't fit to my waist. They come below my belly button, slightly. There is a smooth line from waist to bottom of the leg, but I am pretty fit so there's not much of a 'muffin top' situation for me anyway. The length goes below my ankle but they aren't too long.<br /><br />The Not So Good:<br />That waist that doesn't fit to my body (again, I'm used to this, but expected better). I can understand not having belt loops as these pants are very 'streamlined' but still, for $99 I was hoping for a better fit at the waist.<br />Since you are not supposed to dry them in the dryer, they wrinkle - this went away when I put them on because they are so fitted on me. And, as well, when they are wet, they smell like wet wool--not real bad but they still did.<br />The material is thin, which in a way is good as I didn't want thick wool pants, but I can actually almost see through the material if I hold them up to the light.<br />They are a bit scratchy--I did not find them really soft. That scratchy feeling bothered me a lot when I first put them on until later I forgot about it.<br /><br />I would not pay $99 for these. I like them. They fit me well and flatter my body except at the waist. The color is nice. They are great for running errands, walking, maybe some kinds of hikes. But, they have some flaws and I am finding I am not a wool-wearing kind of woman as I found them a little on the scratchy side.<br /><br />Thanks for reading, y'all."
3.0,"found some didnt work and not just one or two a couple but had enough for what IK wanted and it was as described as for some didn't work the light never came on no matter what tried. But enough I figured some wouldn't work just wish more did,but that was a year or two ago so maybe there are better ones now. You at least get the number ordered for a decent price."
3.0,"I originally ordered a Medium sweater according to the size chart. It was very disappointing when I got it because it was super big. I returned it for a Small size, but I was equally disappointed. The sweater was just as big. I had no choice but to keep it since it was for my nephew's birthday. If you buy one get it about two sizes smaller if it's for a kid. Overall the sweater is cute and super soft. That's why I gave it a 3 ⭐⭐⭐'s"
3.0,"I like the shirt for wearing around the house. Also, because of arthritis in my thumbs, the snaps are easier to close than buttons.  I ordered a large because I have a 16 inch neck and 34/35 sleeve length.  This shirt is very tight fitting, slim fit, and the sleeve length is probably size 32/33.  I like the shirt but sure wish it fit better.  I'm afraid if I order an extra large the sleeve/body seam will be too far down on the arm.  I'd recommend reading the size chart carefully and take your best shot at which one to order.<br /><br /> I recommend this shirt if you can find a size that fits."
3.0,The picture is misleading. I thought shirt was navy blue. Its way lighter than picture. I like darker colors better
3.0,Beautiful sweater but much too large
3.0,The material is not silky. It is on a heavier side. Returned it.
3.0,Very light weight. The snap hook is durable and steady.i guess its aluminium. Thought it was actually stainless steel. Turns out otherwise.
3.0,I like it but I sure am glad I ordered a bigger size than I needed.
3.0,Dress wAs little bigger than I expected. I didn’t like the floral pattern as much as I did in the picture & kind of thin material.
3.0,"I like the shirt. It is thick, soft, and warm. But it must be in Asian sizes. I ordered a size large and the tag says 2x. It was a little small so I ordered an XL and arrived with a tag that said 3x! Not great for my self confidence, but I liked the shirt!"
3.0,"The dress is really cute online and when you pull it out of the package...but when you go to put it on it's a little awkward fitting. The material is awesome and the lace at the top was really well done. The sleeves were very tight but the shoulders were really big so it looked like you were wearing shoulder pads. It's also SUPER loose so if you aren't large up top it makes you look flat. I wish it worked out better.<br /><br />For reference, I'm 4'10, 110 lbs and ordered a small."
3.0,Not bad for the price. I use it as a work shirt
3.0,"It is as it appears in the picture. Very detailed and long chain but somewhat heavy. I do not like it being heavy as it sometimes gets stuck between the back of my heel and my shoes, but I think this proves its of good quality. The only draw back is that i do not recommend wearing it on glazed light-shaded leather shoes as the chains brush off a dark blackish-greenish shade upon traction. It is good value for the price and they come in a pair too."
3.0,"Ridiculous shipping cost (more than the product) & there's only four sleeves/slots for photos; however, it fits my tri-fold perfectly."
3.0,"Good leggings, however they are a bit see through."
3.0,"be careful the cufflinks, it is just a plastic piece that barely goes through the cufflink holes, let alone if you wear it it will jsut pop off. It's similar to what dry cleaners use to keep the cuffs in place. other than that. The shirt is good."
3.0,This product is smaller then i thought it would be & I don't like that it came with no chain..
3.0,"The shirt and pants do not match. Each are darling separately, but the top is white, gray and Neon pink. The bottoms are gray, black and dark red. The pants are very long and have a wide leg, yet the waist seems small in comparison and the elastic is very strong. The top is also long in the torso and arms, but cut narrow. They are cute enough and inexpensive enough that I am keeping them. My baby is 7 months, 27 inches and 18 pounds I ordered the 6-12mo. size."
3.0,"Seem very nice.<br />Very tight, made more for a narrow head, not a melon like mine...lol"
3.0,Fabric is kind of silky polyester and screen printed. It fits well and is a decent weight material.
3.0,"May 2nd, 2017 - I had to modify this review, as it appeared as a 5 star review and I only gave it a 4 star rating.<br />.<br />.I ordered and received this Ayliss® Men's Soft Nylon Canvas Belt Double D-Rings Zinc Alloy Buckle Waistbelt to use with shorts in the summer.  My old webbelt is failing and is a permanent L shaped at the point where the buckle is always fastened to the webbing.  I like this belt well enough."
3.0,"The overall quality of this skort is very good. However, I wear a size 8 or a M, and this M would not even get close to meeting at my side to zip it up. If you like the look, be sure and order a size up."
3.0,Does not stay even when wearing. Triangle moves a lot
3.0,"These work fine as casual slippers. But since retiring I use them around the house most of the day and found that the inner soles get damp from the moisture my feet give off. And they don't always dry out overnight. If you only wear them in the AM and then again for an hour or so before bed, they will probably be fine."
3.0,This set is super cute! I LOVE the color & material buttttt the pants are super long. I’m 5’3 & the pants drag way to much. The size does run small. I ordered a xl & it fits like a large. At the end of the night I noticed this huge hole in the pants pocket. No sure if it came like that or it happened when I wore the pants. Overall I do recommend the outfit but I would say get a bigger size unless you want a snug fit & you will most likely need to get the pants tailored if you’re my height or shorter.
3.0,smaller than the average medium shirts I have
3.0,"It's cute, I just think I'm too short for it. But I rocked it once with heels"
3.0,Runs really big on top and I'm larger busted!
3.0,"""I like STRAWBERRY"""
3.0,My child likes it
3.0,"Beautiful shirts. The material is thick and comfortable. However, I will be returning the shirts I got. After looking at other reviews i went with a size small. Depending on the brand I'm usually an XS/S and on the rare occasion a medium. For reference I'm 5'5"", 127lb, 26 in waist, and 34DDD chest. The small was swimming on me. It fit more like a men's small, with tailoring for a women's fit. As cute as the shirts are, I wont wear them and I won't repurchase in a smaller size, as I'm worried about the fit now."
3.0,"It is small and compact..  simple and  99% cheap plastic, But, It WORKs.  It cooled off a smaller sized room  from 96 to 72f in about 2 hours. We will  see if it stays together."
3.0,"I did like that it was long.<br />The only thing is that it was a bit too long. And I’m short, I am 5’3. It fit well. It was a little too loose; didn’t really form my body. But it will be fine for a fast outfit.. wish it was a little bit thicker material. It’s kinda a little too thin. And may be able to see underwear through it."
3.0,"THIN!!! The product arrived after 3 days and looks just as pictured. My only complaint is that it’s thin like a long sleeved shirt. No it’s not a thin T-shirt, it’s a good weight T-shirt. But it’s advertised as a sweater... It is NOT a sweater. I wouldn’t pay 30$ for this T-shirt in person, so I may send it back<br />Update: I decided to keep it. After washing it the first time, it shrunk in the dryer. I’m mad I didn’t return it"
3.0,These are cute but very narrow and toe is very pointy. Not a fan. Loved the UA baseball shoes though.
3.0,no charge and they run too small
3.0,It’s cheap come on. Don’t size your for the oversized look it’s already oversized.
3.0,"Nice-looking, but it does not mold easily to a human face."
3.0,"I returned it because the material was really thin -- almost see through. Plus, the &#34;torso&#34; was a bit too short, so I had a lot of ride up in the front. Gave me a front wedgie!"
3.0,"The overall quality is alright, but the length of the shirt is too short."
3.0,"Good magnet, thought I was getting two. False advertising with the pic of 2."
3.0,Looks quite nice but is a little small and the plastic is quite flimsy having bent out of shape fairly quickly.
3.0,The color was not as vibrant as the photo but it still looks good.
3.0,Just hard to get used to the stiffness
3.0,Not what I was hoping it would be but still love it cause its the boys!
3.0,No son tan gruesas son finas no la esperaba así
3.0,If you're ordering this get one size bigger.
3.0,"Overall this is a nice tie for the price. The texture adds perspective quality but unfortunately, it is NOT bay pink! In the photo, I put my nail polish cap against the tie. The cap is a true baby pink. The tie is more like a bubble gum pink."
3.0,Not for me as did not fit correctly and too long but seemed like nice slacks.
3.0,Love the wallet but to bulky with very little in it
3.0,These a cute but not elegant.ideal 4 college girls but not 4 ladies.
3.0,I ended up wearing it as a night gown instead of a shirt but it is comfortable
3.0,"If it had fit I totally would be keeping it.  It is cute 50s style dress but it is also a 50s sizing chart because there is no way that this in an xl in today standards.  You can't go off the amazon chart on this.  I am having to return it as there is no larger size available.  I would say maybe the xl would fit a ladies size 10, maybe.  I received this as a promotional test product at a discounted price to test out and review.  This is my limited and unbiased opinion."
3.0,A bit thin and flimsy and the zippers don't hold up.
3.0,I was sent the wrong dress and I returned it without issue. The one that was sent was pretty big for a medium. I pretty much just want this off my &#34;to review&#34; list.
3.0,Cute shoes. Way too small.  Couldn't even use.
3.0,"This is beautiful, but again doesn't fit over the clasp on the bracelet I have."
3.0,Runs small. Had to return.
3.0,"The size was way off! Do not get your normal size. Get one band bigger and a cup bigger. Amazon refunded my money quickly so, that was great."
3.0,It is basically fine. It does feel a little flimsy but it mostly held up over an international flight and several bus trips. The arm to pull it often got jammed and I would have to jiggle it a bit to get it back down but I absolutely loved having the backpack option so that was a small trade-off. The size may seem small but it still lasted me on a week's trip - just don't plan to bring a hair dryer or large coats.
3.0,"I have to agree with many of the other reviews, color was way off. I was expecting olive green and got a bright green. Super soft though."
3.0,Way too long for me.  I am returning it.
3.0,"It wasn't as nice as it looked in the picture, but it was a gift for a friend and she liked it, so I guess that's what counts"
3.0,The  earrings arrived with TWO broken stones and are not immediately wearable since I must now go and buy glue to affix the stones.  I do not recommend this product.
3.0,"This one  is just too thick for me to wear in hot summer. It's just not what I expected for. Since it takes so long time to arrive, I was gonna wear it for hot weather but.."
3.0,Had them for a couple months now and they are starting lose color and fray about a half inch up from the connecting clasps.
3.0,Arms are very small. Cute shirt though.
3.0,Great socks!...<br /><br />Update: after a few washes these socks do not hold up well.  Will not buy again.
3.0,"Awesome and adorable purse, though the strap snapped within a few weeks.... I do throw a lot of things in my purse though."
3.0,The color did not work for me just too orange red for me! They were returned!
3.0,"The shirt is of a medium/thin thickness.  I bought a size medium and I usually wear an 8/10 med. and I have a 38 chest.  This pattern was very pretty but the tunic was way too small.  It squished the chest, arms and the stomach area and I do not have much there.  I will order two sizes up next time to ensure comfort and no shrinkage.  It did come down to the top of my thighs and I liked the 3/4th sleeves.  Maybe when it comes back in stock.  It it high priced for the thickness of the material."
3.0,"I bought A and S rings, I really liked them however the sizes on both rings were not what I was expecting at all and the S was way smaller than the A, that made me switch in which fingers I was gonna wear them. Anyway they looked pretty and all but they slipped through my fingers because the size was not what I was expecting and had to wear it in different fingers. They were pretty though if maybe they were the same size I wouldn't have to switch fingers around and wouldn't have lost them."
3.0,"It does look just like the picture, but after only a week it broke off and I tried reattaching it but it still fell apart."
3.0,It fit well and I liked the color.
3.0,"These were very thin. Like the type you buy at the dollar store, exactly. I was thinking they would be a bit more sturdy. They were small too. Wasn't what i was expecting."
3.0,The dress fits small. The slip under it is tank top length. I am 5 foot and would wear with leggings or skinny jeans. Not as a dress
3.0,This top is a little wide across the chest and the arm holes are big.  The material isn't very stretchy and it is pretty thin.  It shows every bump and lump.
3.0,"I returned it as it was too small-at least by one size. I didn't like the front, way too many seams. It also felt a little scratchy."
3.0,I like the look of the outfit but what I didn't like was that the shirt fits more like a bra than a bell shirt/ crop top. The skirt at the plets seem to be a tad see through. For these reasons I gave it a 3
3.0,I bought this for my daughter. She complains that they fall down constantly and the top part of the bear face faded way too soon.
3.0,I returned the dress as it didn't fit properly on the top.
3.0,"Very soft, but very see through.<br /><br />Wrinkles really easily.<br /><br />A cute essential to have in the closet.<br /><br />Comfy"
3.0,"It's exactly as advertised. Material isn't great, but it worked for what I needed"
3.0,"These are very nice looking and well made except that the bar has very sharp edges like a knife edge. I had to micro file the edges so the recipients would not get cut. Also, I ordered four angels and I got three angels and one ""Best Friend"" arrow. I won't return them because other than the sharp edge and one wrong item, the quality is good."
3.0,In the photo the balls look metallic and not see through. In real life they are a cloudy plastic that you can kind of see through which contrasts heavily with the barbell and crystal.
3.0,I bought two sizes in these pants as I wasn’t sure what to expect. Unfortunately had to return both.  The large was too small around the hips and gave the dreaded camel toe but the XL was too big in the legs and looked like sweatpants. Very dissappinted I couldn’t get a good fit because they were soo comfortable when I put them on. Even the large!! Guess I’ll have to lose weight or gain it to be able to buy these again.
3.0,Every time I wore this necklace it would get so twisted and eventually got so tangled it broke
3.0,It broke after 4 months.
3.0,"The dress is beautifully made and super soft. I have a couple things I don’t like about it though: the sleeves we’re not as I was expecting and personally don’t like their look, the dress also can make one appear pregnant from the placement of the elastic gathering/the waist line."
3.0,Rides up
3.0,Way too small if you have larger breasts. Great material and beautiful dress. Just wish it fit.
3.0,Bracelet is smaller than I expected.
3.0,"I bought this two sizes larger than I usually wear. I wanted a long, cozy sweatshirt to wear with leggings. It sits right at my waist. It *just fits me. I do wear it. It’s soft, and made very well, just runs so much smaller than expected."
3.0,"Not bad looking but a little snug for my big head, wish they had size options or were a little more flexible."
3.0,The size was too large and the material was very thin.
3.0,Eh -
3.0,"not good quality , ripped the first use..."
3.0,"This was not advertised as one size fits all, but you should know that the silicone is actually quite firm so larger faces may not wear this comfortably."
3.0,"The dress is really cute, but there is not a lot of stretch and due to the below-the-knee length, it is a bit difficult to walk in. The jersey material makes it very casual and I do otherwise like it, but I may be returning it because I can only take baby steps while walking lol"
3.0,I like the bracelet but was very upset when I got the package and open it because there was only one bracelet in the package. Two weeks later I got the remaining two.
3.0,I love Hummingbirds but this is super hot and thick. It is like a kids wool blanket. This won't be worn in any season but winter . Beautiful colors not what I wanted or thought it would be.<br />So beware!!!
3.0,I bought a 2 pack for a trip but hardly used them because quality was lacking. Material is cheap and does not fit face shapes as there is light that sneaks in around nose. Travel case/bag is convenient but also cheap. This product has a lot of potential but isn't 100% in satisfaction for me.
3.0,"I will still wear the shirt, but the buttoning is off leaving a gap between so i must pin it (and i have a small chest, so it's not those). Also the collar on this one is much smaller than the orange one I got a month earlier so i have to wear the collar up. Just an FYI"
3.0,"Was looking for a replacement for camis I typically purchase at a local store.  These are OK, but I don't like the length or how sheer they are.  Fits true to size.  Long fit."
3.0,I didn’t like the fitting
3.0,I got these for my son and they fit my daughter who is two years older. They run big other than that super adorable. Just wish they had smaller sizes for my son now.
3.0,I had to send this item back but just because they were too large for my face.  They seem to be quality masks that are thick enough to protect you from covid.
3.0,"I gave this 3 stars because it isn’t the same as the picture in the listing..... it’s shows a raw edge on the bottom hem, which isn’t the case, it has a hemmed edge! Colors were also a bit off from the picture. I kept the shirt, it was comfortable and I bought it on a deal for $7"
3.0,"I bought two.  They were different sizes for some reason, the arms were shorter than the other."
3.0,"The socks are over the knee, not thigh high and each pair was worn by 3 different women ranging in height from 5'3-5'10"
3.0,Cheap material ripped at the bottom
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:2da0f8f4467453e02defeff48d745c2b]] We ordered this Miami Cuban necklace for my wife, but we were a bit disappointed that the circumference of the chains is not as long as expected. She says she does like the quality of the Silver, the design of the chains and the links but it didn’t fit her as the chains were too short for her neck circumference and we decided to give the necklace to our little daughter. I would recommend checking closely for the actual circumference or length of the chains to make sure that the necklace is long enough to go around your neck and fit comfortably. Otherwise, the necklace is elegant, stylish and well crafted."
3.0,They are great except for all the heat is centered around the middle and back of the foot. Nothing on the toes and that’s where I need the heat most.
3.0,"My son is 11, this mask is supposed to be for big boys (there’s even a man in the promo pics) and it’s way too small. It pulls his ears down and it isn’t very comfortable.<br />It’s a shame because the masks seem well-made and good quality. The different colored camo prints are nice also. These are a nice trio of face masks for a younger child."
3.0,Nice but pajama qualities not happy
3.0,I like it all though its not the best material or quality
3.0,"Love it has all the supernatural symbols I need,looks good,not cheap.Not too heavy to have all the metal on it."
3.0,"Kind of disappointed with this ring. It seems like such a cool idea but the ring I received doesn't look at all like the photo. The chain part sticks way up from the silver part, it's not flush like in the photo. So it looks a little silly. That was kind of weird but the real problem is I can barely get the chain to spin at all. I've been working on it, trying to loosen it up and nothing works. I put some white lithium spray on the links to try to reduce friction and it helped a little but still it barely spins.  You can still feel a lot of grit and friction and really it's just not made very well.<br /><br />Aside from that, it's a nice silver ring and some people might like how the chain part sticks up but I don't love it. I've attached some pictures to show you how much it differs from the product photos. I also wanted to address something. Another reviewer said the black part was plastic and it most certainly is metal on the ring I received. The quality of the materials is good, no complaints there, I just don't like how it looks different than the picture and especially that it doesn't spin very well. I have been spinning it as much as I can every day to try and loosen it up and I'm hoping that problem solves itself but no amount of spinning will make it look like the product photo.<br /><br />Finally, and this is the big one and why I should probably rate this way lower - the ring is the wrong size. A size 11 ring should have an inside diameter of 20.7mm and this one is 21.6 which is a size 12 in the US. I normally wear a size 10.5 which is 0.3mm smaller and I can make an 11 work if needed. Not this one. It's a full 1.5 sizes larger than the ring I normally wear and that really isn't acceptable. My suggestion here is that you order at least a size down, maybe two. But who knows what you will get? Quality control doesn't seem to be great at the old MMTTAO ring factory these days. There are no markings on the ring or packaging to indicate size so to be fair, maybe they sent me a size 12 by mistake.<br /><br />Maybe I'll order a size 10 of this ring style and see how that one looks and fits just for fun because I really want to like this ring and I love the one in the product photos. However, sometimes expectations do not equal reality."
3.0,They are ok the moment you start sweating and your body start excreting any form of grease and sweat these WILL PEEL OFF. I wore these to a formal event that required dancing and they didn’t last 20 minutes in I had to go without any coverage for the following 3 hours
3.0,Likes it but after washing the trim kept turning ouy
3.0,"I am 6' 4"" so it's not easy. But this item was way too boxy.  Like it was made for every possible shape and as a result not made for ANY shape.  My advice is to try these on in store.  The actual quality of the item is good - just a fit challenge."
3.0,"The non-skid socks are of nice quality. However, the size is not correct. Our grandchild wears a toddler shoe size 5.5 and while the socks are described as 24 months or up to shoe size 6.5 - they are too small. That's unfortunate, because I think they would be great on our tile and wood floors."
3.0,Really cute but probably need to size up
3.0,"I ordered 5 of TheMogan t-shirts for my wife. She loves the fit, the weight but especially the length for work in the healthcare industry. There were 3 v-necks and 2 scoop necks [[ASIN:B00JMQ688Q TheMogan Women's Active Basic V-Neck Short Sleeve Tee Shirt Burgundy M]]. All 5 were medium but as you can see in the photo, no two were the same. Grey was the smallest and pink was the largest. There's probably a difference of 2 full sizes across the shirts despite ordering 5 medium and all of them being labelled as medium."
3.0,"More like a bralette if you have a larger chest. I'm a 34-36D and the medium was way more flattering to my waist than the large but the length really isn't much more than past my sternum in the front. The fabric is definitely thin but again, for a workout top, that's not exactly bad."
3.0,"bigger than i had anticipated, its the size of a normal wallet , not as small as a front pocket wallet"
3.0,These shoes do NOT light up as the description says.
3.0,"The fabric is soft and the skirt feels really comfy, but it runs long (so good for you tall people) and its very bell shaped, so there is a lot of extra fabric.  The fabric and color are really nice, but its a little too long and billowy for me.  I think this skirt would go well on taller women."
3.0,Too thin and the keep rolling down . So irritating
3.0,Cute dress slightly poor quality but I fixed the small issies we had and it loocked adorable for our flower girl
3.0,"These are cute and pretty comfy, however I was not pleased with the way they look on me. They're really tight so the material is really stretched thin. I ended up giving them away because they aren't flattering on me."
3.0,Like the product but the fabric used as a liner behind the card pockets on side shown has already torn if they made these pockets the same size and would have sewn them directly to the leather or lined with leather my review would have been 5 star.
3.0,These are very heavy.
3.0,"This is made of neoprene so it has that neoprene smell to it, even after washing. My wife was not able to wear this comfortably and believed it to negatively impact the amount of milk she was able to pump out. She especially did not like the neck strap and felt the fabric was itchy."
3.0,"this shirt is okay.. i ordered a medium after reading reviews and it fits like a small. in the picture the front looks low but really it is near my neckline. kinda disappointed in that. i probably should have ordered a large to make it look like the picture... i am 5'2, 120lbs"
3.0,"Hard to keep on, but a great style might turn it into a bracelet"
3.0,"The gold matches perfectly and this looks nice but the feel is just okay. The leather looks nice but feels cheap. I'm worried it may start to show wear after continuous use. However, it was priced well and fall below my expectations."
3.0,Ok so they may have ripped off bOc but what the heck.  For a few bucks it is worth it
3.0,"Great product quality however I was given the wrong colors. I was supposed to get the black and white ones, and I got the white and black with rainbow. So definitely disappointed."
3.0,Weird how it only ties on one shoulder.  Not evident in the pictures.  I will probably cut so that both straps are the same.
3.0,I did not pay attention to description. These are not buckles. They are plastic circles. They are beautiful if you receive one that is painted completely and now black spots
3.0,I love anything with crabs on it and wanted these so bad...I am a july baby so crabs are my thing.... I wear a 11 and these are a little shorter than I like....will be ok with long pants I guess ....
3.0,"The top is cute but way too short, it's more of a crop top. Not worth the price."
3.0,The picture is hiding a seam that makes this itchy shirt look like a maternity gown. I would've liked it better without the seam. And entirely different material.
3.0,"They are ok...I am tall 5'8 and these socks only go about mid calf on me...super uncomfortable I kept wanting to pull them up. I am a nurse and can't work with out compression. These had my legs throwing after my shift. I guess a stronger 15-20 compression works best for me. However they are cute, just not functional for what I need them for."
3.0,"The band does not lock into place...which makes me sad because this is the perfect band for my rose gold apple watch.  I am very sad about not being able to use this band, especially for work or going out with my husband."
3.0,After one wear the socks was damaged. It threw it away. The mittens were ok. The elastic in them stayed consistent. No issues at all with that.
3.0,"Cute joggers, but I don't really see how they're worth even $29.95. I washed them according to the label (cold, delicate wash) and laid them flat to dry...the color has already faded. They are also thinner than I was expecting. Overall, I'm a little disappointed in the quality and would not buy them again."
3.0,I guess I didn't pay attention to the size so it was smaller then I thought. Not really good for practical use. Could pass for cosplay if needed though.
3.0,"really loose case, dirt trapped insie easily, very bulky."
3.0,"If you're tall (I'd say at least 5'8&#34;) with not many curves or muscles, these will be a godsend to you. Being 5'3&#34; and a heavy lifter with the butt and thighs to match...these are absolutely not the ones for me. I think the quality is alright, but you might want to just spend an extra ten bucks on a better pair than go through the hassle of returning/disappointment."
3.0,Fabric has very little stretch- order it larger than you need.
3.0,"If you are buying this for a dress--don't.  It is way too short.  It will work well for a bathing suit coverup or a tunic top with a cami underneath.  I would say the sizing is equivalent to a USA juniors large.  It is very stretchy, so if you don't mind it being tight, it will fit just about anyone, but if you are looking for loose and breezy like the model, if you are a medium or smaller, that might work."
3.0,"I loved the color and material of this dress. Unfortunately, it was way too short for me. Other than the length, the fit was good."
3.0,The material is thin compared to most workout yoga pants like these.
3.0,Cute. Only adhered to phone case for a couple of weeks.
3.0,The fabric is not that good. It definitely look cheap however my daughter love it 🤷🏻‍♀️
3.0,"I thought it would be more looser like the image but it isn't. Other than that, it's a really nice, and fits comfortably."
3.0,Super comfy. Super cute buttttt you can see skin all over when you bend over or squat so I'll be returning.  Defeats the purpose for hiking and workout leggins
3.0,My package was missing the shorts ..... It only came with one piece of the two piece set :(((((
3.0,Mask is very well made. The ink print is extremely bright orange. The color makes the photo look different than the advertisement picture
3.0,Cute - but NOT a one size fits all.<br />My shoe size is between 7 1/2 and 8; these socks kept slipping off the heal because they’re too small. I ended up giving them to my mom who wears a shoe size between 5 1/2 and 6. So far they fit her fine.
3.0,My Main issue with it is that it already broke off and its only been a couple of months of having it on my keys.
3.0,Looks elegant.But had some rust on the handle. Otherwise it is nice.
3.0,"I bought this expecting a dress, but essentially got a long tunic. I am 5'11&#34; and there is no way I could wear this in public sans pants or leggings without causing a scandal. The uneven hem comes way up at the sides, which reveals more on my body type than is socially acceptable. It is cute, just not what I wanted."
3.0,"So sad, because this is a beautiful skirt with POCKETS!!! Absolutely adore the color and the quality/ It fits great!! The only issue was I wore it one time and the zipper got caught somehow and just would never zip up... I even tried to fix it with pliers. Doesn’t work. I will probably purchase another one soon. Maybe I just had a bad zipper?"
3.0,Skirt is long..fabric is thin
3.0,"While the material was not expected, it is thick and comfortable. They are not very flattering, I won’t wear them out, but they are comfortable for hanging around the house."
3.0,… too short.
3.0,"I ordered a size too big but, it was still tied. But I love it, it looks good on."
3.0,The shirt is cute but it does run small and the material isn’t the best.
3.0,I got this because it was very beautiful. I received it nicely packed and all. I put my keys and all the baby's hat came off immediately and I try putting it together but the hat started coming apart.
3.0,"These Sandler fit a little large and the soles are fairly firm. I like the soles to have a little give or squchieness. Overall not bad, I plan to use them as my house flip flops. The company does however donate some proceeds to charity according to an insert included with the order which I like."
3.0,They're really cute but they don't quite cover my booty ... but then there's a lot of it. Cute it you don't mind low rise pants
3.0,Much tighter than expected.
3.0,Size up on this one if you want to be comfortable. I wish the color would have been a little brighter. The fabric is very nice. It washes and dries very well.
3.0,"I really like the style of the dress, however is a small hole in the back from where the tags were.  I will have to sew it up.  Other than that, I really like it!  Also I ordered 2XX and its a little lose around the armpit area."
3.0,"I love the fit and design of this top. The weight of the material is exactly what I was looking for. I ordered the Coffee colored one. It was a bit different then what I expected, but still liked it. A few weeks later I ordered the Light Pink. In the photo it looked more like a Dusty Rose which would have been acceptable. When it arrived it was more like a Salmon color. I wanted to order the Black one. Being the first two colors were off according to the description and picture, not sure about ordering again."
3.0,"Nice hat, not aligned very well when assembled. Ordered one and the bill was not at all aligned with the body of the hat. Got a replacement and the replacement was not as bad as the first hat but still not aligned."
3.0,you can not set  the left sat of the watch
3.0,I got what I paid for.  It looks nicer in the picture and I felt like I was getting a good deal but its ok.  I will still wear it.
3.0,"Be careful with this order. Super-fine print says the shirt is white when it was ordered from pictures to be cream/ivory. Secondly, the grid pattern does not line up on the shirt like it does in the picture. It is off by 1/2 box. Shirt received will not appear as displayed. Product is less than stellar."
3.0,"I would say size up.  I normally wear a medium.  This hung open on the outside of my chest.  If I pulled it closed, the pockets bunched out on the sides.  I didn't like that at all. Also came with a hole in the seam."
3.0,Looked a little awkward on me....
3.0,"I have two of these dresses.  The fit and quality is fine. At 5'2&#34; and 125ish lbs, I ordered a size S.  It hit just above the knees.  I like pairing these with tights, tall boots, and a scarf for work (teacher.)  However, the color was way off.  It was not a &#34;wine red&#34; or even maroon, but a true red (not fire engine bright red, but red nonetheless.)  I noticed the same color differentiation as with the other color I bought."
3.0,"I should have ordered a Medium, but I do like it, is feels more like a nightie. I am not sure if I would wear it outside."
3.0,"I gave this bra 3 stars its not has expected. The top of the bra is too wide thus it does not hold your breast properly  especially if your a dd. I wear 38DD, it fits around  fine it does not slip down but it doesn't look good under your clothing. If the cups were deeper it would be perfect and the tops not so wide"
3.0,"Love the way these look, I always get compliments on them and they look great. However, they sit too low on my waist and fall throughout the day, I am always pulling them back up but they aren't too big, they are too small I think? They gap between my thighs when they fall and overall are uncomfortable. I wish they were high waisted as that would solve the problem I think."
3.0,Very nice but way too small
3.0,"Nice material, but buy a size smaller than you think you need"
3.0,Comfortable but thin material.
3.0,I’m a woman size 7.5 and prefer to buy kids shoes since they’re usually cheaper. I didn’t like the fabric it looked like it was already worn out but it’s not. The material is super soft and offers a lot of flexibility. It is easy to slip on for me I’m not sure how it’d work for kids. The sole is a bit stiff and offers no arch support. The laces are soft and stretchy! I uploaded some photos to show the sneaker. Hope this helps.
3.0,The item was advertised as a 2xl. I am normally an xl but ordered the 2xl for the extra room. I did not realize it was coming from a place where the people are generally much smaller in stature. This item is no bigger than the average U. S. large. It does not even meet in the front let alone wrap around.
3.0,"Admittedly my calves are big, but these were too small for me.  Looking forward to losing weight so that I could use them; but if you're retaining water for a medical reason, this can be difficult and counterproductive."
3.0,"Very cute dress but I couldn't see because of the print that it has a neckline, like a necklace, that runs right in front of the neck. It kinda choked me. The dress fit perfect, though. I returned it."
3.0,the metal looks very dull.... leather seems ok for now..not sure how long it will last...was pleasantly surprised to see a hole punch inside and I needed it.
3.0,You get what you pay for.  A lot of lights for a little money.  33 out of 40 worked properly.  Not intended to last long and certainly not built for it.  They should package a few extra in each bag to account for failures.  It seems my bag was not unique in failures judging from the feedback of others.
3.0,"I love the look, feel, and fit. However, the length is a bit short and I am petite."
3.0,"It fits ok, but I wouldn’t order another one.  There is no stretch to it"
3.0,It lasted awhile but fell apart pretty fast. :(
3.0,Very nice looking dress
3.0,Should've listened to other reviewers who noted all the cases from this manufacturer are too small for all but the little readers and will not close all the way.
3.0,Don't like they put make in china on the lens and does not sit right on nose area
3.0,I selected this item because there were 10 Apple Watch bands for a very good price. But in all honesty I wasn't a fan of all the colors and probably won't use those unwanted colors. I wish that for this same price I could select 10 watch bands -- the colors of my choice.
3.0,"My friend has this purse in black and the leather is soft, smooth, luscious, shiny black.  When my ""navy blue"" purse arrived it was a ""dusty gray"" navy. UGLY color and the leather is pebble grain like cowhide not lamb like advertised. BUT it had all the pockets and size and length of strap that I wanted so decided to try it and ignore how ugly the color is!!  I bought some ""purse charms"" from QVC and hung those on and dressed it up a bit.  It truly is very FUNCTIONAL. For the price it is better than OK.  Just wish it was better looking leather!"
3.0,Nicely made just too big and no form. Length is great and the material is soft. Not true to size it would be better used as a house dress not outdoors.
3.0,"After wearing these at work, I notice they get a little uncomfortable on my nose. I have another set of these that have elastic bands, which lay flat on your nose while this set has an elastic cord which is round and kind of irritates the bridge of your nose if worn for long hours. Still consider it a descent buy but for me they're best worn for short periods of time."
3.0,"My necklace did not come as pictured, I am missing the circle disc that is suppose to be on the 3rd strand."
3.0,"I haven't worn this thing yet, but the color received was not as pictured. The color received was black helmet with purple / blue spikes."
3.0,Waaaaay too short and I’m 5ft even so... if you have long legs your panties will probably be showing. Just FYI
3.0,"I did not receive the correct color assortment, but the fit is so good I’ve decided to keep them anyway. I’m 5’3 and 125 lbs. Many leggings I have purchased end up WAY too long! They are very soft!"
3.0,i thought it was going to be smaller the it is i don't like big wallets
3.0,Not what I was looking for. No real compression but comfortable. Returned
3.0,"I really liked the light feel of this cap. The quality seems fine. It feels like it would be cool to wear, which is important to keep you from sweating all day. Unfortunately, it is really small. I can't even get it on. If they had a larger size I would probably try it, but it is for a very petite woman."
3.0,Not bad but I don’t like it
3.0,"A medium was WAY too large on my 36-38-36 frame.  I think I had at least 6"" extra in the breasts!  Fabric also looks like it will be a nightmare to iron.<br /><br />I returned it."
3.0,"This watch looks cute and fashionable, but it lasted 3-1/2 weeks before it stopped running. You get what you pay for."
3.0,The masks do not fit on a normal adult face.  the mask crept up into my eyes the whole time I am wearing it.
3.0,"Idk maybe I just have huge boobs, but it definitely doesn’t support me like other bathing suits. It’s true to size pretty cheaply made. I decided to keep it as a backup but not in love with it."
3.0,"while the sunglasses are okay for the price, my 3 main criticisms are: 1. Nose piece is uncomfortable, even when adjusted for fit. 2. Lens are difficult to replace unless nose piece is flattened to its utmost. 3. Instructions are totally useless. Overall, if I lose the glasses, I won't be too upset, which I guess is a good thing."
3.0,I recommend everyone who are going to gym and yoga
3.0,"Gloves are snug but thin, might be okay for mild weather. The problem though was that the pair was not of the same length, there was about an inch difference!"
3.0,"If the piece across the foot could accommodate a high instep,  the slide in slippers would have been perfect."
3.0,Feel like a regular shirt then a gym shirt
3.0,They are ok gloves. Not very cooling though. And they fun at least a size to small. I sent them back.
3.0,The middle part of the bow want sealed strong enough. It came off already after one time wear
3.0,I bought a size 5-6x for my daughter that normally wears a small 4/5 or 6 and its way too small for her. I'd say it's closer to a 3-3t size instead.
3.0,"The quality is good for the price, however as one other review states, the necklace does not hang like it shows in the pictures. There is no way to adjust the length of the lower chain (with the name). Very disappointed because of that simple aspect."
3.0,"They sent me the wrong size and it is too big.  It is cute, but def a little cheaply made, which was too be expected with a blouse in this price range.  I am not sure if I would reorder this again, or from Allegra K, although they do have adorable items."
3.0,bought for my grandson  it is much bigger than we thought
3.0,its good for a little time. nothing extra. have to use very delicate for my rough child. but its a good costume.
3.0,I do like the dress and only was able to wear one of them twice and the other one once and they are material ripped and or detached on both?  Difficult to even so it back on because the material rips easy.  I love the look but she probably are only going to get one or two wears out of it.
3.0,This was bigger than I though I did not keep
3.0,"It's pretty, but it leaves a narley indent in your tongue where the top of the heart rests. The pink one also isn't as flattering as the clear, it doesn't sparkle as bright being pink, on a pink tongue."
3.0,"Wisconsin, USA Bought these boots for HVAC rough install work in September. These boots are too warm in summer/fall months and provide little to no warmth in the coldest of days (0 degrees or lower). For the price, it's not a bad boot, fit as expected and were comfy, not job site ready. After 3 months of work, there are holes in the toes and sole is separating."
3.0,"The vionic sandals fit fine but it has taken some time (2 weeks so far) for my foot to adjust to the higher arch.  I am wearing it around the house because I am afraid I might trip if I should wear it on uneven ground.  It is feeling better and seems to have re trained my left foot  to adjust to the change.  So I would recommend that if you have the same feeling when you first put it on,, don't give up.. Keep using it and you will notice a change.  I have rated it Okay for now but I am expecting .it to improve in time..."
3.0,Loved it but size fit more like a medium bought in yellow as well and that one fit as expected.
3.0,"It fit, but did no favors to a middle aged body."
3.0,"Fits overall, although a bit snug. Good for small frames and small chest. Not enough support for B+ cup size."
3.0,"I honestly can't fit that much in here... I have a driver's license, 4 credit/debit cards, my AAA card and health insurance card... It's difficult to put my cash in flat... kind of makes the bills fold in the corners that go in first, and pretty impossible to put in any receipts without first folding them up into little rectangles... I love the color and plumeria pattern, but just not too practical overall if you're looking for something really slim, which I was."
3.0,The fabric is not totally chiffon
3.0,"I’m 5’4” and 155lbs. I bought this dress as part of my Halloween costume. I bought a medium but probably should have bought a large as it is skin tight to me and difficult to zipper, but it’s stretchy so it worked out. However the white dress is incredibly see through and the material is thin. It will work for a Halloween costume but I couldn’t wear this as an actual dress anywhere"
3.0,"As others have noted, the zipper is really cheap. It broke on the first day I was using it."
3.0,Logo printed on...not sewn.  Will probably disappear after only a few washes
3.0,It’s durable but I just didn’t like the fitting to much. Maybe it just me but feel that it could had been made to better fit.
3.0,cute but order an XL because its Very small and be prepared to cur off all the strings from poor stitching... its okay.
3.0,"The yellow area looks like stewed rhubarb, but yellow. Literally the best description I have. The earrings are not terribly heavy. I returned due to the color and texture of the yellow coloring. If the yellow was bended better or it was a different color I would have kept it."
3.0,llego rota!
3.0,"Sadly I had to return them because they were too flat. The arrived vacuum sealed and I think that flattened them too much. Anyway, maybe we have big heads and so it doesn’t fit right… who knows."
3.0,The bathing suit fit really well except for the bust. (I got a Large) The cups and padding are really small in proportion to the rest of the product.
3.0,"I hate this color! I expected to see nice rich color brown wallet but got a pale not brown, not purple, not yellow don't know what color it is wallet."
3.0,good enough for stocking stuffers
3.0,I'm short 5'1&#34; and these are short on me. They are doable but not my favorite.
3.0,"This is well made, but I feel it sticks out a little too far for my tastes. I wish it was a little flatter."
3.0,"Arrived on time and well packaged. This runs pretty large, I’m normally small and ordered a small and it’s got a lot of gaping around the waist. I think I’m about a 27 or 28 inch waist. I’m 110-115lbs and 5’2. The small is too big and no smaller size available."
3.0,"The width of the boots is quite large (9.5 D), a problem I have not had with other footwear.  They are well padded and took a very short break in period."
3.0,"Quality seems good, but the colors are wrong. I ordered gray and I got purple.<br />The product itself though seems sturdy and well put together. Just don't have your heart set on a specific color!"
3.0,It's ok but it takes alot of effort to get it to stay unfolded and in a proper shape.
3.0,It fit a little funny... But it was for a 1 and done costume day and did the trick. I would not go into a BANK with this on... Nope... No way...
3.0,I thought they were sweat shorts.  That is what I searched for and it wasn't clear in the description.  I returned them
3.0,It does not sit right on my neck but pretty !
3.0,"Cute fuzzy sweater. Soft and warm. Nice color for spring. A touch too small but I am tall so maybe that's why it was extra short on me. Slightly itchy, but I have sensitive skin too."
3.0,"I ordered the white floral dress. You will definitely need a slip under it. It’s completely see through!<br />The dress fits perfectly, except for the length. I’m about a size 12 and 5’9”, I ordered a medium. The dress is about 3” too short (I just tied a knot in the bottom)."
3.0,"Picture looked better, than in person."
3.0,"I have one from a while ago and I got this for a friend as a gift and it's not the same, it's dmaller and light weight unlike mine which is heavy ."
3.0,Fit great at the too but the pleats didnt drop where I expected them to
3.0,"Some of the comments said to size up, I did and the waist fit pretty well, but the legs are a little too wide for my liking. They also aren’t the most comfortable. Felt really cheap, but if you know how to sew and can adjust them it’s not so bad. I can’t see them lasting past this summer unfortunately."
3.0,Color is more of a denim instead of blue.
3.0,I wore this sweater one time last year. I wore it the other day to a holiday party at work and it doesn’t work anymore.
3.0,Product fits smaller than advertised
3.0,"This shirt is super cute. The vinyl is nice and thick and well made. However, it's sized very small. I normally wear a size L top. Knowing this was Asian sizing, I ordered a 2x. It came marked US 2x, China 4x. It fit in the length, bust, and sleeves, but the neck felt like it was strangling me. It's very high and very small."
3.0,It is a bit snugger then expected like others have said but looks good and isn't uncomfortable. My main issue was the pockets the left was sewn half way up from the bottom and the right was sewn in the middle.I had to remove the stitches to use them. Everything else about this long sleeve shirt I have loved.
3.0,Not great quality but very groovy!
3.0,I like have a amputee big toe that bleeds so these are perfect because if I needed to I got throw away the socks. Whit out spending much money thank u and everyone have a nice labor day
3.0,Fed a green not a yellow
3.0,"It’s cute, but too short. I’m 5’7 and it ends at my calves. The slit comes up high."
3.0,I accidentally missed the deadline to get my money back...so now I am stuck with something that is too small.  Gorgeous outfit. Wonderfully made and great quality it just didnt fit the little girl I wanted it to fit.
3.0,"Cute dress, it just doesn’t fit me."
3.0,"Based on the product picture, the length is significantly shorter. Product photo shows hitting below the knee (which I'd prefer), but on me it was a good 3 inches above the knee, if not more. The material is also a super thin polyester-like, though it was not see-through, so there's a plus. The gathering of the fabric around the waistline is also a little wonky. All in all, it just wasn't what I expected based on the product photos."
3.0,"Ordered a size 9 but received a size 7.<br />Oh well, very pretty so will wear on pinky finger.  Would’ve been 5 stars if the size had been right."
3.0,"Based off the size chart I ordered a small. It fits, but I only like how it looks when it’s open. I feel like a medium would have fit me better in the shoulders, because I feel like they’re supposed to drop more, but in a small when it’s tied closed it’s still very loose. I love the high leg slits though! Material is ok. Your standard polyester. I don’t think I would purchase again. For reference I’m 5’6, 29 waist, 35 hips, 36C and 15 across the shoulders."
3.0,Very low quality fabric
3.0,Not  great fit!! Cheap fabric!!
3.0,"I really wanted to love this crown. I have quite a collection and this really is a beautiful piece. The downside is that it is very heavy, and the hanging fringe decoration at the front makes it difficult to set right. I feel that that part should be hanging onto my forehead but there is no way to get the crown to sit there. It looks like it would be great for a Cleopatra type cosplay - I just haven't been able to figure out a way to make it work."
3.0,"They are super cute, light weight, but as soon as I open them from the package, they fell apart. The backs came off. I plan on super glueing them, but I was disappointed that this is how they came…"
3.0,"My go to shirt not just for my yoga class. I love the color, not a soft as hopped and being to pill a bit. That said I wouldn't by a second"
3.0,"This is great for the summer. I have it a 3 because the material is a little thin and I’m worried that if I wash it, it may in wravel. It’s a little short but on a child it works. My girl is 2 and about 30 pounds this will be great for the wedding we have coming up. It fits her"
3.0,"If you're already a little heavy through the middle, these are not for you. Don't think you're hiding anything. Unfortunately, that's what I thought would happen and was sadly mistaken :( There is a LOT of fabric in these pants and especially through the waist, so they just add too much thickness at the waist and belly. I really loved the weight of the fabric and the olive color. These would've been great for summer, light & airy! Also, the other reviews about the drawstring affect not working - news flash - when you pull the string on the inside, just tie a quick knot in the string and they stay up great! So if you're a skinny minnie looking for that retro 90's look with these pants, you'll love. Good Luck!"
3.0,The ring is nice and fun but the pearl fell off after three days. I take my jewelry off at night and when washing hands or showering.
3.0,It’s a beautiful dress but it’s very thin and cheaply made. I’ve already seen a run and one button wrap has come undone after one wearing.
3.0,These are super comfortable but they do show everything. So if you have cellulite or deep stretch marks…they will show.
3.0,"The scarf  only has print on one side. This makes it difficult to wear with clothing/dresses or as a basic neck scarf. It’s also stiff, not soft"
3.0,The gloves are quite thin.
3.0,"I purchased this dress in 3 sizes and 3 colors and 2 of the 3 had to be returned. The fit is not flattering, the pockets make it hug weirdly in the stomach area if you are not stick thin. It was not as loose as I would have hoped. It is see through and made of a very cheap material, mine had threads out in multiple places. Bra showed through the top regardless of color.  One if the other colors we ordered had a very weird discoloration right across the chest, it was very noticeable and almost as if the dress had faded in that one spot! We wanted to love these dresses but 2 of the 3 had issues."
3.0,They were not the length shown in the picture—they were Capri length—-very disappointed as I wanted Bermuda shorts—they are fine as a Capri—just not shorts!
3.0,Diamonds fell out but pretty ring! No rust!
3.0,"Very comfortable, fit as expected. I'm disappointed because I've worn a pair out one time and there is already a hole in them. I think it can be sewn up so I will do so, but still."
3.0,It looks nice like the photo however it's too big.
3.0,The shoes are lightweight but size is bigger than expected
3.0,It is a little large.  It is hard to know what size to purchase.  I normally wear a small or medium depending on the manufacturer.
3.0,"...could be better.<br /><br />The lens is rather flimsy. But they do fit over my glasses, and that's all that really matters."
3.0,"I originally bought a small based on the size chart that was provided with this jersey.  When I received it, the shirt was WAY too small.  I returned it for a large.  I generally wear a small/medium in my biking clothes.  The large fit much better overall, except on my arms.  The band that is over my bicep is quite tight.  It will work for shorter rides, but I imagine it might drive me crazy on long rides.  Besides the arm elastic, the jersey is good quality and seems fine so far."
3.0,i gave this tie to my english teacher and he liked it but in the description it didnt tell you that it only had two lights
3.0,"Nice fabric, and great finished, really good quality, just bigger than I thought. Customer service really polite."
3.0,These seems nice but they are the Small/Short Bands.<br /><br />Wish they were more specific about the length.<br /><br />Have to return them because they don’t fit.
3.0,It's ok but not great .
3.0,"So.... I've begun to customize this piece. It's great! I shaved off the paint on the ""sharp"" part of the blade and it looks great so far. I've got a long way to go before I'm really happy with the finished project but the item as bought was great. Unfortunately, it's not as shown in the first few pictures. If they fixed this I'd give it five stars for sure.<br />It's extending feature is in my opinion esthetically lacking. It's cool but doesn't look as cool as id like. Id still give it five stars if it just looked like all the pictures."
3.0,"They're cute rings, but turn coppery/green very quick."
3.0,Not good for women with long torso.<br /><br />The waistline is a bit high so makes me look lumpy
3.0,It's small like I wanted. However its is a bit to small for me. I have several things I like to carry in my wallet. It does not accommodate all of them well. But overall for the price not bad.
3.0,Nice quality but hard to unscrew.
3.0,"I was very disappointed with this watch. My mom bought one (unsure of name brand) for my grandbaby. It was loud, you heard the alarm well. This one will vibrate but if this child doesn't tell you it is vibrating then you have no clue. If you happen to be right beside her you may barely hear the alarm. She didn't have it 2 weeks and the screen was already freaking out. The numbers are showing in pieces. This was for her to prepare for school. Its useless. Unsure if it is water resistant or not."
3.0,Liked the concept and the color. Bought one for my sister who is larger and it worked fine. I had to return mine. It ran big and there was a slight defect.
3.0,I like the design but they were tight and uncomfortable to wear.
3.0,its ok but I don't like the fabric
3.0,"This dress is so cute and great for work, but too tight on the chest area. I wear a Medium in almost everything and I ordered a Medium for this dress, but it was too tight on top. The first time I wore it, the button on the back (top) popped off within 2 hours."
3.0,"The shirt arrived with a hole in the right arm sleeve...  Sort of disappointed in that.  Other than that, it's a great short!  But not sure why it had a hole upon opening it??"
3.0,Shoe kept sliding off my 3 year olds feet.  She constantly complained about wearing them.
3.0,Everything is solid overall but the stitching is going in multiple locations in the hat.
3.0,"Run somewhat small, tend to ride up while wearing them. Seams are not straight down the side. Overall not what I anticipated based on description and images"
3.0,"Didn't run them through the dryer for fear they'll wind up even shorter than they already are. They'll do for at home with just my spouse or dogs, but I wouldn't pack them for traveling to stay with friends or family, just a bit too borderline for my comfort"
3.0,"made my finger a little green, but that was expected considering the price.  over all it was a ok purchase."
3.0,"Orde a size up, especially if you have larger breast. Otherwise, comfy enough"
3.0,"I bought this because is stated that is was a heavy sweatshirt.  It was more of middle weight not that heavy.  I bought a large, and maybe should have gotten the x-large because I layer clothes underneath and It will fit a little snug.  I am 6'1"" and around 180lbs so you can use this as a reference.  It is a nice sweatshirt  although"
3.0,The outfit is good quality fabric but the embroidery is not well made. The 'r' and 'i' are touching for some reason making it look like a 'me. The inside of the shirt where the embroidery is there is no protective cloth protecting baby's skin. I will be returning because of the rough embroidery.
3.0,"The price / build quality of these are awesome, they’re just kinda small. With other glasses on they sit pretty low on your nose and so, as you can see, the arms aren’t really long enough to fit around your ears.<br /><br />Even without glasses it’s a very tight fit. They’d have to be worn uncomfortably high on my nose to reach my ears. The arms themselves are slightly shorter than my normal glasses.<br /><br />I’m bummed"
3.0,Kind of disappointed in this key chain. I was expecting a larger key chain. It is fairly small:(
3.0,"If this laid flat, it would be adorable.  As it is, the different charms will turn over at different times, so I am always having to check to make sure it is setting just right.  It looks fabulous with many different shirts or blouses, but that issue is distracting and makes me want to not wear it for long.  It definitely doesn't look as cheap as the price, though."
3.0,"The jersey looks great but the sizing is a bit wonky.  I thought to order a size up as there might be a discrepancy but a large is large.  A bicycle jersey should be snug otherwise it’s just a t-shirt. I should have ordered a medium for a 39” chest.<br />Looks nice, but also not a summer jersey- the material is comfortable but a wee bit in the heavier side"
3.0,"Rides up, fits fine, would say it’s true to size, but rides up, and I fall out the bottom alot"
3.0,"Super cute bathing suit- however- I ordered an XL (I am a 36C), and since the padding was very stiff, there was barely any support for my boobs, and if you made the bathing suit any tighter around the neck, then my boobs would have popped out lol.<br /><br />The bottom was a little unflattering, made my butt look very flat."
3.0,Love the size and style of this bag but the gold rings on the straps have come off a few times. Thankfully I found the pieces and could put them back together. Otherwise I love everything about the MK bag.
3.0,"First, let me say that this shirt wasn’t worn, so I have no clue how durable it is. It was taken out of the package, tried on by 2 people, and returned. IT RUNS SUPER SMALL! We ordered an XL for my husband, do y’all remember Chris Farley’s “fat guy in a little coat” scene from the movie Tommy Boy? That’s what my 6’1”, 210 lb husband looked like, this shirt was so tiny. Definitely NOT an XL. We had our son, who typically wears a men’s medium try it on next...it fit, but was tight in some places, and went just two inches below the waistband of his pants. The reason I gave this 3 stars, despite the disastrous fit (and awful seller), is because the fabric felt great! Like a much more expensive shirt. But at your own risk."
3.0,"Nice fabric, great stencil. Sizes way off. I usually wear a medium and bought the large and it was still very form fitting. I want this style loose and not form fitting. I returned it. Maybe an extra large would have worked but I did not exchange. Sizing and fit needs to be more clear."
3.0,"Surprisingly decent sun protection, and they look nice. However when I wear sunscreen on my face the coating on the classes peels off, which is sort of creepy."
3.0,Not preshrunk
3.0,They were extremely TINY.  I was expecting them to be larger.
3.0,bought my size but the top was much bigger than i expected. Material is thin. Style of the top nice though.
3.0,What is the size of the bag?
3.0,They are pretty small...
3.0,They look good but I thought the lenses would be a deeper red.  They're more of a rose tint.
3.0,Feels a little tight in the arm area.  I have sensitive skin and can't stand it when the arm area are tight.  It makes me feel itchy but this sweater is thin and felt soft to the touch.  A normal skinned person should be fine.  I liked the style it just did not work for me in the arm area.
3.0,"there's no bust support in this suit and the butt area is incredibly high up, almost like a thong"
3.0,Its a lot longer than i had expected but foldes uo nicely to fit under other shirts. Fabric is very soft and lacing isnt stiff.
3.0,"So I almost included a photo to illustrate exactly how tight the neck is on the loosest snap. Oh Lord, is it tight! The skin of my neck bunched up around the neckline and, aside from making me feel like I was wearing a noose, it looked terrible.<br /><br />If I were younger, I'd have had a muffin top thing going on around my neck. Things being as they are (no elasticity, saggy skin), it looked like curtains being tied back. But instead of fancy, silky curtains, it was beige, out-of-the-box, wrinkled burlap cinched with black satin.<br /><br />I don't recommend this bodysuit unless you have a REALLY skinny neck (12"" around the base of your neck close to the collar bones). There are two snap settings, and I couldn't close the neck strap on the tightest one."
3.0,It shows al it of cleavage if your big busted.
3.0,poorly worded instrctions
3.0,Thought they were for children but actually.adult size.
3.0,This shoe provides no support for people with orthopedic problems.
3.0,"These work pretty well.  They are very synthetic feeling. I got them to wear under dresses to prevent chub rub but unfortunately they ride up in the middle and I have to readjust pretty frequently. I bought some jeans and leggings in 2 sizes and had to return them all cause they didn't fit so maybe I'm in a weird in-between size? But I feel like these fit. I went to a store and got jeans that fit and they were a size 12 so I guess I'm a maternity L, so these may run small (i got an XL)<br /><br />I like that they have pockets. I am 27 weeks preggie and 5'4"" and currently a little over 200lbs"
3.0,"Packaging was bad--all wadded up very tightly into a ball in bag, so is VERY wrinkled.  Super thin material, but looks & feels nice & airy.  Neckline looks floppy--way too wide & lowcut.  Unsure how/if this garment will retain any shape after wash/dry.  Size M looks a bit large."
3.0,Very tight fit should have bought bigger
3.0,"These boots are nice, but the upper half of the boot is extremely large.  So much so that the edges of the boot touch each other when lacing the boots.  It's frustrating because you can't get the top half of boot to fit properly."
3.0,"I need a decent size bag with an inside divider and a zipper closure. This fit the bill and my price range at the time. At first I was really surprised by the bag. Then after some use, I noticed some blemishes with the bag. For example, seams not sewn all the way, threads coming apart and small things like that. The more I use it (I don't always take it with me), the more things fall apart. The gromets are falling off. The inside zipper is starting to get stuck."
3.0,Fits very tight.. I may gave to give it to a friend..
3.0,"These seem okay, not quite as nice as I expected because they are somewhat thin, but they are earrings for a younger girl. The box has advertising on the outside that looks cheap.  It would have been better to have a plain box."
3.0,"Fits everywhere perfectly except the bust. It does technically cover the bust, but it feels pretty snug and a little too revealing. I'm 5'5, 27 inch waist, 37 hips, 24C, ordered Small. Since it fit fine everywhere else, I didn't want to risk ordering a Medium and it being big everywhere except the bust."
3.0,I am tall and this was a little shorter than I wanted.
3.0,Not the perfect fit for me but is a<br />Beautiful color
3.0,"I bought this vest to help me sweat more on the sides of my chest  but after a good sprint id check to see how much i sweated from my chest and there was barely sweat at all, might as well just stick with a regular waist band."
3.0,Try another brand that is larger and have  snaps enstead of velcro
3.0,My daughter loves this leotard. I love the snap t the bottom for bathroom breaks. It would receive five stars if the fit weren’t so off. The 2t is definitely too large and probably closer to a 3t.
3.0,"poor quality ,no label stitched to ."
3.0,They were pretty. I have small ears. These were large for my ears.
3.0,"I was excited about this dress, was hoping it would be flattering and modest and i loved how the color looked in the picture. However, the color is so ugly! and the fit was horrible, I'm big chested with a small waist and full hips (44-30-42) and the dress was not flattering for me at all! My mom is a flat chested size 12 and she loved it because she felt it hid her stomach while flattering her chest well. She kept it and loves how comfortable it is."
3.0,"The bra is a nice one and I wish it fit better. The band size was a good fit, I went up a size as recommended by other reviewers and they were correct. However, the cup size was enormous. I could have fit both of my breasts into one cup. I normally wear a 38B. I ordered a 40B. My sister who used to work in a lingerie store said I would need to go down a cup size when I go up a band size. Well, that would mean that I would have to order a 40A, and that was not an option. It is too bad because the bra was well made and would have been really nice."
3.0,"The quality of the beads are great, however they fit a bit larger on my wrist than I would like. I have small wrists and am afraid of them falling off."
3.0,The glasses unfold while in the keychain and will fold while you are wearing the glasses.
3.0,Not fleece or thick at all. Very thin not like picture
3.0,"Don’t get me wrong, this dress is cute, but when I sit down and really look at it, especially in terms of craftsmanship, it isn’t worth 20$.<br /><br />It fits to say the least. I got a size L, I’m usually wear a size 10 or 8 in dresses depending on the style. 5’6, 36DD. Some of the stitching to the front ruffle is a bit off. One side is stitched down while the other side is not. You can’t tell unless you’re really inspecting the dress. Length wise it’s alright. It’s almost to my knees so it’s definitely not short. I was worried about length due to my thighs (thick) but this dress worked out perfectly. If the stitching was a little better I would have rated higher."
3.0,Not as pretty as the picture. Looks more like a traditional bandana pattern.  Size is nice and large for variety.
3.0,very pretty but way to big for me to use for earrings.
3.0,Don’t like the material but great style
3.0,"Not found of advertising &#34;PRIME&#34; and only size small ships prime!! 6 to 8 bucks for all other sizes.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0046M8PK0 Del Rossa Men's Classic Satin Boxer Shorts (Pack of 5 Solids), Large Solid Colors (A0753PKALG)]]"
3.0,"Although the dress is made well enough and the fabric is nice, it was too sheer for me.  I wanted to wear it with my orange petticoat but you can see it through the fabric.  I tried to show that in the close-up, but am not sure you can really tell from the photo.  It showed through quite a bit in person.  Also, the background was more beige than white so I couldn't have used a white petticoat, either.  About sizing, I went by the seller's size chart and got the XXL for my 45&#34; bust and 39&#34; waist frame.  It was a tad loose around the bust, but not too much.  It was very big around the armholes and puckered out way too much, though.  I might have tried going down a size to see if that made a difference, but didn't bother because of the other two issues for me.  As you can see from my photos, the butterfly colors are lovely and vibrant.  Please ignore how shabby I look in the photos.  I was just trying the outfit on to see how everything looked together so haven't done my hair or make-up.  I still recommend this dress if the few issues I mentioned don't bother you."
3.0,"The knob for the volume/ music fell of about ten minutes after getting it out of the box. The music still worked though, we just couldn't adjust the volume. So not a deal breaker. For the money not a terrible product, we still had fun with it."
3.0,"Since I'm only 5'4"", these go WAY past my knees.  I love the print but it does distort the minute it goes above the ankle.  They are so large that I have to ""arrange"" the puckers up my leg.  Next wash will be with hot water and hot dryer.  Maybe that will help.  If it doesn't they'll be tossed as they are like stockings instead of knee socks on me."
3.0,"This really had potential to be a nice dress. It is sewn okay. Has nice trim around the neck. Now for the bad, You can see through it. You have a slit in the front that is real HIGH. The size is smaller than larger. The sewing is okay. NOT really a dress, maybe a bathing suit cover up. I hope this has helped. Thank You"
3.0,I have mixed feelings about this ring. Sometimes it's pretty and sometimes it's just too fake-looking.
3.0,"thought it would of been lightweight, overall the boots are aight not ok"
3.0,"I like this bag, its small but still fits a lot. However, after using it a few times the inner lining ripped pretty badly. I still use it sometimes, but I can't complain too much, the bag wasn't too expensive."
3.0,It was great looking shirt you definitely need buy a size up .
3.0,"if you are big in the chest your in trouble. the straps that go through the back arent long enough and the front top piece runs small. the bottom part fit like a glove, but I cant wear it unless I lose a ton of weight and lose my boobs. so disappointed"
3.0,"Hi! I normally weigh between 139 to 141 pounds, so my size is medium. Based on the comments I decided size up, but it was a mistake. When I opened the package, it was in one piece, because it is huge! Please, don't size up. I am giving it 3 stars, because the pretty colors and the soft fabric. But unfortunately I will not use it."
3.0,"I thought these were lovely, but after wearing them 2 times, the seams start to unravel. Not a very good quality, but they are pretty."
3.0,"Really difficult to open and equally difficult to close, afraid to use it for my septum. Bought a horseshoe instead to use in same color and size. I do plan to use it for a project im currently doing though so im happy i still have a use for it, its too cute to toss or return."
3.0,"the panty fits, so why is the elastic too tight around my legs and belly? who wants that in a panty!?! is a defect to have thin tight elastic. should not sell anymore with this design - needs less-tight elastic and they would be a winner."
3.0,"Decent looking boot, just not the most comfortable boot.  Like walking on hard wood barefoot."
3.0,"The top wasn't off the shoulder like the picture posted.  They did feel silky against my body, and I slept well."
3.0,Ordered a size up. Fits but tight.
3.0,See through and shrinks after first wash
3.0,VERY disappointed with the new sizes that I got in the mail.  I previously bought this product online from the pink lady directly (first was from a craft type show).<br /><br />The big bottle is 8 fl oz vs 12 fl oz and then the cream is smaller as well as the tub to keep the jewelry in for polish - you can barely fit anything in there.  What I received does not match the pictures on Amazon.  What is pictured is the former sizes that I bought years ago.  Feel like I was lied to but since they don't technically mention sizes not much can be done.
3.0,"Very come, fits well, appears to be made well. The sleeves are slightly shorter than other shirts I have on the same size. Also, as the day went on I noticed the shirt seemed to stretch. So by the time I took it off it was looser than when I initially put it on."
3.0,"Fits great, timely delivery. But there's no logo on the back? The one on the front is already kind of faded. I'm a little dissappointed because I expected a logo on the back as well."
3.0,These were a gift in my granddaughter's Christmas Stocking and she likes them. They are quite cute but they shrunk up badly after the first wash. They barely fit her now. They haven't shrunk any more but she won't get much wear out of them as she's three and growing. I won't buy this brand again.
3.0,Don’t look a real Pandora.
3.0,Not as long on me as shown on bust.
3.0,It's a nice buy. But 2 different items are shown in the display and the item I got wasn't the one I expected.
3.0,"I bought to tie dye but will return.  Too large and not terribly flattering.  The pants are thin, but that isn’t that big of an issue. The see-thru thing is a problem."
3.0,"The images shown show this dress as a little more tailored in the waist/ rib cage areas, but it was cut almost more like a baby doll style. I only wore this once and the button fell off, which is a little bit of a disappointment even though I can sew it on again easily.<br />I did get a lot of compliments on the dress over all and I like the fabric."
3.0,This dress was alot bigger than expected. Im usually between a medium and large. I bought a medium and was still swimming in it. The pockets were nice but my husband said I looked like a nun lol
3.0,"The finish wears off quickly and dirt gets in the mesh.  The band isn""t that comfortable. I've swapped out the band after 2 weeks."
3.0,WAY TOO SMALL! I even ordered a size up! I am a B size cup and there was a big button gap where you could see my skin. if getting this but 2 sizes up! Sadly i had to return. the quality seemed great though! If it fit I would have given it 5 stars!
3.0,"I have large upper arms, that did not work for me. Otherwise they are great. I am female 230lbs.<br />I liked the thumb hole to keep on hand."
3.0,"I'm 5'10&#34; and this hit me at an awkward length, it was actually below my knees and kind of ended up looking frumpy"
3.0,"This little outfit was bigger than expected but it's okay, we used them mostly as jammies."
3.0,"I was disappointed with this dress. It looked so funky on me, so I had to return it."
3.0,Small but fit more like a med.
3.0,They are a bit to tight and I purchased my size. Also the material is very thin so can’t be worn during the winter. The colors are nice and the price is reasonable if you’re looking for thin summer pants.
3.0,Not a bad product.  Nicely built but these are a glove lining and not really intended for outer wear. This was mentioned in the description but only when you looked at contents of the package. Quality was top.
3.0,"The material is good quality and well made, however, the sizes are not very accurate. I needed a medium and had to return for a larger size."
3.0,"Super cute shoes, but the images started completely peeling off after the first time she wore then"
3.0,"So far 4 out of 6 I tried to put on have broken, the worst part is that all I did was unscrew the little ball. 2 of them broke while I was unscrewing them one broke cause it slipped out on my hand & on to the sink & 2 of them broke as I was screwing them on. That was upsetting, specially since I really liked the ones that broke.<br />I won’t be buying them again.<br />At least there are some that can be used, I got one on my lip & one on my nose."
3.0,Runs large but a hassle to return. Wish I would have bought a large instead of x-large
3.0,"If I hang it from one shoulder, it almost makes it to my waist. No way should it be advertised as a cross body. I plan on using the strap from my old bag with this one so it is functional."
3.0,"I love the softness, the length and the look. Not a fan of how low the front scoops and seems a little tight (but might just be my weight) The most disappointing thing is that they pill heavily after just a few wears."
3.0,Great fabric but runs a bit small
3.0,They are very cute. Started unraveling after the first wear.
3.0,It fit everywhere besides the sleeves they are huge!
3.0,I really like this hoodie but the loops that go around the buttons broke on the first wear. I was kinda bummed it wasn't sown better.
3.0,"wish they were a little bigger, but fits snug"
3.0,The only size available is medium and it is not Mordenmiss traditional oversize but small and narrow. That being said it is so adorable  I will just wear it open.
3.0,"Bought up after reading reviews. Usually a large but I bought an XL.<br /><br />Short but not too short.<br /><br />Warm fuzzy inner inning material.<br /><br />If you have back rolls when wearing a bra it will show. If you have a belly, it will show. Recommend spanx"
3.0,This has helped me out tremendously
3.0,"I love the pattern, but these leggings are more like tights. The material is a bit thin. I am a size small and these are a tad tight. I wish the material were heavier but they still look good."
3.0,These are very cute and will fit for a few winters to come. Great price too!
3.0,"Dress arrived promptly, as described. Really cute design. Fabric has nice weight to it. Problem = Sizing is a little strange - ordered a large (which I would expect to wear based on other US standards) and it is a little sack-like.  But I think a M would be too small, based on the listed measurements.  May keep and try to take in a smidge, or - will it shrink?  Anyway, not that flattering as-is :("
3.0,I wear a 36 G  bra. The swimsuit fits fine if you don't need much support in the bust. The straps to tie around the neck are very stretchy and never seem to give support. However it does cover fairly well and a large busted person will not be falling out of it.
3.0,the quality is ok but the fit is not as described. I am usually a small to medium. I ordered the medium and it fit like an extra small. I am 5'3 and 125 lbs. I would return them but since they came from China and it took a month to receive I am not going to bother.
3.0,"This backpack would be great for EDC or a short day hike. It is on the smaller side but the build quality seemed to be pretty good, solid stitching, working zippers, etc.  For how small it is, it has a TON of straps all around the bag which can be useful but are a pain otherwise.  Honestly one of my biggest complaints is that all of the zippers (which there are a lot) are metal on metal, so they clank around and make a ton of noise after any type of movement.  Besides that this is a nice, little, compact day pack or EDC bag. Definitely a bargain at this price."
3.0,"Two of the three came in the conditions expected, but the third had broken where the face broke from the clip. Some Elmers glue and we're good to go!"
3.0,These fit my kiddo perfectly around the waist but after wearing for a bit they stretch around the crotch.
3.0,Love the hat but it is a little tight.  Need to make one for a lady with a bigger head.
3.0,I ended up returning this product. I just didn’t like the way it fit on me.
3.0,It's great that someone is making a Grateful Dead sweatshirt. It looks cool. But quality - not so great. Stitching in armpit area was coming undone within a week.
3.0,"It fits, but the neckline and color are different than the pictures.  I actually like it but it's not what I expected."
3.0,pretty earrings but they are tiny!
3.0,This is not a high waist pant...but it fits lovely!
3.0,"great quality, fits a little tight"
3.0,the colors are not the same that show in the pic
3.0,"I love Ryka shoes. I terrible feet problems and I never found anything more comfortable and I tried everything. I work in a factory and have to replace my sneakers pretty regularly. These were disappointing. First, the insoles are built in. I usually have a small lift in one shoe but it wasn't possible with these. The insoles are memory foam and very comfy so I just went with it. A month or so into wearing them, the shoe laces would unevenly distribute  hours into the day and cause my feet terrible pain. Its a strange problem, never had it with shoes. Again, Ryka makes great shoes! there are just better ones"
3.0,"The product is nice, but it took TOO LONG to get here.  Upon ordering the beginning of February, I didn't realize it was coming from China."
3.0,"it’s really short, more like a shirt. This dress is for people that are under 5’8"
3.0,"Fabric is good, the hardware is so so, but it does it work."
3.0,Nice bag but I was looking for something a little bigger
3.0,"They are well made, but they are really not that warm!"
3.0,This is super hilarious but not super sturdy. Was used simply as a prop and served that purpose well. Plunger is not a snug fit so it didn't stay put but it was fine and got the laughs! Graphics are very good.
3.0,Cute for a few weeks then the edges get tattered and it strecthes and doesn't stay on or look cute or clean anymore even if you wash it
3.0,The shoe was very nice but has a weird way to clasp it and it took me awhile to figure it out. Upon arrival I thought they sent me a broken shoe.  It came on time but after the wedding I attended I couldn't wait to get them off! My feet were killing me and I wear heels very often. They came with some gel inserts for the balls of your feet but those fell out within 5min of wearing the shoe. Good shoe if you only want to wear it for a couple hours max.
3.0,"We received this jacket and it is partially filled with down and is warm, but it also has polyester filling added, which I do not like. It is still technically ""packable"" I guess, but does not pack up as small as other coats we have in larger sizes that are all down/feather. I assumed the 80% down would mean the other 20% was feathers instead of down, but I couldn't find any description of what the other 20% was. Had I known it was polyester/down alternative, I probably would not have purchased.<br />It will get us by, so we're keeping it. I just honestly wish they would have just skipped the fiber filling. I would have preferred it to be less puffy... And that is kind of the point to these jackets, right?<br />... warmth without the bulk?<br />Other than that, it seems well built and warm. I would expect it to last more than one season... Just again, we would have preferred less bulk for what we intended this for."
3.0,"It is warm, but remember that this is a pure gimmick. My kid loves it."
3.0,Nicely made shirt but a bit large. Runs large
3.0,"I bought this robe to wear for my birthday. Since I couldn't go out, I hosted a virtual lingerie party, and it (the robe) was a hit!<br /><br /> What I loved... Even though its satin, it is pretty warm. It's double-layered, so it is suitable for cooler evenings. I took it off a few times because I got hot from dancing. I was worried it would be short on me. I'm 5'9'' and I planned to wear heels. I wore a 5-inch heel and as you can see it was still pretty long. And lastly, I felt so chic, royal, and glamourous, just like Suzzane Sugarbaker or Diana Ross :)<br /><br />What I didn't like... The fur trim is not fur. Unlike the picture, it's a few rows of slender feather boa. The belt is really long. and you'll have to wrap it around you several times. The gown didn't have a hook or inside ribbon like most robes. It also did not have belt loops. I had to make my own. Luckily I found a matching thread at Micheals.<br /><br />All in all, I like the gown and would recommend it. It is a good deal for the price, in spite of it not matching the pictures."
3.0,The metal clips for the strap adjustment sit in an awkward place requiring a tshirt or they dig into my skin making it uncomfortable.  Best for winter when layering clothes can hide it.
3.0,Cozy but no structure
3.0,I need size 8 and they were a bit too tight. Ordered M (7-8)
3.0,Product fits well everywhere except for the chest. If you have big breasts do not buy this as it will be too tight and become see through. Pretty design.
3.0,Quality seems ok but the size was way small and item was returned
3.0,Case has too much wiggle room which I can clearly hear. Prepare to use felt or some other sort of lining.
3.0,Wasn't what I was looking for.  Buckle much bigger than thought it would be and just took away from the looks of the purse for me.
3.0,Too heavy for my ear. Wore it once.
3.0,Is smaller than it looks
3.0,Soooo the print isn't as lively as the picture which is a bit disappointing.  Its very washed out. I would have expected a bit of a difference but not as much.
3.0,"And not holding up as well as I had hoped. I only wear them inside the house, but the inside is clumping, and I wear them with socks."
3.0,It smelled weird & it isn't warm on my face...it is very cold..you should use a warmer fabric. I got it so that I can keep my face WARM...I ride an adult tricycle for my transportation around town.
3.0,Love the smell but doesn't seem to last long... I shall buy the set and see if that will make a difference. I would buy again though
3.0,"Firstly let me say these are one of the softest pair of leggings I’ve ever tried on. They are definitely buttery soft. They slid right on with ease and were a pleasure to have against my skin! So comfortable! Second, these are not made for runners. I have learned a thing or two over the years and that is that you need a super tight wide band around your waist when it comes to leggings you wear to the gym IF you plan to run. I’m a runner. These just weren’t it for me. I could wear them all day as casual leggings and maybe even on a bike. But they are not made for running or using the elliptical. They are super thin, compressive but thin. For example: the squat test failed as you can see in the picture. The white card paper is showing right through without a flash on. Also, I wore them to the gym and first attempted to run and unfortunately I kept stopping to pull them up because they were sliding down off of my belly and my shirt was exposing my stomach. So after about the 10th time I decided to stop all together and try the elliptical instead. Again, the same thing happened. Not as often but it still happened and I got so annoyed that I changed out of them. I am going to use these as fall leggings or comfort leggings instead."
3.0,It’s not a very deep and little shallow for a person with regular head. Took too long to ship and received.
3.0,I like them but I only got 11 not 12😟
3.0,Bought a large... wAY too big!!!
3.0,"My shipment arrived a day early.  Happy I bought 2 different sizes because previous reviews have stated the bra runs smaller; they were correct.  I love the style and holds well when I jog and crosstrain..  Eventhough I normally wear 34DD, the size was too snug.  the 36DD fit perfectly.<br />Thanks again for making the racerback bra."
3.0,Was disappointed that it wasn't what the picture shows.
3.0,es muy pequeño y no tiene aretes..!!
3.0,"Although the pin was decent, there wasn’t any adhesive in the package. I had to compromise with glue and that resulted in many failed attempts. I’m sure having the adhesive would’ve made this an easier task."
3.0,"The sleeves and design are cute but the body is a square, there isn't really any shape to it, so it just looks big around the torso."
3.0,"My son loved them and the hat, one happy customer. Thanks!"
3.0,"While this headpiece looks great, it is entirely too hot to wear for any length of time. Also, the point at the front rubs against the forehead, causing an abrasion. Maybe my skin was too sensitive but I had to do a few scrubs for a couple weeks so that the skin returned to not being irritated and rough. I may try to wear something under the headpiece so that it's not so sweaty. I haven't decided what I'll do about the point at the front. It is a dramatic look that gets the job done, so I'm quite happy with that."
3.0,Nice sweater definitely runs small
3.0,"This is an ok product. It does what is asked of it. My main issue is that the fit is SO snug on the phone that you almost can't get it off without damaging either the phone or the case. I managed after some very careful tricks, but I'm afraid to put it back on."
3.0,they were too short and im short
3.0,Don't look like picture
3.0,It wasn’t how I expected it looks very plasticky
3.0,"It is cute, but it's not made real well. It was too big for my head, and I have an Average head! But other then that, it did the job"
3.0,"I’m usually a size small in most clothing (5’7”, 120 lb), but this ran large on me. When I cinched up the back, there was a large gap underneath the laces, where the zipper ended. It bubbled out because the waist was larger than what I cinched the laces to. Granted I am very small chested, so on someone larger chest this might fit better. The darts seemed rather low and wide for the typical breast location. Fabric pattern (yellow plaid) was cute, very Clueless. It was thin though, so would have to wear pasties since back of a strapless would be exposed. Mostly just meh."
3.0,When I received the item it was a bright beautiful color and after wearing it for a short time it has faded so bad it almost looks clear on the bottom stone. I’m very disappointed. It is actually made very well.
3.0,It’s a nice looking sweatshirt but material is very thin.
3.0,the arm bands are not cut for woman with any type of muscle in their arms ...  pretty but had to cut the bands in the arms to wear.
3.0,Returned this as it really didn't look much like the photos represented.
3.0,"These work great so long as they stay intact. About a month into using them, one alligator clip mysteriously popped off and has disappeared into never never land. I can’t find it anywhere. Unfortunate because they were perfect otherwise."
3.0,Pretty Color
3.0,"The top doesn't stay on the post well. It's a lovely piece of jewelry, however, very easy to lose due to design flaws."
3.0,These are cute but way thinner then I expected. I figured they would be on the thinner side but these are almost too thin. The first 3 were crinkled but we can still use them. I will try to add pics if I remember.
3.0,Fabric is super soft and stretchy. I ordered a size bigger just to make sure they fit and don’t feel like I needed to do that.<br /><br />I ended up cutting the tie piece off as it just added bulk. These are NOT tummy control. In fact the waist band comes up past my boobs!!  Because of this the slit is very high on my thigh.<br /><br />Although comfy I will likely only wear at home.
3.0,The dress is very cute but not stretchy at all. Not ideal for curvy women having that the top part doesn't offer space to move.
3.0,"The bag is long and strap is easy to adjust.  Unfortunately, it's very thin so hard to fit bulky items."
3.0,I would definitely not refer to this bag as &#34;extra large&#34; - but its super cute for just carrying my things...much to the dismay of my boyfriend
3.0,Beautiful but see through...
3.0,"Wanted to use it as a headband for my &#34;Kung Fury&#34; costume, but it wasn't nearly long enough.  My fault for not looking at the product description closely enough.  If you're hoping for a headband that will fall down to your back, this isn't the product for you.  It's way too short."
3.0,"Don’t really like the fit, it’s soft material"
3.0,Came with only 23 charms when it said 46 pieces would come
3.0,I like the product but it gets caught on my clothes a lot
3.0,Comfortable soft material but fairly thin. The compression in the leggings is ok but the top is more of a crop top than a bra. Overall it's not very flattering and I wouldn't wear it to the gym or for running outside but for working out at home it is comfy and functional. For the price I really can't complain.
3.0,"Not to good as I expect, the tassels aré moved from one sided"
3.0,Fits more like a shirt than a beach dress cover up. It winkles horribly. It is very cute otherwise. I suggest wearing shirts with it.
3.0,"The fit was great. The length is long enough to feel modest and not show unmentionables while chasing the baby and kids around, but also wasn't too long. However, after wearing (washed before wearing when received and between wears) my skin under my arms where they rub on the fabric was completely black. Scrubbing over and over with soap didn't even start to remove the color transfer. I eventually found that coconut oil removed the black, but I'm not sure if the cute fit and great price are actually worth it."
3.0,"The cut and shape of this dress is very flattering. For office wear, I usually wear it with a camisole because the v neck is quite deep.<br /><br />I rated it 3 stars because the material faded very quickly with only 1 wash using the recommended settings."
3.0,Fit well. Comfortable at first. But not holding up well at all. Very disappointed. They let my foot roll outwards. Not supportive at all.
3.0,"Looks very different from the picture, you really have to look in the right light to even see the emerald."
3.0,"Shirt is cotton not real soft and fits boxy.. not a tampered fit. It did shrink up shorter when washed.  Its an okay shirt for the money. Didn't look like the picture, just solid black."
3.0,"I love these and how soft they are... they aren’t very durable though. If you have a cat and it occasionally grooms your pants expect them to get strings coming up everywhere, followed by holes."
3.0,It's exactly as pictured.
3.0,It’s not a sweatshirt. It’s more like a thicker tshirt. I ordered a large because I prefer my sweatshirts a bit baggy/loose and I would probably prefer an extra large instead. I’ll keep it and wear it as a lounge top at home but I wouldn’t repurchase.
3.0,Under-sized. Size 4-6 does not fit 2-yr old. Brim to small. Otherwise nice qualities.
3.0,It's kind-of small. (Not trying to be funny here). It just simply isn't big enough to hold everything in. A sock works much better and stays in place better as well.
3.0,They where cute but I only got 11 not 13
3.0,"It’s a cute dress for an Amazon dress. I almost kept it, but the material under the arms cut into my underarms and it felt uncomfortable."
3.0,This light isn't as bright as I thought it was going to be. It was on when the package was delivered so I was able to see the light through the envelope.  While walking my dog at night when the light is on you can see it from a distance but as I said it's not to bright
3.0,Super cute earrings.  My daughter loved them for the month they lasted.  They are shiny and adorable but the backs are very loose fitting and the post that goes into the ear lobe bent within a month of owning the earrings.  They aren't expensive but I do wish the quality were a little better.
3.0,"I ordered this top to supplement my winter wardrobe.  The color of it is much brighter than pictured.  I expected a more subdued winter purple but this is more vibrant.  The fit is great and I love the shawl styled collar.  It fits close to the body but is flattering even if one’s figure is less than perfect due to the ruched front and empire waist style.  The top is true to size and a small was perfect for my small frame fitting well through the shoulders and sleeves.<br /><br />An awkward feature was the front seam directly below the ruching .  I feel it greatly detracts from the appearance.  A smooth, seamless front has an elegant drape.  This drape is interrupted by the awkward seam.  This would be a better design without the seam.  I’d also suggest that the seller retake the listing photo so that the color is accurately representative of the color of the actual product."
3.0,"Really adorable dress, but runs at least one size small in my opinion. Size up one size"
3.0,"The shoes are a bit wide for my feet, I typically wear an average sized width (not narrow or wide) without any issues but my feet are sliding around in these because they are a bit too wide for me.  They are also about 1/2 size too large,I normally take a size 7, never 6 1/2, but these run large in the length.  I took off the heel strap because it just flops around and doesn't provide any support.  I am rather disappointed, thankfully they weren't as expensive as other vionic brand shoes but I would not recommend these unless you are able to get a 1/2 size smaller than your usual size and do not mind the width being larger than normal."
3.0,The fit is great. Looks cute too.  But the inside of the the shirt has extra material that just hangs there. It's really weird and annoying.  You don't see it wearing it though. Just odd.
3.0,"The material isn’t what the picture looks like , also the lace isn’t the way I thought it was gonna be. It looks good on me however I was expecting something totally different than what I received"
3.0,"love the design, but it didn't fit well. I ordered a size up and it was actually more like a smock than a dress."
3.0,It's okay.  Not bad for the price.  Fits a little large and boxy.
3.0,"They seem like decent quality, especially for the price. That being said they are enormous! I ordered an 11 from a different company and they were just too perfect of a fit where we didn't have any  growing room so i ordered an 11.5 here and they are like 3 sizes too big. Also sandal says size 29, which according to the size chart is a 12 not an 11.5 like I ordered.  I might try again but am not sure what size to order."
3.0,"Made very solid but, the gold coloring is very, very yellow."
3.0,Material is very thin & clingy. May need to size up. Shows all your lumps & bumps so be prepared. Color not as saturated as depicted.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:6d93179a7099a0468ecb5765f389b0cc]] I ordered this, tried it on(it looked super cute on me and fit well btw)<br />washed it with color safe detergent and when I took it out of the dryer I noticed a TON of the color had washed out! There were a bunch of blotchy patchy white and faded color spots EVERYWHERE. I have ordered an exchange for another because obviously this ones dye job is defective and the dye bleeds out. Luckily I wash my clothes with like colors or this could have ruined other clothes. I ordered the aqua color.<br />I plan on washing the new one and will see if the dye bleeds as well. If it does I will just return it and not replace it.<br />So BUYER BEWARE: I suggest purchasing a light color or white. Dyes may fade or bleed out.<br />UPDATE: I recieved my new one and I just hand wash it, kinda sucks but whatever...but no dye has bled.<br />It is as pictured, the fabric is soft but not fragile so that's good."
3.0,They look good..the arch support is way overboard.. and the heel isn't sturdy.. just collapses every time you put your foot in and you have to pull the top of the heal back out of the shoe..pain in the arse
3.0,For a plus size girl its a little bit small in the bust and the bottom would be fine i guess if i wasn't over weight. Nice bathing suit colors are nice and quality is alright.
3.0,"Returned them. They are not my first pair of fit over sunglasses, but there was something wrong with the design.  It took a long time to work up the courage to lift the very stiff arm to full extension.  I thought for sure they must have been broken, but the design just means it's a two handed job which would not be easy when driving.  Once on, they were crooked on my face.  Unsure if it was a defective pair, or a flawed design."
3.0,These are incredibly warm and soft but after washing one time the seams started fraying very badly!
3.0,Good for price.  Didn't have an allergic reaction at all..
3.0,"Really liked the picture on website,  the detail on the nose ring itself was really too small to see.  The post was longer than the nose ring I was wearing,  I wasn't used to it,  so I bent the post too many times and broke it. It doesn't sit flush to the nose,  it's raised.  Not bad just different"
3.0,It wasn't the same as pictured.  Kept it anyway. did not want to have to pay to send it back to China.  Disapointed.
3.0,was going to return it because it runs really small (am 5&#34;2 /118lbs). Gave it to my petite friend with big boobs and it fit her much better. it is pretty sexy and nice material .
3.0,Not that great at all don't bother
3.0,Tried it on my E bike yesterday but it was very warm but the problem is it’s very difficult to breathe for some reason the vents and filter do not allow easy breathing so for me at 84 years old it’s not the ideal add cover for winter riding great delivery nice product but it doesn’t work for me
3.0,Got a size small but they fit like a medium ): but they are still mad cute
3.0,It’s good for how cheap it is. However I ordered a black dress and it came with this mismatched headband… will be sending it back.
3.0,Purchased this mask for a masquerade party it did the job but wasn’t very comfortable. Also had trouble seeing out of the mask.
3.0,"These earrings were nice, I really liked them at first. I noticed my ears began to get infected because the lack of space between your ear and the flat part of the earring causing like grime to build up very quickly. I found myself taking off the earring every day just to wipe them clean. They became too much of a hassle. I now stay with gold or silver. These have a coating over the stainless steel. Which is why they were getting infected."
3.0,"Mostly so in love with these pants. Have a dressy look while feeling and moving like active leggings. So flattering except for one MAJOR issue: NO crotch gusset. Legs look great, waist fits smooth... but then hellllloooo  camel toe. If I hadn’t renewed my skills and interest in sewing as a quarantine activity, I’d have had to send them back as I couldn’t wear them out of the house - but alas I constructed and inserted a makeshift gusset to conform to social appropriations. If you’re handy in this skill, the pants are still worth it, but otherwise... you might want to consider where and with whom you wear them."
3.0,"The fit was as expected. I'm 5ft 125lbs, and the small fit like normal leggings. My concern is that these are advertised as being opaque, but you can very clearly see through them (in the flute area). Also, I have another pair of spans leggings while look and feel like cotton. These are more spandex-y. They have a shine to them and you can see the spandex fibers when they're stretched over my legs. I'm. It sure if that's a quality issue or just a different style of fabric."
3.0,"Although I have use this product, but only for casual outing. This item I only recommend purchasing for pre-teens maybe, or children; but not for adults."
3.0,"It's beautiful,  but I broke it in the 1st month."
3.0,"Screen printed logo so not as good as some of the others available on the market. Quality seems ok on the shirt, but I've only washed it once so far."
3.0,Super tight on the boobs. (38DDD) & see thru
3.0,It is smaller than I thought it would be but I still love it
3.0,Love the bag. I had to return it since a slight tear by the handle. But I will purchase another bag of the same style.
3.0,I like the length but the dress wasnt as fitted as expected especially  around the waiste
3.0,"Good Billfold and well made. Only issue is that the material seems to be a bit grabby on the cards. I think maybe the card pockets are a little too tight and make credit cards and drivers license a bit hard to take out. Hopefully, that will loosen up with use. Other than that, Very nice billfold for the price. Would recommend to a friend."
3.0,I wear a size 10. I ordered an XL. Fits snug - so order larger than normal.The dress is basic. The neck is not snug which is odd when everything else is. Looks a bit cheap.
3.0,The top was cute. The bottoms looked cheap and were unflattering.
3.0,Smaller than what I had expected and the lining is not  attached on the inside causing the zipper to get stuck on it occasionally.
3.0,Thin & low-quality. I got a size S and it was too small for my 27 inch waist. Had high hopes for this skirt but unfortunately I will be returning.
3.0,"After reading reviews, I got a size up. Mistake. I am usually between a L and XL. I’m am 6ft 220lbs. Most of my upper body mass is in my arms, back and chest. I have a flat stomach. The XL sleeves go almost to elbows and the shirt looks loose and frumpy. If you are an in-shape muscular guy I would buy a size down."
3.0,"The glasses seem to be of a quality commensurate with their price, but when seen in-person they are too large and square as to be of the aviator style used to describe them.  The aviators that these are said to be like are smaller and more rectangular in shape --- but the seller did provide measurements in the listing and I probably should have found some known to be of the style that I prefer and compared their dimensions to these before buying.  I'm not enthused with the purchase, but I do have to own some of the responsibility for it."
3.0,"Bought these leggings having seen other reviews mentioning they support the tummy, they have a hold to them, etc. id give these leggings 5 stars for being buttery soft, but as a plus sized girl there is not much hold, and no tummy support like others mentioned. They are fairly opaque, but not completely. I will still absolutely wear these, but not out of the house. Will write an update after a couple of washes to see how they hold up"
3.0,I like the style and fit. The material is a nice light weight. They are a thin material that pills after a couple wears. Good for wearing at home. The material will not hold up well. That said I do like them for that extra light layer at home or going to the grocery store.
3.0,Mine are very different in size. The warmers underneath slide around lots
3.0,"This arrived to me with one bead broken off. Despite the poor packaging, it is a nice bracelet. I was looking for real wooden beads which i believe these are. The color is nice as well."
3.0,"Thin rough cotton, no pockets."
3.0,Would have like much better off brim of hat was stiffer to withstand a little wind
3.0,I ordered this necklaceOn June 25th I received it on June 28.I think this necklace is very nice It has a nice gold color when it came out of a package. TOO KEEP from FADING..I painted with clear nail polish immediately!After it had dried I tried it on and it lays perfect with a little adjusting.I AnSWEREDaL the door with it on and my neighbor compliment said it was very pretty on me! :-) ...Three stars cause it's plastic.
3.0,When actually worn in person they do not look as they do in the photos. The material is spandex so it doesn't keep you warm. But they are comfortable and easier that putting something around your ears for over 8 hours a day.<br /><br />Also one of the converings looks nothing like it does in the photo displayed.
3.0,Did not realize that this was not real leather but 'pu' leather.<br />I want a real leather sling bag.
3.0,Too thin and flimsy..
3.0,"Super fast delivery and this seller rocks. I definitely recommend purchasing from them. This item is nice, but the photo is nicer than the actual item. Still, well worth the money."
3.0,"Hubby is just not keen on this holder, due to saying its to bulky, he prefers to just plain passport and leaves the holder on my bag"
3.0,Not as pretty as I thought
3.0,Love the dress but once you put it on all you hear is pop pop pop from the threads and it becomes loose.
3.0,They fit good just a little tall for my legs.
3.0,It’s way smaller than I expected.  I thought it was something else.  It’s cute.  A bit discolored on top but not a big deal.
3.0,"It is fine, and can work as a summer work skirt, but it is too long for what I hoped to use it for- as a golf skirt. I am 5’4” and it comes just below my knees."
3.0,My grandson is hard on shoes thes only last four months
3.0,These shoes are definitely made for winter. They are wool and the material is thick. They come with a second set of insoles. Comfortable for everyday use.
3.0,Showed all my 66 year old bulges<br />But very nice quality and print
3.0,You get what you pay for.  This is much prettier in the photos than in reality.  It was cheap and it shows!  Since I bought it for my 5 year old granddaughter it is fine for her to use to play dress up.  Don't think it would be attractive enough for an adult to wear with a dressy outfit however.
3.0,"One already broke, few weeks in."
3.0,"The picture with the magazine is misleading, this bag is way bigger! It will be prettier in an smaller size."
3.0,"I rated this 3 stars. I typically wear a Large, so I ordered a large. I wear a 36D bra, it fit as expected, I just wasn't digging the flowy top, it almost made me look pregnant. It wasn't right enough under the boob area my boob keep falling down."
3.0,"To be honest, the noise reduction really seems like only noise translation - Instead of peircing sound, it's kind of softer with a sort of echo.  I was hoping that the noise would just be significantly reduced.<br /><br />The only other ""Con"" for these is how they won't stay stretched out if you need to fit them on a longer/larger head - they instantly spring back down once you remove them, and they are very frustrating to hold straight while attempting to stretch them out again."
3.0,My husband was so excited about this keychain. So we were dissapointed when the first day he had it on his keys the ball came unscrewed and it was lost. So it's pointless to buy if you want to actually have it on your keyring.
3.0,It was not the meteral I thought. More silky like I thought cotton and spandex would have been a really good combination. Not sure if i like this at all
3.0,does not hit your tummy at all if you have one...but nice long shirt
3.0,The fit runs small even when ordering two sizes up
3.0,"Good for the price, but the waist was really loose on both, also didn't last long with my work outs before ripping at the thigh area."
3.0,"A little tight and there's about a half inch on the end of each finger of extra room, which is super inconvenient because now I have the cost of the gloves, plus whatever it's going to cost me in fuel and getting them tailored to fit properly. Otherwise, these just may be the coolest looking gloves I have ever owned!"
3.0,"These are tiny. I should have paid more attention to the details. They won't fit my nostril piercings. But they don't feel cheap, and they look nice. Hopefully my friend can use them."
3.0,Although the charms are very cute and good variety....we didn’t even get close to 100 (only 83 in the pack). This becomes very disappointing to the 10 year old who has a million ideas for those charms and immediately counts to see how many there are!
3.0,I love these earrings . they are so cute. however......... a couple weeks in........the ball came off. i just found it under the bed............. i am going to glue it back on. i believe i will have success. i had to take away a couple of stars cos of this. but they are really cute .
3.0,I have several Karen Scott items and have been fine with the fit.  These are rather squared off on the shoulders and they don't fall right.  I don't know how else to describe it.
3.0,The strap was listed as 49 “ what I received was 47”<br />I am only able to put buckle on last hole!
3.0,"I ordered a small and this holds me in, but barely. The straps are adjustable and it is a very minimal adjustment. I feel like I paid more for this item than it was actually worth..."
3.0,Maybe it's just me but the shorts seem to run about 1 size too small.  Had to return.  Otherwise they are nice shorts.
3.0,Okay for costume. Not as gold as the picture shows.
3.0,I bought this for my daughter to wear to a masquerade  It looks great but it is rather flemsy and the paint started chipping off.
3.0,Unfortunately the dress isn't what I expected. I won't order from them again.  Costs three times what the dress cost to send back to China.
3.0,Fits a little large.
3.0,"I consistently buy t-shirts and tanks LARGE size.  They will fit me just right to just a bit loose.  These are huge compared to most larges I've purchased in the past.  3 stars because I like the material and design.  Be forewarned about sizing though.  (I'm 5'8"", 175 lbs.)"
3.0,"Sorry, I have to return them. I have always worn a size 38 and it fit perfectly. This one was is too long and the strap will not adjust to a more narrow width."
3.0,"Look cool, very light, however, I get a weird reflection on the inside of the lense which is very distracting. Perfect for being out on the water/ not great for driving"
3.0,"I loved these shoes.  They are a great transition from bare feet to regular shoes.  Unfortunately, they were coming apart after only 3 weeks.  Good thing I bought two pair!"
3.0,"It looks weird once its on your head, its good material dont get me wrong it just looks a lot different then i expected so i was fairly dissapointed and 70 bucks for something you use once in a year its just not worth its money."
3.0,"Thought it was going to be silver, like what is pictured, but it is an ugly gold color."
3.0,It's see through and too large. But it is very comfortable and looks good.
3.0,"I'm neither impressed nor completely disappointed with this purchase. To start, the material is incredibly cheap, it's the same material as that of what Halloween costumes are made of, it's incredibly long so if you have a short torso, it looks silly. With that said, if you're between sizes, you're kind of screwed. The larger size is too big, the smaller size is too small, so you'll have to decide whether to look like a sausage or sag in all the wrong places. Needless to say, I'm returning the dress."
3.0,I ordered this with the cream lace on the bottom. I selected this seller (even though it cost more) because they had more color options but I ended up getting the product with pink lace. Dissapointed the product was not as advertised. Apart from that it's decent quality and fits well.
3.0,"The dress color and pattern were exactly as pictured, which was great because it was ridiculously cute. Unfortunately, the material was fairly thin, a little rough, smelled like band-aids, and the fit was bad. I went by the sizing chart, but should have ordered 1-2  sizes down. The underarm was closer to my elbow than underarm, So I feel like if I went down two sizes, the dress would fit better, but be incredibly short. It wasn’t flattering at all and I was so disappointed. But, I guess you can’t win them all."
3.0,Love the color but both pieces ran small.  The material was thicker than I expected as well.  I should have returned but with intimate wear I didn’t feel comfortable doing that.  Size up if you want to give it a try.
3.0,"if the cut of this skirt didn't make me look like a box, I'd love it for the price (the blue color is dreamy!) I think it'd flatter a straighter figure best.The fabric itself is fine for the price, obviously doesn't feel luxurious, kinda crinkly. I wish I had sized down, the waist is huge!<br />height-5'6<br />waist-23&#34;<br />hips-35&#34;"
3.0,I liked it but it is a little thin so it’s easily  bendable but for the price overall it’s a nice  charm
3.0,"I bought 2 of these ties: moss green and navy.  Both look very nice and I've worn them multiple times and gotten compliments on them.  Not too matte, not too shiny, just right.  Good feel and good moderate texture.  Thick but not overly bulky and they take a decent dimple.  The moss green is a bit more like the color you would expect from the seller image (between a kelly green and a dark green, very distinguished and nice shade).  The navy is obviously blue but very deep and rich.  I like the shade quite a bit.<br /><br />Now, all of that said, I wish the tie were a tad longer or the area you're supposed to have under your collar were a bit further towards the end of the back blade.  I've found that I have to fiddle with the length and pull rather tightly to get a nice sized knot with an appropriate length on the front blade (I'm not particularly tall either at 5'-10&#34; with a normally proportioned torso).  Still, it's doable and I like it just fine.  I just have to either have extra time to fidget with the length or pull my chinos higher than I would like (not quite grandpa territory, but edging in on it).  Could be a problem with jeans that sit on your hips but I haven't worn either with jeans yet.  I also wish the tag on the back blade were smaller or stitched down on the top and bottom of the tag so as to make undoing the tie a bit easier.<br /><br />In short, buy these if you want to try out knit ties without much expense/risk.  They will definitely look nice, wear well, and feel good and will certainly get you compliments.  Just be aware that you will likely have to spend more time getting your look &#34;right&#34; for your torso and don't expect it to be a $50-100 tie and you'll be all set!"
3.0,pretty decent for the price - but pretty paper thin
3.0,"I have some H2H long-sleeve, button-up shirts and LOVE them and those are truly ""slim fit"". H2H makes some great stuff and this polo shirt is nice, but how they think they can call this ""slim fit"" I have no idea. Slim fit for fat people maybe? :))"
3.0,Too big. Had to return it
3.0,Very Small Amount if you dont know how much 2 Ounces is.  Its a little bit too salty and dry for me compaired to home made venison jerky I have had before.  Cant really taste the difference in this and beef jerky.
3.0,I liked them but there were too many duplicate ones. More original ones please
3.0,Valentine’s Day gift
3.0,A little smaller in waist than expected.
3.0,Runs smaller and fabric is not too great
3.0,Decent product for the price. I'm not sure I can expect too long of a life from the zipper.
3.0,"The slip for the cleavage went WAY to low. It went down to my belly button. The quality was nice, but would have definitely needed to get it altered."
3.0,"Beautiful ring, however, the stones fall out way too easily and its very noticeable."
3.0,"These are colorful but they are far from fuzzy and don’t fit quite right. They  are too small. I half expected this when I bought them due to the price, but I was disappointed to find that they’re not even soft. I cannot recommend this product."
3.0,Great for lounging at home but material is very thin and makes it hard to wear it outside your home.
3.0,"the material seemed to be good quality .I purchased for great granddaughter as gift ,so am unsure as of the fit .However I saw no problem with product ."
3.0,Cute top true to size
3.0,"This ring is unique and can go with anything. It is larger than I thought it would be but still very cute. Of note, this one ring—not a pack of 2."
3.0,"too tide on the shoulders, fabric ...just cheap"
3.0,"Love the necklace shape however, not so crazy over the color I picked. The mint green looks very cloudy in the jewels, not a fan"
3.0,Within the first week the zipper lost some teeth. We kept using it but last week the zipper completely fell off. Little over a month of use. If it wasn’t for that it was very nice.
3.0,"Loved the shape, size, weight and feel of the frame and the way they looked on but.......each time I wore them I felt kinda sick.  I was looking out over water and finally figured out why.  They made water look 3D but like when you look at something with movie theater 3D glasses that isn't 3D.  I had my daughter put them on and she was the one who finally figured that out.  I just kept saying it makes certain things look weird.  Anyway, I'm returning them.  I hope I just had a pair that was manufactured wrong because I really liked them."
3.0,"I like the look of these. White stitching and buckles are nice. Outside leather is buttery soft. Stitching on fingers and lining alignment seem fine. But lining is scratchy. Also, I ordered these as a gift and they just came in a plastic bag. I am now typing this wearing the glove to test the technology tips. I am amazed that this leather works on a touchscreen but it does. I hope the recipient liked these."
3.0,"This shirt's very comfortable, otherwise I'd return it. I ordered a medium (based on measurements), but sizing is closer to a L-XL."
3.0,I love these but they tend to get loose after a few months i had them for about 6 months and can safely say that they are good but not the best. They did kindda disintegrate at the rubber tips because of not being very durable. With this the sunglasses kind of sit on your chest kind of higher than your used to but it makes good sense to have them there as they stay clear of everything and everyone and safe to say haven't got any scratches on them for two years now. i am currently on my third pair of these and use them on my Costa permits 580G. The only hindrance is when u really go to hug some one they kindda dig into your chest. Besides that they are alright.
3.0,Brought large they too big for me  bout they good panties next time am try to place a next order i will get size M God willing
3.0,"Slightly more transparent in certain lighting than I had hoped, but bathing suit or proper undergarment makes it acceptable. Very comfortable, that's why I ordered a second one!  A perfect at home dress.<br />If I could improve it, the stripes would be vertical rather than horizontal. No one looks their best in horizontal stripes and no matter how off the shoulder you where it, the horizontal effect is still there!  Arrived sooner than expected."
3.0,Smaller than described.
3.0,DON'T DRY IT IT'LL SHRINK. IT'S 100% COTTON. A LITTLE SCRATCHY AT FIRST TOO.
3.0,It is not an oblong scarf. It has a tie and that was not in the description. Otherwise the color is lovely and the material is very nice. If you like the style and function of a tie back then you should be very happy with this hijab.
3.0,Disappointed in the product in that the arms are cut larger than normal and it is see through and needs a tank underneath.  It is an uncomfortable fit
3.0,Keep in mind you get what you're paying for. The set I have have started to chip after wearing for a few weeks.
3.0,Longer than I thought. Fits my 3 year old.
3.0,It’s working good but it is not the best.
3.0,The bra are very nice and good quality. However. The cup sizing seems off. I ordered C cup and it was way too large with gapping and wrinkling- I always wear a c cup - so not sure why the big difference. I returned items due to sizing.
3.0,"I am a 36c size 10 and 5'1. I order a large, it was way too big. The straps were soo long. Its a very cute swimwear. I think i would of been good with a small or medium. There are no linings. I am going to sew the suit in myself so it will fit better. But i can wear these with high wasted shorts and would look sooo cute."
3.0,"Overall, they’re incredibly warm and comfortable.  My only complaint is that they are a little sheer in the booty and they PILL SO BAD WHEN WASHED.  The little fuzz balls it creates don’t even come off with a sticky roller you have to pull them off.  So soft comfy and warm but annoying as hell with the fuzzies."
3.0,"Leather on black belt was much stiffer than the brown belt recd at the same time. I think the brown belt end  will be more likely to flop around, especially if a belt loop is not in the right spot. I prefer the quality of the black over the brown. Appreciate that these are made in USA"
3.0,You get what you pay for. They're just ok.
3.0,Nice color. Quality. It is very stiff...hoping it softens
3.0,I found the masks to be too small for me. Gave them away.
3.0,"Cute, but a little bit larger than expected"
3.0,The bust was bigger than I antisipated. Very nice swim suit and very sturdy yet soft material.
3.0,Color is not same as show on screen
3.0,Fades quick .
3.0,The color was great and so was the material. It was hard to zip open and closed with the bag on my shoulder. If that doesn't matter to you then the bag is good for you.
3.0,has to be altered.
3.0,"They are sized a bit small and short, not unwearable though."
3.0,"Eh. Just realize that you get what you pay for. Three of them broke either immediately after putting them on or within one wear. They definitely are trendy and cute, but flimsy and the clasps and how the chokers are made are not reliable. If you want them to last a while and endure wear and tear, I wouldn't bother."
3.0,"5'8&#34; 145-150 lbs. average build. Got a medium. It was fine, but could have easily fit a small. The romper looked baggy. Didn't help there was this weird extra flap of material on the side of the thighs. Didn't notice it in the pictures. goos material. Not sheer at all. Very deep plunge and the bagginess let you see all the way down it. Returned it"
3.0,They don't stick and fall of if they don't have any support!
3.0,Very large but I altered them to fit. Very cute
3.0,great for diy
3.0,Fit smaller than expected and very thin.
3.0,Sin muy pequeños no me sirvieron
3.0,Thin material<br />Tight in chest<br />Just didn't enjoy this dress at all
3.0,Quality lower than expected for price. Very uncomfortable. Cool concept poor execution
3.0,"Excellent quality fleece leggings (not too thick, not too thin).  Sadly, they run very small.  Perhaps by 2 sizes. I bought a size larger b/c daughter needs to wear thin long underwear underneath, but she could hardly get them on - w/o the long underwear AND before washing!  Daughter is 10 yrs and I bought size LARGE.  Wish they came in XL.  P.S.  Purple is a dark royal hue, not a bright purple which my screen looks like."
3.0,Upon trying on and adjusting buckle the piece that hold strap fell off. Otherwise shoe was nice
3.0,"I thought the size was okay, but when it came, it had the WORST smell. I had to stick fabric softener sheets inside to get rid of it... and even then, it only really went away after a week or two of use. I didn't like the bag handles, since they were harsh, so I manually removed them and only use the longer strap now. On the bright side, this bag looks more expensive than it was. It makes a nice addition to any outfit."
3.0,"loved the design on these socks, deadlifts are my favorite and I love skulls Well, they look good but they were sooooooooooo tight I could hardly get them up. I'm a powerlifter and my calves are big, but not that big! They were difficult to even get over my foot! Shame, because they look bad ass :(  Never have had a problem with socks ever before."
3.0,The jacket is cute but in my opinion it’s not worth what they are charging you.
3.0,"I am technically an XL in these socks, but THIS pair is really really large! Compared to the other XL's I purchased, this pair has extra rows of knit which make them hang off my toes.  I sat on these too long to be able to return them, which is too bad, because I really need a size L in this pair.  Oh well.. wash and dry them A LOT maybe?"
3.0,"Excellent craftsmanship, but it's design inherently makes the sleek empty wallet grow like a pufferfish once cards are stacked into the slots.  Adding only 8 cards, made it expand to 3/4"" thick with the snap strap keeping it from expanding even further.<br />If however organized easy access to any specific card is important to you, then this one deserves consideration.  What is very attractive in the minimal-ish wallet is the zipper pocket - non-clunky when not in use, yet available to carry your other essentials such as coins, medications, breath strips, etc.<br />The other nice feature was the top inside slot goes the full depth, not limited to card depth.  This is great for slipping in cash folded only one, instead of twice like required by most minimalist wallet!<br />I personally prefer compact over card organization so this little pufferfish was returned without any problem.  Great seller."
3.0,Pants too small and very thin. If  you wear while it is cold will need a long coat.
3.0,"Not too sure about this watch. Don't really like the Leopard Band but with no invoice, I couldn't send it back for a refund or credit."
3.0,"Look great in the picture and also in person...except for the fact that it really is about 1/2 inch thick.  Good news is you will need to use less weigh to sink to the bottom when you scuba with this baby as it has real heft....  Once the handles get into the area of the digital display, as in between 4:25 and 7:35 the analog hands hide the digital display which, by the way, has really, really, really, small font.  But I have a different tough solar I love.  Like a beautiful woman or a handsome man...good idea to live spend some time with this honey.  I did not send it back, it doubles as a ""brass knuckle.'"
3.0,Nice but not like the first purchase. Only ok and I'm disappointed.
3.0,Very nice but if you have a big wrist they run small
3.0,"The sweat shirt is cute but very short. Strictly for show, not for warmth."
3.0,Bought for my husbands wedding ring.  He has lost weight and his ring keeps falling off.  This is not really designed for wide bands.  He ended up not using this.
3.0,"These fit like children's socks.  I had a really hard time getting them on, and they cut into my ankles because the band at the top is smaller than the sleeve of the sock.  Warm enough, but not comfortable!  Would be fine for an adult who wore a size 6 shoe or smaller."
3.0,"It's not bad, fabric isn't what I thought it was going to be. For the price it's not bad I guess"
3.0,Fits a little bigger than expected. Thin linen. Simple and functional design. It came with a very bad smell like it had been in a moist storage over decades. Had it express delivered to the hotel to use in a meeting..couldn't use it.
3.0,I bought it for my wife as a side gift.  She likes it but hasn't worn it yet. It really  feels very cheap.  You get what you pay for
3.0,"They fit great, but they have this awkward gasoline smell. So, I have used them a total of three times in two years."
3.0,don't get this the rubber bands break very easily and when i got it the bands were everywhere
3.0,They really do not stay on as a cuff and I had to wear them as basic earring so they lost a little bit of the appeal.
3.0,The seams are already starting to fray. Otherwise good product
3.0,"The material on these is a light weight athletic, feels similar to girls running shorts.  I am 5'9"" 180lbs (female) and these fit me comfortably in the waist.  My guy, he doesn't care for the cut or feel of them.  For me they are a bit long but for around the house, working in the yard etc not bad.  I would suggest buying at least a size up for guys.  I washed / dried with other athletic gear and had no shrinking or discoloration."
3.0,It was beautifully made but...Not large enough for iPad series 2
3.0,"I received the wrong style suit.  They sent the correct size, but the bottoms are too snug in the waist and the top is too big."
3.0,So cute I am keeping it the fabric is fabulous but I order medium the labels says XL and it is still a bit tight and short!!!!!!!!!  Looking for the same but better. I am 5 4 118lbs????
3.0,Made kinda cheap
3.0,"The product was good, and just what I'd hoped for.  I just didn't realize when I ordered it that it was being shipped from overseas, and would take more than a month to get to me, which was longer than the time frame I needed for a project to get done."
3.0,They do not stay on my feet well at the heels.
3.0,Very cute and feels nice.. but not compression at all
3.0,"This a large (but not huge), handsome timepiece that for me suffered a little in design. The look is Submariner with a bright, stainless steel case -- really bright against the contrasting black bezel and watch face. It kept time perfectly for the four days I wore it round the clock. The strap fit my just-over-7-inch wrist comfortably. And despite looking at it a few hundred times, I never got to where I could tell the time at a glance! There's just too much, too brightly going on there. I think the biggest issue is that the wide tips on the hour and minute hands are roughly the same size and color as the large dots marking the hours.<br /><br />I liked the looks of this thing. But being able to tell time at a glance seems an important point for an analog watch. I returned it."
3.0,"Very cute, but was smaller than other clothes similar sized."
3.0,Could see right thru it!
3.0,Cute but poor quality and it doesn't fit right
3.0,"Very pretty. Deep purple, gold hardware. Not for rough handed women. Very dainty.  Not for a lot of stuff to be put in it. I will use it for church only."
3.0,"This piece is as cute as the picture and very close to the same size.  It's very light weight - more of a costume jewelry piece; there's no heft to it.  This is OK for me as that is what I wanted but don't expect this to impress as a gift.<br /><br />Functionally, there isn't an indentation for your thumbnail making it difficult to open.  I bought it at the ""sale"" price and would have been very disappointed if I paid what is claimed to be the list/retail price of $50.<br /><br />The description says this is ""sterling silver"" and stamped ""925"" but I didn't find these markings on this piece itself.  The ""925"" stamp is on the clip/hook that accomodates your chain as opposed to the pendant itself."
3.0,The dress was way too small - I had to send it back. :(
3.0,The dress did not fit well in the bust.
3.0,Ordered a 5t for my daughter who's in 5t. It firs like 2 sizes too big. Im going to have it taken in because there is no time for me to exchange it.
3.0,I was expecting these to be true puffs. They ended up being a section cut from a boa and coiled up then glued onto a felt pad. Price was very low so I figured I'd try them out.
3.0,It does not fit perfectly.
3.0,"Needs an insole probably.  The heel of the should has plastic &#34;framing&#34; under the insole, which is cut.  You will feel your heel digging into this frame within a few hours of wearing.  Hoping a sturdy insole fixes this."
3.0,The color was beautiful and I really liked the length. Its is not for busty women. I had to tug the top portion down all day.
3.0,"Cheep, simple, thin scarf that works well tied many ways. Pairs well with many of my blouses, sweaters and tops."
3.0,Tight in the nose and not a good fit for me personally
3.0,My sister loves it! Its smaller than I thought and the chain it came on was kinda stupid. lol
3.0,"Great size, but to thin. I didn't read the fine print. No worries. I will still wear them."
3.0,It was rather slim fitting
3.0,Good quality but way too small.
3.0,"I like the bag enough to keep it, but was disappointed that the bag is not red. Judging from the photo, I thought I was purchasing a red bag, but it is called 'Ginger' which is more of a cognac or burnt orange color. It looks nothing like the photo. All in all the quality of the bag is classic Dooney."
3.0,"The look is nice, but the fit is loose and its almost like walking barefoot on hard pavement."
3.0,Not a good fit. Material was a bit flimsy.
3.0,This item runs small
3.0,This necklace had a defective chain and fell right off into my hand. I was so happy that I hadn't given it to my autistic Granddaughter yet because it is a choking hazard in her hands. But it was so pretty and she loves unicorns and carousels.
3.0,"It’s just the glow lights, batter pack, and attachments.  Nothing else.  I bought the black clothes, but the lights and the attachments are awkward and won’t stay on.  My son really wanted to wear this for Halloween, but we sent it back bc we knew it would come apart all night."
3.0,Strap does not stretch.
3.0,"I wanted to like this, really! I mostly liked the top half of the dress; I thought the cuffs were not so attractive, being kind of long. But the skirt material was what made me return it. It's stretchy but stiff fabric that I fear may require constant ironing since the dress was pretty wrinkled coming out of the package. I guess I was expecting something a little more drapey."
3.0,I wish the stones were the same color as the picture. The ones I got are much lighter than the ones displayed here.
3.0,The band is very small. I would go up a size but I definitely love the bra. Will be exchanging.
3.0,Its cheaply made but what do you expect for 4 bucks! My 13 yr old liked it and thats all that mattered.
3.0,"If you wear a typical helmet for skiing, these will leave your forehead exposed and frozen. Otherwise they work just fine. I can’t speak to durability as I haven’t worn them much.<br /><br />Update: works fairly well with a half shell motorcycle helmet on days when you want less wind-related drying of the eyes."
3.0,good  for 1 use
3.0,The fit was perfect and it was okay-ish but had to return it because it came with broken belt.
3.0,These look ridiculous on me. The low crotch and the baggy waist are not good on a bigger girl like me. I will be returning them.
3.0,"Fits well but I expected a sweatshirt or jersey, this reminds me of swimsuit material.  Smith, cool, thin."
3.0,Nice shirt runs very small
3.0,"Cute hat, but the bill has a scratch in it."
3.0,Runs very small.  I'd order 2 sizes up.
3.0,I loved the weight of this skirt and it’s unusual cut.  What I didn’t enjoy in in the light gray you need to be conscious of what color underwear you have on because you can see through the skirt.
3.0,"It's ok. Nothing special. It's very loose and drapey, so if you're looking for that style, I'd say it fits true to size. Size down if you're looking for something more form fitting. It's also longer than I thought, but not quite long enough to wear with leggings (it doesn't cover my bottom and I'm 5'7)."
3.0,"These are considerably thinner and more rigid than other brands of similar luggage tags. The manufacturer describes the material as flexible and ""jelly-like"", this is not accurate.<br /><br />The edges are pressed/melted together, as opposed to other brands that are much more pliable and molded from a single piece of material, with no seams.<br /><br />Compared to similar style tags I've previously purchased from other manufacturers, these do not seem nearly aus well made or durable and do not seem like they will last. Sending them back for a refund."
3.0,"Muy bonitos pero se ponen feos de una vez, no vale la pena para el precio."
3.0,I had told my daughter she was getting this in the mail soon so she was excited asking me everyday if it arrived only for her to open it up and see that they sent the wrong name. Such a disappointment! In their own listing they mention people getting the wrong name  and in their other listing for the same item there’s quite a few reviewers that also got the wrong name. I’m giving it three stars because although it’s the wrong name it’s really cute. Good quality for the price and perfect length and nameplate size. It also comes in a cute packaging with the matching personalized name. I’m not sure if I would order from them  I wouldn’t want to get the wrong name again.
3.0,Chinese sizing. A 3x is an xL
3.0,"Good traveling shoes bag but if u wear a sz 10 or above it is not what u looking for bc I have a sz 10 jodan and it fit so tight in there , 9.5 is the largest sz that the bag will fit perfectly."
3.0,I had to remove 2 links because it was to big. Then when I would wear it the clasp would come undone and my watch would fall off. I fell like I wasted my money
3.0,They are long enough for my foot but the are too wide and don’t keep my feet in place. My foot ends up sliding forward. Not sure yet if I’m going to keep them. They are comfortable in the foot bed.
3.0,"I was looking for something with a little more substance to it.  This is nice, just not exactly what I was after."
3.0,Not as  nice as the picture to be honest. Looks a little on the cheap side. It is just ok.
3.0,I love the feel of this skirt. The problem is that the second time I washed it the string started to unravel. Very frustrating since my return date has already passed. Not sure I will be able to repair it so it is money lost for me. Review written by Mrs. Hornick
3.0,I like the style and work 1000% on my face.<br />I am buying them again but I bet there must be better glasses I should use since the glasses dont even fill the whole frame and there's gaps in either side that must make them dangerous to wear since sun can get thru and it must make them look cheap from the side. Wish wish wish they would fit the frame. For these unsafe reasons I am knocking it down to some stars.
3.0,"I am 5'9"" and the sleeves were way too short!"
3.0,zippers stick
3.0,"I bought this for a man, and when I tried it on, I could barely scrunch the hat over my head.  I'm female, 5'3&#34;, 125# average head size!  The beard doesn't wrap around your chin either, it lays just on the jaw line.  It's not a cheap hat, so I'm disappointed it's not made better than it is."
3.0,It fits but is not loose and flowing. Too clingy to wear with leggings
3.0,"I have a shoulder bag with the same design and i loved that bag, so i decided to go for this lunch box since i bring lunch to work almost daily, i have to say that the advertisement for this is a lie, yes, it's very pretty and stylish, but not what i expected, i have a lot of trouble putting my lunch inside since is very, very compact. The picture shows a sandwich and a water bottle inside, you can barely put your sandwich in it.. that water bottle must be super tiny."
3.0,"As far as the quality, this jersey is great. Keep in mind that the sizes are in men’s (which makes no sense considering it says “Lola” on the back). I am a very small petite girl and thought maybe i could make a small work. It’s a lot larger than i expected."
3.0,it was nice necklace just didnt fit around my neck.
3.0,"The band is very attractive, but beware. The magnets are weak and the strap is easily separated by shirt sleeves and rapid arm motion."
3.0,"Fit is nice, looks good. But the metal buckles stick out a lot. To far for me. Had to return."
3.0,Nice but tangles all the time
3.0,Bought a bigger size based off the reviews and ended up buying it too big. Beautiful color and made well.
3.0,the pink one got dirty and shows dirt really bad within like a week :(
3.0,Cute idea but uncomfortable towear
3.0,"I like these shoes! They are great for just slipping on and they look cute. They do run a little small, I typically fit a 7.5 and sized up to an 8 and they fit perfect. They are super wide, so if you have a narrow foot watch out for that! I will say they are not the most comfortable shoe. They don’t offer much arch support.<br />These are a great price if you’re interested in the Mohinders style shoe but not sure if you want to take the jump on that price!<br /><br />Had to update my review of these after wearing them a few days. These shoes squeak SO LOUD and SO MUCH! I do like them but hate how loud they are"
3.0,they are long enough but the straps are a little tight
3.0,Had to return. They were at least 2 sizes too big
3.0,I liked the items I had perchased but the colors were not what I had paid for.
3.0,"Color is lighter than the picture which made me buy to match a pendant, yet they look very nice together for an evening out...can't wait."
3.0,"It's attractive, very comfortable, but it gets  bigger every time you put it on and take it off. Eventually, you won't be able to adjust it to fit properly."
3.0,This top is cute and fit as I expected but I just don't like the material of the middle part. It's a kind of shiny stretchy material whereas the sleeves r a stretchy cotton material which I would of preferred but still cute. Also would recommend going a size up if u happen to be more on the curvy side like myself.
3.0,I really like them but they’re baggy for someone with a 29” waist...
3.0,"Beautiful pendant design, and great shape was so excited when it came but instantly disappointed chain color wasn't blue, it was a white rusty, fragile chain that I had to replace with a better one."
3.0,Looks cute but slides around a lot
3.0,"This runs maybe a size small. I bought the black/leopard print one and it was super cute, but I had to return it."
3.0,Ordered these in the large (which is usually my size) and they were too small.  Plus I decided that in reality the print was a bit busy for me so returned them.
3.0,It's a great product  it looks good on my face<br />but the lens popped out and don't fits anymore.
3.0,See through af
3.0,"The overall style of the dress was nice. I have a longer torso and shorter legs, so it isn't incredibly flattering on me (by no fault of the dress). I am disappointed by the sleeves and the color. The picture is VERY misleading. I intended this dress to be my rehearsal dress for my burgundy wedding this winter, and even though I ordered the wine red with three-quarter sleeves, the dress I received was REALLY BRIGHT RED and half sleeved. I might hang on to it for a Christmas dress, but feel like I'll be returning it."
3.0,Band width was skinner than it looks on the picture which makes the watch face look bulky. There was also not a tight enough notch for my wrist which made the face slide sideways on my wrist.
3.0,I was expecting for something more elegant and slim fitting but the it felt more like a Halloween costume. The color was a little darker than expected.
3.0,"[[ASIN:B01MA20L7Z MIUSOL Women's Retro V Neck Cap Sleeve 1950'S Cocktail Evening Swing Dress (Small, Purple)]]<br /><br />Style and fit are great, but I wanted a purple dress, and this was not purple.  It was almost exactly the same color as another dress I purchased recently labeled as Magenta; definitely too pink to be called purple.<br /><br />I normally wear size 6/Small in dresses, and the Small fit great.<br /><br />I had to return it."
3.0,It is a beautiful shirt but runs really small. I may have to go back and get a larger size.
3.0,For the price and my use it is OK.  As a beginning player this is a good starter Ukulele strap.
3.0,"The buckle is to big to feed through pant belt loops.  Other than that, very cool!"
3.0,Not happy with the fit.
3.0,"Chain itself is fine, links are sturdy enough as is the clasp, However the circular link holding the clasp's oval link to the chain links is garbage and is easily pulled apart. So I removed those and used regular key chain rings to attach the clasp rings to the chain. Now it is a stronger 'security' chain for a biker wallet . note none of the links are welded together so its still possible to pull them out but with great effort, so a pick pocket snatch and grab would most likely be stopped. The 3 silver hooks for keys are useless too. Still for the price and a little adaptation it works fine, and is a good length."
3.0,Very thin material very poor quality I thought Amazon would have better merchandise otherwise it is cute
3.0,I was drawn to the Amazonite however what arrived is a solid color turquoise. I’m disappointed in that regard. It does seem to be very well tied however but I am debating returning it
3.0,I dislike it.Looks quite smaller.
3.0,Yes on my trip
3.0,I ordered those twice over a course of two or three years.  And the screw on the end pieces/hinge  keeps getting loose and tries to pop out.  I have to screw it back in continually but it won't hold.  The temple on the right side tend to go loose.  For all of my eyeglasses from this product and supplier.<br /><br />Those are nice glasses and the lens quality is good even it they are plastic.  But I am very annoyed having to screw back in the screws and also from having lost them and the temples totally separate.  I sadly will move on and order a different product from another supplier.
3.0,"Items runs small. Couldn’t make it work, had to send it back."
3.0,The bow is not attached!  It's just a sash you have to tie yourself.  Not what I expected.  The dress is very plain.  Had to return. Not at all what I was looking for.
3.0,Medium look just like a large
3.0,"I really like the style of this ring, but when I tried to put it on a finger it needed to expand to fit, it actually cut off the circulation lol. So, I think I'll use it as a pendant instead."
3.0,"When I first saw this, I too thought it was such a wonderful idea! I was also greatly disappointed in finding out only $20.00 of my dollars would be going to the fund-that's not even half of what I paid.  I'm with the other reviewer when she says ""Where does the rest of the $$ go?  It's better to give directly so that MORE OF YOUR DOLLARS GO WHERE THEY ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED!!""  Amen."
3.0,Cute crop sweater but the design was weird. Stitches were outside when it should be inside.
3.0,This is made beautifully it looks exactly as it does in the picture although it is bigger than I thought it would be.
3.0,great material.  huge.
3.0,"Nice dress. I am 5'3 And weigh 140 lbs. I ordered a large. The top part fit really nice, just didn't realize how big the skirt part was. It did come very, very wrinkled and seems like the only way to get the wrinkles out without ironing for hours is to send it to the cleaners."
3.0,I love them but they break to easily! Worht the prive though and would buy over and over again!
3.0,It’s definitely for someone with a smaller face. It didn’t fit me so I ended up giving it to a friend. It’s put together pretty good but idk how much abuse it could go through.
3.0,Necklace chain came broken. The lobster clasp of the necklace was broken too. The necklace pendant is the only thing in good condition.
3.0,The type of material wasnt what I was expecting.
3.0,Pants were very short
3.0,Didn’t realize they were the real small ones
3.0,Good my son loves them
3.0,I like these socks but I never seem to get the same fit and same thickness of sock from darn tough. This was my 6th or 7th pair. When they fit right they can’t be beat. However I’m through “hoping” they will be the ultra light material I like and winding up disappointed. They confuse the hell out of me with their marketing. I’ll “darned” if I ever buy another pair. Going to a different brand that knows how to be consistent.
3.0,"I've only tried them on, haven't worn them anywhere yet but the jeans seem ok quality. I did have an issue with the button hole being sewn too small so had to snip that a little. Also they should definitely be described as &#34;skinny&#34; instead of &#34;slim&#34;. I usually wear Levis 511 slim and they fit snug on the thighs and looser on the calves. These were snug and looked painted on all the way to my ankles."
3.0,Smaller than anticipated. Will temporarily serve the purpose but key chain quality is lacking. I don't expect this to last without falling apart.
3.0,I normally wear size large.  Fits like xl
3.0,"I like the style of the jacket and the fit is good.  I wish the khaki color was more like the picture shows, but the material is a bit smoother and it’s more of a camel color,"
3.0,Mix of magnetic and non-magnetic stays.  Only the smallest in the package were magnetic.  Only a few stainless steels are magnetic.  Why this item shows as commonly purchased with magnets is misleading.  Probably perpetuated by buyers making this mistake like me!
3.0,It's the price you pay for and does the job until my eyes catch something better.
3.0,It is small. Maybe would fit a really really little kid's head. My daughter is a small 3yo (25th percentile on growth charts). It is too small for her head and her short but full tight curly hair
3.0,Material rather rough
3.0,So cute but the top was too loose.(needed tighter elastic.  The bottom part fit well. If in would have gone down a size for the tops the pants section wouldn’t fit. It looked nice on but the top would not stay up if I moved.
3.0,"This was pretty cheaply made,?I returned my wife’s!"
3.0,The woman shirt was a little snug but overall they were eye soarers
3.0,"Cool looking , but rather uncomfortable."
3.0,Little too light / see through and not as soft as I had hoped but it is acceptable for workout clothing.
3.0,Its well constructed and looks good etc. It works well until someone breaths near it and the whole thing falls over! You could push this thing over just by dropping a feather next to it. The slightest breeze and over it goes. Ended up buying a $140 weight base for it! Why not include a weighted base with it?? Nearly 2 stars for misleading advertising.
3.0,"These are very soft so if you're after comfort then these are for you. They are thin, though, so if you're wanting leggings that hold you in or are slimming then these aren't the best. They show your panty line and cellulite they're so thin."
3.0,A little tight but is fine can be adjusted
3.0,It is a little noisy.  Could not put it in my bed room.
3.0,The flag in not a clear picture.
3.0,It feels a little snug and clings on the back.
3.0,"I liked the look but it's a bit too small for my frame.  I like the design and option with drawstrings.  If I purchased again, I'd buy a larger size."
3.0,"I bought this a few weeks ago and LOVE the meaning & the look, the problem is the design. After a couple hours of wear, the necklace is all twisted up with itself. It doesn't take much to straighten it out, its just having to do so, so often, becomes annoying, and if you don't it simply looks cheap & not so pretty. Other than that, which is kind of big, I love it."
3.0,Brief package came opened and missing 1 brief.
3.0,"Way smaller than it should have been 2x was ordered for my boyfriend, ended up going to my eleven year old boy."
3.0,"After being laundered only 7 times, the elastic is pulling apart in the waist band.  They are very pretty when you first get them, but don't look nearly as good after washing, unless you iron them.  I am disappointed with them.  Amazon will not refund the total purchase price, if you don't return them unused,  within a month.  I am trying to contact C&C Lifestyle but was given the wrong e-mail address."
3.0,Was a little less pink and more coral than I was wanting to match the dress I wanted it to go with
3.0,"Not American sized XL, large at best"
3.0,Nice pijama and comfortable too
3.0,"Decent product. It’s small and compact. Though very difficult to remove cards from the wallet and this becomes extremely inconvenient. I’ve had similar wallets in the past that were better. Also, the threading started becoming loose after about 2 months of use"
3.0,I'm not giving 5 stars because after first use it was kind of falling apart. The fabric and style is very nice though.
3.0,The stone is lovely but the whole thing is very large and quite heavy. Not very practical for casual wear.
3.0,Cute but a little shorter
3.0,"I expected a little more from this strap. Although the strap material is durable and aesthetically pleasing to look at the plastic hardware is probably usable for long periods of time, but at this price point I was expecting at least aluminum or  something of quality. It's a basic strap with an overpriced tag and if you're looking for something more quality then DSPTCH straps aren't for you. I'd personally price this strap at $25-$30."
3.0,This suit runs a size smaller so go up one size
3.0,"Loose , 2in hitch bar."
3.0,"I purchased two of these coats one for my grand and the other for  me.  Both were too small and my coat fits my grand perfectly which tells you how bad the sizing is.  My grand is at least 10 sizes smaller.  I began the process to return one of the coats but the postage was not worth returning the coat.  So, with my sewing/design skills I made both coats as one for my grand.  Worn with a belt it's fabulous.  Also, I ordered navy for one of the coats and I received gray.  I will not be ordering from this manufacturer again."
3.0,"Very thin ribbon it’s connected to, and a very small bow tie, but it’s adjustable and looks like giraffe print even printed poorly on cotton fabric. I’m glad I just wore it for one wedding."
3.0,"la tela no estira lo suficiente en la piernas, es de tiro demasiado largo y queda ancho en el tronco"
3.0,The supplier sent a size bigger than I had ordered. Otherwise I have worn Sloggis for years and love them.
3.0,"The plugs are very thin and do not look good in my ears. Could be cute in earlobes in thinner earlobes, but don't look good in mine. I also got one pair that was two different sizes."
3.0,"The picture of this hat looks nicer then the actual hat, also the word Retired the ""D"" is mostly missing!"
3.0,Todo bien hasta que tenia que cerrar el cierre de mis pechos  😑
3.0,Haven't wore them praise yet but don't let the size Goode fool you. Find the size that fits your dimensions and then order the next size bigger.  Although they fit there is no extra give. Looks to be good quality and solid manufacturing
3.0,Chain needs to be longer so it hangs better on a rear view mirror
3.0,"Decent tool, but a little overpriced."
3.0,"They’re not really compression shorts, they’re more like tights. I’m not disappointed in the product, I just expected more. I have a size bigger in a different brand and they fit tighter than these."
3.0,It's cute but not for an adult.
3.0,"It’s a cute bag until you notice all the errors on it. I received this as a gift and thought it was a great bag but then noticed Jane Austen is spelled Jane Auston. I was like “ok, I can live with that” but then I noticed all the dates. Maybe it is trying to say 1813-1815 but the eights definitely look like sixes on the bag. If details are not important for you then I would recommend this bag but if you get hung up on details then I would advise not purchasing this bag."
3.0,They are very pretty but one is longer than the other one
3.0,"It’s a nice headband and I like that it has the rubber on the underside to hold my hair and better stay in place. That being said I have two problems with it. 1. If you are a heavy sweater like me, this isn’t for outdoor 100+ degree work. It isn’t wide enough or absorbent enough to really catch much of your sweat (and so I never felt it doing much cooling). 2. As shown in the picture, the literature and tag say it is machine washable and you can dry on low, but the sewn in tag says not to machine wash it or dry it…???<br />I will post an update after I use it more over the next week and try washing it."
3.0,"I’m 5’1 135 and I ordered a small. I feel like I’m to short for the dress because it was a bit longer than I like and expected. However, the quality of the material was great and light weight. I do recommend if it’s your taste."
3.0,It doesn't fit plus size 2x... it fits super tight and up to mid stomach. 😕
3.0,"Kind of cheap looking, maybe OK for casual jeans. I returned it."
3.0,"This product was provided to me by amzreviewtrader to review.<br /><br />I was excited  to receive this polka dotted black dress.  The delivery was fast and on time.  The  Pink Patty packaging was fancy and the product kept true to their motto which was &quot;keeping yourself stylish, always&quot;.  Now, let's get these out of the way:<br />a) This item is made with 80 percent polyester.  So, that might be a problem for some.<br />b) The cut is too small.  I went a size up to cover all bases and yet, I could not zip up the item.  I will be returning mine.  That was quite disappointing because I was hoping to wear the dress out on Wednesday. I will recommend that people go two sizes up.  Generally, I wear between a 10 and a 12 and the XL was too tight.<br />c) There was a  problem with the arm area - it was uncomfortable and tight.<br /><br />Despite these flaws:<br />I really like the dress and I will actually like it replaced with a  larger size.  This dress is truly an A cut dress (bottom area) and I could see myself with a pair of red or black pumps traversing a sidewalk somewhere.  It is a simple dress but pretty fancy.  I love the cut and I love the design but they really need to work on the sizing."
3.0,"I ordered this product in all black but when I recieved it the bottom platform part was white.<br />I did not order the black and white shoe but thought it looked nice anyway so decided to keep them because for thw price it wasn't bad. I hope that when I order this product in black again that I ACTUALLY recieve it in all black.<br />Otherwise they fit great and the material is not bad at all, easy to walk in package came in shipped great"
3.0,Way too big for me but it was beautiful
3.0,"I gave this 3 stars because the sewing of the neckline is not very neat and it is cut way too scooped out. I like the fabric. May try a smaller size. I wear a 14 and the Large was too big. I am 5'8"" and have broad shoulders so I was surprised that this gown keeps falling off of one of my shoulders."
3.0,The value was good and we have used these with our beach chairsl
3.0,It was the perfect size. pretty pattern. Not pleased with cancer causing agents.
3.0,Heavy! And awkward to wear! The backs are loose.
3.0,Facebook brought me here read Chad review want disappointed to see that there are other like minded individuals like me.  Lmao
3.0,"There are some great things about this bag, but also a big deal breaker for me.  The leather is super nice and you an tell it will hold it's shape for a long time. A good bargain for under $40.  I've spent several times that amount on bags and had leather I liked less. The construction is also nice as far as the stitching and lining.  It had feet on the bottom and overall just had a simple, but classy look(I had the pebbled gray).  However the zippers are terrible and do not have the same quality as the rest of the bag.  The two main large ones appeared to have  misaligned teeth and the zipper looked sort of &#34;wavy&#34;.  You could not zip it smoothly at all and it had to be worked at.  The wavy look of the zipper also gave the bag an odd look with the zipper not laying smoothly down. The inner zipper was the same as far as being difficult to zip and unzip.  I could have lived with the inner zipper being cheap, but not the two main ones.  Zippers working smoothly and quickly are a deal breaker for me, especially for a work bag. I'll be returning."
3.0,"Brought in two colors. loved everything about them except they were to small in the armpit and chest areas. Not going to return them, I'm just two shirts ahead of Christmas shopping, lol"
3.0,Wouldn’t order again. Wash them a FEW times before wear. No matter what the baby will have black fuzz between their toes. Also. The writing on the bottom of the foot is weird. Wish it was just dots or something.
3.0,"Cute design, good quality. As most know things manufactured in China run small. I would order 2 sizes up."
3.0,One did not work.  Low quality product.
3.0,There is a small tear on the hands
3.0,A bit smaller and more clingy than I expected.
3.0,"While this top is very comfortable, the fabric is not the sweatshirt type fabric I expected.  This fabric is almost slippery, polyester-y...yet it drapes nicely.  The band at the bottom is very comfortable but is very unflattering if you have even the slightest belly.  I ordered 2 of these and I might alter them to take the bottom band off so that I can wear them out in public....this shirt is perfect for leggings.  I like the overall design and although I had expectations that weren't met, I'll keep them and make the best of an almost cute, comfortable shirt."
3.0,"It looks great, but its tight.  I can still wear it and fortunately, even though I have broad shoulders, I have enough room there, but the stomach area is unusually tight.  I can breathe, but its not super comfortable."
3.0,Good for gym clothes.
3.0,Nice product but runs a bit small.
3.0,I like the design of this shirt but not the material. The material is kind of clingy and not flattering. It's also weirdly shiny.  The tag says cotton/polyester but it feels and looks like some kind of spandex blend.
3.0,This is such a cute ring but unfortunately very small. I wear a size 7 on my middle finger but I could not even get this ring past my finger knuckle.
3.0,Like the bright prints of these leggings but the material is not as comfortable. Also these didn’t fit my daughter as full length but were a bit above ankle length. Overall good product the price!
3.0,"The dress is a little snug on top.  It should be pictured on a model who is plus size.  I have curves, and this dress does not hang the same on me as it does on the model."
3.0,"The material is heavy and thick.  So with all the pleats in the back, if you have a little junk in your trunk it looks like a semi-truck! Back it went.  (I have a little junk.)"
3.0,I wasn't expecting professional goggles when buying these but for the price they're pretty good. I don't know if I would use them on the slopes but they work fine for me snowblowing the driveway.  Only thing that I don't like is that the foam around your face doesn't seal very well on the nose. Maybe it's just my face but there's a good quarter inch of space around my nose that the phone does not touch.
3.0,It was an okay bandana
3.0,Not a very sophisticated product but just okay. Does the job. The packing it comes in is low grade.
3.0,"Pendant is nice, chain is cheep."
3.0,"I bought these as a Christmas gift and they arrived in plenty of time, which was appreciated.  However, one of the shoes arrived with a large spot of glue on the top of the shoe that is not able to be cleaned off or fixed in any way.  I tried everything I could think of and then reached out to the seller, who offered me $6.  I just wanted shoes without a large flaw or guidance on how to remove the glue myself, which they couldn't give.  They did answer fairly promptly."
3.0,The top to bottom ration was weird. The skirt part was too short. Recommend getting one size up.
3.0,"I loved this ring...the look is very close to being real<br />However, in a few months the stones fell out and the policy of the seller is a refund within 30 days so I had no positive results trying to get my money back"
3.0,"They are a kind of big for my ears, wish they were a little smaller."
3.0,"good lens, arrived with bent up nose pieces"
3.0,Overall a cute little ring....but.. it does not look the same color as in the picture. I was expecting it to be a little more on the pink side..It's not....So I was a little dissapointed.
3.0,Pretty nice quality- just doesn't fit on my face very well is all. However the other bits are nice.
3.0,"Cute and nice packaging. Only downside is its kind of big on me. I got it to wear at the small of my waist and it kept falling off. I’m a size medium in most things, so I found this odd when this was supposed to be on the smaller side."
3.0,"Love the length of this dress...besides that, runs super small. If you're regularly a medium...buy a 1X...Or maybe I just got a dud! Kind -of scared to try again!"
3.0,"I returned this as it just wasn’t flattering on my hourglass shape (small waist, larger hips). It just made me look larger. The fabric is pretty thin so that was part of the problem."
3.0,La tela no es de muy buena calidad. Es un poco transparente
3.0,Longer and more fitted than expected
3.0,Velcro was not stitched well and broke off but other than that I love this product.
3.0,"got the necklace and Skull is dark and not shiny like pix and the gold on head is not there. All pewter color except eyes, also nose is not red. Gonna hv to touch it up myaelf to see gold and red colors."
3.0,We must've gotten defective ones as the mouths dont open after wearing them for a week.
3.0,"i can work was put into making these sandals, but care was not top of the list. they are uneven in size (one is bigger then the other) and the smaller one broke from the middle chain link when i stood up and pointed my toe.(not enough give ). none of the chains really lay right on my foot but then again they are not custom made for my foot size so i was not expecting it to be perfect. they are beautiful for sure, but i got what i paid for. lucky i can fix them myself when i have time thanks to my armature chain work skills. if you know for a fact you can fix them up yourself i would say go ahead and get them because the price is great. if not then i would say spend the extra cash and get some made to order for your size foot. i am a 10 1/2 flat footed and a 12 in heals the larger one even when flexing is just a hair to big but its easier to work with when you have more then not enough like the smaller one."
3.0,The item is actually not true to size to begin with and secondly the quality is medium. Nothing great. The gathering on the sleeve is awkward.
3.0,"Buckle is a little to wide, very difficult to put through the loops of jeans ."
3.0,They squeak LOUDLY! Looking for something new!
3.0,"to big, didn't fit!"
3.0,"The printed design was somewhat pale.  The fabric feels more like thick ace bandage material than socks.  The “heel” is printed on rather than shaped.  I will keep them and wear them when they match an outfit, but disappointed in their quality."
3.0,I love it except the fact my chain has already changed colors
3.0,"I'm a guy that likes to dress nicely, and I figured I could use a scarf in the closet when it get cold here in Texas for two weeks out of the year. Considering what I paid for this scarf, I'm pleased. This piece of fabric isn't the scarf you might think of, but is a very (very) thin square with tassels on two ends, though it can be folded into scarf shape to wrap around thine neck. It's so thin though, you could pull a thread, then ruining it. Which leads to good and bad things. Bad: ruining means... ruining it. It'll be a rag for whatever then. It also means this isn't for really cold environments. Even in Texas cold for me, this barely does the warmth job outside. The Good? Since it's thin, it can be used in cooler temperatures or for style without making you sweat.<br /><br />So, for style, it's a good buy. For warmth, it's so-so. But with how cheap it is, having it destroyed by a snag will be less painful. Just watch out for thorns, zippers, and any other snaggable objects around you.<br /><br />January 18th, 2012 Update: Recently, I lost my scarf, so, knowing they were dirt cheap, I when't ahead and ordered another. It arrived within one week, but the smell of the scarf was atrocious. It reminded me of what a scarf that a dirty old man would were if he worked in the hot sun for long hours and showered in gasoline. It took a thorough hand wash, some cologne, and a few nights of wear to actually get the smell to become bearable. I fear for putting this in the wash as it might destroy the woven fabric. This experience dropped my score from a 4 star to a 3. I didn't call support to complain, but I believe this should be something that the company who sends these out should know about to begin with. If you buy these scarves and they smell awful, my best advise is to soak them in a sink, hang them to dry after spraying them with your favorite fragrance, and then toughing it out until it reaches the ""your"" scent. Just expect it to be an arduous task."
3.0,"This dress feels so soft and stretchy and comfortable, but it was too big. I wish an xs was available. The small hung on me... I am 5'3"" and I weigh about 110lbs."
3.0,"I like the glasses. However, I only received two colors, purple and red. No pink. As a cancer survivor I really wanted the pink!"
3.0,This hematite necklace was really pretty and it was very shiny but unfortunately it broke after I had only had it for twenty-one days. It looks like the cord the beads were strung on was pretty thin and the screw clasp on the back of the necklace was a little too small.
3.0,I couldn't tolerate these on for more than 10 minutes. They caused me headaches and didnt help with the glare. Mine scratched quickly so I ended up returning them.
3.0,"This is a beautiful watch- I get many compliments on it. However, a pin by the latch keeps coming loose and I have to keep pushing it back in. I’m afraid it will eventually fall apart if I forget to push the pin in throughout the day."
3.0,Looked like good quality leather but was thicker and wider than the original Ferragamo belt that I was looking to replace.<br /><br />I had to return as a result as couldn'f fit in the belt head that I have.
3.0,I brought an extra large but it fit more like a large. In the pockets were very small I could barely put my hands in them the openings were not cut wide enough. Other than that pretty nice lady
3.0,"This is very small. It barely fits over my head. I love the overall idea and I think it is functional, but I really wish it was bigger."
3.0,"These are nice socks, being attractive, cushy and comfy.  They're a little shorter than indicated, and I wouldn't expect them to fit if you wear a size 9 or larger shoe.<br /><br />I find myself wondering why they should need to be handwashed, as I normally toss socks I've handknit with superwash wool yarn in with the normal wash, and even have some which are still in very good, wearable condition over two decades after I knit them.  I handwash them when I'm going to need a fresh pair before other clothes need to be washed, and washing them is not a big deal.  Just put them in some warm water with a little shampoo, and squish them thoroughly, then rinse in some fresh water.  It's drying them which is more an issue unless you have a sock blocker, or an out of the way place to lay them out until they can finish drying completely.<br /><br />If my review was helpful, please click the button below."
3.0,"The fabric looks great and feels okay, it is not scratchy.  The sewing is good and they seem like they are built to last.  The main problem arises from the buttons of the vest.  It seems that these are not meant to be a fitted vest as much as a loose vest.  Usually I feel like vests are supposed to be more fitted, but with enough movement not to obstruct you when you bend or twist.  This felt great while standing or walking, but when I bent over to pick something up one of the buttons sheared off.  At first I thought it was probably stitching or something, but it turned out that the buttons are made of a very soft and thin plastic that breaks easier than opening a bag of chips.  So if you want something you can move around freely in, maybe order a size up from normal.  Still, they look great."
3.0,"Scarf itself is fine. What is doesn't say (at least I didn't see it) is that the ""plush balls"" are real fur. Probably rabbit. I NEVER would have purchased if that was disclosed. If you are against wearing real fur I don't recommend."
3.0,"It is ok, the bracelet would only fit a small child."
3.0,This dress is very cute but was cheaply made - It fit a little bit and looked more like pajamas but the material was very soft and comfy feeling.
3.0,Mask is ok overall but for me its been very uncomfortable around the ear. It is quite tight. Wish it was made of elastic straps around the ear for better comfort. Also if it had a clip to remove from back it would have been good. Have to remove it over the head/hair.
3.0,"It's ok for the price, won't last, lots of loose threads"
3.0,Love the pants ordered a large but you need to go up maybe two sizes.
3.0,Es para un reloj
3.0,"Finally found a sizing chart located among the pictures and I will not be able to wear any of the line for probably a year. A large is an 8-10, which in the real world, is a medium"
3.0,They. are very pretty but the sizing is way off. I ordered a size larger than he wears but he could not sqeeze his feet into them.
3.0,"Made my wrist prespire, too much going on in the background to read easily."
3.0,Product arrived quickly but the wing doesn't lay flat so it flips over when I try and wear it.  I will probably hammer it out some so that it lays flatter.
3.0,Bought 3 necklaces. Gem is pretty and appropriate for little girls. Chain broke after 2-3 uses but the gem can be placed on another chain to be used again
3.0,"Order these shoes 2 sizes bigger. I had to exchange them because my husbands feet were cramped up and very uncomfortable in his true size. However, they are comfortable, very warm, and durable. He loves them!!!"
3.0,I’m a bigger chested girl and it definitely opens up a lot at the top. I recommend wearing something under if you’re got a larger bust
3.0,"Love the look of these, but one piece out of my first two pairs broke within a couple weeks and I couldn't salvage them. Still wearing my third pair a couple of months later, but of course it's my least favorite color choice. May buy again due to price, but be aware the cheap price is reflected in quality."
3.0,Nice hunter green colour. it appears to run a bit smaller than your average size. i should have ordered 1 size larger.
3.0,"The dress is cute but not really cut for a petite person. Everything just fit a little odd. And the material was far thicker than I expected. It’s lined, kind of like winter leggings, hard to describe. I was very disappointed it didn’t fit me. I’m hoping it fits my friend, otherwise I’ll be returning it."
3.0,Buttons are hard to open and close
3.0,I did not care for the rips in the back.....right under my bun(s).  returned.
3.0,Did not like material made of.
3.0,These boots are warm waterproof and soft. The lining goes all the way down inside the boots so we often don’t even put socks on our son when he wears them. The only problem was one of the boots lace broke at some point within a week of receiving them. It must have been while playing in the snow because we couldn’t find it when he came in. Now he can’t wear them until we get him new laces.
3.0,"I like the glasses but the lens' keep falling out, which is pretty annoying"
3.0,Order up a size if you have a tummy. Material reminded me of a swimsuit. Unforgiving in the mid-section.  Size 12/14 ordered the large.
3.0,"I had high hopes for these socks based on some of the reviews. But before I could even get to work, one was already off my heel and wadded up around my toes. Weirdly enough, the other sock stayed put all day and was very comfortable. Thus the reason for three stars instead of one or two. I ordered a different brand of socks at the same time as this order, and the other brand stays up much better. The Vero Monte socks were quite a bit thicker, which would be fine with loafers or Converse, but I think they're too thick for flats."
3.0,Did not fit as expected. Was tight across bust area but loose around chest at band. Weird fit. Didn't like. Returned.
3.0,"I received a lot of compliments on the outfit however, I lost a lot of the rhinestones before the end of the night. It is a 1-time wear item!  If you wash it there may not be any rhinestones left on it. That is the reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 4"
3.0,"To start off I'm a 36 D, and I got the XL, the material and quality is really amazing. I love the fit. The ONLY downfall for an XL there's a lot of side boobage. Since I don't plan on wearing this outside the home just inside its not a big deal. Other than the side boobage the bra is great!"
3.0,Tight in the bust
3.0,"Nice earring but my mistake that I didn't see they didn't have a hinge on them, very hard to put in my ear"
3.0,I sent this dress back I did not care for on me
3.0,I purchased a large which was size of my other jackets. But I should have bought a XL. I waited to long to return it for an XL.5
3.0,Super soft & not sure if absorbent as not used and will be returning. It is polyester and not terry cloth so I don’t think it will be absorbent. I was aware of this when I ordered but wasn’t using it to absorb. HOWEVER…my main complaint is the straps are totally bizarre in how they are attached. You literally have to put one over your head to but this wrap on. On top of that I got a medium and it is HUGE! Plus the head wrap was also too large to make fit around the head. I was actually shocked by all this. So overall dissatisfied and returning. The softness and color was all that I liked.
3.0,Wife just ordered a 2x because the last belle poque product she got fit fine. It was a touch snug. 3x was sold out. She's keeping it for layering.
3.0,"These are definitely women's socks due to the toe and heel being thin. They fit her well, are comfortable, and have good elastic. She says she wouldn't wear these anywhere except at home due to the colors (not really a match for any outfit), and the socks are calf high."
3.0,Made well however even using the measuring charts they fit a little too large.
3.0,a little thin but ok for summer workouts
3.0,The jacket is literally one size. If you wear a s/m the jacket will probably be too big. If you are in to the oversized clothing look - it'll be perfect for you. The jacket is really cute and looks exactly like the picture!
3.0,"Cute but a bit thicker than I would prefer, they might be better for walking or hanging around the house than a tough workout. A little long but I have that problem with most full length leggings."
3.0,I purchased size 10/12 which is a size up (to accommodate her body type) This fit her with room to grow (which was expected since I sized up). Appears to be well made except for the closure at the top (I will have to reinforce this myself) which is okay for me because it was priced so well. I'm not in to spending lots of money when she will only wear it for one season. I plan to hand wash because this doesn't look like it can handle a normal cycle in the machine. Directions are in another language.
3.0,"It really is a beautiful coat, from the outside. The lining is a really ugly brown color, soft though. The sleeves are made of a different material and kinda itchy. I really am tempted to return but I think I will attempt to fix it myself. Because it is a beautiful coat from the outside."
3.0,Very cute but it tangles easily when I wear it :(
3.0,"TRI-Tip broke with first DS it touched. Very cheaply made. I've been in IT field for 15 years, just for reference."
3.0,Liked the style but it was too small so I had to return.
3.0,"leather great, buckle broke within a month"
3.0,"I'm not so sure if this is a knock off or not, but the reasoning for my 3 stars would be because the Pom Pom is abnormally large and looks kinda weird on my head but there is also an attachment where you could take off the Pom Pom and I'm not sure if that is on the actual CC beanie but the pin attached to it doesn't come off so it's kinda pointless being there. Wish I knew the Pom Pom was this big or I wouldn't of bought it but other then that it's a relatively nice hat for the price"
3.0,"They were ok at first but if you wear them<br />daily they will start to irritate your skin.  I don’t think these are real sterling silver. for the price they are cute, but not for everyday wear."
3.0,My straps ripped after 3 weeks. I wore it maybe 4-5 times. Fits great. Super comfortable but I guess quality isn’t the best..
3.0,Thinness Cotton ever
3.0,Not a very well made shirt. For the price I would say you get what you pay for.
3.0,Great service good product!
3.0,Not flattered. Straight top with a belt.
3.0,Print is cute. Fabric is kinda cheap feeling. Good for a beach cover up.. not as an outfit out though. Def size up
3.0,Couldnt tell from the picture but the fabric is not as I expected... Bought it to use as a beach bag but because of the fabric really was not able to... and the bottom is just a piece of cardboard so it cant get wet & it isnt very durable...
3.0,This was a Christmas gift and the pants run small
3.0,Too short.  I should have read the specs.
3.0,Ith
3.0,"My daughter already has a few pairs of Delia's Olivia jeans size 0 that fit well, which she bought before Delia's went out of business. She wanted a new pair, but discovered that the legs are a lot narrower than the pairs she's had for a few years. We're sending them back. They don't seem to have size 1 available.<br /><br />These might be good for a 12 year old who's petite, but not for an older teen."
3.0,"Cute dress, 5’10” and xl fit at the top perfectly but it was way too short in length, I like them to touch the floor but this hit just below the ankle . I would have liked it to be more fitted through the bottom portion of dress"
3.0,"Cute shirt, suggest ordering a size  up"
3.0,"I love that the fabric is stretchy, however I ordered a small and it's still a little too big. Dress is extremely long as well, definitely going to have to have it hemmed if I plan on tripping on it.  The bottom also doesn't flare out like the picture so I might have to have a slit cut up the thigh to give it more flare."
3.0,"Umbrella was easy to assemble, bought the recommended base and filled with sand. It’s easy to use, provides good sun protection and and I love the navy color which works well with our decor. The only negative is that it sways and creeks quite a bit even in mild wind conditions (10 mph). Not sure if this is the norm for all cantilever type umbrellas as this is my first. Makes people under it a bit nervous, including myself. So unfortunately I find myself only when there is literally no breeze at all."
3.0,"I love the design but this dress is paper thin. I was looking for something that's heavier. Based on the price and the other reviews, I thought it would be of much better quality."
3.0,Kid's will break them and/or loose them too fast
3.0,Tank fits big at the top. Material is stretchy. Very Flowy. I am returning.
3.0,"Just ok. Not enough compression. Also a little long for what I was wanting. I ordered because of the pocket, but my phone bounces around a lot during running."
3.0,"The ring set as pictured is beautiful.  The color combination is absolutely stunning. Unfortunately the ring set I ordered is not the ring set I received.  The design is totally different and the large stone is very loose in the setting.  The company has offered to send a replacement, I accepted.  We'll see if the second ring set is actually the right set, matches the design as pictured and the quality is much better."
3.0,"I thought it had a in shelf bra, but no...wasn't what I wanted but they are still nice to work out in."
3.0,"The purse itself is well made, and served my purpose, but I bought it to take to a wedding, and in person it just did not look as nice as I had hoped."
3.0,Product is great for little kids in terms of fit. Comfortable and has good stretch. However the seams are not sewed well and for all 4 gaiters thread was coming apart in just 2 washes.
3.0,Cute but the clevage area is know kinda low for me. This dress is for date night and not for a day with the kids
3.0,"This dress is amazingly cute, but the other reviewers are right...the embroidery is way itchy.<br />I'm heading to a fabric store to get something to cover it. After that, this will be a great work dress or casual dress!"
3.0,"They fit okay but there are strings on the inside of the sock from the patterns and left indentations on my legs and made my legs itchy. No return policy, so maybe I'll donate them to a thrift shop."
3.0,Extremely cute and perfect for sun cover. I'm deeply disappointed that the lining came undone immediately after putting on. I sewed the best it could as it was the last of its size. The decals also came off after the sencond day of use. I'll probably remove the skirt all together.
3.0,"Sadly this didn't work out for me. I really wanted it to!  It's a really cute design that I think flatters a lot of body types.  However, the pink was more like a light lilac and it didn't fit my skin tone well. Also, it has a slightly shorter torso that didn't work with my body style. I'm glad I had a chance to try this at a discount so that I could leave an honest review.  I wish it had worked for me. I am 5'8&#34; and 160 pounds. I purchased a  large and it was a little bit big in the shoulders and waist.  I think that's normal for this sort of draping style.  The length came down to the top of my hips, and had to be pulled down  frequently to avoid it pulling up.  The lace in the back was really pretty. The material is very light, so perfect for a warm climate  or somewhere sunny. I was wearing a nude bra and it didn't show through. So the fabric is not so light that it is sheer."
3.0,"It's an ok top. I like the neutral color and long length to fully cover the backside. However, it's not figure-flattering and doesn't hug curves. It kind of hides your curves and looks very matronly. I'd recommend it if you work in a nursery or pre-K and want something comfy, practical and modest. But if you want to look cute, I don't recommend it.  I am 5'4, 120 pounds, and went with the medium, as I wanted to make sure it would be long enough. Maybe I should have went with the small. I'll wear it, but I don't love it!"
3.0,"A bit too short all around (strap, crotch, leg), and a bit too narrow in the rear. I’d order a size up."
3.0,Boning bends out once you wear it for awhile.
3.0,"I loved it - bought it for my European vacation - to feel extra safe and protected .... Unfortunately after 8 days t the closing patent disconnected - could not close it anymore. ...but since I love the color, the touch of the leather - I am trying to find somebody to fix it - I come back the end of the summer - way after the possibility to return it :("
3.0,"For the price point they were ok out of all of them two came not working, the ring tops were not aligned and I must of misunderstood because I thought the whole ring was jelly soft  material but only the images pictured are of soft jelly material. The ring part is made from scratchy plastic. Overall the product felt and looked very cheap"
3.0,They were cute but larger than the actual TB studs and seemed to tarnish pretty quickly. I wore them but not for long. Buy a back up pair if you plan to wear them often.
3.0,"The mask looks great and man did I want it to work. That chin strap is a joke, like many others that was the first thing to get cut. I find that when I place the mask in a comfortable position the bottom of the eye socket hits me right in the eye and its not like I can cut that part since its already thin to begin with. I tried widening it a little bit by cutting the eye socket at the top. The spot where the mask lays on your nose begins to irritate, to solve that issue I cut a small piece of a makeup sponge and glued it and it relieved the pain immediately."
3.0,Cover Thin hair while cleaning house
3.0,No room to move
3.0,Has no strings
3.0,I ordered a large to be safe but it was way small on me. I am returning it. I hope the XL will be big enough. Can’t answer the other questions because I couldn’t tell but the app made me enter a number of stars. Kind of silly that!
3.0,The quality of the bralette is mediocre and not pleasant to feel on the skin. Too bad because it s very pretty!
3.0,"I bought this to wear for a New Years eve party. When I tried it on and my husband saw it his exact comment was ""You look like you're wearing an old lady's bathrobe""<br /><br />So needless to say I will not ever wear this dress!!"
3.0,I expected it to be more flowy and elegant for an elf costume I'm putting together. I don't like the elastic waist band. Makes me look like an old school marm. Maybe better on smaller-chested ladies. Thankfully I can return it with paying shipping.
3.0,"I bought the black one for my birthday and loved it so I wanted to get the red and pink one but it wasn’t for me, so I had to return it. The red wasn’t red it was a dark pink and the pink one looked a little cheap. The black one was a hit and looks expensive. Hope this help"
3.0,One post is much larger than it's mate and is too large for my piercing. Useless.
3.0,It's a visor.  Not sturdy but if for one day will give you shade
3.0,"A much darker brown than it appeared to be on the screen. I thought that it would be more caramel brown when in fact its more of a brown-brown(if that makes any sense lol). Anywho, the quality of the belt is nice but just not what I wanted. Oh well, I'll regift it!"
3.0,"Material is cheap,see threw to be exact"
3.0,"Fit is quite a bit off, definitely runs small. Super soft material and nice necklace that comes with it. My daughter was happy except that the size wasn't quite right."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:532bdf6d4fa97751e9a7597a53543213]] The shirt that came in the mail is nothing what was shown, this thing is completely see through! It look like the shirt USED to have an under layer but was badly cut out, as you can see from the choppy neck area I took a picture of. 100% returning this garbage<br />UPDATE: I'm raising my rating from 1 star to 3 stars specifically due to this seller's customer service. They had reached out to me to apologize and informed me that this shirt should have had an inner liner and that I must have been sent a damaged product. I was asked not to send this back so no one else would have to receive the same thing I did and was still refunded."
3.0,Good material only flaw the sizing is reduced
3.0,Not as bright at the photo which is what I wanted. I don’t love it but I’ll keep it or gift it.<br />The fabric is thin; nothing special.
3.0,"The bag is like the photo but the doll is totally different, almost bizarre. It's impossible to use the bag with this hanging rough doll."
3.0,shrank over 6 inches at the hem after first wash but very soft
3.0,"Unfortunately, we had to return this. My daughter has a relatively small head for an adult, but this was too tight .<br />Never got a chance to ""try it out"", but it seemed good quality."
3.0,"I got this as a gift for a friend, and it didn't really fit."
3.0,"Nice fabric, but nothing fancy: don't expect a party thing. Also, the &#34;Large&#34; size is too large. All the hoodies I buy are of that size, and they fit ok, but this is way too loose on the arms and the belly. If you are a 190-lb person like myself with 6&#34; height, buy a size below Large."
3.0,"My son enjoyed all of these additions for his Halloween 1920s gangster costume. The pocket watch is not a working watch and the hat is almost a paper-like material. So we bought a different hat. But, overall, for the price, I feel it was worth purchasing."
3.0,I bought this out of whim because the picture looked very cute on the model. I wasn’t a huge fan of the look once it was on but I paired it with a denim jacket and faux leather leggings for a casual running errands look which made it look better than it did by itself. I did receive a compliment but it just wasn’t my favorite! The top is light weight which was nice because it wasn’t too hot.
3.0,It helps dim the lights glare by about 25%.
3.0,These are pretty shoes and I wanted to keep them but they don’t run narrow enough to fit comfortably.
3.0,It’s a beautiful set. Purchased this set for wedding jewelry but did not use due to the gold is much brighter than depicted in photo.
3.0,"Good for one wear,<br />hole at snaps after one wash"
3.0,"By the time I got the box home from work (where I have my items shipped) the glass had already released from the inside top of the box cover and is no longer a nice, clean look."
3.0,COLOR was NOT white...returned.
3.0,I haven't tried then skirt on yet. The lambswool is soft and very heavy. I'm hoping it doesn't hang down too much. I'm also hoping we have a day cold enough for lambswool. The skirt will be very warm.
3.0,"Beautiful! Loved them! But a piece came off of one by the end of the day, and the fish hook was not attached on the other one when I took it out of the package. I attached it myself but came off again later in the day. Will be sending them back.😞"
3.0,I had this for an few months and I loved it but I used the same hole every day and its starting to tear through the rubber.
3.0,"It's cute and fit good one i got it in, but the wire that is wrapped around the bead in the center is NOT surgical steel. It turned my ear green just in that area. I've not had this issue with any other barbell. Also I had a hard time getting it to screw back together properly. It kept cross threading (also not an issue I've had with any other barbell)."
3.0,"To be clear- this is a cross, not a crucifix.  Please use words correctly."
3.0,It runs a little on the big side
3.0,"It is very soft and delicate and easy on eye flowery design as pictured .But does not have a nose brige ,stays loose on top,and it is very small for an average face or head ,so after knotting behind your neck just half of  what you see on that model sits on top of the chest .The model most likely has a petite head and face .Could have used more fabric ."
3.0,"While an absolutely adorable suit, it's a very weird cut.  The slightly annoying: the front of the skirt is twice as long as the rear.  Do NOT expect bottom coverage.  Still looks very cute.<br /><br />The incredibly annoying: as many others have mentioned, the cups are just absurdly small.  I wear a 36 D (maybe pushing a DD in cheaper bras), and wear a size 8 or 10 depending on the brand. I got the XXXL after reading a zillion reviews, and man...not even close.  The cups aren't wide enough, but far more troublesome is that they aren't LONG enough.  The line was riding up and my boobs were under it---not a good look at all for anyone.  As lowcut as the V is, there's really no saving it no matter how you tie the straps.<br /><br />If you look through the customer photos, you will see a lot of bigger busted girls flat out rocking this suit...which is why I gave it a try.  I simply couldn't make it work.  Returned and tried one of Cocoship's high waisted 2 pieces.  Cross your fingers I can pull it off---my vacation is in 2 weeks!"
3.0,"Fit as expected. The fabric is low quality, very itchy."
3.0,"While it's a bit smaller than expected, it still fits perfect!"
3.0,Fabric is not comfortable. Fit is fine
3.0,The band tarnished too fast
3.0,"I buy cheap glasses because they easily get lost or scratched, and most hold up but these started bubbling for the tint very soon after purchase. Loved the look and fit, but I wish it was a black plastic and not film that creates bubbling."
3.0,"I wanted to love it and would have but it runs on the smallish side and this is the real deal breaker, the crotch liner is coming off every single panty. It is glued on apparently and I haven't even washed them yet. i will probably send them back"
3.0,Too low cut. I would have to wear something inside for modesty. Otherwise a pretty dress.
3.0,A very light weight see through material but has a cute cut!
3.0,A little disappointed with the size of these earrings.  Too small to see what is actually on them.
3.0,They came a couple days early. I though they were gonna be the same or close to being tall as my 14 eye steel toe docs but there like a half a inch short even though there 14 eye too:\ meh... I think my next pair I'll get will be the brand solovair. The grinders are comfy though.  Oh yeah I forgot they had some scratch marks on them too
3.0,"The product description stated (caps added): ""MAGNET Infinity Stones Gauntlet FOR ADULT. New version Infinity Gauntlet, LED gems CAN BE REMOVED and install, just like the movie, when you install the gems in gauntlet, the Gems will light up. When you TAKE OUT the gems, the LED will snub out.""<br /><br />This isn't the glove I received.  The gems were epoxied in.  I was able to remove them (I needed them off) by prying them out with a screwdriver, but there certainly were no magnets to hold them in place.  (I've added some, though.)  Also, I'm a 6'2"" human male, and I couldn't get my hand all the way into the glove.  If you buy ""size large"" gloves at Home Depot, you'll struggle with this.<br /><br />All of that said, it's nifty for the right audience.  Mine had a power switch inside the sleeve which turns the LEDs on, and the gems did look cool when lit."
3.0,It's too small and I've mailed it to return.
3.0,Size was perfect. Feet stayed dry until the boot cracked where foot creased at top where foot meets ankle. Disappointing because they were great and cute!
3.0,Bought this for my daughter off her wish list. She was disappointed in the missing symbols but decided to keep the necklace.
3.0,I got these for me 5'7 125lb. I got the small after reading reviews. well they were calf bellbottoms on me lol. my daughter who is 5'1 115lb...they fit her great! she absolutely loves these jeans and said they are so comfy on her. so yes they are teenager approved!
3.0,"Quality wise, they are great.  What you see in the picture is NOT what you get.<br /><br />I chose this product for the price and colors in the picture.  I REALLY wanted the gray pair.  I thought the pink, red and blue would be nice and then I received the gloves.  I didn’t get gray or pink, either pink.  I got a neon yellow pair, which isn’t in the picture and this is a bit of a disappointment.<br /><br />Don’t show a picture of what you will get and give you something else.  If you don’t care what colors you receive, these gloves are the ones for you, but this won’t be a re-buy for next winter.  I want my gloves to match my winter jacket."
3.0,the dress is cute but the fabric is a very (very) lightweight think T-shirt type fabric.  Just doesn't have the quality that will last.
3.0,"The material could be thicker for more support, of the contents you place in it."
3.0,"I like the glasses, but the screws fell out in two weeks and couldn't find them."
3.0,I thought it was going to be something special but it looks like a very inexpensive grocery bag
3.0,"Really hopeful at first, only had for like a month and the hinges already bent . Disappointing I couldn't  get more uses out to see effects before it started falling apart"
3.0,I ordered two of these and they are ok....wish the anklet could have a little extra linkage to it..I just clamped both together and where them like that.The inside of the hearts still had a little dirt or grit from where they were not cleaned in the shining machine completely but they are cute.
3.0,The graphic is wonderful quality but it keeps pulling away from the console.
3.0,"ordered XL, I wear it occasionally is a little tight, you might want to order up a size"
3.0,"This is an adorable set, I couldn't wait for my little one to wear it. It's a bit large but I knew that when I purchased it so it wasn't a surprise. It's cozy and thick and I was hoping would be a perfect activity sweatsuit. My one complaint is that the zipper broke after a few zips into the very first wear. I was pretty disappointed, I've tried many tricks and it just wont stay zipped. We still use the sweatsuit but its more of an indoor outfit now, because the jacket is still a little large it's difficult for my daughter to wear and without a closed zipper. The sweater is used as a layer under another jacket now.<br />If the Zipper hadn't fallen apart so fast I would have given 5 stars."
3.0,fits larger then size and the bow fell off after first wash
3.0,My daughter is in the 90% percentile for head circumference and she had difficulty keeping these glasses on her ears. She is 4 and even though I think the over the glasses feature is a good idea- there needs to be more thought into holding them in place.<br /><br />We were able to achieve a tighter fit with sunglass straps similar to the miroflex
3.0,"The front of the sweater is short so make sure that you buy a size up. Although, it's a little boxy already so I'm not sure what a size up would be like. I gave mine to my niece."
3.0,"I like it but............I missed that it was &#34;hand wash&#34; or &#34;dry clean&#34; only.  The tag actually states &#34;dryer forbidden.&#34;  What?  I understand things could shrink, but forbidden?  Will it catch fire if I do?  A casual dress at this price point should be wash and dry.  Don't need the headache.  Sending it back."
3.0,Returned it as it was way larger than I expected.
3.0,Its to small
3.0,I like these pin cards ok. They would be nicer if they were black! Also very expensive unlike earring cards that you can buy for $9.95 for 100 pieces!
3.0,I had trouble getting this to fit like I wanted.  Remove initial links and it was too tight.  Added one back and it was too big.  Not good for small wrists
3.0,Got good.  Skirt was a bit too thin. Didn’t seem like good quality.
3.0,"Honestly I like the design, I think my sister will like it but it feels kind of cheap. The sides are kind of pushed in making the clasp a little crooked so who knows if it will hold up over time. I'll keep you updated as time passes."
3.0,"When I put on a pair, something was poking the back of my leg. Took them off and took a closer look and found a piece of plastic in the seem that was scratching the back of my leg. Every pair had the same issue. I had to get tweezers and pull this out of every pair. Otherwise, they were just fine."
3.0,Nice material and top but it fits too large on top being oversized.  Order a size or two down from your  normal.
3.0,"I love the fabric and how it's high waisted, but at 5'5 they are much too short to be worn outside of doing only yoga.  As we used to say in the 7th grade...flood pants.  Will not be purchasing other colors. I want a yoga pant to run around in and do errands."
3.0,"Great color and dress, wish I could wear it confidently but tried it on with wet hair and it showed the water like large black stain spots! Anywhere it got damp the water spot turned the red to black. Can’t imagine what would happen if I were to sweat in it… returned unfortunately"
3.0,"The good: Fits well, does accommodate my 40G chest without revealing too much. Not great on support, but I wasn't expecting miracles. I adjusted the straps to the tightest setting for maximum support. Very comfortable overall though.<br />The bad: The floating cups are, as other people have said, a major pain. I'm unsure if I will keep it because of this, waiting for a similar suit to come in and see if they sewed the cups in. The floating cups move around even as you walk, so I can't imagine what they will do in the water. This is the only issue with the suit without me having worn it in the water yet."
3.0,the rings were too small for my fingers
3.0,Loved the look but the chest area was too small overall.
3.0,"Really loved this coat, I was so excited when I pulled it out of the box. Then it turned out to be way too small, I was so disappointed but I have to return it."
3.0,"I like the shirt. However, after one washing, line dried, some seams have come apart."
3.0,Thicker than I wanted.
3.0,They are made way smaller than they say they are even with the fitting guide the size guide it wasn't right I want to return it
3.0,Haven't worn them much but Born have always been fabulous. I considered sending them back because the heel was a bit high but the return cost was 20$. So I kept them. I prefer Prime vendors.
3.0,"I thought this would be a much lighter, almost tan color from the picture on the listing.  It's actually a medium gray.  Photo in the listing does not match the color that you receive."
3.0,"Firstly they are super long, i used the sizing chart too.  Secondly the waist band area is really thick, like an 1.5&#34;-2&#34; thick! They are also super tight along the thigh area for me."
3.0,"I bought this for an upcoming trip to use as my ""day bag"" for excursions during a land tour and cruise.  I'm a senior with back issues, and even a crossbody purse often causes back pain.  The Ameribag Healthy Back Bag was recommended to me by other family members who use them whenever they travel.  I bought the raspberry, and I love the color (so much more stylish than their plain bags).<br /><br />On the inside is a good sized zippered pouch sewn into the bag with RFID protection.  I believe the RFID is a new feature for Ameribag.  I'm not sure that protection is as important in the US as many manufacturers would have us believe, but it is an added feature.  It would be great if that pouch snapped into the bag and were removable.  There are several other inside pockets of varying sizes that should be useful.  Essentially, the inside is identical to earlier versions of the HBB in medium with the exception of RFID.<br /><br />The zippered water bottle pocket on the outside width of the bag is well designed.  When you unzip it, there is a netting that expands the pocket size.  On the earlier designs, the pocket was not expandable.  I tried both 16 and 20 oz. standard disposable water bottles, and both fit nicely.  That pocket has good width and height, so hopefully the bottle won't fall out.  There is a similar pocket on the interior which is about the same size, so you could carry two water bottles.<br /><br />One BIG problem I see with this bag is there is no outside zippered pocket appropriately sized to accommodate my iphone 7+.  The cute little zippered pocket in the second Amazon photo is the obvious place to store it.  Refer to my photo with 7+ and minimalist silicone case - it will not fit.  I was able to insert my husband's iphone 6 without issue, but if it had a more substantial case, I'm not sure it would have fit.  If they had made that pocket 1"" wider and 1"" deeper, it would be perfect.  That pocket is so small, I'm not even sure how I could use it.  The zippered pocket you see in the fourth Amazon photo near the inside seam is a pocket that is the full size of the bag, so that's not a good option for the phone.  I don't know what I would put in that pocket either other than maybe travel documents, as any items would get lost in the bottom of the bag.  Other than the water bottle pocket, there are two remaining exterior pockets that are just slip pockets.  The slip pocket in Amazon photo #1 running diagonally down the front has one rather weak magnet as a closure.  Since the opening to that pocket is the full width of the bag, the phone could easily slide out on either side of the magnetic closure.  The earlier HBB in medium had a flap on this pocket, and I believe the magnet was stronger, so that would make it more useful.  The slip pocket in Amazon photo #2 near the inside seam is also the full size of the bag, too cavernous for a phone, and it has NO closure - no magnet, no zipper and no flap - just an open pocket.<br /><br />I would give this 4 stars if it weren't for the lack of a good place for phone storage in this new style bag which I believe was just released last year.  But after writing this review and reflecting on the purchase, I'm thinking the entire outside of the bag needs a re-design.  Since it is a bag that can be pulled around the body and easily repositioned, slip pockets don't make sense.  Give me zippers!<br /><br />I was really looking forward to receiving this bag.  If I were to keep it, I'd have to store my phone inside which is a big inconvenience.  At this price of $100, I will probably return the bag."
3.0,The sewing on the sleeve came apart after my daughter wore it once.
3.0,Its decent. It comes just as it looks. It just covers the back of the phone so the pictures are kinda misleading. I don't feel as if my phone is very protected but the stand adds a +1 to the entertainment category. You pay what you get for. For the price? It's a'ight
3.0,I purchased 3 different inexpensive loups the same power and at about the same price all at the same time.  I used them to read size stampings on small drill bits. This is may least favorite of the three. This comment is based on how well I thought I could read the markings.
3.0,Everyday dress
3.0,The crouch was short and didn't allow for free movement comfortably
3.0,Material is different than expected  i got a large should've got a med.It also came with a face mask but it fits kind of thight though.
3.0,"The sequins around the arms are insanely scratchy, too uncomfortable to wear for more than 5 minutes.  The straps that come around fit oddly; I would have to take it in to have it altered to make them lay flat against my back and shoulders.  As they fold out in the middle of them looking a little funny in the back.  If the dress could be altered and have a softer material touching your skin it would be really pretty but in my case I'll be returning it. I ordered burgundy and expected a darker color red; it's not fire engine red but it is brighter than what I expected burgundy to look like.  Was still a very pretty color red.  The satin on the dress is very soft and below the waist the material fell beautifully."
3.0,Definitely small. Would be perfect for a kid's gift or someone who has tiny wrists. Also it is just small in general. I thought it would have been a bit more large? It's just small lol
3.0,One of them did alright the other one is useless because it over bent when I tried to put them in
3.0,Love the scarf necklace!! The silver tassels started coming off the first time I wore it.😟😟
3.0,"I wanted to like this.  I really did.  I put it on and because it's a high-low style, the ""high"" was way too high.  It may have worked with leggings & boots, but then I feel the ""low"" would be too long in the back.  I'm 5'8"" and it just didn't work.  For shorter gals, it'll be super cute :)"
3.0,Expected more for the price i paid for it.  The actual watch holder sets loose inside the dome which i did not expect.
3.0,"The item was broken in many places when I got it, the wings weren't the color pictured. However, I was offered a full refund, so I'm pleased, even though I didn't get the necklace I was hoping for."
3.0,"You get what u pay for. I love boots and spotted these. The material on the outside was soft, I ordered black and they got dirty quick. The boots feel cheaply made with not a lot of support which I dont come across often. Cute boot but not my favorite"
3.0,I did not like it that much it was not what I wanted but keep it to wear to beach
3.0,"Sleeves are too short, but I have long arms."
3.0,"3 days wearing, and a stro broke."
3.0,The fabric was not what i thought it would be. The picture shows a thin flowy fabric. The fabric is thick. Pretty dress just not for me.
3.0,"The glasses arrived in a mailer envelope with minimal protection. There was no damage though because the glasses were in a very nice protective case. The glasses are comfortable and light. They seem to be made well and be decent quality. But there is were the good aspects end. The main issue is the lenses.<br /><br />The level of magnification from top of lens to bottom is not a smooth progression. It supposedly starts at no magnification at the top of the lens and ends with the desired magnification at the bottom of the lens where you need the ""readers"" aspect of the lens. The problem is that the top of the lens is a distorted zero corrective magnification and then ""jumps"" to about a 1.75 to 2.25 magnification instantly. And the transition is blurry. It then appears to increase magnification as you move down the lens quickly and not smoothly causing poor optics. It also seems that the final ""reading"" magnification has a small focal spot.<br />You see the changing magnification as blurry or unclear areas in your line of sight making it very difficult to use these glasses generally. Some specific limited situations like reading only may be workable but not for my intended use.<br /><br />Had to return them.<br /><br />The 3 star rating is because of the lenses being poor and cheap packaging. Even with the nice case a little padding wouldn't hurt. The frames seemed good enough quality. Fit well and were comfortably light. Better lenses and these would be good glasses."
3.0,"GREAT PLACE TO SHOP, SOMETIMES THING SEEMS BIGGER THAN WHAT ADVERTISE, BUT THAT THE PRICE YOU HAVE TO PAY .<br />THING NOT ALWAYS DELIVERED ON THE DATE GIVEN. SOMETIME YOUR ORDER COMES IN DIFFERENT SHIPMENT."
3.0,It's a bit small for the 1X
3.0,don't like the band that holds the fridges on the bottom. tapers in a bit.
3.0,"I liked the top, but I am tall with long arms so the sleeves did not work for me."
3.0,"I like the dress , it's just way too long , I will put a gem in it."
3.0,"this is a weird shirt. fits ok, but looks weird as hell. the back hangs long so you SHOULD tuck in, but its just really a weird shirt."
3.0,"Not a dress! This is truly more like a night gown or lingerie. Although it is pretty and fits as described, I would not wear it out in public even with a slip underneath."
3.0,"I was dissapointed. Way too many Christmas and Halloween charms and not as colorful as listing. Sadly, will not buy again."
3.0,These shirts run very small. I ordered a X-large and it fits like a medium.
3.0,Too tight on chest area
3.0,"This is a nice shirt and my wife liked the color and fabric but...  it was no the typical large size.  Hence, it was more like a small and didn't fit so...... back it went."
3.0,It’s a nice dress but the material needs to be dresser not cotton look.
3.0,I liked how the picture showed lines 0f multiple colors of turquoise.  these are just one solid color
3.0,A &#34;set&#34; is a set of logs only. Does not include anything but the logs and not what I expected. I did ask for a description of a &#34;set&#34; but did not get a reply. I do like the color of the logs.
3.0,Description indicated the gloves were small but they were very tiny and would not fit my petit daughter. I would recommend a slight better description or photo by which to compare size of gloves.
3.0,Cute shirt but it's very thin and doesn't have a lot of stretch.  I purchased this for my 29# 3 year old granddaughter and I had to stretch the head of this shirt quite a bit to even get it on her.
3.0,It is just OK...not super impressed with the quality for the price.
3.0,Not very soft. Bit scratchy. My boy is short and stocky so they were not very comfortable on him. Kind of wrapped around him which aggravated him. Prints are cute.
3.0,You don't have to get a bigger size because it's a boot. They run big
3.0,Beautiful dress but way to be for me. I'm usually a small and this is for sure more of a medium. Is really decent fabric though so I may be able to have it taken in.
3.0,These didn’t stay up and slid down to my knees. They stretched out too quickly so really only worked for one use.
3.0,"These earrings are pretty, but they are a tad too big for my liking. I think it's because they hang so low. Wish they had been smaller."
3.0,Great shoe is helping tremendously but I wore them one day and looked down and saw that the elastic wasn't sewn in properly on side. Still a great shoe for hurting feet.
3.0,I own a lot of hats and I've been looking for a plain black mesh trucker hat like this but this one is too bulky for me.  I'll probably never wear it.
3.0,Arrived on time.  I don’t find it user friendly or it will stay when you’re sweating a lot. I felt uncomfortable using since I feel it will come out eventually.
3.0,"Cute, true colors, great padding and runs really small. I am an A cup and wish I bought an XL."
3.0,Padding is weird
3.0,i wouldn't go by the sizes they say here.  i thought purchasing a large sounded too big and i was right.  go with the size you normally are.  not enough lumbar support for me either.
3.0,I ordered my normal bra size but when I got the bra it was way too small. Also the snap in the front was a different and hard to clasp.<br /><br />I will return for a refund
3.0,"This took a while to receive and runs small (with short arms). Buy two sizes up if you want the slouchy look in the pictures. It has side slits which I didn’t realize and am not a fan of, and they look worse with the shirt not being as flowy. It’s the soft but cheep material that has a bit of a sheen and is white on the inside, so the color gets lighter where the material is stretched. The pattern (green with stars) is cute. Overall, it’s ok."
3.0,Where purchased as a gift.  She says she liked them ok
3.0,I returned it as the fit was too small and the top too short for an off the shoulder top.  I would have been arrested!
3.0,This is a somewhat sexy robe. A little long and does not stay closed and tied.  You have to continue tying it so it is a bit of a hassle.  I just end up keeping it open.
3.0,Thinner than expected. Hard to screw in as the screw is attached to the tree which is very thin and round and makes it hard to grasp when trying to screw it in. Size is perfect.
3.0,These are huge. Not what I expected but I can wear them with tall boots just fine. They do feel nice. Worth what I paid but no more.
3.0,The hat itself is cute and presentable but it is definitely too small. I purchased the 5-10 size and it fits my 3year old perfectly. It’s too small on my 10 year old.
3.0,Tailoring of side pocket openings balloons.
3.0,"Kind of thin material, doesn't compress very well. I do love the dinosaur print though!!"
3.0,Not much support for my liking .
3.0,This dress runs small. I wear size 4 or small in almost everything. For this one I had to get a medium and it fits me like normal small sizes. Also be aware you may want to wear a slip under it. But I like the dress and it is flattering.
3.0,"They are cute, and soft, but my kids complain that the feet are too light and uncomfortable. Everywhere else it fits fine though. I tried to cut the elastic around the ankle to make it better, but they still say the heal and sole of the foot feel &#34;weird&#34;."
3.0,The material was fabulous. Loved everything about it except it was about 3 inches shorter than the picture. Barely covered my bra unfortunately. Would have loved it if it would’ve been longer
3.0,The fit was perfect. Fabric is really nice. The only issue I had is that it was a bit see through. Wearing a slip underneath would be suggested
3.0,"Not sure how dexterous I am compared to the rest of the male population, but could not twist around the right way to get these attached.  Fair warning to those considering a purchase."
3.0,"This bathing suit is made pretty well, considering the fact that it's only about 10 bucks. I definitely would have kept if it fitted me perfectly.<br />I am a size 6 and wear 27/28 in pants. Found that the bottoms were a little too tight."
3.0,If I ordered again I would go up a size as they do run a little small and I want crazy about the dirty look so I would also order a different color. My main purpose was to get some jeans that didn’t hurt my back and it appears as these are going to achieve my goal.
3.0,Really like the pattern and got lots of compliments. Unfortunately the colors faded when I washed it. Not as cute as it once was but would still recommend if your looking for a soft but flowy top.
3.0,"Way way way too big.  The dress is gorgeous and totally worth it (material, design) but it's way bigger than expected and the zipper sucks."
3.0,More gold color then pictured.
3.0,"I received the necklace in the stipulated time frame. It is very nice. Lightweight, but not flimsy as others have stated. It looks expensive. I am happy with my purchase.<br />Update: I used it for a couple of weeks. It did annoy me in that it would knot a bit. Furthermore, it oxidized and lost a fair amount of its go!d color. It is a good buy for very occasional use as it looks really good, but not if you plan to wear it a lot, you would be better off investing in a higher quality piece. I removed two stars because of this."
3.0,"not a good deal, okay product"
3.0,It's cute but my husband said it's very itchy.
3.0,Nice colours. But way too big to be practical. I have 3 pierces in each ear and these are literally 3 pierces wide. Ended up giving away.
3.0,"Sad, I got size small should have got xs."
3.0,the charm is cute BUT it is bigger than the typical Pandora sized charm so it does look authentic at all.  I am keeping it because I have an empty section on my bracelet so it fills it up pretty nicely.
3.0,not to tight but it smells weird and makes a sound when you walk but when you have thunder thighs you kind of expect that.
3.0,"These are well made, but are quite slippery if that makes sense. I also suspect they will not fit everyone's face - I imagine having to adjust and pull it up repeatedly. They're a comfortable material, in that they aren't super-tight and don't choke when worn around the neck, are also breathable as described. I can't really imagine how anyone could be TOO active in these though, without them falling down. (maybe it's just my face shape?) Haven't tried them outside in the cold yet, so can't speak to their warmth factor."
3.0,Not as blue as pictured. I still love these but they don't match with the necklace I intended to wear them with. The blue in the picture is a perfect match but when they showed up they were extremely pale blue.
3.0,this is a great shirt . to small to be a large  would cost more to send it back so I gave it to someone else
3.0,"I bought this dress for a wedding and it fit perfectly!  My husband and daughter loved it on me! BUT... The day of the wedding, getting dressed in our hotel room, I asked my husband to zip up the back for me.  He zipped it up and once the zipper reached the top, the entire zipper opened all the way down.  He had to remove the zipper from one side at the top so I could take the dress off.  And then, in a panic, we had to find the nearest women's clothing store to buy a new dress just 20 minutes before the ceremony.  Thankfully there was a Marshalls nearby and we scored a little black dress for only $14.99. We were both completely bummed.  We ❤️ this dress!!"
3.0,Fits great everywhere but small in rear
3.0,"I bought them to use to protect myself from asthma triggers. They arrived with a strong chemical smell which is an asthma trigger so could not wear them right away. Had to air them out for days, then clean and spray them to reduce the small so I could wear them."
3.0,I may have a big head but nornally dont have problems. This band however is a bit tight and gives me head aches if I wear too long. It so super cute however and would wear it more if it wasnt so tight. The fabric is also super soft!!
3.0,"Color on pants is not white as featured, but some random beige. Heads up before you purchase - Captain America in red, white and beige? I think not, however my kiddo unboxed these Captain America PJs, so regardless of the non-match and well, a little off on the CA + USA branding, they belong to us - mom speak."
3.0,The slit for the crotch opening goes up a bit high to the waistband. Looked odd on me as I have a bit of a belly.
3.0,Not a true fit
3.0,"Thin cotton, fits really small on me n certainly nothing like pic advertised. Haven't washed or worn yet so can't comment on the durability of same. Received plain and floral colors."
3.0,"Long torso = tight in the shoulders.  But as this was my first body suit, I'm pretty happy with it."
3.0,"REALLY small, they aren't kidding about that one size fits most. I think they literally mean 51% of the population. I wear large in mens. :/"
3.0,Much smaller than advertised. Don’t actually close. The captive bead is fake and it’s a cheap metal like aluminum. Break easily. Even with the cheap price they aren’t worth it at all.
3.0,"The backs are incredibly small, I have to use the small plastic piece included in the packaging to make the ball sit properly as the back does not go very far onto the post. They do the job with no allergic reaction, but the back--needing two tiny pieces each--makes putting them on or taking them off extremely nerve racking."
3.0,Nice but you get what you pay for. Nothing negative to say about.
3.0,It's a beautiful ring but it is not sterling silver it is some cheap knock off from China which will turn your finger green as soon as the black wears off as you read in the detail that will tell you to put clear fingernail polish on it of course at the price you understand that it's most likely fake it is pretty but it's not sterling silver
3.0,"The seams started to seperate my first time wearing it. You get what you pay for. I reinforced it and now it's fine. But if you aren't capable or willing to do so, don't bother with this."
3.0,A little see through and a bit loose
3.0,"Felt like a rag, it did not fit me at all. I'm a tall girl."
3.0,"Washed mask and put on for about 20 minutes. It doesn’t adjust to your breathing. It just sucks in your breath till you have to physically move it to talk to another person. I found it difficult to breathe and talk properly. They shipped fast, and colors are beautiful, but not very good when wearing more than a minute"
3.0,Super cheaply made. They worked for a one time wear for a costume and then I trashed them.
3.0,A little smaller than I expected and one pair already had a hole just from the first wash (without ever wearing them). I was hoping that these would cover my toes but they come just short and fall of my heel repeatedly.
3.0,"This product was good. Just, the legs in the pants were weird one was about 3-4 inches longer than the other."
3.0,"I bought this for my 3-year-old and everywhere we go she gets compliments. I would LOVE to give it five stars, but after only two washes the ruffle in the front started to fray. I was able to trim it a little so it doesn't look too bad, but it's definitely frayed. :("
3.0,These dainty little earrings were very shiny and pretty at first so I wore them frequently when I first bought them.  Then I noticed the shininess of the rhinestones or whatever the decoration is lost its luster quickly!
3.0,Very thin socks.  Time will tell how they hold up.
3.0,"The fit is really nice, but I couldn't get over the swishy sound. It was VERY loud. I will need to find someplace to wear it--maybe the club--as it is not work appropriate"
3.0,I will say this is a super cute hoodie. The top is thinner than the bottom I typically wear a 2x in shirts and 20 in pants. Its snug only as I pull over my hips but the arms and the top are a good length. I don't regret this purchase it is very cute but if you have wider hips it can be snug at the bottom.
3.0,"The color is nice, material is good. It doesn't look cheap. The arms are a little tight. Bought it months ago...have never worn it."
3.0,Very thin. You have to wear something underneath
3.0,"The taps themselves were very good. But, the nails that we received with them were ""junk"". The heads were too big to go into the recessed portion of the taps. They were too short, and were not ringed nails as advertised. My husband had to buy nails that would do the job."
3.0,"Soft, cozy, warm.  Team color and logo are spot on.  Works as a “slipper sock.”  Too thick, loose and floppy to wear with shoes.  Slips all over foot with no grip at all to hold them in place."
3.0,"Look nice. Good price point. HOWEVER, says for men or women, but packaging says women’s glasses and the over the ear piece was too short for man’s head."
3.0,"Got it for my wife, she loves it. Always hesitant to order clothes online, but it was exactly what I expected. Good product.<br />Update.... ok, have to update this review as the pocket totally ripped after two days. Picture attached."
3.0,This jacket run small and is made of polyester blend it's not what I was really looking for
3.0,Have to be Xs to look cute
3.0,Looks great but sadly the quality of the fabric is pretty low to where its itchy/scratchy on skin. sad too as the design with good fabric could sell really well!!
3.0,"Really cute , but turned brassy/ copper like quickly"
3.0,"My foot is a size 7. It's just ok, I find that it slips round a little too much on my manduka mat. The eXTend socks are a better fit."
3.0,Purchased stud earring set for my niece's birthday. She recently added a second piercing to her ears and I thought these would be perfect. Since her birthday is in August I was glad one if the colors was peridot. Was very disappointed with both the peridot and amethyst colors. You could barely tell what colors they were since they were extremely light in color.
3.0,"The bag is very well constructed, but the color was very off from what you see online. I expected a nice mocha colored bag, but what I got was nearly black (I ordered cafe).  The bag also did not hold the shape quite like I expected.  For these reasons, I'm returning it.  I will say that so far, my return has been a seamless process."
3.0,Not cool
3.0,It was a simple mask. Not really high quality or fancy but still fun. A little small around the nose.
3.0,"I like the color of these boots.  My son plays and works hard, so his shoes need to be tough.  These boots are good for fancy wear like to school or church, but the boots lack durability.<br /><br />If you have a little cowboy/cowgirl who is going to USE these boots, consider a different brand.  If you have a kiddo that wear boots on occasion these will do the job."
3.0,"I  am 162 cm tall (5 ft 4 inches), 51 kg (112 pounds) with 34B cup, 63 cm waist and 95 cm hips. This dress was a bit bulky in chest but good fit on waist and draped around my hips. Still the look was not super flattering, I prefer tighter sitting dresses around chest line.<br /><br />The under skirt was not floor length (approximately knee low) so the dress skirt was a bit see through below the knee level, which did not look good on the photos.<br />I returned the dress"
3.0,Just too big.
3.0,"I was disappointed. Jeans are great color, good quality but the cut is weird and actually sags, no lift at all."
3.0,"Works<br />The big end could use some work, it is much rougher than I had expected it to be.  Order some steel wool with it and expect to spend a couple of hrs smoothing out the sharp edge.  I know, it is the trailing edge but, it will still leave internal scratches."
3.0,Very small frames and I even have a narrow face. Nice color but too small for adult and not listed in description.
3.0,"I bought these to use as a scarf when running in the winter and they work just fine (for about 30 minutes at 20F).  As a 'snood' pulled up they are too short, and there's a gap and the back of my neck; they're also a little tight worn that way.  There's a great choice of colour combinations, but they are cheap and you definitely get what you pay for."
3.0,Rode to word the other day in 27°  and they kept me warm. The thighs are tight but once you get them on  they are wearable.
3.0,The bands come off pretty easily so I’m afraid to stick my hand out the window when I’m driving . The littlest thing they bump into sometimes undos them
3.0,Very see through. Make sure you wear nude under garments.. wash on gentle cycle and let air dry
3.0,This shirt was so cute but extremely small. I usually wear a medium in US so I ordered a large because it comes in Asian sizes and even a large was too small. I should have ordered a 2X to fit perfectly. Guess I will have to donate this to good will. Disappointed!
3.0,"It looks like the picture,  but it doesn't stay in place. The satin bow does not stay tied. I'll sew it to something to make it work."
3.0,"The ears were very nice, I gave this product 3 stars because the packing was missing tail and bow. I didn’t need the bow but I did need the ears. I emailed the company but no reply still. If it wasn’t for the price I would return due to missing item and lack of communication"
3.0,"I don’t know why I thought this shirt would fit. Well it fits, but not like I traditionally like my t-shirt’s to fit. I definitely don’t like them to be fitted. I like mine to fit loosely. So, when I ordered this Goranbon shirt in an XL, I should have ordered up. It seems to be more of a fitted style. The style of fabric is waffle, but you can see through (thin) the material. So I would suggest wearing a tank or something underneath. And finally, what I do like is that the color is white and can be worn with anything - a skirt, shorts, jeans or khakis. So out of 5 stars, I would give it 3."
3.0,"looks  a little funny, couldn't figure how to wear it, it doesn't quite hang right, wouldn't buy it again"
3.0,Nice watch just wish the face was bigger.
3.0,"Cute, but I did not pay attention to the dimensions, and was shocked at how tiny.  LOL"
3.0,"It fits as expected, but I am only 5'3"" and it sits above my ankle, so I wouldn't say it long, especially for taller people. And there is a seam right down the front that isn't aligned, but no seam down the back. Poor design. Otherwise, would have been a great but at half the price."
3.0,"We purchased this dress as part of a costume for my daughter. Thankfully we read the reviews first because it is absolutely not true to size in the least.<br />She wears a size 16, but the dress size we ordered was a 3X. It fit very well, and the material has a bit of stretch, as opposed to being stiff, which was comfortable for her.<br />For the price, it's a cute dress, which she's able to wear again, not just as a costume."
3.0,I love the color and length. I ordered Ann large. It wears like a large. I prefer large but I order large to have some five when I wash it. I won’t place this dress in the dryer; I may send it back for the next size.
3.0,"The dress was too small, but I love the style so I gave it to a friend and ordered another one a size larger."
3.0,Cool shirt but colors are different- the print is a combination of bright neon colors but does contain neon PINK. Surprised when the shirt arrived. My kid still thought it was great!
3.0,Giving it as a present to a friend:  not for men!
3.0,"You get what you pay for, not the greatest quality but it’s also not complete poop. It does change colors and start to rust. It’s okay for an once in a while wear but not every day."
3.0,They were filthy after our grandson wore them one time! I guess I should have sprayed them with a repellent.
3.0,"I don't know what dress the rest of the reviewers were trying on that said they needed to size up. I think it fit a little too loose for a body-con dress. Also, the material was a bit more casual than expected."
3.0,The socks are somewhat large. But they are very warm and comfortable.
3.0,"If you are looking for a dark royal blue this is not what you want. It does look dark royal blue in the picture, but it is actually more of a true navy blue. More of an indigo"
3.0,it's relatively smaller than standard. lucky that i ordered 2 size larger so i can still use it......
3.0,"Kind of bulky a little noticable and the hat fits small. It fits small on me and doesn't fit my husband I hope it stretches out because it's a little tight. I still have to hide that there are headphones by positioning it corectly and they are spaced by inside by velcro much differently than my ears. It's not much different from wearing my beats under a beanie but a little more comfortable and less layers. Music play life is listed on the box as five hours and talk time 8 hours. I like that the light changes colors when it's finished charging. Charging time is about an hour. Honestly I wish the beanie was a little thicker. It's thinner than a normal beanie. Even though it's tight on me when I wear it the top of my ears are still cold underneath because the thinness of the material, I thought about wearing a headband to help with this but then what would be the point at all. For me the point of this is less layers but I think I will still have to wear my hood outside while walking my dog and listening to these speakers. The headset inside does look like speakers or like cheap head sets with out the phone pads."
3.0,This was a bit too short for my 5'9 legs. It was nice light weight fabric.
3.0,"A medium is tiny. I am typically a med. Or large. This top is made of thin cheap material. Returning, will not buy again."
3.0,"Used this swimsuit in Aruba, had fun in it! Even though, the yellow top is slightly a different tone from the one on the bottoms.  The top has removable cups and it is somewhat see-through... I would have liked thicker fabric for the top and a bit more support."
3.0,I'm a 32c and weight 130 and my boobs are at risk of spilling out
3.0,thin frame
3.0,It's a pretty cool mask it's just kind of cheesy the hair doesnt stick out like the pic at all
3.0,"The dress is well-made, but it is just too long for me. I'm under 5 feet, the top part fits ok but it reaches down to my ankles."
3.0,"It is a pretty and dainty little necklace, but the gold color is darker like you see in cheaper gold necklaces. I also thought the clasp was a little harder to fasten myself, but I did eventually get it, and it should be less of a problem with help.<br />The pearls are not completely uniform, but I think the subtle differences in them are neat.<br />I will definitely still be wearing the necklace because it is pretty overall."
3.0,"Little underwhelmed about this hat, like its design, but the medium is too snug For me and I don't love enough to order a large"
3.0,This product definitely fits smaller. I typically wear a medium but bought a large and it was snug.
3.0,"the lenses fit tight in the case, is  not for the ones I have  :("
3.0,"Thought that the stones were a blush pink, they are clear with some pink around the edges. Came in some interesting packaging though."
3.0,"I love the slippers but they are unraveling before my very eyes.  Every day there are more yarn strings hanging.<br />I like them enough to buy another pair.  They are soft, warm and comfortable."
3.0,"I loved cute design and floral print. But I had to return.<br />Good: Floral print is beautiful and nice design.<br />Bad: Fabric is too thin, to me I could only wear around house. Fabric does not stretch at all, so you may need order size up. Straps are not study.<br />Other: Medium is too big around chest (I'm 36C or 36D depend on company), waist and hips fits nice. If I size down, it maybe not fits well anyway."
3.0,Pants were to small in the waist. I ordered a 16 and it was like putting a 14 on him.  Shirt n vest fine.  We r doung easter pics so I want dress slacks so now I have to order dress slacks on top of the price of this outfit.  But just fyi it does look good with Jeans!
3.0,such a cute shirt --- I'd ordered a 2XL and it appears to be a Youth large....  Very disappointed
3.0,I assumed colors would be more vibrant.
3.0,Super cute but lasted for 3 months and cannot read the words
3.0,Nice shirt but OMG small. I wear a medium normally and this fit like a kids large. Would need to order  XL.
3.0,Nice looking watch.  Not to crazy about the double clasp.  Feels uncomfortable on the skin. Too heavy.
3.0,"They're adorable & very true to picture, only downside is I can only wear them for a few hours, any longer & they really start to irritate my earlobes bad."
3.0,As other reviews stated -a sticker on a necklace...Put in our dress up box instead of to the friend I was going to give it to.
3.0,The bottom portion was really cute and flirty but the waist fit really strange.  Sits really low on hips.
3.0,"I've worn a number of different compression socks, specifically for running. Product fits small in the ankle area and there seems extra material in the overall foot.  Hard to put on and take off  due to the tightness in the ankle area.  Fit feels weird with the excessive material.  Hoping they loosen up some with washing and wear."
3.0,"Got medium, fits a bit tight on the forearm near elbow. Using it in a tropical climate, a bit uncomfortable with sweat and upper arm tightness but it does the job, bills have to be folded, cc ok. Zipper works very well. I would recommend product."
3.0,I ordered a size 8 for my toddler. He’s really a size 7 and they were sooooo tiny! It says 8 on them!
3.0,"This was gift for my nephew for his first Holy Communion.  It is a nice looking piece BUT I rated lower b/c it was supposed to come with a resizing tool & it did not.  I purposely purchased this one just for the tool, knowing it was going on a child w/ smaller wrists.  Unfortunately my sister-in-law didn't lmk until just last week!"
3.0,they came quickly and I like the design
3.0,Material doesn't look as nice in person as it does in the photo...
3.0,"Absolutely beautiful band BUT doesn’t last. This Fitbit Versa band was a beauty, great fit meets style. Loved it so much I was extra careful not to get it wet & swapped it out when exercising. Despite my care after 3months the rose gold is fading and the white is yellowing, sadly it’s time is already coming to an end!!!!"
3.0,I love these but the post are too large to fit my hole. I compared to my other earring (included in picture) and the are really large.i can get one of the gold one's in but that's it.
3.0,They don’t present the quality I was expecting based on advertising.
3.0,I bought a large thinking that they would be a little big but when I tried them on it was a little more like a medium.  Loved the design though
3.0,"I was a little dissapointed with these. I saw many great reviews for these shorts so I chose them for my spinning class. I wasn't even halfway through spin class and I was in a lot of pain. My friend bought these same shorts and had the same problem. Needless to say, I was bruised for about two weeks..."
3.0,Got this to try it out. It's OK but I think it could have been better with tighter straps especially if you don't have huge thighs.
3.0,"This dress is cute, but it has a lot of  materiial and it's thick. I was looking for a lightweight, t-shirt dress for spring and summer. I'm also talk and this dress fit me more like a midi dress. Overall, just didn't work for me."
3.0,The sizing runs a solid half a size smaller. I'm having to return the item. Even though it's beautiful.
3.0,I really like this dress. It’s comfortable and loose fitting looks great with a denim jacket and some cute boots. Love that it has pockets
3.0,Wife likes it.  It fits ok. But could be a little longer at the waistline
3.0,Cute little flower ring only thing I don't like is it is starting to turn my finger green
3.0,"This jacket is pretty good. I only got it yesterday, but it was good for today (30degrees F). I am really glad I ordered two sizes up. I usually am always a medium, but based on other reviews I decided to get two sizes up because I wear blazers and sweaters underneath my jacket usually. I am really glad I did! Fits me well, being an XL and I was able to comfortably wear a blazer underneath."
3.0,"Pretty, but but flimsy"
3.0,Really like the skirt but since it runs small the most popular size seems to be the one I now need. Size medium which usually runs loose on me was to small in this skirt. I hope I can get a black large if they ever have one again.
3.0,"The pants are beautiful no frays or stray threads….<br />Great sharp color…<br />The pleats and the v shape above them are beautiful and can rock a perfect 80s working 9 to five look…<br />The fabric is very thin… before I opened the package I thought it was the wrong one Bc it was so light! The waist of the pant is very small…<br />To get the look like the model I need to go up to 2x but then I am worried the rest of the pant will look baggy and unprofessional<br />Honestly not sure what to do , I love the pants but can’t currently wear them"
3.0,Was purchase as a Birthday gift.  The birthday girl loved it.
3.0,Waist band gets weird after a few washes. Material is very comfortable and fits well. Just don’t put them in the dryer and they might last a long time?
3.0,I like the design of the earrings but the bronze material is very thin.
3.0,It is a very cute gymnastics outfit it fits well but is a little thin. Maybe because the color is light?
3.0,Really beautiful but broke easily so overall disappointing.
3.0,The dress and belt were  exactly as pictured and size was not a problem.  But the HAT .... WAY TOO SMALL.. I gave it to my granddaughter who's 4.  I'll have to buy another hat  :(
3.0,i don't like the feel and they aren't well made.
3.0,too gold
3.0,Unfortunately the silver was rusted when I received it. And the rope chain was also rusted on the clasps. The crystal itself is lovely but kind of disappointed.
3.0,Visually product is very attractive but the bracelet bands are different lengths so it doesn't sit right on my arm with some bands budging or hanging out instead of laying down. Also the items due to the over slack in bands clump up and flip inside out. Since the cost is really low I gave it a 3 star instead of lower. Colors and size are fairly represented just the fit and construction of assembled product are off.
3.0,"Top is much shorter than expected, and loose. Not as flattering as it looks, but ok for a casual bum around top. Colors are pretty!"
3.0,Very sml
3.0,"I just got this up. its nice, but it requires 175 # counterweight on the cross bars. I can not think of anything that weighs that much. it would require a good number of bags of sand and would not look good. I drilled some holes and lag bolted it to my deck. In the picture it shows each section in a different position ( one of the reasons I purchased it). if it does I haven't figured it out yet. It was easy to put together."
3.0,"Shorts are comfy, nice color and under layer fits great. The outer layer does run small...and doesn't have that nice roomy look that product pictures show. If you want that look, size up!"
3.0,"Disappointed because the pic shows the hat with a dark brown ribbon. Mine came and the ribbon was the same color as the hat. Its a lil small,  & packaging was terrible! Its gon take a lot to get this hat to its original shape! It's cute tho."
3.0,It's okay.. but it was very cheaply made
3.0,I wish they would just do better on the sizing on the size chart
3.0,"The print is nice. The straps are scary-flimsy. Will definitely need some support in the straps. Somehow, the way the dress is cut, my 34D/DD bust appeared flat. The material is nice. I ordered size according to company's sizing chart. It was probably one or two sizes too large. It skimmed my body, but it didn't &#34;hug&#34; anything, or &#34;accentuate&#34; anything. I really really wanted to love this dress. I ordered another in a smaller size and with a different &#34;skirt&#34; portion, from the same company. Hoping for a better fit."
3.0,"This is a good-looking watch and a great deal for the money ...just one problem. It is almost impossible to tell the time, at a glance. They needed to make the hour and minute hands white. Such an easy fix! If they did that, I would give it 5 stars."
3.0,"Cheap, cheap, cheap material. The snap on the shoulder is weird- it reminds me of a nursing top and it constantly comes unsnapped. Better if you have a small bust."
3.0,Great looking but feels light and cheap.
3.0,Bought it for the gym and it’s a tad bit too small but still manageable
3.0,"Not the color I expected.  It's 80s flourescent pink as opposed to the muted rose of the photo.  The &#34;Atomic&#34; in the color name, I suppose, should have given me a clue.  Otherwise a very nice top."
3.0,I would not give this to anyone as a gift. You can buy for yourself and wear. The only reason why I would not give as a gift because of how it's cheaply made. I like some of the necklaces but not all. I prefer a more sturdy type of choker. These chokers are more like for an special occasion but not everyday use.
3.0,"The knit on this is a nice medium weight, but it is very short and all the openings ""roll"".  Other than being too short, it fit as expected.  Just a meh"
3.0,The size is a bit off I wear 38 pants but the 38 belt is one inch too short
3.0,"The dress is put together oddly. Tight in the shoulder,  big in the hips. Loose in the boobs.<br />My measurements are 36 - 34 - 37 I weigh 140 and am 5' 3&#34;<br />Just strange how it fits."
3.0,Love the towel! Currently use for backseat cover in car cuz I dont like the way material feels.
3.0,It is very cute but to small
3.0,It ships fast. Just right!
3.0,Meh. I wasn't totally impressed. Returned bc the material was thin and it just didn't look right on me. Wouldn't recommend for larger chested women.
3.0,"This watch is very sleek looking, it was a bit to small for my wrist, I should have read the description. But nice overall"
3.0,i did not like it
3.0,A bit too large to be a size 12.  I should have ordered size 10.
3.0,"Not quite what I expected. It is pretty, but too dainty for what I want to give it for. It is more suited for a young girl rather than an adult gift."
3.0,"Contrary to the product description, there is no pocket for the filter.  The mask came with 2 filters to be attached with double sided tape, which is not acceptable as it puts the filter next to the mouth, rather than cloth being next to the mouth. This is unfortunate as the mask is very well constructed, and the pattern is as depicted."
3.0,This dual colored silicone ring fits well and stretches less than most other brands. My only grief is that the top color wears off. No one can notice other than the wearer.
3.0,"I ordered a mens large for my husband who always wears a large in shirts. He is 6’3 and about 190 lbs. he tried this on and it was WAY too short. There was plenty of room in the chest and body of the shirt but it was so short like a crop top and the sleeves came to above his wrists. I tried it on to see how it got me I am 5’5 I typically take a women's medium and this fits me for length and in the sleeves. It’s of course too roomy though. So the sizing of this is really off vs any other flannel shirt my husband wears in a large.<br />The shirt itself was a nice medium weight flannel, we liked the pattern. It had a strong odor coming out of the packaging but with a wash that issue is gone."
3.0,"I had to return these, mainly because they are too short but also one pair arrived with a large snag on the inseam."
3.0,Cute. But cheap material.
3.0,"i bought this shoe last year. great shoe, it's just to large. maybe a 7 would fit perfect."
3.0,"Beautiful, however easy to come off. I lost two of them 😭"
3.0,"I loved this when it first came, but on the first time wearing it it broke, the prettiest part the heart fell off, I couldn't find it.:( I guess  you get what you pay for!"
3.0,"i think its pretty but the picture is prettier, bought it as a gift for someone and ended up buying them something else because it just looks cheap. as costume jewelry or for a kid it would be great"
3.0,Size is definitely not adult more child size
3.0,They are ok for the price
3.0,"Kind of hard to put on an adult ear lobe, but other than that very cute, and great for sensitive ears."
3.0,"I thought these would be really fun to add to my holiday earring collection, but I think they will stay in my jewelry box. They seem hastily put together, and the greenery around Santa's neck won't lay down nicely. They are also very heavy on my ears and made them sore. I haven't even worn them a full day, and likely won't be because they are uncomfortable. Maybe other pairs are made a little better, but I was pretty disappointed in mine."
3.0,ok I supposed
3.0,"Beautiful the first time I wore the black pair. However, the threads frayed and are not silky and straight like the first time I wore them."
3.0,Order one size larger...runs small
3.0,Cute too runs small though and short if you lift your arms you will bare skin
3.0,This top us well made and very cute but for me didn’t fit quite like I wished.
3.0,Pretty but hard to open and close the fit bit inside the pendant
3.0,It was more than two days late. If your buying this DON'T buy it last second or you will not get it on time. Quality was fine
3.0,"Shirt fit great and not see through. Pants, see through and kept falling down."
3.0,didn't measure my seat my BAD it suck have to pay return shipping should have read return policy<br /> buyer beware. can't comment on seats comfort because it would fit my bike seat.[[ASIN:B014T7V1X4 Gel Top Cruiser / Comfort Bicycle Seat Cushion Cover - Bike Saddle Topper]]
3.0,"This bag was cute while it lasted, but after a little while the material the bag is made of started cracking and peeling away… Needless to say it did not look very nice."
3.0,"My wife likes these earrings very much. That said, the picture depicts a much more vibrant shade of red than you will observe in person unless you're in direct sunlight."
3.0,Although hat is like many hats with the plastic sizing bands on the back. This hat is at the last notch and the hat looks small on my head.
3.0,Nice fabric. Pleating done nicely. Fit is off...runs small. Order next size up.
3.0,"Was hoping for more for the price. The bifocal area is very visible, the product pictured on Amazon is not accurate for what the lens actually looks like.  I was hoping the mirror coating would hide the reader lens, but the reader portion appears to be applied to the outside of the lens - you can see and feel the raised bump.  If you are interesting in sunglasses where others can't see the readers, keep looking."
3.0,The color on the website is not reflective of the color delivered.
3.0,Awful dress. Sized up per reviews and it was huge on me!! Also this is a true rose gold not regular gold at all. I'm 5'2&#34; 125 34 DD and I was swimming in a medium
3.0,its cool to rock but the gold starts to faded away after 2 months
3.0,Cheap bands but very nice looking diffusers. I put the black band on my daughter and on the first day you can see the string from it. I wish I knew of where to get replacement bands.
3.0,I wish the lights were multi colored but other than that it was good. The only other complaint I have its the battery box it anoying since it is installed near the head band instead of putting it up near the top of the hat
3.0,Its ok...thought it was bigger but its very tiny.
3.0,"The fabric is pretty thin, it's cute and is a little loose, but I have to wear white under garments."
3.0,"Well, I should say this thing would be hard to wear on the head for Hijabies because it's so big. The color is exact, material is soft and nice but I'm returning it because I can't wear it. It would be nice to use as a neck scarf tho."
3.0,An ok product..good company not excited about this product
3.0,They pill after 1-2 wears
3.0,VERY COMFORTABLE BUT FEW<br />POCKETS. NONE ARE DEEP
3.0,I like them but when it is time to charge it hard to connect it to the charger
3.0,"I don’t like wrinkles. I ironed the coverup before I wore it. It was a wrinkled mess w minutes after putting it on. I like the cut, look and color. Use some other material."
3.0,"It is alright, but not exactly what I thought it would be!"
3.0,"I like the fit and length. The fabric, however, is interesting, and not the type of fabric I am accustomed to for use in classes, i.e. Pilates or Yoga, It is shiny, and just seems different. I will keep these for limited use, because they were inexpensive and I walk outdoors in the winter when it rains. For this use, it will be fine."
3.0,"A little too big, I should have sized down"
3.0,Ordered the wrong size.
3.0,"As a woman who is between regular and petite sizes, they were just too long on me. Very nice piece of clothing, just not right for me."
3.0,Loved it have gone back and bought other colors. Cute and comfortable.
3.0,hard to use opens weird
3.0,Bought to use for Mardi Gras Fat Tuesday party. Didn't end up wearing. Was a little too tight. Definitely need to size up.  Great colors though.
3.0,Scared it will break in my tongue
3.0,Have to be really careful so the wires don’t get caught in the converse belt
3.0,"Very pretty, but too small.  I wear a 42DD and I felt the cup size was too small for me.  My girls were squashed and squishing out the sides."
3.0,"I haven't worn this yet, the material was very thin and see through."
3.0,Not very good shape
3.0,"Size is correct. Shirt looks great.<br />I thought it would be softer material.<br />I have sensitive skin and need super soft material. I couldn't wear it for a long time.<br />It is not warm, which is what I wanted, but if you want warm, this is not it."
3.0,Super cute and super small but totally retro.. awesome earrings for an great price.  super cute for clubs and parties.. I try to wear them as much as possible
3.0,The scarf is cute.  It's not as big as the picture makes it seem and it's more of an orange color than red.
3.0,"The accessories were easily torn off by my 2.5 year old and scary for 1 year old to be around. I recommend the shoes, but not the little decorations."
3.0,"Definitely cool glasses. But, they do not seem to be photochromatic. I have had them in various light situations and they do not seem to change at all. I am confused. But, they are pretty cool none-the-less. Great for night driving in a well lit light polluted place. Have not tried them otherwise"
3.0,The earrings were a but smaller than I expected but still cute for my two year old. The screw backs were did not hold and we lost an earring 2 weeks after ordering.
3.0,band has a couple of seams that rub. this is a knock off of SUUNTO. but it gets the job done
3.0,Good material. I wear a medium normally. Ordered this is XL and it was still to small!
3.0,"Dress is a good design, but the fabric is the cheap polyester or nylon type fabric, which has stretch but I don't like. In addition to bad fabric, the bust doesn't fit. I have a C cup, so I feel like filling it out in a Medium shouldn't be an issue, but it is.<br />The halter doesn't rest easy and can feel tight if the dress gets pulled down.<br />Cute design, but not totally practical or well executed."
3.0,This is a cute dress but it’s very short. So short that I decided to wear this as a tunic under leggings. But it looks good!
3.0,I like the glasses for reading and computer use. The 3 stars are because the screws come loose on a daily basis.
3.0,Was okay ish eh
3.0,"Bought this for my husband to use at wrestling, was super excited, but then opened it and noticed one of the horns/spikes on the top of the goggles was missing. We found it and the screw in the bag- after several attempts of trying to mend it I discovered that the screw was not long enough for it by only a couple of tiny threads.<br />Husband decided to just take the other top horn/spike off and wear them anyway for the show."
3.0,I love the top its just made way to small.  Rating is due to my liking for the top however it is made way to small!!
3.0,"This seemed like a high quality item, but after only a month the stitching is coming loose and the wallet is falling apart. Such a bummer because it looked awesome, but it’s only a matter of time before I’m back on the market for another cool wallet."
3.0,it came small
3.0,"Chain was twisted, but the cat was super cute. 2.5ish stars.<br /><br />This was a gift for a friend. She said it wasn't that twisted but meh."
3.0,The shirt is still working a year later however the pants ripped
3.0,"Loved the color and feel of the fabric, but the fabric is very thin."
3.0,"Purchased these shorts for wearing in the woods and for ATV creek riding. They are comfortable and have a good amount of pockets, some with zippers which is handy for ATV riding and wanting items secured. However the sizes are super weird and tend to run small. As an example I am 5-4 and weight 150 lbs. Generally I wear a size 34 waist shorts and jeans as I like some room. I ordered the 2 XXL figuring I might get some wear out of them in the fall when I like to wear thermals underneath cargo shorts when riding. These came and fit me almost exactly. No real extra room. I kept them as figured the next size up might be too large, and the length was what I liked as they were just slightly past the knee. I road in the creek with them, they are somewhat waterproof, and dried super fast. I like them, might even purchase a 2nd pair, but do some thinking around that size chart if you pick up a pair."
3.0,"Great pants, but at least one size too small!  14 was too small!"
3.0,Came as expected. Cheap price. Top fit but no support. No underwire but padded nicely. Not something to swim in.. Mainly for sunbathing. Bottoms fit good and super cute
3.0,"This is a beautiful bag, but it does not fit my 15&#34; laptop.  The padded section for the laptop is too small.  Info misleading."
3.0,"The dress was cute but didn’t really look like the photos, the color was a lot different and so was the style, it was more loose fitting"
3.0,"I was so excited to get this set. It is cute, very comfortable and fit me well. When I looked at the shorts more closely though, I realized that instead of saying ""But first, coffee"" it says ""Bust."" Sure enough, if you zoom in on the picture it is wrong there too. Not a bit deal since they are for me and they are pajamas, but beware if you are buying them as a gift."
3.0,thought the purse would be a little larger with a different material
3.0,Analog portion of the watch loses time. The watch is a bit big for my 7 year old but he doesn't mind the size. His main complaint is the analog hands being off time.
3.0,"very nice size and weight, but the clasp seems too small and the loop where the clasp attaches is very thin and looks like it might fail prematurely. Sellers advice was to take it to a jeweler and pay to have it replaced.<br /><br />This is a follow up to my original review. As I expected, the clasp broke prematurely. Fortunately it fell by my side, and I found it.. The bracelet wasn't cheap and $25 to replace the clasp was unreasonable."
3.0,"I liked it ,but it was too small for me to hold my necessities. Also after the first week the strap broke. I think that this is better for little girls than girls in high school."
3.0,They are quite long
3.0,"Bought this dress for family photos. My daughter is between sizes so I ordered a 5t expecting it might be a bit big. It fits pretty well but the sleeves seem to fall awkwardly and very large. Despite having gone with the “big” size, it’s really short for my daughter who is average height for her age. Definitely will have to wear something underneath. The stock photo gives a very flowy impression but the dress itself doesn’t quite live up to that. It works for a photo session so I won’t return it, but not as cute as I expected."
3.0,"These were super cute and CHEAP, although I was disappointed that the backs were too big and constantly fall off."
3.0,"My wife is on her second one. The first one broke the first time she put it on. We sent it back and got another one, and this one came broke. We bent the link back and she has been wearing it, but I don't think it will last to long. The colors are bright and the finish is nice and shiny, looks nice for the price, but the links seem to be to thin on the bottom. We bought a couple of other pieces from this same company, and they seem more durable."
3.0,"Fit is ok, but the belt isn't low enough , it sits too high"
3.0,The ring wasn’t the right size. But my niece was able to fit it. She love the ring made a nice gift for her.
3.0,Es hermoso pero muy pequeño.
3.0,"Sadly, I returned this nicely packaged pack of compression socks. Size 11, I ordered size 11-13 so the sizing was perfect. Socks were incredibly thin, excessively, overly tight as compared to other compression socks I've bought and are using. I did return them, easily done thru seller."
3.0,Disappointed! The hat is much more red than what was posted on amazon.
3.0,"Pendant is beautiful, deep purple with some zirconia stones. However, the actual necklace chain is totally different from the pattern shown in the pictures. It looks like a cheaper version. It does not really match the quality of the pendant at all.<br />Comes in a ""coin case"" zippered bag that is not really a good fit for jewelry. For the price, I would expect better quality on the package.<br />If seller can adjust those 2 important things (necklace chain quality and package quality), it might be worth paying ~$30 for it."
3.0,Fits okay but definitely isn't as nice and baggy as the picture. I don't really think ordering a size up will help with that either.
3.0,"I'm fit enough, but this bra's band is so tight, and the straps come in such an angle, that it gives me two back mini boobs. I don't usually have that much issue with back bulge, but I can not wear this sports bra without completely covering the back.<br />Color was great. Great hold- I ran 8 min mile for 5 miles and it felt great! I just wish I didn't look like I was trying to flash people from behind :("
3.0,"For the money, it is a fairly decent hat in terms of quality.  But it is unflattering and it came with a fold that did not look like it was going away.  I was looking for a hat that would last and that I loved.  This was not it.  But for the price, it's not bad.  I'd view it as a throwaway disposable hat.  One to bring to the beach and not worry about."
3.0,"Love this suit! Top fits very well,  the bottoms not so much.  But they r also not the type of bottom I prefer to wear"
3.0,Good fit if the pouch was a bit bigger.  I’m mostly average in size but could use a larger pouch as the snaps couldn’t handle everything.
3.0,Blouse fit as expected however much too shear for winter...will wear when it warms up
3.0,"Product met my expectations. Is it possible these studs are reversible? The backs are the same size as the fronts and have a rounded polished surface similar to the fronts. Kind of a nice feature, but it makes it easier for the studs to pull through. I also can't think of any time I might want to wear silver studs."
3.0,"These are quite boxy - the photos make them look slim-fitted, but the ones I got are basically square. In short - the length and fit was very disappointing."
3.0,"The sizing advice was accurate and a large fit me well when I usually wear a medium. I also don't find the shirt to be too see-through. However, I am disappointed with the placement of the text on the tank. Mine was printed what appears to be at least a few inches lower than depicted in the photo, making the placement of the words on my body less than ideal and not clearly displayed across the flat portion of my back. See attached photo.<br /><br />Would love the shirt and give it 5 stars if it was crafted as depicted in the listing photo."
3.0,"The jewelry is cute. If you plan to wear it several times, you are out of luck. Mine came with the hook for the fastener missing. I could still close it with one of the links on the chain. Beautiful color. But, it's worth about half of what it costs."
3.0,sleeves tight
3.0,This was a gift and the recipient was going to return them.
3.0,"This necklace is cute, but could be better. It has the same quality as some necklaces that are half the price. The sizing of the neck seems to be sized for a child. I can't really tie the ribbons up to secure the necklace. I tried this necklace on my 8 year old and it doesn't even really  fit her!!! The ribbon ties are way too short. I'm thinking of returning..."
3.0,"I bought this set for my self as I loved how the hearts looked. Necklace is holding ok for now but the bracelet broke in 2 seconds after wearing it, links are very thin and don’t see the way to fix it"
3.0,It doesn’t fit well.  Too big on top.
3.0,Very soft but WAY too small. (I did use the size chart)
3.0,The quality was not the best
3.0,"I should've known that the price was too good to be true.  It looks good, wears well on the belt, but it is made of cheap material and feels so.  I gave it a three instead of one, because it does the job."
3.0,"The color and materials are as listed. The ends of the arms are tight against my head, I have a larger head (size 8 hat)."
3.0,"I ordered a black pair and a white pair and received a black pair and RED pair instead! VERY DISAPPOINTING!  As for the sunglasses, they fit very well and comfortable. I would’ve loved them and gave 5 stars had I received the colors that I PAID FOR!"
3.0,"It's a great shirt, but the fit is way off.  the photo shows a slim-fit, in reality it's a wide fit, looks baggy/sloppy."
3.0,Not compression as described
3.0,Good watch wasnt happy about the sound and mp3 feature non available
3.0,The buttons fell off as soon as i tried it on. The favorite is pretty cheap also. Expect a one time wear out of this top
3.0,This runs super small!! But so cute!!
3.0,This swimsuit is beautiful but it runs small so I ended up giving it away and ordering a bigger size in hopes that it fits because I do love it.
3.0,Excellent Product! Highly recommend to all users of the network!<br />Very Cool!<br />Loved it!<br /><br />But is not new era cap.
3.0,"Size is fine. This dress looks cheap, more like a dress up costume than an actual dress. The blue material is also itchy."
3.0,The color of the &#34;Synthetic Turquoise&#34; is so intense it looks plastic. I have average size wrists and the space between the cuff when I wear it is almost an inch so it gets hooked on things a lot. Otherwise the watch is nice enough
3.0,"Amazon is advertising these as pant, but the label clearly says ""leggings."" Very different. Change your advertising and they'll be 5 star."
3.0,"Another shirt I really wanted to keep, it fits nice and is comfortable but that gap between the buttons is to great to go it alone so you have to wear something under which isnt what I want."
3.0,I kept the size I ordered because I was going on vacation and wanted to take it with me.  I wish now I would have sent it back for a smaller size.  It runs big.
3.0,The band is to big for hand
3.0,Product was really nice but I&#34;m 5'1&#34; and I felt it was too long for me
3.0,The material is really thin. It has a cheap feeling and appearance.
3.0,It fit nice but would fold slightly on my sides
3.0,"Honestly struggling a little to figure out how this works exactly, but it may work more easily for people with a smaller bust. Doesn't seem to do much &#34;securing&#34; from what I can tell, but rather just kind of covering them, which was not the reason for my purchasing. I appreciate how inexpensive this was, however, as I don't feel like I'm out much money for trying something I had eyed frequently in retailers like VS for double or triple the cost. Will have to try it a few other times to see if I can make it work for me, but it may just not be for my size (34C). May have just been wishful thinking on my part!"
3.0,"Bra runs VERY small. I ordered the size I always wear and have many bras in the size and this barely fits. I have to use the loosest hook and it is still tight and I spill out of the cups. The fabric is fine, it looks good. I missed my return window because I was traveling for work and didn't have time to return..oh well, I'll donate it."
3.0,"The shoes have a rich color and great detail. The insoles don't seem to be &#34;stuck down&#34; very well and shifted in the shoe when I tried them on. They also run very small. I ordered one size up based upon reviews and had to return. I purchased a second pair a full size larger. The big issues I experienced were with the second pair I purchased. The shoes arrived and had been obviously worn. There was dirt and hair stuck to the bottom. The little silky knots that hold the straps were not bright red, but more of a dirty red/brown. The shoes had a bad odor. I sent the second pair back as well. The big positive, is the refund time was quick; same day as I shipped the item."
3.0,Was not meet expectations
3.0,"The are adjustable, but just not very bright."
3.0,"Product is elegant and small, perfect for what we needed. But tracking is a nightmare and the company was no help. Be prepared to wait a long time but it's beautiful"
3.0,Super cute but bottoms are definitely NOT full coverage 🤣
3.0,"Ma o menos,,  claro!! Por ese precio ta bien."
3.0,I use size S but this S was kinda XS for me.so i returned it will try M .
3.0,"Had to send it back, was too tight. The material was so soft though."
3.0,"Great price, but you get what you pay for! Seems cheap, there are loose threads, the seams aren't finished - just a raw edge beyond the stitching. The ""coral"" color is bright orange, which I like, but if you're expecting more of a pastel, you won't be happy. Strong dye smell. All that said, the fabric is super soft and lightweight, and the fit is generous in my usual size small. I also ordered a Meriwool t-shirt to compare, since the price point is higher. When that arrives, I'll decided which to keep."
3.0,"I ordered a size medium in the red colored bodysuit and every thing fit me except for my chest area. I probably should have ordered a size Large, I am a busty 34DDD and it showed a lot of cleavage. I'm not sure if the large size would've been that much better since the bodysuit is a very deep v-neck style so you will need to wear a deep plunge bra or not wear a bra at all. I will most likely need a safety pin to avoid any accidental wardrobe malfunction. Overall the material feels very stretchy and comfortable, I just wish it covered my girls up more."
3.0,Design is flattering (if you order up a size or two) and the Color/print is as pretty and vibrant...as expected.<br /><br />Cons: Material is thin. It’s low cut and gapes open. Slit offers an unwanted peep show at times. I remedied this by wearing a cami like slip with lace on the bottom. A safety pin could do the trick too.<br /><br />I bought a size large. I’m 5’5-6 and 150-155lbs
3.0,i love the style of the glasses but they are to wide for my face... So I decided to give them to my wide faced sister.
3.0,It might get better.  Now it is terribly stiff and difficult to get credit cards in and out of the slots. It does have the features I wanted including an attached coin pouch.
3.0,I had to exchange and get a larger size to be able to exercise comfortably .  Also the pads moving around luckily I could remove them.
3.0,"When I received this, the two loops that hold the ring were actually looped together, and the ring was free on the chain.  Not as advertised!!  It's as though it was put together by someone who didn't know what the finished piece was supposed to look like... I will try to fix it myself, and if I can't do it easily I'm returning this item.<br /><br />EDIT:  I was able to fix the necklace with a pair of pliers, but it was still a disappointment.  I should not have to repair something brand new."
3.0,Looks great but does not stay put. You must keep adjusting it.
3.0,"Super thin but warm, runs small in size"
3.0,"I usually wear an XL or 1X, I ordered a 2X and it is still too small.  I plan to keep it because I just need something to wear around the house and the sleeves are long enough, but I wouldn't order another."
3.0,"I know these are leggings, so they are supposed to be tight. Which is why I got the 2x-3x, when I am usually a XL. But even sizing up they are pretty tight. Don't get me wrong, I could get them on, but after pulling them on breathing was more difficult."
3.0,It is a exercise type shirt. I was looking for a heavy duty t-shirt. It’s okay but not what I expected.
3.0,I keep trying different face masks.  This one clings to my nose and mouth making it annoying and hard to wear.  I kept having to pull it out of my mouth.  I gave it 3 stars because it is well made and might be good for a teen or child size face(?)
3.0,"This shirt is cute, but the pants are awful. Came faster than expected."
3.0,"I am not a fan of the style in this fabrication. The knit is too thick for the asymmetrical style in my opinion. On me, it just looked like something went wrong in the making of the sweater. It has asymmetrical lines yet come in oddly at the waist and not only is it not flattering but it is also not stylish. Not for me."
3.0,Bonito pero le quedo muy grande a mi hija
3.0,Ordered a 2X size........runs very small.  Did not notice anyway to remove padding without cutting product!<br />Returning for refund.  Made well but does not fit me!
3.0,"This is a convenient product category, and the color is great (even looked good on me).<br /><br />I am small-ish at 5'2"" and this was rather too big on me.<br /><br />Also, the material isn't as thick as the photo suggests it might be.  It wasn't good enough for outdoors below freezing, for instance."
3.0,"I like the color of this shirt, but it is small (I wear a 2x, and the 3x is tight) and the material is kind of thin."
3.0,esta pasable
3.0,I wear a size 10 shoe and these fit just a little to snug at the top.  I still wear them because I love the colors but I am not sure I would buy them again.
3.0,Zipper not fully functional so had hard time putting on and taking off. Returned item...not practical.
3.0,I'm a 34c. It's difficult to keep the top on tight enough.
3.0,"I don’t want to return this dress but I have to go. I ordered the size large, put it on, and try to button it up. I could not button the last two buttons.  I was trying to buttoned up above My chest still couldn't. I wear a size medium at the loft, American Eagle and most other stores. If it’s more designer I go up to a large. If this came in an extra large I would buy it. Perfect throw on summer dress"
3.0,Beautiful dress yet runs too small. Ordered 2 sizes up and yet a bit snug..
3.0,A bit too small. Could be looser
3.0,I'd rather that it didn't have the Lettering on the shirt.
3.0,Pretty but too long.  I am short and it looked like a dress on me
3.0,"I sized up 2 sizes, just to be safe and was so disappointed. These are SO cute but there's no stretch/give in them and my thick thighs did not fit, even though my waist had room to spare. Bummer because they are adorable, but if you've got a booty and thick thighs, these may not be what you're looking for."
3.0,Too long. Had to get altered Good quality though
3.0,Pretty and nice material but size was off by 2 sizes.
3.0,El logo esta alrevez
3.0,Not the best quality… but ok for one night
3.0,Gave it 3 stars because it’s cute but it’s more like a necklace than a mask. Scratched my face even with a cloth mask underneath.
3.0,"I read the reviews and so many said to order a size or two bigger than you normally order.  I even have a dirndl from this company in size medium, but I went with the reviewers and ordered a large, since so many were having issues with it running small.  That was a BIG problem (lol) as it is absolutely too big in the chest and a bit too large in the waist.  I am busty too 34DD, and it was still too big.  I will try to exchange for a medium.  The materials are pretty meh - but it was $20, so I wasn't expecting a luxurious fabric."
3.0,"Runs small, but really cute dress"
3.0,"not fitted like a bodysuit suppose to fit, this has more cotton than spandex, so it can stretch out really quick. Perfect for costumes, not sexy at all."
3.0,"OK, not great quality"
3.0,Smaller than I expected from XL size
3.0,"I was expecting more of a cream/pastel color, as pictured, but I got a bright yellow, it is a very cheap piece of jewelry and you get what you pay for, its still an okay necklace, but I probably won't wear it as much as I was hoping for"
3.0,"I ordered a small, normally wear a small and sometimes a medium. The dress was very short and hit me 4&#34; above the ankle, just a very odd length. I'm 5'6&#34;."
3.0,"I purchased this for both the minimalist aspect and the RFID it claims to have.<br /><br />Though I like the &#34;wallet&#34; for what it is and seems sturdy enough, this is not RFID<br />protection at all.  I utilize an ID Card access panel to gain entrance to my companies<br />buildings, which uses RFID technology.<br /><br />This does not block the signal at all.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for a minimalist wallet, this works great for me.<br /><br />If you also want to include RFID protection, look elsewhere."
3.0,"The manufacturer said to give the hat time to unwrinkle and / or steam the hat(s).  I've owned this hat all summer, and I've also steamed it multiple times.  It's not completely creased any longer but the brim is always wavy making me look a little bit crazy but the hat serves it's purpose to protecting my face from sun damage."
3.0,"sent inside white plastic envelope, Gift box was covered in black smudges, couldn't remove without tearing box.so much for nice presentation for a gift"
3.0,"It fits alright and does the job. One thing I really liked is the material. it is super smooth and soft. However, I haven't washed it and I would think I will have to run a second set of stitches to keep in place. Otherwise, it's worth the price."
3.0,"Came broken, returned. Buckle seems very cheaply made."
3.0,"I ordered this to wear with a black dress and gold accessories. The clutch appears to be gold with some silver sparkles online, but in person it just appears silver. Will be returning."
3.0,Cute but very small... i could not wear it
3.0,Material was not what I thought not spandex more cotton doesn't hold its shape
3.0,"Bought to wear in goals in soccer.  The vision is greatly impaired, the bridge bar across nose is too high which distorts vision.<br />In order for it to feel secure on you face you must tighten up the straps which then give real pressure point squeeze on the face and forehead.  After reading other peoples comments, I am very disappointed"
3.0,"Its a well made dress. Cute. I am a C cup, so it fit a bit snug on top. The straps is the big headache they keep falling off the shoulder no matter how tight or loose I tie it."
3.0,Unfortunately these cute studs are too short to insert/attach in my nose.
3.0,Really Nice fabric but runs small.  I ordered a large but normally wear a medium and it was tight.  Kept it because my wife can wear it but I ordered another in Xlarge.
3.0,Beautiful colors. I bought the largest cup size but my boobs still spill out the top or bottom. I normally wear DDD bras.
3.0,"It wasn't that it's a bad idea, just wasn't working for me, money falls out,can't get all my cards in,my money is visible"
3.0,Not 14 guage. Smaller. Color comes off.
3.0,"I have two main “issues” with these Chinese pants. . .<br /><br />#1.  They don’t list the inseam. . . And these are only 30.5, so they are certainly not going to work for some.<br /><br />#2.  They show all of the listing pictures with “crinkled” legs, which is just silly.  I don’t know if they think they will sell better this way or what.  To have one that way is one thing. .  .But all the rest should show the pants the way they really are. . . flat. . . and non-crinkled.<br /><br />These pants are made of 95% cotton and 5% polyester.  The fabric is rather thin.  I have the Army Green color, and the color looks nice.  The front pockets and the back pockets are nice-and-deep.<br /><br />These pants are Made in China and being sold by a Chinese company on Amazon."
3.0,I loved these socks.  Soft and super warm.  But after washing they are getting pilly and the fuzz inside the sock is coming of and getting all over my rug and on the clothes together in the dryer.
3.0,"I don't really like these gloves and will just keep them for a spare set.  The fingers are strange. There is extra room at the fingertips.  I guess it'd be fine for someone with very long nails, maybe.  Mine aren't exactly short, but not super long.  It just leaves me always feeling like I want to pull the gloves down more on my hands, but they won't go down any further. Not a fan."
3.0,"The gold snitch locket doesn't stay closed as it should.  This is antique in color and the locket is the same color, not shiny gold as pictured."
3.0,The material is rough
3.0,"It looks good but I find the clip distracting, at least for me. YMMV."
3.0,"This is giant! Lol I usually wear M-L. I'm normally 5'9&#34; 180Lbs pre prey. & I'm 5mo pregnant now so I ordered a large based on ohh reviews. And since I'm one of those that gains like 60LBs when preg. 😳 I figured this would fit fine. Well this will definitely fit me till I pop, that is for sure. It.Is.Huge! I suggest ordering 1-2 sizes down from normal size unless you really like the billowing loose look, which would work great for a swimsuit cover I suppose. But I would not recommend ordering your normal size!"
3.0,Very cute and nice material but it runs very small so order a size up!
3.0,"Got the set and two were unable to be used because the straps were not connected, I had to see them on. The rest were great. Won't buy again tho."
3.0,shrinks after washing.. soft and pretty colors
3.0,"This is a beautiful piece. If you are meaty and curved ,this is a beautiful piece and it will be fitted and flattering on you.If you are of a smaller frame, it will not be as flirty looking,but it can still be pretty.The strappy back and faint side cut outs make up for the fit.This is a beautiful piece"
3.0,"The turquoise isn’t quite like the picture but, it’s still beautiful!"
3.0,Slightly disappointed because it didn't come with the certificate of authenticity.  Also one of the strands wad way longer than all of the others.
3.0,breaks easily. You get what you pay for.
3.0,They look really cute but much to narrow.<br />Just took this out from my May purchase unfortunately they lasted one day. The piece between the toes broke very disappointing.
3.0,"The fit style and color were great, but these pants run very small, and I sized up. Sadly, I requested a refund. Try 2 sizes bigger than your normal size and they work out. Length was good for me, but maybe not for someone tall."
3.0,Runs small but it's cute
3.0,I measured my daughter out and she was almost exactly 130cm. So I ordered the 130cm costume. It is so small on her she will have to wear leggings under it. But the rest looks good.
3.0,"Get what you pay for. They fall apart easily, but did get a couple wears out of them."
3.0,"Read the dimensions carefully-- I relied on the photo and the description, which are both misleading. (My fault and I know better than to shop in a hurry.) It is a pocketbook, not a &#34;large tote shopping bag&#34; but it would fit my needs IF the handles actually were LONG as in the description. Unless you are very thin, you won't be wearing this over your shoulder.  I can only assume that the photo is of a child mannequin.  Otherwise, the purse is fine, well made, well protected when it arrived.  It just will be relegated to my &#34;wear once in a blue moon&#34; pile instead of as the &#34;go to&#34; indispensable travel bag I had hoped it to be."
3.0,Beautiful. But the bow falls right off. It's glued on.
3.0,Way too heavy.
3.0,I should have known from the photo. They do not come high enough up on the wrist to make a good seal.
3.0,"Cute, but too clingy for me.  I normally wear a medium/large and ordered the medium."
3.0,"I really love the styling of the top. I have a hard type purchasing tops and bottoms as a set and prefer to order different sizes. I have no rear end, but I wear a 36 D or DD top and that doesn't usually match up. I took a chance on this suit since the top is so cute. My breasts sit lower than most and I have a hard time when there are no straps to adjust. This top is no different. It gives me a bit of underboob if I am not careful. The pads...like everyone in the world...are loose and inadequate at best. Just throw them out. They are the size of pasties, but not even as useful considering the amount of wiggle room they have. They certainly don't give any support. The top really doesn't have any support at all. It could be much improved with some vertical stays on either size of the top to keep the breast tissue to the front. Anyone with a full C cup or bigger is going to be hardpressed to keep their nipples covered. This is a very cleavage heavy style top. Laying out in the sun is fine, but any swimming is going to result in some slippage. I really really love the style. They just need to increase the top's support and coverage. I like the cleavage, but I just need a bit more coverage to make it wearable at the lake. The bottoms are cute, have good coverage. I could appreciate the tiniest bit more room in the waist as not to smoosh my loose skin, but that is a body image issue for me anyway. Overall a cute suit."
3.0,Exactly what I paid for
3.0,"Hermoso color, buen tamaño, solo en la parte de la costura lateral hay una fisura, lo que significa que por ahí comenzará a maltratarse."
3.0,"The colors are a bit off on some of the bands.  It seems like the bands are not uniform, some fasten well and some do not.  I almost lost my fitbit because the lavender band does not stay closed.  Thankfully it fell off in the car.  After a couple weeks use, the black band is  coming apart where the band is connected to the little window."
3.0,These shoes are adorable but super wide. They have elastic at the heel which helps them stay on. I wish I had sized down. But she will grow into them.
3.0,"It runs a little small. But very comfortable, very nice joggers, great price."
3.0,"I ordered up a size and was still surprised on how small this was. In some of the pics it looked be less cropped than it actually is so unless your going for that look, this may not be for you… Print and colors were as depicted. Super cute but just way to cropped for me.."
3.0,"Not a bad tunic, like the feel of the fabric. After reading reviews purchased a larger size, which is too big for me."
3.0,"This shirt is soooooooo pretty but soooooooo small. I wear a 22 or 1x/2x in shirts. I bought the 5x and wayyyyyy too small - like not going to even try it small. The 5x is closer to a XL. The material is light and cool with NOOOOOO stretch, the bodice is cut more fitted. Sooooooo disappointed. I wanted this sooooo badly. The seller was nice."
3.0,It is a nice product and its price is a good choice
3.0,"Very nice indeed but in the picture, it looks like there is some kind of padding, which is what I wanted.  I'll have to wear a bra under this cami as when it depects &#34;too much&#34;, especially when you have a chill!  Will keep them for sure."
3.0,The fit is a bit uncomfortable.  The metal along the arms isn't real smooth.  When I first put them on they scratch as they slide along my temples to my ears.  They block out the sun real good
3.0,It would have been nice to actually receive the 3 different lenses that were advertised. Instead I got two of the Amber lenses and one dark tinted lens. I did not receive the letter yellow color. That was the one I was most interested in to begin with.
3.0,Rides up just like every other thing I've ever tried.
3.0,They look nicer than they cost. I particularly like the way they fasten. Easy to get on & off.
3.0,the mesh is a little stiff.  My 3 year old daughter thought it was the most beautiful dress she's ever seen and wanted me to wear it to have tea party after tea party.  But it isn't exactly soft.  I do look forward to wearing it.
3.0,I love it in person but I don’t love it on so returned it. I’m fortunate and have a very proportional body. I’m 5’5 and 125 lbs and ordered a small. It fit perfectly but it hit me on the waste in a weird spot. I work really hard to have a small waste and avoid carbs and sugar so usually fit and flare is very flattering. It hit me too low on my waste so doesn’t fit like the pix. Could be flattering on a curvier body type (I’m only a B cup). Not for flatter and petite women in my opinion.
3.0,great shirt but a little on the small side
3.0,"love the pendant, but the chain came with a defect.."
3.0,"i got a medium, and the top fits well but the bottoms are way too small, there is no stretch to them"
3.0,Run very very small.  I suggest you order two to three sizes smaller than you normally wear.  I needed to return mine.
3.0,I wish I had read the reviews!  Had to return.  To echo the other reviews: The sleeves were very tight and disproportionately too small.
3.0,"Purchased these in black in my usual size 8.  They were too small and I had to return and get them in an 8.5.  They fit fine, but after wearing out of the house I realized that the padding in the back by the ankle was hurting me.  It is too thick and rubs in a strange spot.  If I hadn't worn them outside, I would have returned these.  On the black style the white part of the shoe is sort of mucked up to make them look worn and edgy.  Overall they are OK.  They look very cool (if you don't have to walk far) and I will go to the shoemaker and see if they can hammer it down or something."
3.0,"Great padding, average stretch/support, but way too short for my hand. If I got a larger size it would be too big width wise. Had to return as it didn’t cover my lower palm well."
3.0,"I had thought the ""dots"" on the fabric represented a printed pattern, but the fabric is actually pointelle (tiny holes woven into the fabric itself). Pointelle is pretty, but I needed sturdy, not pretty. It would have been better to add that to the description."
3.0,Thin material and a strange neckline. Almost like a man's cheap undershirt neckline.
3.0,"Love the bright colors, however, sleeves fit tight.  Order at least 2 sizes larger than what you would normally wear."
3.0,"Good looking shirt, but runs a bit on the smaller side."
3.0,Very see through and pockets were more in the back than on the side
3.0,"Good quality and length, but too tight for 17&#34; calves. Hoped they would stretch out after a few wears but they have not."
3.0,The vision is great but the frame is thick. This means there are some blind spots specially on the peripheral vision. My opinion is that it’s better to have thinner frames for a safer nighttime drive.
3.0,"It's more like a bag than a purse. It's okay, but I wanted a &#34;firmer&#34; type purse. The quality is fine, but know that you are buying a product that is ALL soft material and similar to buying a tote bag."
3.0,It was a bit smaller than expected. Thought it was a wrap dress but it is not.
3.0,"So. This is a cute skirt. Comfortable. Pretty. Feminine. My only issue is the tie. It threads through a hole like a wrap skirt but when you close the skirt - or wrap it - the tie ends up behind you on your hip. Not sitting prettily at the front side.  It’s behind you. I don’t know if this is a size issue? Maybe I should go down a size? I got a medium and I’m 5’9” 148lbs and thought it was correct. It fits fine- maybe a little loose? But how tight is it supposed to be? It’s a flowy skirt! The ruffle is pretty and not too frou-frou, and the length is perfect and lady-like.  Overall cute skirt, great price. If I get another, I think I will try a small- I’ll let everyone know if the tie issue is better. But worth the price overall."
3.0,It's not as nice looking as the picture. It will need to be steamed or ironed as it's folded in its package. Otherwise it's cute
3.0,"Material is pretty, but thin. I wash and lay this top flat to dry, so I have been pretty gentle with it. One of the seams has fallen apart, however."
3.0,"These glasses are an excellent look. But I noticed they were on the heavy side. The filter is amazing, and truly an enjoyable experience with respect to the hue that everything has with these on. However, the design on the side of the glasses pokes out a little bit where they are worn. This can get a little irritating when they are worn for a long extended period of time. I would recommend though if you like the look and want everything to have a very attractive and warm hue to it."
3.0,Looks great but runs VERY SMALL. Order 2 sizes up!
3.0,Didn't really like it! The item seemed new and packed perfectly. But the material looks cheap and the dye looks fake. The item​ is way to large
3.0,very long.  I had to hem these
3.0,Super cute and soft but missized. I normally wear a medium. I read that these run small so I ordered a large. But the large fits like a small. So go a couple sizes up if you order these. :)
3.0,unfortunately these are just not very well made. The jewels don't sit straight and they break very easily.
3.0,"Absolutely beautiful watch.  so disappointed it didn't work at all, right out of the box. I'm bummed. I really loved it."
3.0,"I like the shirt, but after washing it several times it has shrunk.  It makes it hard to fit comfortably."
3.0,A little bit small and artificial looking
3.0,Very comfortable and light . Would be 5 stars except for the black bridge part looks like a third eyebrow when you are wearing them.
3.0,Good size for spacers.
3.0,Practically a mans shirt... Good quality though. I mean- it's a Hanes shirt so.
3.0,"This suit was not made bad at all. in fact, the quality seemed great. The problem was that the torso was much too short. I am 5'5&quot;. Also, I have a small top but my hips are substantially larger so the bottom portion cut in very deep. I, unfortunately will not be able to wear this suit but I am trying to find someone to gift it to because it is SOOOO very cute and such a great deal."
3.0,Quality is so-so. One of the side seams wasn't sewn straight and resulted in a hole from the get-go.
3.0,The sizing is really weird. I ordered a small bc their chart said that was a size large size. I wanted it to be loose and comfy and it unfortunately hardly covered my stomach when i lifted up my arms
3.0,The loop doesn't work out the way that I thought it would. Could not tighten the belt so it was loose on my waist.
3.0,The posts are too large. Therefore they hurt my ears.
3.0,No Grippers on the bottoms.
3.0,"I like that this mask is very thick and seems safe, but the sizing is a little off and because of the thickness it isn't very stretchy. I can wear it okay but after a while it does pull on the ears."
3.0,"If you want jewelry for a specific occasion or only want to wear them a handful of times this is the product for you. I was hoping to keep them for a while, but they started turning black not long after I bought them."
3.0,"Nice ring but stretched out too big, like from 8 to 10, after only 2 weeks and was returned. Was snug when I got it, wore it all the time, but didnt do much physical activity with it, probably would have stretched out more. This was my second one, both smaller than my size to allow for stretching. Return service was great and as advertised. Buying a smaller one, 3 sizes smaller than my 'actual' size to see how it stands up."
3.0,"These earrings are huge - make sure to check the measurements in the description. The fringe is ok. I think I will wear them, just didn’t realize how big they were."
3.0,rolled down my tummy
3.0,"This is a very cute top. BUT the multi blue has BLACK at the top, not blue :("
3.0,"I guess it does its job, I am a little disappointed that it wasn't as snug or sucked in as much as I really wanted but there was a difference. I was also a lil disappointed in the fact that it wasn't completely invisible under my clothes but it serves its purpose and not a total waste of money. I've had bad luck shopping for these things just haven't found that perfect one yet."
3.0,Textured part is gorgeous the other part not so much. It also came with a scratch. Inside very spacious. Got compliments on it.
3.0,Love them but they were too big. I sewed ribbons on them so they would stay on.
3.0,Definitely just a tummy slimmer/control product. Very minimal control in the thighs and definitely no slimming. It is comfortable tho and sturdy so it seems pretty well made.
3.0,"The packaging was cute and the rings are dainty and pretty. Although, not all of the balls are sturdy and stay on well, and with the dainty size they are difficult to screw on. For the money, it’s not a bad purchase."
3.0,Deformed. Not Good quality
3.0,The bra has two layers which is a bit odd but it looks cute. I have this company’s other bras and they fit perfectly in my size but this one gives me popover boob.
3.0,The socks are a little tight but you can stretch them out a little bit to fit fine. Very expensive.
3.0,"The necklace is okay, earrings look really cheap. Not that impressed with the quality."
3.0,I knew it had polyester in it but it definitely feels a little cheap and it is a little see through if you don't wear light underwear.
3.0,"I read another review that said this shirt is not oversized or bigger sleeves and they were so right, this is just a regular t shirt. Does not fit oversize, not going to wear it for what I wanted at all. Will just be around the house shirt, so disappointed. And the color is not apricot, it is very light color of pinkish. Would not purchase another one of these shirts."
3.0,"I measured my daughter's waist, hip and legs before I ordered M. Her waist is 29"", hip 31"" and her inseam was 22"", so I ordered M as it says Medium is waist 28.3"", hip 40.2"" and inseam is 20.1"". She's 12 years old so her hip is obviously not big, but her waist is not that small. I don't know which size would've fit her better. I guess S or XS, but the waist would be too small. M was way too big for her even though I did my best trying to match the measurements.<br /><br />The material is thick and soft. Kinda has the feel of sweat pants. It's stretchy. Just feels too thick. Like something you would wear in winter. Softball pants are usually thin and tight but stretchy. I don't think we're going to be able to use this one due to the size and the material."
3.0,Alot smaller than I thought
3.0,"The shirt is good quality and color, but runs small"
3.0,"Nice watch. Quite heavy. Automatic runs well..<br />However, date digits change starts at 22:00..<br />well into early dawn..during these hours the watch ticks slower and results in ~40minutes<br />back/late !!! time.. thus becomes unreliable.."
3.0,Nice sunglasses... however I was expecting the blue sunglasses which are sold at the goodr website.  These sunglasses were more of a teal color and were to feminine for me...<br />I returned for refund.
3.0,I am a heavy slipper wearer in the cooler months.  As soon as I put these on I could tell they won't last the season.  The footbed looks very thick and comfy until you step on it. Then you hit bottom.  No support.  The sole itself looks like a decent enough weather rubber.  Im sceptical they will wear well.
3.0,I bought 2 pair since they were only $10. One pair just split right above the lens while I was wearing them in the pool.  Maybe it was too hot for these glasses to be in the dessert.
3.0,They were cute but they broke after two days! :’) but they were good for the price.
3.0,"My 5 year old grandson loves this hoodie. I ordered the 5-6 year old size, but should have gone larger as it actually runs small. He is an average sized 5 (almost 6) year old. Unfortunately he won't be able to wear it for long."
3.0,It works and flexible but this one is starting to fray. I would not purchase again.
3.0,No issue w/ quality ... simply a sizing issue and that will happen from time to time when buying over the internet
3.0,"Good size for big sunglasses, not so hard."
3.0,I liked the image shown for the product.  It was much larger than I was expecting and looks more childish than the photo.  Would be great for child fashion.<br />I was a little disappointed as I purchased this for my self to wear and feel that it would be better for my niece.
3.0,Looks just like the photo but runs a little large since it's one size fits all.
3.0,Might get just a few uses out of these.  I would suggest going to a store to buy in person before ordering online..
3.0,"Took a long time to ship, but that was my fault for not noticing where it came from. Do not dry on any temp, the prints will melt and stain other clothing/itself. Veey cute though."
3.0,Slides off the shoulders
3.0,Fabric looks cheap
3.0,"I wanted a NATO or Zulu style watch band for my work watch.  This band seems to be made well enough but it's a little short.  I  am about 5,11 and weigh 185 pounds, so I'm not overly big.  If you lace the band like you are supposed to  to take the strain off the spring pins, you really don't have a lot of band left over. I don't think this is really a regulation band. I was hoping for something more.  If you have narrow wrists, it should be fine."
3.0,Runs small in size and the mask is very hard to see out of but it looks great
3.0,Too small and from China once again!
3.0,"The colors are bright and the designs are as pictured but I’m disappointed with the quality, one shirt has a small hole on the pocket and another a stain :("
3.0,It’s ok for the price.  It is not the best quality but it is fine for the summer.
3.0,Very tight and not loose fitting.  Love the color though!
3.0,Shorter than I expected.<br />Fit is much smaller.<br />I’ll keep and give it as a gift.<br />Order the next size up. Cute design
3.0,I normally wear a size 8-10. It's really important to look carefully at the sizing chart. The XXL dress fits but it's a little snug up top. But I do like it a lot!
3.0,One pair arrived broken
3.0,the material is very cheap. it doesn't look like the one on the picture.
3.0,"Looks great, but very heavy."
3.0,This is a pretty dress but it’s not adequate for a formal occasion. I found something at a local store for a similar price but made with higher quality materials.
3.0,Love it but comes apart easily
3.0,Bought this in a pinch as we were on vacation & hubby forgot to pack a hat. He has a very large head. This is the first hat that is actually large on him. Worked for us.
3.0,This bag is made of  good material its nice and sturdy but the strap could be a lot longer.
3.0,Super convenient to have but I have to tie it because it won’t stay in place with the plastic piece.
3.0,"Material is stretchy and thin, but comfortable. Be sure to try these on before wearing since these are very tight. Returning and needing a XXL since the XL is too tight in the stomach area and below."
3.0,"Looks old, like it could rust at any moment."
3.0,"I bought this for a theatrical costume. As other reviewers pictures show, these rings (when all worn together) are quite large and flashy. I took off two stars, though, because one of the small stones fell out in the bag before it arrived -- I could potentially glue it in, but for a costume piece that I would never wear in real life (not my taste) it isn't worth the effort."
3.0,"Cute, for a novelty item! Not super thick material. Too small for my husband who is 6 foot! I guess it is mine now! :)"
3.0,"I bought these to replace the original garmin vivofit band that was not adjustable. According to the description these are supposed to be adjustable up to 1.3 inches larger than the original garmin band but they are not. Although these are adjustable, they are roughly the same size as the 145cm solid garmin band. Not a good next step option. I have a small framed 9 year old and this is too small for her. Also tight on my 7 year old."
3.0,Pretty cheap price for a pretty cheap dress. I wear a 4-6 and ordered large. Barely fit. Going back. Nothing like the picture ruffle wise.
3.0,It is not that much comfort. It doesn't stay all night. The thickness is good but it is not warm enough. I like the colors and size.
3.0,These are okay for the price. There is nothing compression or athletic about them except maybe the fact that they’re a racerback cut.
3.0,"I normally wear size 8-8.5 on my right foot, 7.5-8 on my left. I bought size 8.5 and had to return them. The left foot was snug, and the right foot was extremely small. They didn't feel as comfortable as i had hoped, but probably would have been ok for my infrequent use if the size had worked."
3.0,"I got these earrings as I liked the design and pattern.<br />But when I actually received them, they were not exactly like what was in the product description.<br />I could not get confidence about the quality.<br />They felt quite flimsy."
3.0,"My daughter is 5'2"" and thin. We used the sizing instructions to order and it is WAY too small. My wife wound up having to use another daughter's old dress cut up underneath to be the body. Of course, since it shipped from China, there was no time to return it in time for Halloween."
3.0,"No me encantó, pero no está mal y el tamaño corre bien."
3.0,"The product was fine except the medium was so big, it was loose from ankle to upper calf. These run very large, in my opinion. I'm thinking about ordering a small, but based on how they run, I might go down 2 sizes. I was looking for something opaque like tights, and these do deliver on that."
3.0,"Good look and fit, except it doesn’t stick very well to your skin."
3.0,This is a really cute set for a really great price. However I bought the size that my daughter normally wears and it fits her just right with no extra room and if you dry it then it would quite likely be too small. She wore them once and I bought them maybe 2 months ago and there isn't much room to grow. I wish I would have gone to size up. But it is a cute package and I like the diverse colors!
3.0,Not flair in the bottom half as expected
3.0,I love infinity scarves. I wish to was longer
3.0,Runs a little  small.
3.0,"I really like it, I just don't like that it moves a lot when you have it on and also leaves my skin a little green after a few hours of having it on like a residue :( but I love how it looks"
3.0,"The sleeves are very snug and definitely not long enough. Other than that, I like it!"
3.0,"While the sports bra is comfortable and gives great support, I was disappointed to see today, less than two weeks of use, that the back straps are coming unstitched."
3.0,"Cute little earrings.  I would have given more stars, but I ordered the gold color. Wore them twice and the gold is already worn off.  Still wear them though. They are just now silver."
3.0,It is not really what i spected
3.0,"Not sure how I feel about this dress. I read the reviews and checked the size chart and ordered a medium (I usually wear a S or XS), and it sort of fit when I tried it on, but when I actually wore it it seemed off, somehow. It took me awhile to realize it really was just too big, especially in the bodice. I think it didn't quite click at first because of the material, which I like a lot; it's really thick and sort of stretchy. I still like the style of the dress though. I'm thinking of giving the medium to my sister and ordering a small for myself."
3.0,"There is a fabric lining inside of this shoes. Very not practical for toddler's shoes and gets dirty all the time, difficult to clean."
3.0,The length of the shirt and sleeves are WAY off! I'm 5 feet tall (or short lol depending on how you look at it) 165 pounds I bought the xxl bc I'm rather large chested. The sleeves don't even come to my wrists and the shirt itself barely covers my stomach! Being as short as I am this shirt should have more than covered my backside and def been longer in the sleeves.  Not sure if I was sent a smaller size or what....I love the color but also didn't realize the sleeves are a different material than the shirt itself...more like a jersey material on the sleeves. It did come with a pretty necklace but unfortunately this shirt is useless to me. Thankfully I have someone that can use the shirt but just beware on the sizing....even for over seas sizing this was just crazy off!
3.0,"Looks to much like a prom dress, but if that's what you want it for buy it."
3.0,"It's comfortable, but it lets a lot of light in around the nose."
3.0,Shaped funny.
3.0,They are very clunky looking. They look like orthopedic shoes which I guess they are. But I was a bit surprised by the appearance. I’m not sure if they will help the heel pain. They seem to help temporarily but as soon as I take them off the pain returns with a vengeance. I’m holding judgement for now.
3.0,The pants are way longer than pictured and the material is super thin. They’re comfortable enough but not like what they look like in the image. It’s like cheap material. But I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,"Took these to EDC recently and thought they'd be fun.  But, on either setting, the music was just too loud to make them &#34;dance.&#34;  So, they ended up being on all the time.  Which is an okay look, too.  I couldn't see that well through them, either, so had them on top of my head alot.  I saw other similar glasses at the festival that were &#34;dancing&#34; to the music just fine, but these just couldn't handle it.<br />It was nice being able to recharge them, and use again, and I liked them overall.  Just too sensitive."
3.0,"The material of this dress was very odd. It felt sort of like swimsuit material? Also, the sleeves were too long on me so that didn’t look right. For reference I’m 5’4 155lbs 36C. The medium fit fine besides the sleeve length."
3.0,Pretty ring but smaller than I wear but ordered my normal ring size
3.0,"This blouse is all sheer fabric. I thought it was solid. Nice blouse, just not what I expected."
3.0,"Everything about the shirt was great, except the sleeves were a little on the tight side I thought. I ordered a Large"
3.0,This is just ok. It seems a little too big and it just doesn't really want to stay on my shoulders. It is very see through. it really only looks good with a tank top. The picture makes It look much prettier. They must have tacked it in the back for the picture or something. It is very big in real life.
3.0,"The treasure chest was so cute and somewhat heavy. However, after only an hour, the “pin” that held the hinge together, fell right out. Luckily we were able to find the tiny piece and it is fixable with some sort of strong glue. But for the price, it should not have fallen apart."
3.0,I ordered the flower print tankini but recieved the dragonfly tankini. Slightly disappointed since I recieved a different item then what I had ordered. Other then that I do like how the suit fits.
3.0,Very snug for size
3.0,"These socks are super comfortable but the grippy parts on the bottom began to fall off the first time I wore them around the house. They are also very big on my feet (size 6), which makes them feel a little less secure."
3.0,"I bought this cosplay from their actual website and it cost about 20 bucks cheaper which is a plus, it came within 3-7 days, I’m gonna guess around 6? Overall I really like it<br /><br />Shipping was 20$ there and was the same for both expedited shipping and standard<br /><br />I was worried it was gonna come as a one piece cosplay and I was going to get screwed over, that’s thanks to my paranoia lol, it did not, the items included are the pants/ white shorts combo, body suit and jacket, along with a belt and little bag (which can come in handy for carrying eyeliner, lipstick, hair pins, phone, etc) I like that I can actually use it.<br /><br />One thing I will say is the seams are a bit cheaply made which, where can you find good seams on cosplays these days, that is if you buy them, the fabric quality is good for me, I like that the inside is soft while outside gives off the body shaping latex like look<br /><br />Texture wise it feels soft and alright, jacket is a bit restraintive so you don’t have to clip it onto your chest, (chest has little clips so you can fasten the jacket on bcs Lucy has a genshin physics jacket lol) sensory wise I give it a 8.5/10, soft and comfortable, while having a cosplay feeling (cosplayers know what I mean)<br /><br />It’s pretty true to size, I’m a size 6-8 us and I bought a medium, it fits snug and nice, I’m not exactly a hour glass so i didn’t know how to measure myself lol, but it fits nice<br /><br />Amazon is being mean and not letting me add a picture of it but you can check it out on my tiktok bcs I posted some videos, my handle is diozballz<br /><br />I hope this review took you to the moon"
3.0,Love the ring except it is starting to chip. And that's why I am rating it three stars
3.0,The arms are long. The chest is small for the size.
3.0,"After baby #3 I needed a backpack diaper bag but traditional ones are too big and heavy. I decided to try this bag and I'm not totally in love. The zipper sticks easily and the zipper teeth and starting to not interlock on the right side. The pockets on the side are so small/tight that they are really only useful for a phone or keys. What I do like is that it looks decent, more like a purse, and I love the pocket in the back because I can easily slip my wallet in and out."
3.0,Beautiful watch. Unfortunately it arrived with a dead battery so it cost me money and hassle to go out and buy a new one. I could have just picked up a similar new watch at Walmart for the same price.
3.0,These are way to small. XL fir a boy not a man
3.0,"I used it to hold my keys, cards and some cash. It’s good in the sense that it acts like a mini wallet, but as time goes by, if you put cash in the middle, your cards are going to be bent. But overall, it’s not bad."
3.0,"I received this today, only to discover that the side logo is upside down on the bag. Not sure if I’m keeping or returning."
3.0,I normally wear a small but I saw other reviews so I went ahead and got a medium. It’s still tight in the arm pit area. I cannot imagine having a small. It would be for little kids. And they run short. I wouldn’t buy this again.
3.0,The shirt design was beautiful  and the material was soft however sizing was way off.  Gave it to a friend who loves it
3.0,Ok design but sintetic material 🙅🏼‍♀️
3.0,You can see right through the skirt. Very thin material.
3.0,I gave 3 stars because the top could be a littler larger for top heavy women. Set should be sold &#34;separate&#34; with the opportunity to select large top.
3.0,"Wish it came together higher at open front. Otherwise, it is okay, and decent material."
3.0,"Don’t like the material, it’s not warm and the hood is very heavy."
3.0,Was pretty but began turning after the 5th time wearing.
3.0,Thought it would fit tighter and has a funny smell. Hoping that will fade in time.
3.0,I liked thw back but the front was not flattering at all.
3.0,"On the whole the product was awesome its cheap but I love it. I just have one issue which is its not exactly what I ordered one of the faces isn't the same, I got this cause one of my Chinese friends said it for good luck but now I have no idea what it means."
3.0,"Bought a Large, usually buy a Medium in jackets and shirts.  I’m a size 10 with a little extra weight around middle. This fit like a Small. Quality was average to above average.  I returned it."
3.0,Fits well. A bit of a gab at the waist but the elastic held up wrll for a costume. The material is made for costume only. Not every day wear.
3.0,"I liked the look and feel of these boxers, but they fit extremely small.  My husband's normal size didn't fit at all, so order a size larger than what you normally would."
3.0,It is  very nice but too small for me
3.0,thick heavy material. did not lay nicely on body
3.0,"These shirts are nice but they did not fit properly, I’m 5’1, 105 lbs.  There is no compression at all for a size small and they don’t come in an extra small. The fit of each color was slightly different, ordered white, black and blue. The material on the arms is very loose fitting, with no compression at all. They may fit better on larger body types, but not for me."
3.0,Wallet is  too narrow and so business cards barely fit - needs to be another 1/8 wider and 1/8 taller to be a GREAT product.  Previous versions wider and larger but for some reason they shrunk this latest version...
3.0,"Cute, cheap accessories. However, they came with a number of obvious scratches on the front surface on one of them."
3.0,They look great but they don't protect your eyes as good as a name brand sunglasses would but for looks its awesome .
3.0,"It's an okay case. The Waterproofing is legitimate, but the seal needed for the fingerprint scanner is simply put awful. The seal causes my phone that never has issues with detecting my fingerprint to need 4-5 attempts to detect it."
3.0,runs small; quality is ok
3.0,"This is a good product, however when filled its hard to get it opened & closed so be aware of that, like how you could pull out the brush holder on the bottom & re-attach. I think its a little smaller & bulkier than I would like."
3.0,looks really cheap not so much as the picture
3.0,"The same material is used for both, and for the gloves it's fine, but the socks are a complete nuisance to get on."
3.0,"I maybe should have returned for a larger size, but given they had spandex and others reported stretching, as spandex pants typically do, I kept and wore them to see.  I'm continuing to wear them, they have a nice business like leg shape I can wear on casual days to work.  They would be more comfortable, though if the waist set higher.  they hit about  1 inch below my navel.  I did buy a 30 inch inseam, so I would not have to hem them, so perhaps they are petite jeans and that would explain the shorter rise(?)  However, the pants labelling does not state they are petite."
3.0,the Sizing is off on these
3.0,Not as great of a fit as I was hoping for
3.0,The shipment was well packaged and received in excellent condition . The product is well made for the price (good value- includes 2 bras). The item is smaller than I expected for a 2x and will sometimes slide down in the back then the front will side down. They come padded which can be removed (nice feature). Overall good product for the price if your a “A” or “B” cup.
3.0,Low quality but cute.
3.0,These look blue in the photo but they're not. They are a cut glass. Disappointed with the color but they are good quality for the price.
3.0,"Pros:<br />Fits me perfectly.<br />Serves the purpose and didn't embarrass me in public the first two times I used them. I only used them twice.<br /><br />Cons:<br />My skin can't breath when I wear this..<br />When I remove it after a few hours, it feels like the glue has went into my skin and I had to literally peel it off.<br />It smells a little bit.<br />The fabric on the outside feels cheap and looks cheap."
3.0,"I ordered this because I love sea creatures and it was one of the more unique pieces I have seen. The pricing was excellent, delivery came on time and the product was as described. However, while pewter is a weaker material the loop broke away after a week, and thankfully I didn't lose it. I had to bend it back to its original shape."
3.0,I do not think these shorts will be very durable.
3.0,Love these boots....BUT....got them and realized after wearing them ONCE that some of the stitching was flawed. I'm gonna have to glue the seam or something because there is no option to return the boots because of the defect. :( Kinda bummed because otherwise they are PERFECT!
3.0,"Dress too loose at the underarm area. Was ok, not as cute on as is seen in pictures."
3.0,"I love this brand and all of their jeans; however, these jeans weren’t as great as I expected."
3.0,you van see threw them
3.0,"These are very thick between my toes and uncomfortable.  I’ve tried them a few times to work up to wearing them longer, but just haven't been able to."
3.0,Very small fit honestly would be more the size for a child instead of a small adult
3.0,The had fit well and I have a larger head and lots of hair. Unfortunately it did seem to slid upwards as I wore it. It also itched a lot I guess it must be the polyester and I have sensitive skin so back it went.
3.0,great price prompt service
3.0,Not a very clear graphic. Words in the middle can't even be read
3.0,This top was suppose to be an extra large and it is also on the small size and shorter than the picture shows.
3.0,Size up! Teenager size. My normal size M. I got M and the sleeves were short and all hoodie seemed really narrow. I gave it to my son he wears already  between L and XL teen's size. But style pretty is nice. I can't say that is only for women actually i think black color will be ok for youth boys and girls.
3.0,"Seems to run on the larger size. Looked good, felt good.. much to big, sent back"
3.0,I like these shorts. They fit really well...but they are cheaply made and I don’t expect them to last long (I’ve had 2 pairs tear on me).
3.0,"I really really love the design of these dresses but each one is made of a different fabric. One is super silky, one is made out of some weird kind of cotton, one is just straight up 100% itchy polyester. You basically don’t know what you’re going to get until you purchase them. I have five and every single one of them is a different material."
3.0,"They are very pretty and light.  However, the  small box they came in had broken open and both earring posts became bent in the bigger package."
3.0,Too expensive!!
3.0,Fits very large on top without much support
3.0,"Overall, pretty nice.<br />Good Quality. True to colors shown online.<br /><br />I wish it held more. There are 4 slots to store cards or money.. But with more than 2 cards it is nearly impossible to close since the clip is magnetic and doesn't stay closed.  So for that , its alright.  Wish i would have purchased one with a button clip instead of magnetic or  if it held a little more stuff."
3.0,Color are not as shown
3.0,"Missing a few correct sizes and too many of other sizes, but the ones we did get were ok"
3.0,"So I ordered 2 nuckily out fits for cycling at the same time. I ordered the same size for both. They were different.... On this outfit, loved the shorts because they came down to knees, but the shirt was a little tight (thanks to the color, my belly kinda blends so not too bad). The other out fit was perfect just the shorts length wasn't quite as long as these"
3.0,"I really could love this bra, but it has that curling/flaring out at the cups edge. It looks poorly under most everything. I've only washed it gently and air dried it, too. Not great quality."
3.0,The pattern and fabric are good. Comfy. But the dress is a little short in the waist and tends to run small. Shrinks a little with washing too. Looks cute with leggings. I wear a size 4 in dresses and ordered a size small...
3.0,Love the style of the jacket and fits true to size.<br />Fabric is already pilling
3.0,"The watch looks great, but it's HUGE!! I don't mean that it's just a large watch, but it's so big that it's almost like costume jewelry. If you are into extremely large watches, then this is it. The face, dial, band, everything, looks really impressive despite it's size."
3.0,The material gets A LOT of wrinkles and it runs quite small. So be sure to get one size larger.
3.0,Weird looking
3.0,"Ordered a XXL (I’m a 16-18) and was way to small, especially vertically. I’m 5’7” and it gave me a huge wedgie lol."
3.0,It's beautiful but the sizing is horrible. I ordered a xl and the top looks like a xxs. I definitely will be returning it.
3.0,Even for Plus Size 2X the ran smaller than I'm use too
3.0,"To me a capri is mid calf at the longest, this one was below the ankle on me.  I returned these.  The embroidery was cute, but not for me."
3.0,"Good quality mask.  Also has a slot for filters but seems thick enough to wear without...comes with 2 filters as well.  When wearing the mask, the nose area is a little awkward but you can adjust it until you are comfortable."
3.0,"Love the boot. My daughter was crazy about them, but the zipper broke recently and we did not have them that long."
3.0,Be nice if they were warmer
3.0,"Returned them because they were difficult to put on. But they were lovely, very classy -- but not for my ears."
3.0,"Returned. The fabric was really stiff, and I followed the size chart and it was too small for the comfy outfit I wanted it for. I did get two colors and they both fit exactly the same and the quality and craftsmanship was good, so that was nice."
3.0,"The photo looks great, but when I got it, I realized how thin the material was and how cheap the zipper is. I do not recommend."
3.0,I normally where a XXL so I bought it in that size. I now where to lounge around the house or sleep. Almost big enough to where as a dress.
3.0,"The belt looked wider than most but it fit perfectly through the loops.  These were actually a bit longer than expected so you might want to go exactly with your waist size and not follow their rule of waist size plus 7 inches.  The one concerning item is the belt seemed to stretch three inches after the first day or two of use.  My fear is that it's going to crack and fail, prematurely.  If it lasts months, that will be a win.  The reversing feature I couldn't figure it out and the instructions were useless with the poor translation.  In fact, the translation produced some unintended humor. In every sentence."
3.0,Very cute and authentic but it arrived missing a clip. Thinking I can add one on myself since time is short for when it is needed.
3.0,"My daughter is absolutely going to love these for Christmas. Love that the charger splits into two so that way both shoes can charge at the same time. The charging spot is on the in side where it cant be seen. The colors are bight. Can make the color one solid color, solid color flash, and rotate throw the colors and flash. I cant wait to see her walking around in these. She is going to be one happy kid. Maybe even the most popular kid. The shoes seem to be made really well they arent to heavy and the charging port wont be seen when she wears them. I had to try them on myself and they seemed to be a little flat footed which is fine she is about flat footed but the sizing it spot on Since I could wear them I know she will be able to as well. Really love the high top style. Great for when She is wearing her leggings I think I will end up having to steal them from her every now and then. They are the coolest thing Ive seen in a while. Changing the color is easy a little red button on the back of the charging port on either shoe will change each shoes color .<br />UPDATE<br />12/17/16<br />I gave these to my daughter last week instead of waiting until Christmas they worked great for the first few days now the right shoes lights are stuck o and the left shoe when the lights are o one single light is a different color than the others. If she has it on green the one light bulb is purple. I am changing my stars from a 5 to a 3. very upset"
3.0,"These shorts have an adjustable band that runs across the entire top of the shorts. This band had to be secured or they fall down and it’s only one side. The end of the adjustable band has a price of plastic that can push on your side. The elastic band will also fold over its self which can cause annoyance.<br />The shorts fit well. They are jeans so they might not be great for hot days. And it’s not noticeable in the pictures on amazon, but they are the kind of jeans that they had holes to."
3.0,Not a women's watch. It's large. The smallest hole on the strap was still too big on my wrist.
3.0,Cute boots! The material does not hold up well. The boots tear easily.
3.0,It's a pretty pattern and the skirt is divine.  The top is pretty dumpy looking. Too big and the V cut is too high.  Returned.
3.0,Gorgeous skirt but not flattering for my full figure.
3.0,"Good kit,<br />Good price.<br />Last good."
3.0,"Fabric was disappointing, not at all what you would expect sweatshirt material to be.  However, loved the color."
3.0,Color wasn't as bright as expected but I still like it. Fits comfortably.
3.0,Not so flattering g unless you are really filled at the top or really tall. I’m 5’3” size 4/6.
3.0,This is the second pair of boots I’ve ordered from this company. The first pair was brown and they looked great coming out of the box. The black pair which is what this feedback in in regards to came with a small scuff mark on the from of one boot and I don’t know what on the front side of the other boot. Both marks are very noticeable in person. I thought they may just wipe off and could have been dust or something but that was not the case.
3.0,I don't like the feel of microfiber and this reminded me of that.  So I returned it.
3.0,I love the patterns of these leggings but they are too small. I ordered the 7-16 size for my 11 year old who is has very thin legs but they were too tight and too short.
3.0,"For a $40, 1/4 inch bit of metal, I think it could have come in a nice little gift box.  It is the holidays after all.  Does anyone else think Pandora stuff is over-priced?"
3.0,"Neither of my girls, 3 and 6, have their ears pierced. And since they love stick on earrings, I thought I'd try these. The price was right and there are a ton of them in one package. The problem, we found, was that they don't have very much staying power. They would both come back from school with the earrings either completely missing, or in the case of my three year old, stuck to her butt. So they have been relegated mostly to playing dress up and for decorating their pictures and drawings. Lucky me, I find them stuck to the floor and carpet ALL the time. And the little triangles have quite sharp points, so I have to be careful pulling those up. All in all they're okay. But I'm now considering piercing they're ears... If they're open to it."
3.0,The brass buckle and elasticized belt material are both good.  It runs quite small though and only has two holes.  I am a size 4-6 and find it just fits (and would probably be too tight if trying to belt something heavy.)
3.0,I was going to wear it to a wedding but having a different thought
3.0,"It didn’t come with a belt , witch was disappointing:("
3.0,"The bands work, BUT the paint comes off the buckle part easy…"
3.0,"Normally I'm an XS. This fit WAY too tight. I have a 22 in waist. DDD chest. My arms didnt fit in the sleeves... it was as if I was trying to put a child's sweater on. Super cute, sizing is just way off. Order a size or 2 up..."
3.0,My daughter loves the shoes but is a little big around the ankle. The shoes are fine but the delivery and the notification not accurate.<br /><br />I am unhappy that the shoe did not arrive in time for my function- expected Dec 1 but arrived Dec 5!!!!!
3.0,"Nice piece, but way to petite for my needs..."
3.0,I got a reaction from the medal so I don’t wear it 24/7 also the size was thicker than expected. It also tarnished after two weeks of having it
3.0,"Heavy, bulky and not quite what I was going for."
3.0,Dislike did not fit like other I bought
3.0,"I am 4’11 and 115 lbs and purchased the 6/8.  If fit perfectly and looks great.  However, the Rhinestones were constantly falling off.  I wore it once and left a trail of Rhinestones everywhere I went."
3.0,"The dress was nice but the piece of fabric that went across the chest to the side just didn't flow well with the rest of the dress design. It looked off and as much as tried to ignore it, I couldn't. I returned it the very next day. Fit true to size."
3.0,It was a little tight. I ordered the correct size and it was small.
3.0,This brand runs very small.  I don't like my clothes too tight but this is SNUG.  I'm starting a new job so I'll be losing weight and then they'll fit ok.  They are very nice to the tough.  Soft and silky.
3.0,"A little bit meh. I'm not sure what I was expecting - but I guess desmit brand. In stead, when they arrived they were &#34;wang jang&#34;.<br /><br />Overall they're okay, and come in nice vibrant colours. So good value for money.<br /><br />However if you are not overly tight for cash, I'd really recommend getting something from JM Skinz instead. You'll find yourself wanting to wear them all the time."
3.0,"I was so excited for these. I got the purple and I loved the color but they fit odd and no matter how low pull them down or pull them out of your crotch, you will have the most defined camel toe."
3.0,I ordered an xl....2 of them was a large.
3.0,"I got the heather brown , it looks better in the picture . It’s an odd sort of orange brown color . The dress is fine ( I will keep it ) but it’s not the most comfortable to wear . The sleeves are slightly tight and the upper portion in general feels tighter then I think it should at this size . I usually order a medium . I’m 5 8 , 157 and have 36DD bra . I read in the reviews that it has good stretch ; I don’t find that to be true in my case . If you simply must have it , get a size bigger ."
3.0,"the belt is a little too high for me , and the curve is not my body it may be someone else"
3.0,"Just received my order of ""warm winter socks"" but there is no tag or packing slip to show the materials used. Upon opening the pack, I have a hard time believing these are really the: Made of 80% Wool, 20% Polyester - as stated in the description. But I will update in a week or so after they have been worn and washed."
3.0,"Okay, I love this dress. The fit and feel are perfect. I own it in black and navy blue. But the color ""charcoal grey"" is misleading. I ordered the charcoal gray thinking it would be just that, a dark, deep gray! Instead what I got was heather gray. You know, the athletic heather gray that is the color of a 4 pack of mens pocket tees. That color just doesn't scream dressy to me, no matter what scarf and boots you try to pair it with, so I returned. But again, the dress itself is great! Just know what color you are after."
3.0,"These are nicely packaged and a great price. However, you get what you pay for. I bought these for my son and I to use for a day of skiing/boarding. They fogged up terribly unless we were facing directly into the wind. My son is 10 and ended up barely using them because he couldn’t see. Strap in thin compared to a normal ski goggle also. So skips around when wearing with ski a helmet. The lenses on both have scratches also after only one days use. Good for one day on the hill but not something we’ll use long term. Will get us both something better quality for next time."
3.0,Nice watch band but couldn't get good fit for smaller wrist.
3.0,The colour is not what I had expected
3.0,"Runs a bit big.  The material is not stretchy, and can look at bit unkempt when wearing it, if it does not fit your particular body. But, I like the color, the white detail, and looks good with my riding breeches."
3.0,Was expecting design and material to be different. Didn't care for it.
3.0,Too tight and small.
3.0,"Very cute, however order a size up! It was a bit too small (119lbs -5'6- medium). The waistband is a bit too tight. Otherwise, it's cute and breezy!"
3.0,The pocket is attached to the pants fabric without reinforcement so a whole was created at the top where it attaches. It should be reinforced from the underside to increase the strength. The pants fabric isn't thick enough to support a pocket. Otherwise: Great fit. Comfortable waistband. The fabric is a bit thin.
3.0,The stones keep coming out
3.0,Not true to size. Had to give away
3.0,It was too short once tied
3.0,"Love the top, but the lace top part was a bit too big"
3.0,"Minnesota is a great place to test how warm winter items actually are.<br />these gloves are NOT warm, little better than cheap knit gloves people use to work in the garden.<br />they are soft and comfortable, seem well made.<br />NOT WARM!<br />only good for looks, and they aren't ""that"" attractive."
3.0,"It was a bit snug and the cross cross straps were uneven. I had to pull out the thread, place it in a new/straight position and sew. The fabric is soft, silky and flattering and the print is just like the photo (I purchased the blue floral)."
3.0,It is a return.  I love everything about the purse except for the strap.  It is not adjustable.  Bummer!
3.0,It's a good chat if you liked to bleach spilled on denim look. The stars are mostly broken up by the hat seams do you get a few stars that are complete but most are not. It's sturdy do it will last a long time.
3.0,"The dress is beautiful. Li fits good from behind but if you have a excess fat around your mid section, the dress will reveal it. A really good Support foundation is should be worn to get the desired look if needed"
3.0,"The way the hood connects to the torso makes wearing the hood uncomfortable. Also, the pockets flop around a lot if the sweatshirt is not buttoned up. Materials are nice quality."
3.0,You can see my tattoo through the white shorts as well as everything else. Grey shorts are fine.
3.0,"It’s a pretty good quality dress, however, one button was missing and it fits sort of lopsided."
3.0,Runs small in the arms. Made from cheap material.
3.0,"The outfit is cute and it was a great price. My daughter spilt something on the shirt, near the lettering. When I tried to clean it off, the black ink on the lettering bled onto the white part of the shirt, forming a longish black streak. It looked like she'd taken a sharpie to her shirt. I tried to scrub it out but it didn't come clean. I was disappointed with that, but otherwise it's a cute outfit."
3.0,A good but not outstanding Champion sweat. I have purchased different color sweats by Champion in this model that are better.
3.0,Average quality. But the delivery took much longer than expected...
3.0,"The crotch support just isn't there. They're cute and fun, but poorly constructed so I'll spend my money on something a little more expensive that I know is quality."
3.0,I like the charm but don't like necklace
3.0,"Same quality, comfort and functionality as previously received.  The contents of the kit were slightly different than earlier replacement, but all went well replacing the band.  However, the watch band ripped through the holes provided for the replacement screws I placed into watch to tether the band.  I bought another fitbit to limit frustration.  Worthy of note that the replacement band on my 2nd fitbit lasted for several years so not sure why this one gave up so quickly"
3.0,"Product quality was spot on but the sizing was a bit off, choose a larger size especially if you muscular"
3.0,Who made these awful ties? The material looks unreal.
3.0,They're lightweight and furry good. They don't tint when going from darker areas into the sunlight like the advertised.
3.0,I kept it bc I like dbz but its misprint and too tight but I still kept it I'll color in the blue with a marker or something it's ok
3.0,"These glasses are ginormous, much bigger than other glasses from this brand. I cannot wear them. Am going to see if my sister can wear them since her face is fuller than mine."
3.0,Purchased for my nephew.  my sister said it was little cheap and wouldn't last long.  But I think its good for beginners.
3.0,It was too short in length and smaller is size than expected
3.0,"It's alright but it was a bit smaller than I expected even though I looked at the measurements. For myself as a larger chested lady, I had a little bit of a 'falling out' problem. The fabric and color are gorgeous though!"
3.0,It's not for me. I'm 5'1 and 144 lbs<br />. I ordered medium and the dress doesn't fit well for my body. It's longer than I expected. I guess this appropriate for curvy type of body. But I still recommend because of the stretchable material.
3.0,"This is not a high impact product. It is very comfortable but it does not keep the girls still when I am working out.<br />That said, these bras are comfortable and do a good job of keeping me supported during a workout and for everyday activity. These bras are a great buy for the money but don't get them if you need high impact or compression for your workout."
3.0,"I like the look of the watch, the black face and the stylish band that doesn't pinch my wrist like link bands do. The Roman numerals are wrong. Four should be IV, not IIII, and the bottom numbers are upside down. Strange, but cute, as I said."
3.0,Mine look more gray than white like I was expecting..  i will probbably sned them back and request white only  OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BEL PERFECT.
3.0,"These are wonderful earrings to wear every now and then. They aren't particularly sturdy and hardy - when I received them, one of the leaves had bent from shipping. I was able to fix it and lay it back flat, but still worries me."
3.0,Cute but a stone already fell out in first wear.
3.0,I like it but when it came and I open the box the product is damage. I wish they can give me a replacement for it. it feels like I wasted my money cuz I cannot use it.
3.0,The shirt wasn't what I expected but cute anyway. My daughter has to wear a tank top under it because the fabric is so thin you can see through it! Not impressed!
3.0,I got these to put in my lip when I didn't want my piercing noticeable. These haven't caused me any pain or discomfort & I've been wearing them since they arrived. One things I don't like about them is how shinny they are. I put some matte clear polish on end so it would be less noticeable & thats worked for me so far. I plan on painting them so they match my skin tone. That way they'll be able to blend in flawlessly. The piece you push/snap in came out one night while I was sleep. That hasn't happen to me before with any other body jewelry.
3.0,"only complaint is that after a few wearings, the material becomes knobby."
3.0,a little disappointed in structure of petticoat plus it ran small. I would not purchase again but made do with what we purchased.
3.0,Was very small compared to other brands in this size
3.0,Oversized fit.  Size down one.<br />Comfy material. Could’ve bought a large instead of XL.
3.0,Looks cheap. Material is horrible
3.0,"I’m keeping it, but the fabric and stitching looks cheap...I guess you get what you paid for. Definitely NOT a dress up item."
3.0,Not as big as the picture makes it look. its ok for a smaller woman or a teen... not for a grown woman with large wrists. Upsetting cause it was supposed to be a gift for my mom for xmas
3.0,ran too small in the arms.
3.0,Longer than expected. Hand wash and dry.<br />Hem is sloppily finished
3.0,More like a $10 dress.. its thin and way overpriced but it fit well.
3.0,I got this to be educational but even as an adult I have a hard time remembering which stones are which planet. They should’ve been in order.
3.0,"Loved this in the photo,  even ordered it in the olive green color.  I read the measurements and went with a size large. I was very satisfied when it arrived, the color was exactly as shown and the material was soft,  not at all see through. Unfortunately it was absolutely huge (it looked like I was wearing a gigantic night gown), and there were 2 thin snags across the front. I would definitely order at least one size down, if not two.  Based on the quality of this item, I feel like the snags were a fluke. I will be returning this,  but possibly reordering in the same color but much smaller size."
3.0,"Looks great. Feels like quality. BUT, stops periodically and has to be reset and wound manually.  Stem not that convenient for winding. Easy to set date etc. Instructions that came with package pretty much useless. Costs more than it should.  Find a battery operated watch. More practical and probably cheaper."
3.0,The ones I received are actually too big for me to wear. They are made of good quality and after a stitch or two it fit well.
3.0,Wide enough but would have liked it longer. After washing it hits about mid calf!
3.0,"Overall this looked good and I got many compliments at Halloween parties. However, there were two slight problems:<br /><br />1) The cape is larger than expected and a lot of the fabric dragged on the ground. I had a friend resew the seam and take it up, but it was still longer than I wanted. I'm an average height male, so seems it could be smaller.<br /><br />2) The laurel leaf headpiece that comes with the costume is garbage. It's an elastic band with a dozen or so plastic gold leaves loosely sewn onto it. The elastic band broke the first time I tried it on. Fortunately I'd planned to use a nicer-looking headpiece anyway, so just salvaged the leaves and glued them to the one I wanted."
3.0,Is a very nice looking watch come in a really cool wooden box. Only down fall is the battery in it did not work and it isn't a type of battery I can find anywhere to replace so it has never worked. But still became a good accent for looks at least
3.0,loved it but after about a month it broke
3.0,"Easy to twist your feet because of the  heal, not as confortable as I thought they will be."
3.0,I am round in the middle so I appreciated the style that helps give me a waste-line.  Great color- so far has worn well….I’m<br />Amending my review because the suit didn’t hold up…. Stretched out no longer holds in the tummy which is very sad because I really loved it
3.0,"Waist band screeches, a little, but does not close completely, no matter how tight you make the drew strings."
3.0,Faded color really quick!!!! Only wear it when riding the bike and within a month it looks brown.
3.0,Super cute. Complete set everything! Got an XL. I'm a Large in general. It was still too small and the apron had a stain on it. Order 2 sizes up to be safe. :/
3.0,Sadly this fell apart within a week's use. I carry my keys in my purse so it wasn't subjected to any hard wear and tear.
3.0,"I was quite excited to receive this product, but when I got it, it did not have the &#34;kiss me&#34; behind the cat and the chain broke the first day I got it, i still kept the cat and wear it with other chains."
3.0,"Not much too these shoes.  Not super high quality, but I was expecting that because of the price."
3.0,No shape. Collar would not lay flat.
3.0,Like the fact that it zips. Fabric is not very soft
3.0,This shirt is cute and decent quality but it runs a bit on the small side. I reccomend getting a size up if you purchase this.
3.0,more green than blue.....
3.0,The material is terrible... It itches all over.. I can't imagine wearing it...
3.0,"The shirt appeared to be cute but I had to return it.  If you have breasts, it will not fit."
3.0,Fits a little bit too tight
3.0,"I normally wear large and ordered large, everything fit great except it was very big near the hip area and too loose. I am going to try and order a medium, i just hope the top part fits. Returning now."
3.0,"So when this came in the mail today I was like what is this? It’s quite flimsy and made of nylon. I give it the benefit of the doubt and tried it on, and it doesn’t look too bad, it’s just not  what was expected!"
3.0,Extremely small.  I take a 34-36.  I bought a 38.  And is extremely tight.  I can only use as sleeping shorts
3.0,The width of the toe area is too wide. Kinda floppy.
3.0,"Nice but tight, even trying to strength them out a little was a no go. I gave the socks to my 9 year old."
3.0,Don’t really care for it
3.0,Unfortunately this tore the same day my daughter got it for her birthday - she was so disappointed
3.0,I thought is was gonna be just material kinda feel it's more like a costume for Halloween I wanted to wear like a everyday kinda wear a bit snug. But eh still cute am sure I can figure out something if not ingot half of a costume 😁
3.0,"Jacket is good for fall weather, not very warm in the middle of a Midwest winter. Runs a little small, so if you are cold natured like me, then you may want to order a bigger size to be able to bundle up better"
3.0,It's okay...runs small.
3.0,more on the gray then black large little to tight around the chest
3.0,"The fit is great, with the right amount of swing and comfortable sleeves.  The front and back hem is about knee length on me (5'6"" tall).  Unfortunately, the longer part of the hem (sides) was so long that it dragged on the floor, so I had to trim and hem it.  Hemming knit fabric is not my idea of a good time."
3.0,"fun, no sun protection on the sides of the glasses and scratch super easy, but fun while they lasted."
3.0,This dress is cut too large in the underarms.  Otherwise it fits great but isn't as nice as the dress that cost only $5 more from the same manufacturer.  I will wear this dress as a casual dress but won't be my favorite.
3.0,Package didn't contain the t-bar extension
3.0,"Just like the picture but the white is not bright white like in the picture. Material is light, breathable and super long."
3.0,Meh-it does the job but it sit awkwardly down over my eyes so it hits my sunglasses when I wear it. I still use but usually just in my yard.
3.0,Nice material but lace curls up even after washing. Neckline is slightly strange cut but I am already getting used to it. Was expecting a oval shape but it is more eye shaped.
3.0,"Great material, but the fit was off"
3.0,"Way to small, order 2 sizes bigger."
3.0,"Not the most comfortable but it is definitely one of the best *looking* sports bras. No problems of, um, squooshed-together lady bits."
3.0,"Very cute, but runs very small. I usually wear a large and had to return for an extra large which is still too small."
3.0,Runs a bit small and not made in the US even though I searched “woman’s blouses made in US”. I find the clothing made in China never fits me properly.
3.0,Returning they didn’t fit me right.
3.0,Beautiful coat but XL will NOT fit a 16-18. I almost didn't order that size but because I like my coats loose so I can wear big sweaters under them I ordered a larger size and this was ridiculously small.
3.0,"These mittens were not as pictured. They don't have the sports balls on them and are just plain navy, so not what I expected. Also, don't seem that they are entirely waterproof because the top side is just heavy fleece, but we haven't had any snow yet to know for sure!"
3.0,"I like the fit, they have nice stretch. They do run a little large."
3.0,Fits a bit tight but still cute.
3.0,"I love the colour and fit of this dress! The only disappointment for me was the fabric. Based on the photo I assumed it would be a light cotton or even chiffon, however it was a thick polyester and doesn’t have the “movement” I expected. Overall, I’m still pleased with this dress and I will keep it."
3.0,Nice hat but kind of a small fit. Has some creases in the hat as well from shipping. Hopefully they will come out within the next few days.
3.0,"I'm not impressed. I have a small frame and build, but I'm currently breastfeeding so I ordered a size medium. I look ridiculous in this top and I'm not going to order a size large because it will be too long and too big after I finish nursing my baby."
3.0,"I wouldn’t buy these again or suggest these pants To anyone. They’re not terrible, but they are very thin. They do not compress my belly, maybe I should have ordered a size down. I’m 225, 2 months postpartum and wanted something besides leggings. They’re not worth returning but I wouldn’t buy them again even in a smaller size. Even in a better fitting size, the high waisted part is flimsy and not supportive"
3.0,This product was too small for me.
3.0,I really don't notice an improvement after wearing it.  Sorry.
3.0,"I just got my bag and it’s bigger than I expected, which is a good thing, but as soon as I took it out of the plastic bag it was in, the smell of canvas “new smell” is soooo strong.  I let it hang outside for 2 days, that didn’t work, I used Febreeze and that didn’t work either, does anyone know how to rid that awful smell from these bags?  Oooftah!"
3.0,"It cleaned up all my jewelry well but then I made the mistake of washing it in the sink and it died. Had to throw it out, didn't shine anything after that. My fault I suppose."
3.0,I love the style of this chic jacket. It's lightweight and would be a great topper for a tank top or decorative bra.<br />The length is right at the waist.<br /><br />My only issue is that I will never be able to wear the jacket snapped. My chest is too large for the garment.<br />I do plan to keep it and wear it opened.
3.0,It’s not as long as the photo and it flares out at the bottom instead of a straighter cut as shown. The shirt is fine but not the slouchy fit or loose style I was expecting based on the photo. I disagree that it runs super large as others have stated. I would say order true to size if you don’t mind the other things mentioned.
3.0,A little bit small but still love them
3.0,Feet got sore after a few hours of standing at a wedding. My Walmart dress shoes don't even make my feet sore.<br /><br />They are an attractive looking shoe though.
3.0,"I consider myself pretty average- 5'3 and 138 pounds. I wear a medium in everything. This swimsuit looked great, especially for new mommies, but it seemed to be a little tight around my neck area. Aside from that, it looked great at the beach."
3.0,"Stiff as wood! Sitting in the closet, collecting dust..."
3.0,"I was so excited for these to come in the mail because I have two pairs of winter INK & IVY pajamas. They are sooooo soft, comfortable, are a good length in the legs & sleeves (the winter PJs, that is), and wash nicely and don't shrink up in the dryer.<br /><br />Imagine my disappointment when I received my summer jammies and the pajamas in the package were a different brand entirely! So... off to the return center they went. I don't know if the same pajamas get sold under different brands, but I wasn't going to risk it. Had I actually received INK & IVY pajamas, they would most certainly get 5 STARS.<br /><br />I think I'm going to reorder these now and hope I get what I expect! If I do, I'll come back and give a higher rating. If I again get a different brand, the rating won't be so great."
3.0,"I just didn’t love the fabric of this top. It looks better in the picture but I was looking for an easy wear, lightweight tank and this just doesn’t feel like what I was looking for. It’s not as soft or as drapey and while the fit is fine, the overall look just didn’t work for me."
3.0,earrings are tinier then expected but overall very cute. the packaging was excellent made me feel like i ordered more expensive earrings.
3.0,Pretty but won't last long. Turns your finger green.
3.0,"Everything was great but the sides are very tight. They ripped as soon as I was taking them off the 1st time, there's threads all fraid on both sides.They don't have any give. I suggest they make the material with something that is stretches some."
3.0,They have plenty of support and the sizing is true to size but I feel like the thong part that goes between your toes is too thick so they are not very comfortable.
3.0,The dress isn't awful but you can tell its cheaply made. Also please note you will need help getting in and out of the dress.
3.0,The boots are nice when I saw them on the web page but every time my daughter would walk it would make a huge sack on the back of the boot. She doesn't like them because of that :(
3.0,"The swimsuit is super cute and very well made! However, the sizing chart is WAY OFF! I have ordered the next size up and hope it fits better :)"
3.0,like the lights- more for a child- very small and tight
3.0,too large for what I expected
3.0,"I used these sporran hangars twice.  The 2nd time, one of the snaps broke so I had to go back to my chain.  I examined the snaps and whoever or whatever put them together did a poor job.  I ordered my own proper snaps to do a better job than what I got.  I really like the embossed leather with the Celtic knots.  The leather is of good quality."
3.0,"Shirt is see-through and kind of thin, but it is comfy. It runs very large, size down! I sized down from a L to a M and it was still pretty big."
3.0,great glasses! my wife loves them! very stylish design.
3.0,"They are tight and rigid i don't recommend, I buy the other"
3.0,Cheap and it shows in the material. Good watch -- the pins that hold the watch together fall apart easily so when adjusting the watch size be careful or you might permanently damage a rod and the only replacement rods it comes with are the ones for the very end.
3.0,Gift for my sister she likes it a lot
3.0,Cute and comfortable but I wouldn't call these compression tanks.
3.0,Cute shirt but the material is similar to inexpensive Halloween costume material.
3.0,"The top gets narrow at the top, more like a pilgrim hat instead of a top hat. I wasn't too happy."
3.0,"Fits well, not very comfortable or stylish though"
3.0,"The shoes are great, but, the light switch it hurts my child's ankle and he can't wear them for long periods. If the switch could be relocated on to the Velcro tabs it would be nice. So now we have a pair of shoes that can't be worn. It gave my child a sore on his ankles and cut his skin. I hope he doesn't get an infection on his ankles."
3.0,"Can’t get the sizing right on these. After reading the reviews, ordered two sizes up and the overalls were huge on me. Then ordered an XL which is my normal size and they fit a little too snug and gave me a camel toe. Would recommend maybe just going up one size if you want a semi-loose fit which is what I’m wanting. Also you have to tie the straps on, there is no button or clasp."
3.0,The Vendors are really nice and the sweater was cute.
3.0,I ordered wrong size. Had to return bc they were men’s shoes but seemed comfortable for men.
3.0,"For reference: I am 5'2"", 117 pounds, with long legs and a short torso. Athletic build (narrow hips, bigger thighs). I bought these leggings in grey size XS and marled blue size S. The grey size XS fits me and has good compression which I like, but they are too short on me, and the line that is supposed to go under your butt goes like halfway up my butt, and my butt is not that big. The blue size S is the right length and fits much better. However, the waistband is just a smidge looser than I would like. Overall, not bad for the price though, and I love the material. They are also not sweatproof, but that does not bother me that much. I would buy more colors in the size Small for sure."
3.0,"The product came exactly as pictured and described. However, getting it on my daughters eyeglasses was a 45 minute long task. Then when we put the glasses on with the band to check the fit they popped right off. There is no kind of stopper to hold them in place. So I had to invent a solution."
3.0,no like frabric
3.0,"I had to return it because it is too short on a long torso. Not really the fault of the dress, but I am 5’8” and this waist hit at the wrong spot for me."
3.0,Just not as warm as expected.... Played golf today...in mid 50s....needed to add a wind vest to stay warm
3.0,Not manly looking at all!
3.0,"The fabric is very thin, and while it does fit, the fit could be a lot more flattering."
3.0,The band feels nice but I can't figure out how to adjust the size. The clasp is a little hard to click and takes more time then I want to spend putting the watch on
3.0,"A very pretty and well made bracelet; however, it was a bit loose on my wrist.  Unlike other 'macrame' bracelets that I have, this one doesn't adjust to fit. Macrame' knots are very tightly woven so I'm not sure what its purpose is for."
3.0,"i love the fabric and colors,<br />however the cut of the bra is for people with very small/narrow rib cages.<br /><br />i'm usually 34A and still this thing is way too narrow to even try it on<br /><br />I was thinking of getting another one that is 2 sizes bigger, but then the cups will probably be too big<br /><br />So if you have a narrow/skinny ribcage/torso, this would be ok.<br /><br />Otherwise it's just too small  width-wise"
3.0,Cozy but runs a size bigger than expected
3.0,I liked how silky it was but strange fit
3.0,"The maybe dress is adorable, however the white bodysuit is not nice at all. The bodysuit is very, very wide. Not worth the money so I had to return."
3.0,"The material was good, but the zipper is cheap and poorly made. Didn’t really get to wear it as the zipper broke the day of the event. Thank Goodness I had a back up dress."
3.0,The cut
3.0,Cute but definitely runs small! Seems like youth size instead of adult.
3.0,"I bought this to wear in colder fall months but it's paper thin. It has pockets which is awesome, but they make the dress flare out around the legs so it looks like you have huge saddlebags and the dress is VERY see-through. A belt and some nude shapewear can fix it but not exactly what I was expecting"
3.0,"I was looking for a simple athletic style bathing suit, i needed something quickly and this seemed like a good option for the price. It is cut very high on the sides/hips, in the back, it has little breast coverage on the sides, etc. I ordered the right size. It has no paneling, no padding or panel for the breasts, this is ""sexy"". I'm 52 I was looking for something more practical. This is not an athletic suit. It is a skimpy suit, moreso than it looks in the pic. If that's what you're looking for, it's what it is, won't last long but, i guess it's good enough for the price. I returned it obv."
3.0,"These were almost identical to a set I bought at Wal-Mart but wanted to replace. Although the same size with the same band fit (2XL), there simply wasn't enough fabric provided for the cups. The lack of end fabric (so that I could let it out a bit) and a few loose threads conveyed that these were cheaply made. They were promptly returned for being too small."
3.0,Too big for me. Hurt my tongue.
3.0,"This was a cute costume. Unfortunately I’m 4’11” and had to cut and take it up.  I bought a large because even though I usually wear a medium i wanted a comfortable wear around the waist since it’s a zipper.  I also had to adjust the top where the gingham meets the white, because the large top was too large and fell too low on my chest. In the end with some alterations it turned out really cute. So I’m ok with it. If I had some recommendations for them I’d have them let you mix and match the top and bottom for size as well as using elastic for the skirt waistband instead of zipper and maybe buttons instead of Velcro for the back of the top because it opens every time you reach or bend for something."
3.0,I liked the braclet part of this but the cross could have better quality it looks cheap to a point
3.0,"The Talanes Racerback Sports Bras run at least a size small. I’m a 34A and picked my usual size, medium. The size chart from Talanes indicates I should pick a medium.<br /><br />When I got them, I couldn’t believe they were a size medium, they looked so small! I put one on top of a similar style, size medium Nike sports bra. The Talanes sports bra is an inch smaller in the band and almost 2 inches smaller in the cup area.<br /><br />Naturally, I was worried the sports bras wouldn’t even fit, or would be so tight they would be uncomfortable. To my surprise, they do fit, because they are so stretchy and lightweight.<br /><br />But the bras are so stretchy and lightweight -- they offer virtually no support. I don’t need much, but I like compressive, supportive sports bras. I can’t wear these for any athletic activity, but they will work for lounging.<br /><br />Construction is okay. I’m not sure how well the mesh panel on the front will hold up; one of the sports bras had a few snagged areas when I got it."
3.0,"Fabric is not the softest tencel, a bit scratchy on the inside.<br />Pants are so long.<br />I usually wear medium but because it was recommended to size up, I bought a large. The legs are too roomy but the elastic waist was too tight. Will have to return."
3.0,I ordered a size bigger and it is still a little small but it is cute
3.0,"This is a beautiful combination, however, I feel the price is a bit high for the size of the product. The charms themselves are no bigger than bracelet charms. And the little gems? Yeah, they fell out within the first two weeks of wearing them. Not only that but the gems are so small it's difficult to put back in. I gave up. My boyfriend has the other charm and though it works pretty well with what we wanted, it could have been better priced or at least larger. If you want them small, then have at it. Otherwise I'm neutral as to whether I would recommend this product."
3.0,I like the bag. It performs as I expected. I received the wrong color so I don't expect to use it much. Amazon customer service was wonderful in dealing with the wrong color issue.
3.0,"I wouldn't recommend these for anyone with a bubble butt. Run a little small... just enough so to not be comfortable. Also, the sequin panel doesn't wrap around as far as it looks in the picture. I am returning them."
3.0,"The headband is ok, but slips during vigorous activity such as HIIT and boot camp. Stays in place ok when running or cycling. The headband gets saturated with sweat and doesn’t wick it away also."
3.0,Runs very large...had to return it...but a nice looking shirt
3.0,Very much like the style and quality but these run small in the width. Very tight across the foot and I bought one size larger than I wear based on previous reviews.
3.0,This is more of a sweater then a jacket. Good for fall weather in the United States
3.0,"to wear, in my case, with a navy blazer.<br />Good for meetings. Reasonable price."
3.0,large difference in sizes between the toddler 8(24mos.) and 10(3T) it will be awhile before he can wear them.
3.0,Doesn’t fit well. Seem to run small.
3.0,Good fit. Fabric is flimsy. Does not drape nicely.
3.0,"Although adorable and fun, it does run a but too small. I was hoping for a more loose fitting sweater and this is just a little too fitted for me. I'm super curvy, I do have some bust but not gigantic and I usually fit into a large with plenty of wiggle room, I just didn't feel comfortable wearing this."
3.0,"Cumplió con su función. No creo que sean de muy buena calidad, pero vienen 8 unidades. Así que me durarán un tiempo."
3.0,"Not sure if it’s just the one I received, but I ordered two 2-4t kids carhart hats. One black and one gray . The gray one fits my daughters baby doll and that’s about it. It’s smaller than the hats they give to newborns in the hospital. Black one was perfect though!"
3.0,"Fits normal, but material is a thin soft cotton."
3.0,Too small and crop style material is very lightweight
3.0,"Mask is ok, but arrived too late to be worn at work during cicada season.  We all had a few run-ins with cicadas and I got this to add a few laughs with my colleagues.  The quality of the mask is fine.  I have no complaints about it."
3.0,"Beautiful, but to heavy for my ears"
3.0,Runs way smaller than size projects
3.0,a little smalL worrried if  u WASH
3.0,Cute if you have small or surgically altered boobs but this offers zero support for natural or large breasts.
3.0,"My order arrived promptly, the skirt fit very well. The color is much more of a pinkish wine than a deeper red I was expecting."
3.0,Cheap. Fabric is not fleece and is very thin.
3.0,"I was expecting more,thought the order was for different types."
3.0,"I love this shirt, but it's not super soft. I think it runs big. I wanted it larger and should have ordered true to size for a baggy fit. It's not washing up well and is starting to pill after a few washes."
3.0,This aren't the most comfortable shoes. Walking around with them for 15mins and my feet were hurting. I would definitely recommend if you wear these wear to a place you are going to be seated down for the majority of the time
3.0,"I picked up a pair of these Ristake Men's Flag Dress Novelty Cotton Crew socks in the blue star pattern in size medium for my 12 year old son. We love silly socks, especially to wear under ""dress up"" clothes to add an unexpected pop of color and a bit of whimsy. They are nice socks, cotton rich fabric, bold fade resistant colors, decent elastic and arch support. I would advise you to pay close attention to your selection when ordering as some of the pictures do not match the description. We got one pair of star patterned socks. In the picture it showed a pair of star socks and a pair of striped socks. I was expecting two pairs of socks, one star pair and one stripe pair, and we planned to mix and match them wearing one of each for a stars and stripes effect. Imagine my disappointment when only one pair arrived. As I said they are nice socks, but not $8.00 a pair nice! I washed the sock on the right according to the manufacturer's  instructions, machine wash cold, tumble dry low. As you can see in my photo, compared to the unwashed sock on the right, we lost about 2 inches to shrinkage. At this price, for one pair of made in China socks that shrunk two inches, I would not recommend. "
3.0,Doesn't hold up well. I bought this in December and It's already cracking in several places. Overall I am happy with my purchase. The case design is Beautiful and I received many compliments.
3.0,"After reading reviews, I ordered two sizes up and it is HUGE. Definitely only go up one size from your normal. It’s a very thin, stretchy fabric."
3.0,The picture makes them look soo much bigger than they actually are. Still pretty but very misleading photo
3.0,I love the design on this case and the feel.  My macbook air fits perfectly with a little room to add my ebook as well.  Unfortunately this bag really smells.  It is like a burnt rubber smell that transfers to my electronics.
3.0,"Flimsy - but cool looking - broke...I did not return because it would mean to drive to a postal station and be bothered for all the other things - wore it four times - on the fifth, it fell apart - quality - no good - style - sensational.."
3.0,"I ordered two of these, expecting 4 total daggers. Only 3 showed up, the packaging on one was open and the 4th was missing. Also this product took one hit on a hard surface from a 9 year old boy and shattered. I would reccomend this for younger kids, or kids who don't play rough."
3.0,I got the floral white dress and its depicted very white but is way more tan in actuality.
3.0,"The belt seems sturdy. But I would prefer the classic metal buckle. I would not use the terms ""tactical"" (whatever that means) or ""military"" to describe a belt with a plastic buckle, but this belt should be adequate for casual wear, which is why I bought it."
3.0,"Very cute. Exposed sharp metal on sides, which wasn't ideal. They also are a MUCH paler red than advertised. Overall, they served their purpose."
3.0,My husband is 5ft 10 and these are about 6 inches to long for him.
3.0,"These dresses/patterns are very cute and comfortable, but the sizing for each print is waaaay off. After reading the reviews on the sizes, I decided to order both dresses in XL. The blue dress fits perfectly, but the this particular dress swallowed me. It was way to big, but it was the exact same size as the bluish looking one."
3.0,"I had purchased these before but lost them and purchased these again to replace them. This time around I had a very hard time getting the rings to open and close. I'm giving three stars because the shipping was amazing, they arrived  3 days early."
3.0,Pretty and it jingles when you shake it but the chain is flimsy. The clasp broke the first time I put it on so I will have to replace it before wearing.
3.0,"The set was packaged together and should have been a size small.  Sadly the shirt was a small but the pants were a medium! :-(<br /><br />There was no option for an exchange to correct the error, so we’re sending them back for a refund."
3.0,"A bit dissatisfied. I love the colors! I bought these because I personally needed a smaller mask to fit my face all comments said they ran small. So I am bummed Because they shrunk just in the wash (cold water is not cold in AZ), now the elastic is too tight on my ears. These are great for asthma people as they are breathable and I do like the way the mask fits my nose and chin. I like all the different colors so will most likely replace the elastic myself to make longer and more comfortable so they fit."
3.0,I always wanted a watch with a clip because it more useful to me than a wrist watch. The price was fair and I liked the design and colors. The only thing about the product is the minute and hour hand on the clock are blue and red plastic not metal. The watch is very small and it's very light even with the battery which was included. My personal con is having to pull the ears apart in order to open the watch. I thought there would be a switch to do that for me. Outside of that I have no other major concerns.
3.0,"Good cheap glasses, look nice. However, the plastic rather quickly started to degrade and fall apart with little use. Yes they are cheap, so you get what you pay for I suppose, this is no exception. My next pair will be a little more expensive!"
3.0,"I bought two of these the xtra large fit fine but Came above my ankles, i bought a 2x for the other one it’s waaay too big but it’s the length of the photo"
3.0,"I bought this wristband because the original silicone band also caused skin irritation issues... so this sucks! Where the inside metal piece touches the skin is now bumpy, SUPER itchy and inflamed after less than a week of wearing it. This usually happens to me when something contains nickel. Just a heads up for other folks.<br /><br />The stretchiness and aesthetic of the band was nice."
3.0,The flat gems are harder to get in but I have liked all of them besides the fully blue and fully black (personal preference)
3.0,Wife says they are a little too over-sized. Otherwise good.
3.0,The suit itself was gorgeous but looked awful on me.  The top was too small and the bottom too big.  I would have to order in two different sizes to fit my body.  It would be nicer if you could order different size tops & bottoms without it having to be separate orders.
3.0,"Sleeves are kind of long, little black fabric fuzzies stuck in seams. Wal-Mart quality."
3.0,Cute but doesn't fit right due to my abnormally long torso.  I'm sure someone that isn't all Amazon lady body type would be stoked.
3.0,"The fabric is quite lovely - very drapey and just the right amount of sheer.<br /><br />It's just too tight across the shoulders. This is definitely not a super loose kimono cardigan.<br /><br />If I was smaller, I'm sure I would have loved it."
3.0,"Cute suit and unique color, but the fabric is stiff so it’s hard to get on!"
3.0,"According to Amazon's rating system, three stars indicates ""It's ok.""  That's a suitable rating for this set.<br /><br />First of all, I purchased this for a  2012 MacBook Air 13"" (Model A1466) laptop.  You certainly get a large number of pieces in this bundle, so it is a great value for the price.  (Note:  One of the images in the listing shows a MacBook Pro 13"".  This kit will NOT work on a MacBook Pro.)<br /><br />The pink cover portions for the top and bottom of the laptop case fit well, and give the laptop a pretty pink color.  It feels sturdy enough for normal use.  The bottom panel is fully vented to allow heat to escape, which is definitely beneficial and a must in any case of this type.  It also has feet that lift the laptop a bit higher off of any surface, which makes using it on a bed a more pleasant experience.<br /><br />There are several extra dust covers for ports that the MacBook Air does not need included in this set.  However, they have plenty of covers for the ports it *does* have, including the power connector.  I just tucked the extras away in case I have a use for them on another device later.<br /><br />The big letdown in this set was the keyboard cover.  I will say that I have never used a keyboard cover on a laptop computer before, so perhaps this is how they all are, however it rendered the laptop's keyboard almost unusable for me.  The outer portion of the cover (i.e. the portion that surrounds the keys) is made of a seemingly thicker and definitely firmer material, or a firmer version of the same material, than the portions that cover the actual keys.  When the cover is on, the keys are so close together due to the additional material that it's nearly impossible to touch-type as I normally do.  In addition, pressing a key makes the keyboard cover wrinkle and shift slightly, even after aligning the cover properly to settle between the keys as it should.  To the credit of the keyboard cover, though, it does have the keys labeled properly, and the labels line up perfectly with the markings on the actual keyboard (when you're not typing).<br /><br />I did not use the screen protector that was included in the package, so I can not speak to its quality or benefit.  I'm of the belief that if you use your laptop responsibly, you shouldn't need to put a screen protector on it.  From the look of the screen protector, however, it appeared to be glossy.  I strongly prefer the matte appearance of my MacBook Air's screen, as it prevents glare during use.  If you prefer a glossy screen, perhaps the screen protector would benefit you."
3.0,Item was ok.  Sent back to small.
3.0,It is Okay but not what was expected.  The brushes and cloth would be much better if they were larger.
3.0,"I ordered a size 5 for my son who usually wears a 4T.  It arrived in great condition and so cute, however it’s so small. It’s more like a size 3T."
3.0,I was looking for a thicker sock so I'm not thrilled with these but they are quite soft and comfy.
3.0,I bought this for my husband but did not even give it to him once I saw how small and feminine it looks.
3.0,Way too big for me.
3.0,This was fine except I forgot to measure the vessel of the charm I was going to put on it. The charm would not fit. So I have had to return it.
3.0,The balls are really hard to screw on but once you get them it looks great! Made with a good quality metal!
3.0,Quality bra
3.0,this was a pretty little ring but looked larger in the picture.  Just wasn't the one for me but it was nice.
3.0,Nice and thin which is what I like but I am also hot natured.
3.0,A little too small so the material start to get a run in it as I had it on! Material is not very strong! But it was a cute costume!
3.0,Ok it is for summer time
3.0,I loved the print but the fit was too small in the bust even though it was size Large.  I had to returned it.
3.0,"A very nice casual top, but so loose I will have to wear a shirt underneath."
3.0,"Very cute shirt but I never got to em wear it, as it runs so small I couldn’t fit into it."
3.0,The spring tension is not very tight.
3.0,Nice quality but runs extremely small.
3.0,"I feel conflicted in not giving this product 5 stars. It is as advertised and would work flawlessly if not for one issue.<br /><br />As I’ve recently transitioned to dialysis, I thought it prudent to get a bright pink band alerting any healthcare workers that my left arm is off limits.<br /><br />The grim reality is that the band may as well be invisible. I just spent 2 1/2 months in 3 local hospitals and either no one noticed the band or they didn’t know what it signified. It’s routine for me to say ‘there’s a pink band on my wrist informing you not to use that arm’. They’re response is typically, ’oh! Sorry, which arm should I use?’.  It’s also not uncommon to repeat myself to the same person later that day or week.<br /><br />I still wear the band as it makes perfect sense to do so and I have hope that eventually I’ll come across a healthcare worker who notices it on their own. Unfortunately, people are all too often wrapped up in themselves to notice much else, even a bright neon pink wrist band with an important warning.<br /><br />I say buy it just in case, but be prepared to vocalize your alerts."
3.0,Looks super cute but it rips my hair out when I run my fingers threw
3.0,"Much thinner than I expected, and it the feathers fall out like crazy, BUT for the price - it did its job for night =)"
3.0,They are cute. Unfortunately some were not glued properly so some were missing parts. But overall they are ok.
3.0,"Necklace broke same day, pendant okay.<br />Ring still on finger, so that's good.<br />Earrings prongs to put in ear broke the same day."
3.0,This is a very pretty band. I have very small wrists and this is a tad big and makes my Apple Watch spin around- which is not cool because it gets to be annoying! Very very beautiful though!
3.0,Runs small.. unusual for Addidas.
3.0,The picture of sailor moon was added poorly on the mask👎
3.0,Small on the wrist
3.0,"Nice dress, just did not like the fit/look of the top portion on me. Returning the item."
3.0,"The material is thinner than I expected, and there is thread hanging out everywhere"
3.0,Cute shirt and fits well..soft and comfortable. I did not wash it yet though.  But I paid $15.99 and this same shirt sells for half the price on Amazon . Not sure why so keep checking the prices .
3.0,Very cute! i bought 2 sets inside material id bet soft but the material sticks to my lips as i try to talk
3.0,I did not like them.  They are very big and not comfortable.  The metal is inferior quality and have sharp edges.  From the pictures you can have a visual of the sharp edges<br />I would not recommend.
3.0,5.6' 165lbd purchased medium sz. It's a neon coral. Almost looks like it can glow in the dark
3.0,The dress is sized small and after washing shrunk even more.
3.0,"Very thin socks, always falling off."
3.0,"I had ordered from this company before, and it was an amazing belt (soft and had a very nice lining). This one is tough and poor quality lining. It is OK only with jeans."
3.0,"This was really cute, It was a bit smaller than what I thought it was going to be. I followed the size chart very carefully to ensure I got the correct size. Aside from being a little weird looking, the material was super comfortable. I you can get the  size right this is as cute as it looks!"
3.0,"This Anna wig fit as expected, but was VERY heavy for my 7 year old Niece. She didn't enjoy wearing it because of that. It's very good quality."
3.0,Got holes in crotch. Kinda thin material but not see through. Good for anything other than professional. I clean in them.
3.0,"I am not thrilled. They are ok.  I wear them for my fitness walking on cold mornings, and they do the trick, but I won't use them for much else."
3.0,"Ridiculous shipping cost (more than the product) & there's only four sleeves/slots for photos; however, it fits my tri-fold perfectly."
3.0,I bought this watch to perform daily work duties . But it can be worn with causual attire as well. It's sturdy and nicely manufactured.  Albeit I was better off just buying that type watch band from Amazon. Because that's the only reason why I wanted it.I overpaid for it by far. This watch in my opinion should be reatiled for around the $20 -$30 price range.
3.0,Smaller than I anticipated.
3.0,"I thought for sure when I ordered this that it would be my main go-to cardigan for the fall and even winter in Arkansas. I love the idea of it. And it is thick and warm enough. But it's just not flattering on me at all and makes my waist look thicker and rides up on my butt that isn't even that big in comparison to the rest of me. It's just too short, especially in the back. This would probably work best for a very petite person with a flat bottom or sizing up for length purposes might help. I can't recommend it as-is though. As much as I wanted to love it, I don't reach for it hardly at all :("
3.0,super thin material. Not what I was expecting.
3.0,The style/look is okay. But it would be nice if the band below your boobs was a bit more tight.
3.0,The buckle comes apart when you take the belt off.
3.0,"Super cute! They are pretty comfortable on my cartilage piercing but absolutely would not work in my tragus piercing, if they were just a teensy bit longer maybe. Also 3 stars because getting them in is nearly impossible"
3.0,I was disappointed in the quality and fit of these jeans.  They felt cheap and the fit wasn’t flattering.  They were tighter than I anticipated.
3.0,"The dress is ok, smelled like smoke when I opened the package."
3.0,It fits great but the material is thin and has no stretch to it. I constantly was afraid of ripping my shorts each time I got into my car. I would also prefer if the shorts were about an inch shorter in length
3.0,"I bought this as a night shirt.  It fits great and the fabric is super soft.  HOWEVER, the embroidery is sharp.  It is not possible to wear so I wear it inside out.  I thought I would wash out soft but no- after 6 months of wash is has not."
3.0,Bought these for a boudoir prop. You need VERY small wrists to fit them!
3.0,Ordered XL and fits like a medium! Okay though I will give it to a small girl!
3.0,Didn't fit my one year old. Too large
3.0,Great looking glasses but so fragile.  My dog knocked them out of my hand and they dropped onto a wooden table not 2 feet down and shattered.  I've purchased two of these sunglasses and both have shattered within a month of purchase. Shame because they look awesome
3.0,Pretty sturdy!
3.0,"Sort of kind of useless to actually use as a belt, more for decoration purposes."
3.0,"It was a little cheap looking, but okay."
3.0,Overall cute. I wish the texture was smooth because tops look funny with it. Also it runs small. I'm an 18/20 and the 3x is almost too small.
3.0,Looks good but the size runs on the smaller side.
3.0,Super cute my son loved it but the lights don’t work
3.0,"Solid-looking clutchback pin shows picture of U.S. flag and the motto: ""I stand for the flag, kneel for the cross.""<br />The price is a little high considering that one can get American-made flag pins for about a third the unit price when buying ten.  Check out your local Harley-type store and you're apt to find better choices."
3.0,This is not considered walking on the American flag?
3.0,"Bought this for a trip to Nica with my GF to fit 4 boards and clothes. The construction is great, zipper is super strong, bag will do a nice job with protecting the boards BUT you will need to bubble your boards still and it just does not fit the application of multiple types of boards unless you ride toothpicks. When going on a trip I want to have a few different type of boards with varying thickness and length. With one of her boards being an Egg that is 2 3/4 and most of my boards being around 2.5 in thickness we really can only fit 3 boards. When you save up to go on a week+ trip this is just not enough boards for two people. I ended up selling the bag and buying a Tour Regulator 2.0 that is on its way. The construction is pretty similar minus the wheels. I did recommend that they put two handles on each side for the Regulator so it can be carried by two people."
3.0,Makes a great makeup bag...material feels more like luggage.
3.0,Very pleased with entire process & order!
3.0,"I am a fairly savvy person when it comes to figuring out electronics, but this watch has stumped me.  The instructions that come with it are not very clear and I've about given up.  I'm not trying to do anything complicated either -- just wanted it to be a reminder for a family member to take their meds during the day.  Surely to goodness there's a way to make it easier."
3.0,I love the color of the shirt.  The detail on the back is wonderful and it fits great on the top.  But when you get down to the bottom it turns into a bell.  I am a skinny person so it looks really bad on me. It made me look like I had a hoop around my waist.  I love PB tops but this one is not for me.  I am going to send it back.  Im 5 foot 8 inches and 125 pounds.
3.0,"These look a lot more faded than I expected, so that's fine if that's what you're going for. They are very well made."
3.0,"Got the socks and they appear to be of good quality but for large / X large they are really a medium. They only come about 3/4 of the way up my leg and I expected them to be knee high, and not quite wide enough. The band around the top leaves a furrow into my skin like I have a rubber band around my calf. Won't buy these again"
3.0,Comfy pants. Great for day to day wear. My only issue is that bits of elastic started coming out of the pants after a few wears...
3.0,Material feels kind of funny.  I'll need to wash it several times first before its soft enough to wear.
3.0,I have gotten a lot of these  rated for Sense 3 watches... and these just didn't latch properly.
3.0,"Visually, the mask is fantastic. It's currently on display at the shop I work at. It is, however, very tight-fitting and uncomfortable. The mouth is completely open, which is great for if you're wearing it and want to eat something, however it affects the stability of the lip area of the mask. I am comparing the item to a different Creature mask that I also have, which is structurally a bit better though less detailed.  I would say, overall, worth it if you have a smaller head, or for a child."
3.0,Not the color purple for sure More of a Maroon color no purple at all could not use with the outfit.
3.0,I ordered several pairs for my children. There are size / color / length (calf) differences between the 2 socks sold as pairs. They are warm though.
3.0,Goldy look false looking
3.0,Crinkly and somewhat odd fiting. They are decent but not great
3.0,"Left eye lens came with a small scratch. I did not return it because the scratch is small and a little bit uncomfortable, mayve this eyeglasses are easy to scratch."
3.0,They're ok but not great. They tilt over and can't stand.
3.0,Love them. They are very comfortable. Downfall - I received them with a hole in the pocket (seam is undone) and almost lost something! Would get a 5 star rating but give a 3 because of this.
3.0,The material very thin but cute shirt
3.0,"It’s cute, but they do shrink significantly when you dry them. I have a large baby. She’s 4 months, but fits in 6-9. They fit after the first wash, but they shrunk more after the second wash. I would get a size up of what you need. I posted a picture, and the ones underneath are also 6-9 and they look significantly bigger."
3.0,Ran small on my son. He wears 3-4T in pjs. I ordered a 4T and it tight on him. I should have ordered a 5T
3.0,It’s nice to go as a layer underneath but you need to add more layers of clothing for warmth.<br />Good to work out in but not super absorbent.
3.0,"I like the style (nose pieces were close together so glasses did not touch my cheek), but did NOT receive the colors they stated -- particularly wanted the blue & pink"
3.0,"This top doesn't fit well on me. I have a large bust which seems to make this top fall weird on me. It fits boxy on me which I hate. The sides of the shirt go straight down and out instead of falling or laying on my sides. The cuffs around the sleeves are a little tight, too. I'm not docking a star for this because it was my fault, but it got thrown in with my regular laundry and the red ran and turned the top part of the top pink. The top part is see-through so you can see any straps that you're wearing underneath the shirt. It seems like good quality and like it would look good on someone else. It just isn't flattering on me."
3.0,Was a little small for medium and quality not so good
3.0,no snaps or hooks
3.0,I normally wear a 10-12. Medium  tops and large bottoms.  I ordered a 2X<br />after reading  the reviews suggesting sizing up 2 sizes. I returned for a 3X. Sleeves are still too short and tight thru the bottom.<br />I will keep it in hopes of it stretching.<br />I wish China would use US models for products sold here.
3.0,"I still think its cute but the shoulders are way to large. I fimd myself pulling thwm up or tucking bits under my bra strap so i dont fall out. Get a size smaller. Its also not a soft materiel so be prepared for that as well.  Over all you het ehat you pay for, I'm a size m-l in tops, and a 10 in pants us size.  And a XL was way way to large."
3.0,"First off, these are really comfortable for dress shoes, trail shoes, work boots, and even gym shoes. But they did not fit with my heritage 8111 iron Rangers. They raised the heel to far up out of the cup and caused nasty friction and a sense of not being secure in the boot. I ended up buying some 2.99 wal-mart cushion slip ins and duct taping some memory foam on the undersides as desired for my arches. Ghetto rigged, but it works. They are really nice and quality, but did not fit into heritage boots as advertised. They may fir other lines of boots, but for IR I found them to be undesirable."
3.0,The dress was ok but they need to work on the sizing
3.0,"This necklace is really cute and I love that they already offer one for Midnights. I tend to not wear necklaces often because I have pretty sensitive skin, and this necklace will unfortunately not be the exception, as I started to breakout after wearing it for a couple hours. It is a nice necklace for the price!"
3.0,It wasn’t a good buy compared to the price so returned.
3.0,"I did not expect this watch to be so big and heavy! I don’t mind the big, but the heavy is a bit much. It’s heavy enough that unless you make the wristband VERY tight, the watch will fall to the bottom of your wrist.<br /><br />I rather like wearing big heavy watches, but I don’t know about this one. I want to like it. I think it’s quite stylish with a great retro look. It’s definitely like wearing boyfriend jeans or giant white shirts (and would look great with that duo). But as you can see from the photo, I don’t have young hands. I wore the watch for a few hours earlier and it was rather tiring. It’s definitely more of a statement piece than anything else.<br /><br />I really like the silicone band BUT it’s problematic for a heavy watch. The things that hold the strap in place keep slipping and the band is quite long for woman’s watch, so even if you arrange everything just so, very quickly the band will be sticking out. I do have a fairly small wrist as I’m a size 2 and five feet tall, but I have larger than average hands.<br /><br />I was SO looking forward to getting and wearing this watch but I am not sure I will be wearing it.<br /><br />It keeps the time just fine. Truth is, unless it was seriously off, it wouldn’t matter, ‘cause in this day and age, one wear a device on the wrist or consults one’s phone for the time. One wears a watch for the style. This one is very stylish in the big oversized glasses kinda way, but just be aware that it is heavy. Did I mention that it is heavy?"
3.0,Hits at waist.  Runs bit small.  Hits at waist .  Ordered size up
3.0,Nice but they missed a spot in the paint type design
3.0,Very disappointed hat was bent and crumpled just not what I expected
3.0,"I really loved this band. Thick but not uncomfortable. But…after only 2 weeks of intermittent wear, the metal bar the connects the band to the watch broke off. Don’t know if it was a fluke, but I’m sad I can’t use it."
3.0,Too big for a standarts
3.0,This shirt is cute but I received the wrong one. Instead of coffee mine reads &#34;wine.&#34; Not a huge deal but I did expect to receive the item I ordered. I'm not really a wine person but I'll still wear it. I kept imagining how horrible it would be if a recovering alcoholic  ordered the coffee version of this shirt and recieved the wine one instead.
3.0,I loved the look of this shirt but the material is too fragile.  It tore after a few washes.
3.0,Really cute; pants ran a little big but not noticeable; jacket had a small hole under the arm but for 20$ the set is worth it...u get what u pay for 1 wash and it's unraveling at all the seams :( I really love the outfits just wish the material would hold up
3.0,these socks are to tight
3.0,"Hat was cool but should show under the hat brim where it says ""Bitch face never rest"" I bought the hat for my younger son."
3.0,Perfect for girls with smaller bottoms!
3.0,This cuff is adorable but it can only be worn on your ear for 30 mins. this jewelry killed my ear and left It red and tender to the touch for at least 24 hours
3.0,"I didn't like the material, it felt a bit rough."
3.0,"The pink is so pale that it almost looks white.  The quality seems okay; however, I rejected this ring due to the disappointing excuse for pink."
3.0,"This product fit fine, but it was very unflattering and made me feel like a Christmas tree. I returned the product."
3.0,"Print and fabric are fantastic will never fade, but has these tiny gathers that land right at my hips making look unflattering . I was looking for a flows look, it's more form fitting .  I'm American size 6, average Med in women's , this top is more like a women's small, but still a cute top on the right figure."
3.0,These are really cute but I am 5'8 and I think average height they go to my ankles like pants picture shows them as cropped.  Will need to alter them
3.0,Way too short for torso.
3.0,"The bottom is basically a foam hospital sock. I expected something a smidgeon more substantial. Gonna give it a try, but not sure how well it will work."
3.0,"Don't really like the feel of the fabric, was a bit too small. I would size up. Shirts are not as long as I hoped. Okay to wear around the house but will wear pieces separately to the gym or out in public."
3.0,"for a 5x was feeling like an 3x, too small. gave away due to the whole return issue"
3.0,They are lovely. But short.  I am getting it restrung to 2 longer strands instead of 3
3.0,This jewelry is okay i was expecting for a big one though but after all its all good i am just sad that it quickly lost the other pairs :'(
3.0,A little small and tight
3.0,"This suit looks great from the front - very flattering. The back view, however, looks pretty terrible on me. I am larger-waisted and this suit accentuates that. I love the support and coverage up front, though, so I might keep it."
3.0,Love this hat! Didn’t love waiting a month for it to be delivered!
3.0,"I was a little worried at first.  The band felt fragile, but after wearing it for a few weeks, I now know it’s quite sturdy and well made.  Great bargain!"
3.0,"Pretty kimono. Compared to others I have from Target, Victoria's Secret, LuLaRoe, it runs small."
3.0,A lot taller than I thought they would be
3.0,The dress is very pretty but it doesn't flare out at the bottom as depicted.
3.0,"I liked the style of this shirt and I do wear it, but I do not really care for the fabric as it is not even a light true denim but a fabric that pills."
3.0,These were smaller than I thought they would be the fabric is a lot thinner than I thought it would be an overall I'm just not thrilled with the bottoms. They did come with a bonus headband which was nice but I can't really wear the pants I will just probably give them to one of my girls.
3.0,"Fits as expected. After a few washes the straps get uncomfortable, but they work and the colors are cute."
3.0,Runs tight. My daughter hasn’t worn it.  But it’s super cute. I’m hoping we can regift it. It’s never been worn just tied on. She’s a medium but this was too small.
3.0,"Very nice fit, and design, but just hanging it on a hook behind the door, caused it to begin a tear on the hoodie."
3.0,"Weird material, but cute design."
3.0,"Los tapabocas son excelentes, en cuando a su tela y uso, pero la cuerda que las ajusta, una me llego dañada y otra, a los 15 días se me daño, así que hoy en día solo uso 1 tapabocas de los 3, por esa razón."
3.0,bought this for mom and it swelled her but she still uses it as a house dress
3.0,I ordered a large but it fits like a small.
3.0,It's just okay. It looks cheap in real life.
3.0,"This dress is nice, I ordered an XL based on the reviews. Let me start by saying the length did not even cover over by back side.  im 5'7 170lbs. the skirt wrap portion is sooo short. I had to return it.<br />The color was beautiful, the material was nice, however it was barley long enough for my 8 year old daughter."
3.0,Really like the material but the vikings part started coming off within a month...
3.0,I like the fact that they have the extra pockets and the waist is adjustable .I am 59 yrs. old around 5'10'' 5'11''and weigh 195 lbs. and I buy the med. short . This pair I had a problem with them fitting at first then upon inspection noticed the top button was at least a 1/2 inch over to far .Cut it loose moved over and resewed and pants fit fine .Minor problem .
3.0,"I love the sweater, it just doesn't fit like it does in the photo."
3.0,"It is weather proof, and provide enough visibility.Zip sometime bites the cloth and stuck."
3.0,It was a good deal compared to similar items so we tried it out. The stitching was not the best. Strings hanging. The torso was very short for a large. I would recommend getting two sizes up for that reason alone.
3.0,These stay on good but they are tight and make my toes curl up. I got the large for size 9 feet with long toes.
3.0,"I like the shirt, but it didn't keep its shape. I don't hate it, but I don't love it. It's a good shirt to sleep in now. So I don't wear it out, but I'm still wearing it. For the money, I'm not complaining. Just not what I expected. It was on time, and fit desecent when I wore it the first time. Till I washed it."
3.0,"The bracelets were beautiful and I loved the stones , sadly though my signigicant others broke after about 2 and a half weeks, other than that happening they were truley lovelt bracelets"
3.0,"The rose gold color is like in the picture, the cross is small but well made, they feel a little heave.  But for me, this earrings were very difficult to put on, I had a hard time trying to do it and I finally quit. maybe they are made for children."
3.0,"The black coating started to wear off. First it was only on the middle rod, but eventually the discs began to show wear as well. After a few months of screwing them on and off, the screws were stripped and they continuously spun around and around without screwing in. Not worth the price considering the lack of quality control."
3.0,"This is not the best mask out there. Don’t get me wrong, it’s better than most of the cheap ones. To me it looks more like an old man instead of Michael Myers. If you’re on a budget get this one, but if you want a nice good looking mask get the one Trick or Treat Studios sells."
3.0,Fantastic gift for someone or even yourself.  I use it to put my new Samsung Brightside cell phone in.  Just make sure that you redo ALL of the stitching before you use this product as the leather loop connectors fell off the first day due to poor workmanship.  Other than that they are very nice looking and do the job!  I would of gave this product 5 stars if it wasn't for the issue of stitching.
3.0,Material is slightly different from what is shown however it fits very well and is pretty.
3.0,They feel good on the feet but I like something that comes a little higher up the leg.
3.0,Fits small. Sizing chart not accurate.
3.0,"Nice quality,  but it runs small."
3.0,Fits nice but the quality of the actually image on the shirt is really bad. Kind of like if you zoomed in on a 150x150 photo.
3.0,The fabric is fairly soft but too thin for me and the dress is not very flattering on my body. Wish the Vneck was deeper. I wouldnt buy again.
3.0,"I brought these rings sometime last month and had them sent to a relative address in the U.S.  I recently received them Monday 4th August so I can't really give an accurate assessment as to the durability of the rings at present. Since I only had them for the short space of time.  But on trying them on my fingers I realized that they are a little too small for my fingers. But I must say that they are indeed really cute, if your interested in getting something cute. As it relates to the delivery timing of the rings it was really fast compared to the estimated delivery timing which was a plus for me.  The only thing that I was concerned about is the method of having proper updates (tracking information) for this item.  But overall it would be a good buy for persons with small (slim) fingers."
3.0,"To be fair to this bag, it is gorgeous.  The color, texture and feel are all very nice.  The problem is, I'm an intern therapist, who doesn't have a permanent office and needs to carry all of my stuff around daily.  I was looking for a large bag that could carry a clipboard, a notebook, two filing folders, a double sided expandable file case, my iPad, schedule book, wallet, pens, and a water bottle.  This is a tall order, which based on the reviews, I hoped this bag would fulfill.<br /><br />Unfortunately there is a design flaw in the bag for those who need it to hold their lives.  The bottom of the bag is sufficiently large, although the padded compartment takes up some of it.  However, the bag get narrower towards the top.  This means if anything in the bag is tall AND wide, the top doesn't really close all that well.  I end up having to contortion it into an odd shape to get the zippers closed, and then because it is an odd shape, it is awkward to handle.<br /><br />Overall, if you have narrow items, or if they are soft and flexible, I think this bag can be an awesome option for the office.  I am going to keep it and maybe when I have a more permanent office space, it will work better because I won't have to hold as much."
3.0,Ear loops way too big for anyone. Had to tie them to make them fit. Most looked cute.
3.0,Came on time love the colors except I thought they be brighter. The purple ones are very light n when I put them on you can’t tell they are purple which made me sad cus I really like them. Overall they fit great
3.0,I don't like that it's two layers. Doesn't sit right on my head. I'm constantly having to make sure the layers line up before I put it one. Would be easier without the inside layer.
3.0,"This piece is nice and I like it, but I didn't like the way it looked. The first time I tried an industrial bar like this I was a little skeptical but it is honestly the most comfortable industrial bar I have EVER worn in my ear...that however was from a different seller. My honest opinion is the other seller's were made better."
3.0,Pretty dress but fits very small order one or two sizes larger for a perfect fit
3.0,I am 1x size and I ordered 2x because the sizes come small but unfortunately it came very small for me
3.0,"It fits great every where BUT the collar/neck area, which is way too big. But with summer coming having the neck wide open like it is it will be ok."
3.0,Loved it but will be adjusting the size. I do jewelry so I have tools. It’s rally too loose.
3.0,"Thin material, simply okay quality. Not comfortable to wear."
3.0,Okay fit but the material faded really fast. Was hoping for deeper scoopneck
3.0,"I'm returning this product, but if it had fit I would have loved it. I am typically an XL, but can comfortably wear an L, and can even be okay in an M if it runs a bit big. I ordered this shirt in an XL and could barely get my arms into the sleeves. The body of the shirt fit great but it was like the tacked a smaller sizes sleeves onto the body. I don't know if the product was defective or if they all have tiny little sleeves, but keep that in mind before you order."
3.0,I love the bathing suit it was the perfect side but the hole on the stomach is awkward. I have to lose more stomach to be comfortable.
3.0,"It's not that the boots are too small, it's that you can't get your foot into them without unbuckling them EVERY TIME.<br />Ain't nobody got time for that! There's no elastic even. I don't know about ya'll but it's not easy for me to buckle and unbuckle all the time."
3.0,love this set but sad bottoms a little small top a little big wish shorts where a little higher knitted so but crack wont show if pull to where tgey need to go if u have a shorter botton half u should be fine but i am 5/6 and im 125lb...
3.0,The color is NOT what is pictured for the linen looking ones... it is more of a pale yellow color... the fit well and have a relax feeling still slightly disappointed in the color.
3.0,This runs small so be sure to order up a size
3.0,"They look really cool, bought  them for my friend who loves Hu Tao. I put one on and it just feels like poor metal. Looks great though, hoping they hold up!"
3.0,Colors are great but yes you can see your bra color through the dress beautiful dresses beautiful colors fit as expected
3.0,"These are very cute shoes, look exactly like they did on the online pictures. I ordered the black and orange ones. My son loves then. However, we've had them for about 3 weeks now and the stitching is already starting to fray. Nice-looking item, poor quality"
3.0,"I just received the watch today I like it a lot, but when I tried it on I was disappointed. The watch is a little small for bigger guys so it's very tight on my wrist. Only if it came with extra links but it doesn't so going to have to return it sadly."
3.0,These are really pretty but two of the posts bent pretty easily
3.0,bigger than I thought. Sloppily made but it was very cheap.
3.0,Gave this to my daughter as a gift. She has only worn it maybe 6 times and the stone has fallen out.
3.0,"Nothing wrong with them, just don''t like how they fit... Makes boobs look very pointy. Personally I like my bras to make a little more rounded rather tan pointy..."
3.0,The rose is nice but you really can't see much of the pearl inside.
3.0,"Fabric is not thick felt you think of from crafts.  It's paper thin, and doesn't stand up great, BUT, it was only $6.50, so I guess can deal with it."
3.0,"So it looked amazing in the front and felt amazing on, but somehow the straps made my back look really fat and unflattering. I have a muscular back / am in good shape so it was really odd that this bra was able to do this to me. Usually these kinds of things look really sexy."
3.0,"Not that I expected a super great quality for the price, but I have only had these less than a month and the color is coming off making it look goldish. I am surprised that my finger hasn’t turned green yet.  I thought with 14k gold plating the quality would be a bit better.  I am a little disappointed that it took less than a month to start chipping.  The fit is great and accurate."
3.0,Sizes run a little small so I would suggest ordering a size up.
3.0,We ordered a box of the headbands. Half of the headbands never worked when the box was delivered.
3.0,"Great looking bikini, however, I didn't notice the cut of the bottoms!  Left nothing to the imagination!  Notice the front and back are the same cut, if shopping for a minor!!"
3.0,"Gave it 3 stars because the product description says sweatshirt, but it is a heavier jersey material. The snaps are on 1 side. Like all tasc it feels lovely and this is a good travel item as it takes little space to pack. Buy it for layering."
3.0,Pretty just like the picture.
3.0,"I ordered these and within a week of starting to use them the seams started to tear. I've used fabric glue to mend them. They hold a decent amount of weight. They keep your stuff cooler than not having an insulated bag but not cold. Get your groceries & go home. Don't make any extra stops. These aren't coolers. I'm satisfied with the purchase, not thrilled. I wouldn't buy them again but if I got them as say a gift, I wouldn't go to the trouble of returning them. I'd use them."
3.0,It was very nice but after wearing it for a week it started to become discolored from the silver
3.0,"It was a gift. Not exactly the colors I would have chosen, but it serves its purpose."
3.0,"Love the design, but the hat fits weird."
3.0,It just fits kind of off I don't like the buckle in the back and the ear muffs stick way out look funny and are useless and when you tuck ear muffs inside the hat it is to tite .
3.0,"This is super cute and soft but unfortunately the sizes are completely off. I got a 3X because I wanted it to be super big on me and it barely fit. To put that in perspective, I ended up giving it to my 10 year old daughter and other than the sleeves being way too long it fits her pretty well.<br /><br />Pretty disappointed because I was excited for this one."
3.0,"All appeared good, except to small for me."
3.0,It's nice exactly what I expected.  I would not order again. Reason why is it took almost a full month to receive it. I didn't know when I ordered it and I don't know how to tell when I order things where they are coming from. But I do know anytime I accidentally order something from China it takes a super long time to get. So if you're not in a hurry to get this I guess it's nice. I got a large because I heard they ran small. It is true if you usually wear a medium make sure you get the large.
3.0,Need to order a smaller size.
3.0,Kinda chinsey
3.0,Not very comfortable material but it is a good staple
3.0,It is a great looking wallet. The wallet itself is a nice one but there was s shipping mix up. I ordered a gray one but it came brown
3.0,Super cute but runs big and not as expected.
3.0,"It's really a nice piece for the price, but it is NOT the same as what is pictured. The actual image is pretty close to the same, but the name CECILY does not appear on what was delivered. The item instead shows CECILIA and then includes additional text on the right side that says PRAY FOR US. Still not bad but also not exactly what I ordered."
3.0,Very loose fitting and shows cleavage.
3.0,Awful pattern on thick legs and runs a bit small
3.0,At the zipper area it's not glued properly. Other then that every is good.
3.0,"pretty, but I expected something larger.  Very dainty and not a statement piece.  I was disappointed but did not return"
3.0,It fell out my ear the first time but I wore it but other than that it's nice
3.0,Unfortunately it was too large for my wrist so I can’t wear it.
3.0,It does not come with a return address so I had to take it to an alteration place and it cost as much as the dress to have it taken in. A 2x fits perfectly and is beautiful on. I am going to order a third print right now!
3.0,"As always this is a quality Merrell product. Unfortunately its was advertised as a Hiking Boot its actually a Work Boot, two different things. I had to return it for an actual Merrill Hiking Boot."
3.0,The top fit well on the bottom half but the top covering wasnt filled in. but I use a safety pin to make it tighter to fit properly
3.0,The fabric is thin and the top had strings hanging
3.0,"This is my first ever review. I ordered these glasses in purple the first time and they were fanastic! They didn't come with a case and I was able to drop them in my purse, drop them on them ground, etc with no reprocution. It was a long time after purchase that the purple finally started chipping off so I ordered another pair of purple and a pair of aqua/teal color. Sadly the purple ones somehow got ""bent"" (even though they're plastic) so now they're just too uncomforable to wear and the aqua/teal pair are too scratched to see out of. I'm very, very sad about this! I loved them and they always feel so good on! I'd love to try them again if I could be sure they'd be ok."
3.0,Not quite denim... more of a thin denim looking fabric.  The dress was cute but it didn't fit me as expected. I returned it.
3.0,bulky on the ear
3.0,"This was a replacement for one which my husband has had for &#34;years&#34;.  It came on time.........but did not fit.  My suggestion would be if you are close to the largest measurement on a medium go ahead an order a large.  Vendor was quick to respond about returning it, I have done this and now we shall see if they are as quick in exchanging for the next size.<br /><br />As to the hats in general........................FANTASTIC!!!"
3.0,"GF: These shirts are okay... For reference I'm 36D, waist 28in. They don't offer any type of compression as you can see. They're very stretchy, will see how they are with wicking away sweat. If they offered a smaller size I probably would want to replace, but since they don't, I'll just keep these."
3.0,"It’s beautiful but doesn’t stay up by itself. Thankfully there’s a wide loop in the tail where you can hook another earring through to hold it. Other than that, 10/10 :)"
3.0,"Big plus for coming with everything needed to adjust the size. The bracelet looks nice. I can be finicky to get a good fit. If you have hairy arms, expect to have hairs pulled by the links. The surface is nice and smooth and has a nice weight to it. The clasp is plastic and can feel a little cheap, but shouldn't be noticeable when worn."
3.0,I wasn’t super fond of the material it was made from. It’s super thin.. and the belt that it comes with doesn’t look anything like the picture.
3.0,"Design is really cute but it rides up in between my thighs when walking. If you don't have a thigh gap, expect this to ride up in between your legs. I have to constantly pull it back down when wearing it under a dress. I wanted something to reduce static under my flowy work dresses but I got tired of having to readjust these shorts. These are now my lounge shorts."
3.0,hm...
3.0,"A bra being seamless is always a good thing. However, this bra didn't work for me. The padding assumes that every womans body and 'girls' are perfectly shapely and we know that's not the case. It just didn't cover the way it should so not helpful. There was also a little bunching.as the bra didn't quite stay in place. A different size wasn't going to change this. Taking the padding out wasn't helpful either in my case. Might work for someone else though. I'll be returning the one I didn't wear."
3.0,"Perfect color, soft, simple but cute and well printed but way too big for a small."
3.0,"These are comfortable, fit well, and seem sturdy, but they hold a lot of water if your feet get wet.  Beware of blisters if you get caught in the rain on a long ride."
3.0,"They're a bit small, barely reach my ears"
3.0,This was very cute but I had to return since I have larger hips and thighs the slit was very open and noticeable on me. If you don't have curbs then definitely a must buy.
3.0,Loved it at first but it is now showing signs of wear and I’ve only owned it about 5 months. The leather around the edges is peeling away from the plastic frame underneath. Wish it was more durable!
3.0,"I kept seeing these beautiful blouses and talking myself out of them knowing you get what you pay for.  So, I finally broke down and ordered this.  The material is very thin.  The zipper is very rough.  I usually wear a medium but ordered a large.  It was not as big on me as I thought it would be, so order large.  It is still cute.  I will still wear it over a warmer shirt."
3.0,Looks real.  I don't wear a lot but hasn't discolored my finger when worn.
3.0,Tying the lace on the back without someone's help is next to impossible.
3.0,So cute in the photos but looked ridiculous on my 5’4 frame. Literally hung to the middle of my shin and was so big and baggy.  I returned it sadly.
3.0,I have received several compliments for the color of this bag. Been using it for work for about a year now and the large shoulder straps are coming apart so I tossed them. Material is not sturdy and neither is the lining. Its a good bag for everyday use - one that you don't have to worry about ruining.
3.0,"Fits true to size, just t-shirt material. Good for layering."
3.0,I really want to keep this but the bottoms roll over themselves in the back and lay right in the front. The top is soooo cute. I love the ruffle straps. The top makes it hard to return but the bottoms just look terrible.
3.0,These are nice but they don't stay too well if you have an abnormal footstep.
3.0,Did not stay on well. I have small feet and they were still a little too small for me.
3.0,"This is a pretty purse holder, but the clasp is weak & does not hold together very well.  The clasp has come loose twice, and I've only used it several times."
3.0,Too long and material was not of high quality
3.0,"Although the product description says &#34;Welcos 7 Pack&#34; the item you are receiving is actually only a 4 pack like in the photo provided by them. These bras are comfortable for around the house or running errands but definitely don't use these as a sports bra! The padding does tend to move around slightly; however, given the price you pay it's understandable. My only concern was when the package arrived in my mailbox the outer packaging was fine, but the inner bag the bras were packaged in was ripped open and broken."
3.0,"The quality of the fabric used is very bad for the price. It is extremely thin and does not work well for a coldish day. The actual design did look cool though, but also a bit poor quality in image quality also. Would not recommend for the price."
3.0,"This purse is beautiful.  However, the size listed is way off. It is much bigger than it states. I could fit a small 5 year old in this purse, that's how big it is. It is larger than the 18.5&#34; purse I originally bought and returned because it was too big.  Sadly I was slow on trying to return this and am past the 30 days. Not sure what I am going to do with this - possibly a fancy laundry bag??"
3.0,This is not a baseball cap. It's very clearly a trucker style hat. Other than that the hat itself isn't bad quality. It's what you'd expect. Even though I don't like trucker hats I'll probably just keep this one.
3.0,Love the ring but it was too small on me so I had to give it to my son. It's difficult to size these right so be careful. When in doubt get bigger not smaller.
3.0,The clock was shattered :(
3.0,"I wash everything before I wear it and I followed the directions on the tag only to have the first wear leave me covered in lint. I thought this would be a great winter workout sweater, but after one hour of boxing drills and light sparring I took it off to find myself covered in caked on lint and I don’t sweat heavily. Great at keeping in heat hoping this goes away after a few more washes."
3.0,It was too big and I had to return it.
3.0,The bathing suit was a good material but had too much coverage for my taste compared to the picture.
3.0,Size down. They run bigger
3.0,"Looks exactly like the picture. Lettering is small and difficult to read but, my daughter loves it."
3.0,"The ""bling"" pieces fell off almost completely after 1 week."
3.0,"I mainly only gave this a three star rating because it took so long to come in. I ordered another dress exactly like it but a different print the same Time that I ordered this one and it came in within two weeks but this one took well over a month and a half to come in and completely missed it’s delivery date by a mile. Other than that the dress did fit her very well and she loves it. Very nice feel to this fabric. Nice light, breathable material. Very happy with the quality."
3.0,Color not a s vibrant as I had hoped but its a comfortable fit. Waistband is very forgiving. Looks good on but would look better on a taller person (over 5'6&#34;).
3.0,"for the size of the handbag, the straps are too delicate and break easily."
3.0,Pretty! Wish it had matching wrist cuffs!!<br />Was a little delayed in arrival...
3.0,"These would kind of fall into the 'you get what you pay for' category.  I don't normally buy cheap hiking boots, but I was drawn to them by the style.  The fit is probably a 1/4 - 1/2 size too large.  I don't think any leather was used in making them (which is a negative in my book); however, they have stood up to some abuse so far, so I can't knock them too much."
3.0,Loved the look except the earring broke shortly after wearing it.
3.0,This product is beautiful the fabric is soft and would’ve seemed comfortable to wear unfortunately the product description said elastic waist and it was a zipper I ordered extra large just to be sure and safe and it still is much too small.. i’ll keep it to give it to someone else in my family
3.0,Very big! Didn't flatter my figure
3.0,"Clingy jersey fabric. It was slightly slinky WITH pockets. Sizing was fairly accurate.<br />Unfortunately, I didn't anticipate the white design to be printed on. I was hopeful it was lace.<br />It didn't look very good on me so I've returned the dresses. Too bad, I love pockets on dresses."
3.0,"If I hadn't already thrown away the bag to return this, sighhhh. There's a weird bump in the back where the zipper sticks out, and the midline ribbon sits really weird. The skirt is kinda bunched into that ribbon and sticks out. Not the best from Miusol, and I'm a repeat customer. Should have tried a smaller size maybe. I'm 5'3&#34; and 158lbs, and got a size XL."
3.0,"The belt is fairly nice and looks good. Fabrication seems sturdy. I like the cut to girth feature. The main problem I have with this belt is the release latch is small and difficult to operate, especially if the belt is snug which is how I wear them."
3.0,These were way too big and would not stay in place.
3.0,"It’s a very pretty dress. Unfortunately, being a petite lady, the pockets hit me a bit too low and added about 10 lbs to my frame. I really wanted to like it but it just wasn’t for me."
3.0,"Pretty, but these earrings fell apart before I could even wear them and I had to glue.  I am afraid to wear them because they might fall apart again or I might lose them."
3.0,Garment not true to size. Order size larger than what u normally wear. Will look for something else to wear to event...
3.0,They tend to come down his knees
3.0,Weave is loose and catches on things
3.0,"Bought the mask for a five year old.  Great quality lousy sizing guidance.  Too tight pulling on his ears, and hard to breath."
3.0,It's rather small!!
3.0,American dollars don’t fit (straight)in this wallet.
3.0,I bought this shirt to wear to work. I have many products from this brand and I love that their cotton is so soft and comfortable yet professional looking. This is a great look for a business casual environment. I bought it in Ivory so that I could mix and match it BUT its so transparent that I haven't been able to wear it. I tried a cami under it but it looks really bad. I wish it were a tad thicker.
3.0,"Too small, had to return it"
3.0,"Got this sweater today and the damn thing is big its a good Quality sweater But it fits too big. Got it in large. If your a person who wears large and extra large, get it in Medium And save yourself some money on going to the laundromat and trying to shrink it -___-"
3.0,Fits super awkwardly.
3.0,"Not fancy, but nice in a simple way"
3.0,"The material is of good quality, but the size is a bit small"
3.0,The only problem I have is I don’t get the slouch. I love the hats though. They’re warm and fit for the most part. They keep my locs in place.
3.0,"I bought two different  sizes of these  for my grandaughters.Although they were very cute and soft, they did not have the sizes written in them, and it was hard to tell what size was what.  They were kind of stretched out as well. A little short but wide in shoulders. They were very inexpensive though, and for the price I think the girls will get enough wear out of them to warrant the purchase."
3.0,Disappointed with the earrings. They both face the same way.
3.0,"i got this for a girl that i like at school and she claims she loves it,even know she never wears it becaus she forgets,<br />hopeful she dose and shes not just being nice.......<br />wow,that got depressing really fast"
3.0,My son loved the hoodie and material but it ran small
3.0,Only gave it 3 stars because my long torso having self had no business in this swimsuit 🤣
3.0,"The stone toe rings are great, but none of the flower toe rings would fit!  The flower toe rings have a clear plastic loop to go around your toe and all three loops were so big they would only fit on my big toe with no way to adjust!"
3.0,"It's very pretty, but very poor quality. I put it on my ring finger, & it was scratched up after just 10 minutes of wearing it next to a ring on my middle finger. A tiny, sharp shard of some kind of metal on the under side of one of the wings had pealed back that wasn't there when I put it on. Sharp enough to cut my finger. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money. You get what you pay for though."
3.0,"Quality is good.  However, sizing runs a little small."
3.0,Love it. But it is too small.
3.0,"The floral pattern and colors on this dress are very attractive. I felt that the material was too light-weight and thin. The dress fit me size-wise but definitely not style-wise. For this reason I returned the dress, which was a very simple process."
3.0,Beautiful  dress but the size was small .. pls make  sure you get the right
3.0,Pretty bag...but the black handles are coming apart. Only had it less than a year and not a daily purse. Looks classy but the bag is cheap.
3.0,The ring does not look as it does online. The picture reflects a gold tone to the ears. Also the carrot seems more distinct in the picture.<br />Mine arrived without any gold to the ears and the carrot just blended into the band.
3.0,"These are thin. If that’s not what you want then move along. The only complaint I have is that the seam on the toe is really wide and gets caught between my toe and the shoe. This can cause a little blister after awhile, but I just adjust my sock and move on.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/22/19 - The toe seam is super annoying now. It rubs between my toe and the shoe. I find myself adjusting it during the day which is not ideal. Taking off one star for that because it hurts."
3.0,It is beautiful but my door lost it twice.
3.0,"If you want a really wide brimmed hat at a reasonable price, this is good for you. It does come squashed and wrinkled but with some patience, you can work with that."
3.0,"I really like this bathing suit cover up. It has a really soft, silky feel to it & it is truly beautiful! However, I am a &#34;bigger&#34; girl and so the dress/cover-up does not look on me Anything like what it does in the picture or on the super skinny model. Instead of having a V shape on the top, it pretty much just goes straight across. The way the straps are, they just pull on my shoulders & constantly feel like they are going to slip or fall off. Due to the very low price I am going to keep this product, but I am very glad that I will be wearing a bathing suit underneath it. I wear a 38DD and size 16 dress size. I love this cover up, I just wish it came in different size options instead of just 1 size fits all. 1 size does NOT fit all.<br /><br />I would gladly give this 5 stars, IF it came in different sizes."
3.0,I brought a tutu in a different color...blue. The quality on the other tutu was much better! This tutu looked lifeless and limp...
3.0,"Really pretty, but runs small! I’m a size 10 in women bought a 10, had to give them away to my sis that wears an eight!"
3.0,Big chests need not apply.  Stress tested the buttons around the chest area.
3.0,Bigger than they look
3.0,I got a white one... not pink..
3.0,"I did not know this was an unmarked mint coin and was only silver bullion,  but it is great to wear as intended."
3.0,"I had really high hopes for these. I wear lots of knee and thigh high socks and I am considered plus. I'm (In America) a 15-16 or XL in bottoms. I'm also 175lbs and 5'7&#34;. When ever I get thigh high socks, they never reach my thighs. So I end up just wearing them as knee socks. So when I saw this, I was like, plus size thigh highs!? Hell yeah! So I got them. When I got them, they're the texture of tights. So I though that was a good sign. Maybe they'll fit to me and won't roll down or anything!? I put them on and.. they gave my thighs a little muffin top. Now, it wasn't a bad muffin top. It was a small one. But it made it look obvious I was a big girl trying to wear skinny girls clothes.... Then, I took one step forward, and they rolled down. Maybe if I got some garters, they'd look alright on me. I'm very self conscious. Also, on one of the foot of the sock, around the toes, it started a tear. Its still sturdy. Its like a teach in your tights that hasn't made a hole yet it might if you're not careful. The is Not very bad. Who's gonna notice anyway? I'll be in shoes. But it just kinda annoying. So, I'm currently wearing them as just knee socks.. on good days they won't roll down my thighs. But it's rare. I think they're very cute though. Just good for knee socks. I'm still on the search for GOOD plus size thigh highs."
3.0,You get what you pay for...No worries.
3.0,"Super thin, completely see through"
3.0,"Cute, like it! BUT does not stay snapped shut, very easily bumped and pops open. I lost it a few times already not even realizing it fell out. Unfortunate"
3.0,It’s so cute but it’s runs small! So it definitely not true to size. Got the size 4-6 and my daughter is 14 months and it was tight. Had to return. .
3.0,Not too bad. Better than no glasses at all while night driving. Not as much glare at night while driving. Could be better
3.0,"I ordered L, normally I wear XS or S. These fits me in size L perfectly, just dont understand why I got two L and one came S ( which is too tight)"
3.0,"Good watch, but arm band is too small and flimsy"
3.0,When I opened the bag one ear was completely bent back and when I put the ears on they flop in different directions. They are way more comfortable than the parks ears but I really wish these had a little more stiffness to the ears. Now is adorable though. I put them between two large books to see if I can straighten them out and I may put a piece of wire to somehow keep the ears from flipping over when I walk.
3.0,"They are nice, but they brake easy. They are thin and the ones with something printed on them are hard to see or read. They worked ok for something small as an extra gift"
3.0,Was cute but didn’t like how the put some pictures in sideways
3.0,I really loved this but I had to send back the pants were way to lg
3.0,Cute...could designed better. You get what you paid for.
3.0,Should order 2 sizes plus.
3.0,This is a new dress made of good material. It fits a little snug in the bust and short stoping around the ankle. My bust size is a 38 C and ordered the large. I suggest ordering a larger size.
3.0,Fabric-backed and ties at the neck. Can be a little awkward looking at the back because there will be a big bow there. Little black beads around the blue stones are very loose and have not fallen off yet but may. A lot darker than it appears in the picture.
3.0,Pretty. Thank you.
3.0,"bigger than they appear. way bigger, but good quality."
3.0,"This is a pretty top and it is true to size. However, I really wish the straps were adjustable."
3.0,"Bought this dress online because we needed fast it for upcoming event. The dress itself is beautiful. There’s some flaw though, the breast pads are weirdly placed too low and they’re thick so the dress doesn’t fit right. Had to remove them since we’re desperate with time. Will not purchase again."
3.0,"These are very stylish -- a great looking shoe. BUT EEK -- they run very, very narrow, with a very low toe box too. I ordered the wide width which usually gives me more than enough room, but not in this style! A great disappointment because I love the look of them. If your foot is narrow, you'll love 'em though."
3.0,I am usually size L. I got XL this time and thought after I wash them thwy should fit ok but they were a bit small and tight. I can still wear them but not as I expected.
3.0,"It's a cute shirt, especially if you want something with just Piccolo.  My only issue with it is that this can probably be purchased at a cheaper price or DIY if you have that design."
3.0,Seems a little cheap for price
3.0,"Not as soft as I hoped, clingy and stretchy."
3.0,Very cinched waist while flaring drastically at hips....not very flattering for a woman with hips (even though I am a small person)
3.0,It was as orange as I would of like nut still very nice
3.0,"I am going to be completely honest with this review as when I buy clothes online, the more details I have the better. I was looking for soft, appropriate PJ's for around the house around teenage boys & elderly man but yet something my BF would like to see me in as well. Based on the photos I thought these would be just right as the bottoms looked loose and the top was cute, but not too sexy. I ordered a set in medium. I am 5'0 and 130 pounds. My back end is a bit thick. So I thought the medium would fit great based on other reviews. First off, the order was supposed to arrive on a Sunday. I got notifications that it was late, then it never showed up.  I did a refund on it and tried my luck again. I ended up with both orders arriving on the same day. I tried on the set. The shorts are shorter and tighter than expected, my 11-year-old daughter calls them 'booty shorts'. So be it, They still cover everything and I think wearing them around the house will be okay. Now to the top. I'm only a 32A/B at most. So the medium top was HUGE. I had the straps as short as could be and they kept falling off and the cut, made it so low cut it made me uncomfortable to wear it around. I then proceeded to return one of the mediums and try my luck at a small. I got that order in regular time. The small top is still a bit big, I wish the straps would go a little tighter. The whole set is super cute and I would now wear them around the house. I gave my daughter the shorts and they fit her. I hope this helps anyone else looking at this set."
3.0,These aprons were pretty however they were really thin and could have been a bit larger or at least a longer tie for the thicker girls. Pretty though.
3.0,I would have kept the dress if the design was smaller. Didn't make it flattering. The material was a nice quality.
3.0,"Look just like picture, poor quality. Get what you pay for  I guess"
3.0,The fit is great but I thought I was getting a deep red dress. This color is definitely pink.
3.0,It broke the first time I put it on. Very disappointed. I fixed it and I will wear it. Its designed cheaply.
3.0,For great but the drawstring tonthis shirt is dramatically long.
3.0,Super cute !<br />Was very comfortable at first!<br />6 washes in and it's a little rough and knotty feeling now 😕
3.0,"The teeth should be higher on the mask, or it shouldn't be as big. I tucked some of the upper part in, still covering my nose, but still don't like the design flaw."
3.0,"Great for the price, but you lose a lot of feathers."
3.0,"I loved these gloves in years past and actually field tested Marmot ski clothing in the 70’s into the 80’s as a member of the Aspen Highlands Ski Patrol. Loved and wore the ski pants, jackets, gloves and fleece. Slowly but surely I quit purchasing your products except for the gloves.  Alas this will be y the last Marmot product I will have purchased."
3.0,"Although the color appears black in the picture, this bracelet is, in fact, brown. I have no doubt that this is genuine leather but it has a wierd waxy texture. Like another reviewer stated the strings used to tighten it do seem a bit long, but that may be do to my small wrists. I was able to retie and cut them to a better length for me. All in all a decent bracelet at a fair price."
3.0,A little too short I’m 5’7
3.0,too short in the hips.
3.0,Very cute. But could be just a little bigger.
3.0,The dress was a lot bigger than I expected but the seller was very good about fixing my issue.
3.0,"We used these for a dance piece. The material isn't fabulous, but it worked fine for what we needed. The cut was roomy enough that it fit a variety of body types. The embroidery around the neck was a nice touch."
3.0,"I was expecting a little better grade of leather, very thin and flimsy, but you get what you pay for.<br />Maybe a decent value for the money. Definitely looks better in the pics."
3.0,runs large will  need to return
3.0,"For the most part, this is a very smart looking Harrington jacket with a cool tartan lining. However, I immediately had issues with the zipper. It would get stuck, come off track and eventually broke after only a couple weeks of wear. Unfortunately I had to have the zipper replaced, but I think that says something for the cost itself. I really like it and didn't want to just call it a loss. Hopefully I can continue to wear this jacket for years to come. Here's hoping Warrior addresses this issue going forward."
3.0,OK-they tend to slide down in the rear when sitting and getting up.
3.0,this is a great bag from like a quick  date or something but IT IS NOT BIG FOR A SIDEBAG PURSEEE
3.0,Product didn't even last a week before strap broke off one shoe.. my son still uses them to play but was very disappointed in how fast they broke.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this robe but I'm 5' 11"" tall and 175 pounds and this was huge on me.  It also generates a hell of a static electricity field and was clinging to itself and me, not to mention sparking and popping.  If you're a bigger guy and live in a more humid enviornment this would probably work great for you."
3.0,"Bought size 12 months for 6 month old (she's not chubby, just long), and they are very snug. Can get them on her but she won't be in them long."
3.0,It’s fire engine red.
3.0,"The product pilled the first time I wore it.  And, all I was doing was sitting.  Also, very hard (almost impossible) to get a small stain out.  It is quite cute."
3.0,"This dress needs something to make it work.  The material is very soft and the black is a nice deep black, but the styling is not what it should be.  The slit in the front should be in the back or side, and the way it hangs is kind of baggy.  I doubt I will be wearing this dress anywhere and it probably will hit the donation bag before too long."
3.0,"Be forewarned...the strip-band design is ONLY on the &#34;top&#34; of the bracelet.  It has two snap-buttons to use based upon the thickness of your wrist.  The strip bands are also a brighter red-brown than the primary band.<br /><br />That said, I really like this band but feel as though the picture supplied was misleading, therefore instead of getting the 4 stars it probably should get, I'll give it only 3.<br /><br />(Maybe some use in the sun and my sweat will help stain the bands darker...)"
3.0,"For any professional Moana cosplayers, you will need to get a higher quality grass skirt as this is a plastic one. But other than that it's everything you need"
3.0,"Nice belt, but stretchier than I expected. looks good, but as you add weight to your pockets( keys,wallet, cell, etc.) it seems to give too easily and I have to keep tightening it to hold up my pants."
3.0,"Cute suit, top too big and bottom too small."
3.0,It is just okay.  The actual necklace look a little cheap and not up to the quality of many of the other necklaces.
3.0,Create material!<br />Only had 4/6 available. No 0/2 option.
3.0,Darker color than what was pictured.  Very dark blue. Still pretty
3.0,I am on my third pair of style 1601 sunglasses...like them alot but the ear pieces are designed to fail asap....despite taking exceptional care of these glasses the ear pieces continue to break off about 2/3 from the end....will have to move on...
3.0,"A nice, light, summer dress that fit as expected."
3.0,"I haven't decided if I like this top yet or not. It's made of sports material, like Under Armor shirts. (I thought it would be more like a sweatshirt.) So, it's not cozy and warm. Honestly, I was just looking for a comfy tunic top to wear with leggings and this one might not be it. Even though it's light-weight, it hangs straight down, if that makes any sense.<br /><br />Edit: I sent it back. I am an hour glass shape, even when chunky after having a baby. This top didn’t do anything to flatter my curves."
3.0,This necklace is a very vibrant fire truck red so if that is what you are looking for this is for you! The thing that I did not like about it necessarily is how large it is. It covers a good amount of my chest area which looked very awkward with the dress that I was wearing. Other than that it is a great necklace and looks cute when worn with the right outfit! Definately a statement necklace.
3.0,"This is a nice enough looking necklace. It comes in a really cute box. The problem is it only glows for about 3 or 4 minutes in the dark,which is really the point of the necklace. So, if you like the design of the necklace and aren't really worried about the glowing part then you should buy it. However, if you are looking for something that glows for a long time I don't  know that something without a battery is going to be able to do it."
3.0,"Very light and comfortable, but fit a little small."
3.0,"It is more like a jacket than a coat - it is very thin, there is no collar - basically it is just a thin layer for faux fur and satin like lining. This jacket is straight cut, and there is no collar - it almost seems like it was designed as a vest, and sleeves were added. I ordered a much larger size coat than I typically wear, and it is not that much bigger on me - so it fits small. The coat I got is pure white and reaches just above my knees. It has no collar - so chest area is exposed. Because coat is not fitted - I believe it would look cute with a wide belt, to give it a little bit more shapely form. The price at the time of this review - around $26 plus shipping - so you get what you pay for a cheap coat. 3 stars because of small sizing and how thin it is - for sure not a real winter coat - maybe a California winter.."
3.0,"This ring was very pretty in person, but mine had an obvious flaw on the surface so I returned it. There was plenty of sparkle, though keeping the ring together on my finger was a pain."
3.0,This fit was odd. The cuffed hem seemed to be really narrow for skinny legs but the waist was too big.<br />It was not at all what I was looking for.
3.0,It was definitely too small. Plus the labels were soft and didn't stay put.
3.0,"One of the pockets was stitched in one spot to the actual pant which made it dimple up but once I cut that, they were ok."
3.0,"I bought the wallet and handbag, and both are really beautiful. I get a lot of compliments on both everywhere I go. And the great stamped leather pattern matches many of my western belts & boots. However, it isn't well made. Within the first week of use, the leather shoulder straps started cracking and fraying, and lots of the threads in the stitching are popping out. This continues so I'm not sure if this bag will last long. And the disappointing thing is that I'm not hard on bags. I guess it's just not well made."
3.0,"The face of the plug is really disproportionate to the gauge sizes. I got an 8g, and the face of it would fit a 4g, which is fine for people with single ear holes, but I needed this to fit in a top hole."
3.0,I was surprised how good the quality was on this dress. The red was pretty in person but since I have a large bust the ruffles did not fall in the right place and made me look bigger than I am so had to return.
3.0,"It does fit the Casio MDV106 watch. If you have a sanding drum in a moto tool and the paitence to file down the ends to allow the spring bars to engage the lugs. And provided you have the original 22mm spring bars from your watch and not attempt to use the 20mm spring bars that came with this unit. After a half hour to forty five minute sanding session, the band fits. Once it is made to fit, the band is not bad. Hence the three stars. Yes It was less than ten bucks so what did I expect. Actually the bracelet part is very good for the price."
3.0,"These are really pretty frames with a graduated red color. They are on the smaller size in terms of fit over my ears, and of how they look on my face. Sadly, I had to return them."
3.0,"Such a pretty blouse, but my arms couldn’t fit the sleeves! Way too tight! I do have big arms, but not that big!"
3.0,Its ok not something i would wear wont buy it again
3.0,"They worked with my granddaughters Halloween costume, but the stitching came out between the middle and ring finger on one hand the 2nd time she used them."
3.0,"Small, cheap umbrella with sensitive (or poorly designed) button"
3.0,They run smaller than I thought they would.  It was a tight fit.
3.0,"I had been eyeing this suit for a while since I cosplay Domino frequently and have always wanted a video game version of her suit. However. The main suit was fairly nicely made and detailed. However, the top of the suit near the bust area was so low andonly secured by one tiny bra clasp closure and I super feared a wardrobe malfunction. Not to mention this thing is hotter and sweatier than some of my pleather suits. However I would still have paid fifty to seventy bucks for the suit itself. My big complaint is all the accessories. TOTAL GARBAGE. The holsters are all practically unusable trash. So thin, flimsy, and poorly made. They look atrocious. The knee pads and shoulder pads are soft and smooshy and look like you’ve strapped metallic pillows to yourself. I wish I could just buy the suit alone, so I could modify the closures and use the suit, however I couldn’t justify over a hundred dollars when over a third of the product was such cheap garbage so I returned it. I really wouldn’t recommend wasting your money. At this price point you could get a suit commissioned properly."
3.0,"Not the material I imagined, and I should have listened to the reviews and ordered a larger size. Not very forgiving or stretchy. Came super late, but the company was very responsive to every inquiry of where the package was. Maybe once I lose some weight it will look cuter on me.<br /><br />130lbs 5'3. Usually wear size medium."
3.0,"I should've gone one size down, these are very stretchy and do not fit as I wanted them to.  However, they are quite comfortable, and a good value for the money.  I do wish they had reinforced crotches as other brands of underpants (I have quite a few of the nylon spandex kind, and these are the only ones in a single layer."
3.0,"The shirt is made just fine, but it is constructed for a very slim man. I am of average build and it was too tight in the torso for me."
3.0,Great set but too small for a school going kid. Had to return due to the size.
3.0,"The actual color of this top is totally different than the advertised photo.  Overall, it is a good product, but I was disappointed in the dull red color."
3.0,Not very thin at all. They were actually pretty thick or the sizing wasn’t right.
3.0,The lapel pins came quickly which made me excited but the first one I wore the flower broke off by the end of my work day...I fixed it with a bit of super glue but that was disappointing.
3.0,"I am 5'6"" 140lbs, hourglass shape. I got the S and it was generous on me.<br /><br />Pros: The fabric is good, thicker than the Amazon Basics similar dresses, and the skirt is generous with the fabric, with flattering sleeves.<br /><br />Cons: Seriously unflattering shape on an hourglass figure. There is a seam directly below the bust, and the fullness of the skirt begins immediately. If you have a narrow waist, it vanishes. It looks like a maternity gown, and not in a good way - very frumpifying on my specific figure. The underbust seam is also raw and uncomfortable on the inside. It will be a good friend to you if you store your weight in your belly."
3.0,Too slippery. They need a different sole/bottom. They are too slippery for hardwood floors.
3.0,"I bought a 3xl and it’s an Asian 3xl so it’s like an American medium at best, I gifted it to my aunt and she looked fabulous in it."
3.0,"These were too tight to be comfortably worn as a gater, much less any other position like a headband. I guess I'll use them as fashion collars for my dogs."
3.0,Okay but shipped from china.
3.0,Have to make adjustments as the fit is not right. Not as nice as pictured.
3.0,This is ichy and uncomfortable
3.0,"I like how this dress looks. It’s just too small. I bought an extra large, but I gave it to my daughter who wears a medium. It fit her perfectly.<br />The dress is well made, though it runs small."
3.0,Love the band but it has spaces on the band that seem to have been chipped off. Won’t order again.
3.0,I loved the dress but it runs really small! Order a size up.
3.0,Nice fabric but cut funny through shoulders making sleeves tight. I am returning.
3.0,The frame was smaller than I expected.
3.0,It seems like its too large to be a shirt and too small to be a dress.
3.0,Too long for infant and clasp gets too loose. 7 month old can pull it off.
3.0,I didn't realize this was plastic. There is one you can purchase for a little more that must be cloth. It's cute and will still use it.
3.0,It is too small even for a petite like me.
3.0,"The shirt is super cute. Perfect for leather leggings but it’s an awkward length. I’m a small/ medium and I ordered a large. I can barely tie it up or tuck it in. I only washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. Get it anyway, it’s cute."
3.0,I really want to like this robe. Its cut on the ample side and is very nice fabric. But one thing I insist on is an inside tie to keep the front pieces from separating. It says in the description it has inside ties but they lied. It does not. So back it goes............
3.0,Love the dress. My only problem is The bust is small and the waist and bottoms is to big.  Will order next one is a size up and take in where needed.
3.0,This glasses hurt the ears and they hold lose.
3.0,"They look good, bigger than I expected, the wire is large. I got them to close boleros/cardigans, I guess I should look for something else and keep these ones for scarves..."
3.0,Not really good quality. Look so fake.
3.0,Ordered size small but it was way too big all around. It didn't help that it's stretchy.
3.0,"Definitely good idea with the size and the amount of pockets.<br />Immediately upon opening, the side zipper was dislodged. I reconnected it. The top zipper did the same thing.<br />Does come with inner pocket with another bad zipper.<br />Came with a small mark on it.<br />Disappointed"
3.0,"The dress came without the sash.  I had to purchase a separate ribbon to use in a pinch, timing was off to try and contact seller for the sash to be supplied.  The dress will work for the short event it will be worn for but probably not  going to hold up for many other times to be warn, sort of low quality.  Looks nice, came incomplete, and will not last long.  Good for an inexpensive one time function/event dress."
3.0,"This was okay. It is not very warm for winter time :(. However, if you would want to add layers underneath get a bigger size. Over time the interior rips since it is silk on the inside and the buttons pop off, but that’s wear an tear. Of any goth woman or man if they so choose to get this I do recommend. Maybe wear for a fall day instead :). The winter title is misleading."
3.0,The non-slip grip dots did not grip or stick very properly.
3.0,"I bought a large on a whim. I really enjoy the throwback designs. However this should perhaps be printed on a heavier duty T shirt. 6' 205 44"" chest the thing hangs off me and is softer than a lamb and thinner than a hobos wallet. Good for sleepovers if your old lady wants to look tough and be comfortable and patriotic, bless America!"
3.0,"I can't say I'm disappointed, because the look of the product is very close to what is pictured. That said, the beads and medallion were much smaller than I expect. And for some reason, I am breaking out in a rash around my wrist. I could be allergic to the seed pods, I suppose, or it could be the dye. I wonder if it contains some metals. I wish I'd gone with the natural pods. I'm wearing mine as a necklace with a high collared shirt to avoid skin contact."
3.0,I bought a XXL and it fit small:)<br />The blouse is exactly like what is displayed.  I still love it even though it can't fit.
3.0,Cute product but it’s huge. And the pleats & stitches are uneven making it feel even more awkward on my face :( I have to wear masks for a full eight hour shift. Unfortunately I don’t think this will be one of them.
3.0,The suede isn't soft.. Purse is a good size but relatively cheaply made. Not worth the price. Some of the rivets for the fridge have fallen out and I've only it a few days!
3.0,Bought these for daughter who needs good support for athletics- thought they would work but not as supportive as she wanted.
3.0,"These pants were of good quality, thick and supportive. However as soon as I moved around a little they would start to slide down. I'm not sure if purchasing a size down would have helped as the pants felt like they were sized appropriately."
3.0,"The jacket is okay. It fits true to size, sort of. It's way looser than I expected on my body but the sleeves are shorter and barely reach my wrists. It makes me look like a square with more angular torso. So not the look I was going for. One of the outside breast pockets is fake, the rest of the pockets are medium sized. The hood is removable. The hood would close and keep my head warm and away from wind if the Velcro straps were not the same. Both sides have the same side of Velcro, so they do not connect and do not keep closed. I was hoping to give it to my SIL but with the faulty hood Velcro straps I can't. Bad oversight here. The fabric is water resistant. The jacket does have padding and keeps me warm but I wouldn't go out in it anywhere but my backyard."
3.0,"I used to be a size small, but I gave birth and my hips expanded so I decided to go with a size medium. I barely can get this over my hips. It's nice material and pretty, but it bunches up if I wear it high where it is supposed to go."
3.0,"Okay, so if you have large calves these are not going to have the right fit..... they are not slouchy at all. They are warm and the wool is good quality, but that’s really all I have to say that’s good. There ARE three different shades of brown, TECHNICALLY.... but they don’t look anything like in the picture. In fact, I had to put these super close to my face at first to really distinguish that they weren’t a solid color of brown. Disappointed."
3.0,it's cute but the neckline goes up higher than the picture. i am a C cup and it makes me look flat chested
3.0,pretty chinsey. Lightweight material does not lay well. The ruffle is not controllable.
3.0,"Love the glasses, but the first time when I was changeing the lens,the Frame cracked in half. This product is not that sturdy!"
3.0,Not good quality. Too small
3.0,Not a great swimsuit for a little girl. The sheer skirt has glitter that sheds everywhere. It is the actual one sold at Disney Stores and not one of the licensed products.
3.0,"This is such a cute, comfy, and flattering dress, but I had to return it because it is SO SHORT.  I'm 5'7&#34; with a long torso and normally wear a size 2, ao I tried a small and a medium.  The small was obscene - all my lady parts were on display when I raised my arms.The medium was a little better, but still obviously made for someone much shorter than me.  The mall hit about 6-8 in above my knee, the med about 4-6in."
3.0,Didn’t fit my engagement ring but they quality was nice
3.0,I ordered the white with red floral pattern and had to return it. The fabric is completely see thru! I wasn't even going to try it on as I knew that there was absolutely no way I would wear a see thru dress in public. But I did end up trying it on and actually really liked the style I would consider reordering the dress in another color.
3.0,"Not bad.  I like the hook, I can throw it on my laptop backpack and do not have to carry it all the time."
3.0,Fit is really cute.  Does not last more than 3 washings.  Fabric fades and loses shape quickly.  Buy and discard shortly thereafter.
3.0,"These fit true to size, great color ( Dark Yellow)  & are constructed well. I believe they would last a long time. however I found them to be a bit discomforting between the large toe & index toe. Therefore I returned them  The choice is yours if you want to take a chance if this goes away after wearing them a few times."
3.0,They never glowed for me so don’t buy if you want them to glow
3.0,"Not the best, wish I payed less"
3.0,"I really wanted to love this but it just didn't work for me. I'm 135, 5'7&#34;, 34b and ordered a medium. It wouldn't stay off the shoulder when I moved my arms and the sleeve length was too short. It is somewhat see through, you could see my black strapless bra. Back it goes"
3.0,"The are cute, but the loop is too small to go on the split ring. Also they are much more expensive then similar charms."
3.0,Cute but not made for tall women with long arms
3.0,Just stopped working suddenly. Other than that it is a beautiful watch.
3.0,love the design but the plating is incomplete on one earring and it shows
3.0,"Looked like it was previously used. Pretty, but the paint is coming off on the detailing...only been using it for 3 days."
3.0,The collar area was too weird. It didn’t fit well. The tie in the neck area was way too long. The dress was cute just not for me.
3.0,It’s smaller then I thought.  My cell phone doesn’t fit in the outside pocket without stretching the material over it.
3.0,"The shoulders were way out of proportion to the rest of the sweater, I sent it back."
3.0,Freaky facto Ruler=10. Eye holes however are a little wonky.
3.0,My son says they nice so far
3.0,For me these are difficult to breathe in. Feels like there’s no air flow. They do fit right.
3.0,"These were ok, the size was good however I thought the lenses were too reflective like a mirror."
3.0,"I got this set for the clicker. It was a little bigger than I wanted but I won't fault them for that - they stated the dimensions accurately I just have a small mouth so it looked bigger on me.<br /><br />I will fault them that after a few days it started to hurt. Not sure exactly why - I have a lot of piercings and most of them are stainless steel (or titanium) and have never had a problem. Also, it is easy to put in but hard to take out. I had to use a pair of hemostats to open it and my nose was already sore so it hurt even more to take out. I put in my horseshoe that I had before and it's much happier now. Too bad, it is pretty."
3.0,"So I love that's little key chains,  however there should be 3 pendants.  I ordered 4 and 2 of them were missing there tooth pendant.  A little disappointed about that."
3.0,Wish it had the legion with it<br />Otherwise good for a child
3.0,"Dress is pretty and if it was the right size I think it would be nice but for me it didn’t fit well.  I am 5’4” and typically wear a size 4 in dresses, small or XS shirts, size 2 or 4 pants, and 32 or 34 B bra. The size small was tight to my bust and the very thin fabric makes the outlines of a bra stick out.  I felt it was unflatteringly tight in my stomach although maybe with spanks on it would have been better but with the very thin material and light color of the dress I think spanks would show through.<br /><br />I will try on again with proper undergarments if I can figure out what that would be and if it improves I will update."
3.0,"I gave it 3-stars...likely closer to 2.5 starts but not more than 3...Its cheap and it wears cheap. Snaps closed and opens w/double trigger...but when closed it exhibits very ""loose"" tolerances. You get what you paid for...I guess if I want better I'll have to spend $200 or more on a real Omega deployant :)"
3.0,"Cheap, cheap, cheap. Cute color scheme. Returned."
3.0,Super cute purse but the zipper head arrived broken. Free returns ❤️
3.0,"Super cute. Unfortunately way too big.<br />I ordered the size 7 (which is what her usual size is right know), and it was way too big! I could fit 2 fingers 😣 so I probably could have gone with a size 5 instead. I will not reorder, I will just be searching for some other shoes.<br />Wanted them for her dresses/pictures. And it costs $4 to ship back, so I will just keep them and wait til she grows into them.<br />Loved them, look like they will be comfterble, just giving them a 3 star rating, because of the huge difference in size."
3.0,"it is ok, it is thin and a little to big i think for regular use.  I would not buy again"
3.0,I am plus size gal and it didn’t even really fit my teenage daughter
3.0,It is cute but the design doesn’t last long on the band.
3.0,"I did not like these glasses at all.  Although it dimmed the brightness of oncoming headlights, it made everything else around very impossible to see which makes night driving (which is why I purchased them) very dangerous."
3.0,Way to difficult to put on in a crowded airport after TSA has removed it.
3.0,Not great material but nice color
3.0,price for material to much
3.0,It is way shorter then I expected and super tight. Although I hope to lose weight so maybe when I do it will fit.
3.0,It would be better if the brim was wider to protect your face and ears from the sun better. A lighter fabric would be cooler as well.
3.0,shinny and huge reflection
3.0,"I like the bracelet, but I am not sure I would have ordered if I had known that it is not as blue as the pic lead me to believe."
3.0,was OK
3.0,These sliip off and are weird to wear even though fashionable.
3.0,Less curved than I thought but still very comfortable
3.0,"This bra has almost no stretch at all, and it is small to a point that I expect that it might be mislabeled. I seriously doubt that the band could stretch 36 inches, much less 38 inches, without being torn apart. Though it is very solidly constructed. Very firm."
3.0,It was a nice top for the price and I hope it washes well also
3.0,Metal wears down quickly. But was cute the first few times of wear. Not a long lasting or daily wear necklace though.
3.0,I liked the look and style of the shirt however it definitely shrank in the wash. Plan to go up a size when ordering.
3.0,"Didn’t like the design as much as I thought I would. Too small, but only because I have gained weight."
3.0,I wanted to love this dress--the print is beautiful and material is so soft.. but it is short!  I am only 5'5 and it hit me in my shins versus my ankles.  I can only imagine how short it would be on taller people! I will be returning unfortunately!
3.0,"Not as bright as the colors shown and I was kind of expecting sweatshirt material, its more like a thick tshirt feel with a glossy finish"
3.0,The pins seem sturdy but did not fit without modifying them a bit. After bending and a little sweet talk I am able to make them work. My watch used 24mm. I think these may be a bit oversized.
3.0,"okay but, one of the shoes didnt work and so i had to return them"
3.0,size way too small.  The 2XL size is still too snug for someone who normally wears a L size.
3.0,"Fast shipping, but the picture was a bit deceiving. Mask is super small and felt like it belonged on a face of a 10 year old. The pros are that it did come with 4 additional filters and 2 sets of valve replacements. Straps are sturdy and the material felt comfortable. It just wasn’t big enough to fit my face properly."
3.0,Shirt was tight for a 2XL
3.0,The dress is nice but the fabric is translucent....I had to return it
3.0,I am 5&#34;7 so the skirt was shorter than I expected. I wanted it to be long.  It reached just at my ankles. Nice skirt but had to return
3.0,"I normally wear a medium size, but ordered a large or make sure it fit. It was very tight."
3.0,Looked very pretty but metal was not of good quality. The nose pin would bend easily.
3.0,I liked the initial material and it looked cute on. However the cut sleeves will fray away on the first washing. It looked finished in the picture. I returned it but it will be awhile for credit as it’s not one to be dropped off at kohl’s or a ups store. You pay shipping for return.
3.0,Didnt really like it
3.0,"The dress is nice and a good deal for the price, it was just a little big on me. The chest area was not as low cut as much as it did on the model and there is this weird flap on the inside of the dress that caused a line across the chest. It was also baggy in the waste so I had to belt it. If you have more curves, this will probably flatter you very well. I liked the stretchy material."
3.0,"I expected the leg portion to be sheer because it says High Waist SHEERS - to me they are support stockings, much heavier than expected."
3.0,Gift its too big bought wrong size
3.0,They are not tight around the tummy nor waist. I would definitely have liked more tummy control. The ankles are also large. I am 5’1 and they are too long for me. They bunch at my ankles. Material is comfortable though. I ordered a large and a medium probably would’ve been better.
3.0,"Color was not as vibrant as I thought it would be, decent warp for the money"
3.0,"The fabric feels cheap. It’s thin, very stiff, makes noise when you walk. This would be a five star if the fabric was soft."
3.0,"I like the dress, but it is too tight across the back and around the bust area."
3.0,"This dress is SO comfortable and very cute. However, the stripes on the waistband didn't line up properly, making it a dead giveaway for cheap cheap fast fashion. Also, the buttons were a little ugly. I returned this, but would actually give it another try if they had solid colors."
3.0,Any subtle movement and these shorts are up into your crack. They basically turn into underwear if you're working out with them on.
3.0,"So, not cool really.  The photo looks like it's a multi colored sequined mask, when it's really a kind of porous pink knit fabric with shiny threads. I don't even want to double mask with it as it looks cheesy. Disappointing."
3.0,They squeak as you walk...
3.0,"It's pretty, though the red paint used is a bit off from the red of, say, the Soviet flag. The chain provided was too long for me, but I used it as a keychain anyway. My only complaint is that it scratches and rusts quickly (after about 2 months for me). If the shipping costed less it'd be worth the price."
3.0,I love this dress. I ordered it based on the measurements. For me I should I gone up a size.  The top fit good but I'm larger at the bottom and it just wasn't a good fit.
3.0,"Positives first. Okay, everything arrived on time. The top is made very well. It looks prettier in person.  My issue is the leopard print bell bottoms.  The material is so soft  which is awesome, but the cut is weird. The bell bottom doesn't fo to the ankle . It goes about mid calf. My secons issue is ,the sewing quality.  The top of the waist band is not sewn on properly and there is a small hole that I have to stitch to connect the top of the pant line to the waist band."
3.0,While this Chinese made belt is stamped 'genuine leather' on the inside it does not feel nor act or feel like leather.<br />The fit is good as advertised.  But not like any leather belt I have purchased in the U.S.  Not sure it is going to last nearly as long as my old belts. the design looks good and is presentable. For the cost it is okay.
3.0,The job to set the time broke off within a few days
3.0,Come apart easily
3.0,Fabric was way too thin for my preference. Ran true to size but shorter than expected - above the knee. Returned.
3.0,"This one is tiny bit tight for an XL but the length is good and it does fit. I usually wear a large so I am glad I got an XL. Also, I ordered a green one but I received a pastel greenish one. Color is way different than the screen shot."
3.0,they are so small and hard to open. but are really nice and really cheap
3.0,"It's a nice, fluffy, and soft beanie.. I will have to give it 3stars because it has defaults at 2 spots.. Ill have to stitch them or something... I'd give it 1 star but the delivery was fast and i do like the hat.. I just wish it didnt have any defaults :((. I'd order several more, different colors if it did not have any defaults. But don't wanna risk it. Order it at your own risk. I'll upload pictures of the defaults later!"
3.0,Very long even for a tall person
3.0,"Looks better in picture , wire sticks out on the braid .. Had too sew the braid up..."
3.0,"I just received my order and tried them on. The structure and material look nice, but the size I'm afraid is running small. My regular size is P/M, but the sleeves and length of pants are barely long enough. It's cotton. I guess they will shrink after wash and even more if you put them in the dryer! I hate sleep in somewhat short sleeves in cold days. I should have ordered one size larger or a regular M. I'm only 5'2&#34; for your information."
3.0,"It is beautiful, but the size was too small."
3.0,"Good clutch but the chain quality is poor, it breaks after every use."
3.0,"The wristband is set to 8/12th largest notch, but if the clasp is centered on the bottom of my wrist, the face is way misaligned on the top of my wrist. I'll adjust the face to be centered on the top of my wrist, but after a few minutes the clasp will adjust itself to center on the bottom, causing the face to be way off center again.<br />Also the light is pretty dim for looking at the time in the dark.<br />Still decent and light weight, but I wouldn't buy it again even at the sub $10 mark."
3.0,"If you have big wrists, dont buy it but I really love it. It looks like it does on the picture but it was too small for me so I gave it to a friend"
3.0,Size comes in S/M or L/XL . I wear a medium and ordered S/M. I weigh 143 pounds and it fits way too snug but I feel that the XL would have been too big
3.0,"I've had it for about two weeks and already the chain broke in half. However, it does look nice."
3.0,Be very careful how you wash it and dry it.  Had a lot of loose threads and had to trim a bunch of them carefully so as not to unravel anything.
3.0,Just a wee bit junky for the price.
3.0,"The fabric is fine but the elastic waist band on the right is awful. It’s extremely thick an unflattering and it easily twists. The shirt is also unflattering, even for quarantine pajamas I regret buying these"
3.0,They look great until I put them on then they just looked too big and flat/straight across. Like if you pushed them up to wear as a headband.😒
3.0,"The color in the picture does not reflect the colors shown in the description. It is called navy, but they actually look purple and the white looks pink! These are for my son and he is not happy that they look ""girlie""."
3.0,Very nice bracelet; however it was longer than expected.  Impossible to open/shut clasp; couldn't take any links out to shorten the length.
3.0,"Runs a little small, but its stretchy..<br />Material wise its more rayon than anything.. it has that kinda sheen look.. I wish it would have been cotton.."
3.0,This is more of a hunter green
3.0,I'm only 5' 2&#34; so the dress is a little large on me.  Material is lightweight.  Not the best quality but the price is good.<br />.
3.0,The jewelry box that the earrings shipped in was all but destroyed on arrival. The ear rings themselves were intact but loose in the box and not firmly secured. The quality of the earrings are okay.
3.0,I really like these pants . They fit and look great the fleece adds comfort in the cold . The only issue I have is the stitching  on the inside is kinda messy . I thought about returning them. 100 percent made in China .  The price is right so this will be a test pair. I hope they hold up.
3.0,"I feel like this bra is not true to size.. feels a little snug. No support for boobs, If I were to leak it would come straight through. I also think it’s unreasonable priced for the quality."
3.0,They were for my daughter and these were more athletic type fabric she wanted more cotton.
3.0,I mean I know nothing looks like the picture but when this comes its not really a fitted dress... its very slinky material and the way it lays it's more like an oversized night shirt. I ordered true to my size but it just hangs badly.  And after 5 minutes of wearing this I was sweating like a beast!! I couldn't imagine wearing this out anywhere that wasn't fully air conditioned or you'd die of heat.  Not to mention it took well over 2 months to arrive.  Not impressed
3.0,One size small
3.0,Don't really like the shiny material but I kept it...
3.0,it did not fit my kids hand and she is a tween and it can be reshaped so its not a good ring very cute tho
3.0,This is a beautiful ring. The sizing is spot on. The only issue is that one of the stones fell out the day after I got it. You get what you pay for.
3.0,Was not what I expected. There decent just didn’t work for what I wanted to use them for!
3.0,Color not as attractive as I hoped for.
3.0,"These felt very bouncy and comfortable and they fit as expected. They weren't as flat on the bottom as I had hoped, and are almost like a rocking chair in that depending on where you position your weight, you could lean forward or backward"
3.0,I loved the bracelet but it broke extremely easy. Within the first week it broke.
3.0,A lot shorter than expected. Did not make it up to the top eyeholes.
3.0,The hats are nice but... If you have a ton of thick hair like me it's almost impossible to get your hair through the small hole. The seller is wonderful.
3.0,"I love the color and the fit is great, but it is a little see through."
3.0,"Lame that the removable side of the buckle has to be taken all the way off to put it on or take it off, but even more annoying is also having to remove the elastic loop that’s used for excess slack after you’ve tightened the belt. Once it’s on, it’s a solid belt though."
3.0,Returned it. Hardly seen the purple color.
3.0,"Nice heavy, good looking key chain at first, but it scratches easily, and the corolla letters and Toyota emblem has worn off and now its unreadable, but i still use it."
3.0,great design but on the small side and came in too much in the front. Shows a little too much in the chest for my 4 year old
3.0,"Bought this to wear as a costume. It fits okay, but I had to get it taken in under the arms and in the back between the shoulder blades. Its a bit stiff, but that's to be expected with this type of thick cotton fabric, and I prefer that over flimsy costume-y fabric these dresses are sometimes made of.  Other than that, its very pretty and sturdy."
3.0,"Nice masks; good cotton; does not have nose wire or elastic around the ears, fabric loops.  You can adjust to fit snugly, but not elastic."
3.0,Buckle is too bulky.
3.0,"I ordered two of these and one fit correctly and the other was too small and I ordered the same size.  Thin, cute, sweater."
3.0,The fit of this suit was really off.  It was too short in the torso but very wide across the buttocks. This is not a good brand fir my granddaughter’s build I guess. It’s pretty though.
3.0,I WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN THIS STONE A SECOND LOOK HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR EDGER CAYCES MENTION OF THE INNATE UNSEEN HEALING OF CERTAIN TRAITS UNBECOMING TO AND A HINDRANCE TOWARD THE GOAL OF ENLIGHTMENT IN THIS PLANE OF EXSISTANCE. AND THE VERY HAUNTING DEEP BLUE HUE IS JAZZY TOO. I WOULD HAVE PREFURRED A DRILLED HOLE FOR A LEATHER NECKSTRAP INSTEAD OF THE UNBECOMING GLUED FITTING.
3.0,"Bought for my niece that has ocd.<br />If it wasn't so hard to get the gloves on her hands, I would have given 5 stars. It's a real struggle to get them on. We had to use baby powder on her hands to get the gloves on."
3.0,"The hat fit perfectly, it's just still a little crushed from being packaged, it's been open for 2 days. I don't like that it comes folded...messes with the wire shape a little. And the red/pink doesn't show up as vibrant as in the picture...mostly purple. But it will do for what it's for, my daughters 10th birthday tea party."
3.0,"This dress has a stiff feel to it.  It is not very flowing.  It also has a deep plunging neckline.  The only saving grace was the pockets.  I wore it once, was super uncomfortable that I was going to fall out of it, and donated it to Savers."
3.0,"Good length nice brown color the red stripe is more of dark pink / red blend.<br />I got the small it is a loss fit , I wish the had extra small available.<br />This is a very stretchy sweater…<br />You will need long sleeve outfit with if wearing this in October and in to winter.<br /><br />This is not going to work as a coat lol<br />Only for a fast walk from the car to inside"
3.0,I was so excited when it arrived  Its not as comfortable as I hoped for.
3.0,"My daughter only used it once so far, but it works for the purpose"
3.0,"I like the way they looked. Very cute pattern. This was why I bought them. They seem to fit properly compared to other pants. But when I bend down they show the white of the insides, as if they are stretched to the limits or something. What I really dislike is that they don't stay put. I wore them for a 5k and I was pulling them up all the way. The waist stays put but the legs creep down to the ankles. Very irritating."
3.0,I'm not in love with the material this is made from. Also the card slots are so deep that some of my cards go in past the point of return.
3.0,Bought these for my son. They run very large. They would have been perfect if I bought two sizes down.
3.0,I'm 5'4 240lb DD breast. Xl fits great. True to size. Check chart.
3.0,Get a size smaller. I’m glad I listened to reviews and sizes down. Still had to alter. Super cute but material is super thin. My daughter wears it at home to swim but nowhere else.
3.0,"Not as soft or comfortable as the similar (but more expensive, and discontinued) reebok shorts. Still, not a bad item."
3.0,Very basic. Almost “Amish” is simplicity.  Wish I would have returned.
3.0,Too big for a kid.
3.0,"The pants from first sight looked like they would be exactly what I needed, until I washed them 2 times and when I put them on for the third time the side pocket with the Velcro completely ripped apart."
3.0,"Great material, great shape. Only problem if you have long arms then the sleeves are way too short :("
3.0,"Low quality and took a lot of tinkering to get it to fit on the watch.  At the end of the day, I put the factory plates on it and had to leave the screws a little loose.  Once it got that, it slides on and off as expected and fits well.  I have not has issues with removing links like others stated.<br /><br />The metal is not a perfect match for the watch face but it's good enough. the biggest thing is that it is comfortable to wear it all day long."
3.0,"Nice looking and comfortable.  Collar is a bit too thick.  My main problem is the static buildup and I have even thought of asking for a refund. Washing didn't help much.  Belt could have been a bit longer also.<br />Update: static problem went away in a few months.  Robe is very soft and comfortable, so long that I step on it when ascending stairs.  Belt is barely long enough, but I am a big guy."
3.0,"I'm 5'11&#34; and got a medium like another reviewer my height. I am about 155 lbs. The bottom fits but the top swims. It's ridiculous. And useless. Also, it's all kinda ugly and crappy looking."
3.0,These EAEAO Women's Cargo Shorts have a couple of real pockets although even 2 of those are weirdly constructed and are fully as deep as possible about the width of 2 fingers. Other pockets are not real - just flaps. The cut is a bit weird and they don't wear well. I would pass on these strange shorts.
3.0,"The skirt is adorable! I should have sized down, because it fits around my waist and it is a bit large"
3.0,"The top mesh pocket busted within 2 weeks. Was looking forward to this bag, it just didn't hold up. The bottom big pocket is good though."
3.0,"Beautiful suit, however, it runs small in the chest area. I am a 36C and the cups felt like they would fit a person who is an A or possibly a B"
3.0,"Based on reviews, I ordered on the large side, and they ended up being way too roomy in the waist and legs. However, there still wasn't enough height to cover my bum comfortably. I'd say these are not shaped for girly curves. Returned. Quality isn't great but would have looked cute while they are on trend."
3.0,This dress runs small in size.
3.0,Un poco chico pero me gusto
3.0,I think a safe bet with Amazon clothing is always order one size larger.
3.0,Its not puffy like advertised and thinner then expected not t as warm as should be. Cant wear it in the cold. It will be great for spring.
3.0,"Very pretty patterns, and nice lightweight cotton but they don't lay well on your face."
3.0,Okay overall but 2 of the circles have obvious joints which cheapens the look of the necklace.
3.0,Nice quality but it’s bigger than expected.
3.0,It is a nice dress but I guess the model is short... it was over my knees.
3.0,"It's OK, but not great. Leather is too stiff. Would have liked a window area for drivers license."
3.0,The color of the band is much different than what is pictured. Mine looks very much like light gray/tan camouflage whereas the picture has more of a charcoal look to it. I play DiscGolf and lift weights mostly for activities and my wrist is always super wet and stinks like always from any other brand of watch bands. This product claims to cure the “cheese” smell and sweat issue with their groove track technology and that is false for this particular band. I’ve only had this since Christmas 2020 in my latch is already breaking down in material and wearing off. Cool concept but overall does not meet the quality or criteria that they are selling. I have two of their rings as well and both of them continue to keep sweat and moisture on my finger even after waking up in the morning to take my band off to shave. The positives are that these products are extremely comfortable and easy to take on and off.
3.0,Slightly larger than expected.
3.0,"For reference, I'm 5 feet tall, bra is 32D, and bought a small. Normally I wear an XS, but I saw the other reviews about how small the cup sizes were, and sized up. I was into the design so I figured I'd buy it and see how it went.<br />The bottom of the cups hits about 1 cm/0.5 inches above where my chest meets my rib cage, but does cover the girls completely - doable, but kind of awkward. The rest of the dress is slightly loose because I sized up. I'd also say the dress is meant for taller girls than me, because the skirt begins about an inch below my natural waist, and is about 4 inches too long on skirt. The way the dress is sewn makes it difficult adjust too much about it without completely taking it apart, so I'll exchange for an XS and see if that's better.<br /><br />Edit: after getting the XS, the fit is much better around the waist and hips. The cups are not noticeably different in size. Interestingly the skirt still starts about 1-2 cm below my natural waist, and is still too long by about 3-4 inches, although this one I didn't measure too closely. It's cute, so I'll take the time to hem it and make some minor changes, but that might not be ideal for you. All in all, I'd say the ideal woman for a size S has a 26-27 inch waist, has a 32C or 34B cup size max, and is about 5'3""-5'5""."
3.0,"Dress is really pretty when worn, you need to size up if you want a comfortable fit though. Also, on the second time I wanted to wear it, the zipper broke so it's unwearable now."
3.0,Was not as effective as the cheaper off brands
3.0,"They were ok, you get what you pay for if its cheap they will work cheap but its a temporary toy but it was ok"
3.0,"these earrings came in a cheap draw string bag....would have to find something else to wrap them in as a gift, also i think they might have been returned because they had 2 different backs on them , 1 the old fashion back and the other the kind that has a round plactic disc.....so i had to find 2 matching backs before wrapping. i was actually disapointed for the money. could of bought something nicer at jcpenny for alittle less."
3.0,Def cheap suspenders but if you want some fun color touch ups if does the trick. We used these foru our wedding. Make sure your suit pants have suspender buttons as they do not have the dual connector.
3.0,"very cute, but quality is not as expected"
3.0,"I liked this onsie I bought for my daughter! It it soft, velvet like, on the outside. It fits her well. My one complaint is after the first time I washed it, one of the Pom Poms on the hood fell off. Seems like it is held onto the hood poorly."
3.0,"I didn't like the material, looked very cheap not like the picture."
3.0,Pretty dress but nothing like the picture.
3.0,I liked the simplicity of the bracelet; however I'm returning it because it's too hard for me to adjust and it's not very comfortable on.
3.0,*update*<br />Clasp keeps breaking and I’ve lost my watch a few times because of it.<br /><br />My favorite watch band!
3.0,The elastic in the waist pants was a little tight. But it is very soft fabric.
3.0,"Fabric is ok, but neck hangs a bit loosely.  Returning."
3.0,Very thin. Not like a normal hoodie.
3.0,"I like them, but there should be a plastic insert to keep them from unscrewing.  Maybe a flat piece of metal on the end of the screw to keep them from cutting into the skin."
3.0,"I bought this in a size small in black for my daughters 10th Birthday. She loves MHA so I knew she would love this sweatshirt. I’d say this runs small. She is very petite and the small fits perfect so I can’t imagine the small fitting anyone other than a child. The quality is not very good, very thin material. The print looks great. I’ve washed it once and it still looks okay. It did have a horrible smell though. Very chemically. It came out after one wash. My daughter loves it so that’s all that matters. It would repurchase. The price is fine for what it is."
3.0,"Cute skirt, but a little stiff and cut on the smaller side. After reading the reviews, I was worried it wouldn't fit, but it's fine after you get it over your head"
3.0,"Tops great, bottom is questionable at best!<br />The top fits great, looks great. The bottom seemed about 6 sizes smaller and the size wasn’t marked, so maybe there was a mix up, I’m not sure."
3.0,Not worth $60! Looked NOTHING like the photo!
3.0,Nice material but runs too small.
3.0,They work as they should.  Over the course of the say however they do loosen up. Great for daily use if you are in and out of stores.  Blocks the wind very well
3.0,"This key chain is nice, but it is large, so if you are looking for a small one I wouldn't recommend it!"
3.0,The metal twist apart is held together by tiny screws I'm hoping over time don't work there way out as it's the glue her and keys would be everywhere.  My only reservation and so far so good.
3.0,This tunic is very narrow. This picture gives the impression of an A-Line tunic. The one I received is a strait cut. The color is beautiful.
3.0,did read about sized small but ordered an x-large for my son who is a large and it was too small...needs at least an xx-large
3.0,"This jacket is ""okay"". I bought it for my daughter as part of her Halloween costume. The coloring is off. It's not brown like in the picture you see on Amazon. It's like a weird purple. It is a shiny material as well but I was expecting that. I ordered it a size bigger than I would typically buy for her based on another review saying it runs small and it's slightly to big for her, which is fine. She doesn't mind that at all. Just mentioning for her it would not run small but would run true to size overall. I wouldn't purchase again, nor would I recommend this to anyone else either. If I saw it in a store I would have told her we would keep looking for something closer to the actual color the jacket should be (and is advertised as). The product pictures really should updated to show the actual product your getting. I feel like I wouldn't have minded the color difference had the item been cheaper than what I paid for it."
3.0,"The design/pattern was really cute, but I had to return because the shape was just not flattering for my body type."
3.0,"Exactly like picture but the band holder on side is much too loose, instead of tighter fitting. Otherwise it's great."
3.0,Knees wore pretty quickly
3.0,I didnt like the buttons
3.0,"Great way to protect the hair, but it IS slippery!"
3.0,"Didn't care for the position of the handles, look odd."
3.0,Very cute. They are not stainless steel and some of them won't close completely. The ring with the green ball won't close completely so it feels like it's going to fall out.
3.0,"These were great for my students, but a few were not glued well"
3.0,"I like to read descriptions and have an idea what I’m ordering. These were smaller than expected, and didn’t fit at all. I was a slacker about returning them and they sat in the bag for too long so I had to give them away to donation. The material was thin."
3.0,"Super cute, fits great, but I need leggings to wear it to work because it’s so short. Might not be so short on someone who’s not as tall as I am."
3.0,"This top has no real support. Although it fits over my body, it will not support my breasts from falling out in the water"
3.0,Dress fits ok. Nice and simple. Thin material though. And the &#34;purple&#34; I ordered is not purple. Doesnt look remotely close to the picture and is more of a deep eggplant color. Will be returning.
3.0,The bust area is extremely tight. Doesn't give much room feel almost like flattening
3.0,"its not bad, just smaller than i expect~<br />i thought its very big, can fit all regular size skin care and makeup stuff~<br />but can fit many things also, not too small~"
3.0,Looks better in the picture. Feels cheep when you hold it and the pink is a dull plastic so it doesn't really shine
3.0,They are waterproof but not that warm. They are also a little large on the sizing.
3.0,"Very nice, but the color is brighter and lighter than what I  expected. Very light material but not see through."
3.0,These clip on earrings are pretty but fall off easy. I lost one the first day I wore them.
3.0,"It's a beautiful and very good quality garment. Fit is perfect and I am size 16/18,5'7&#34;.Very slimming and cute.Thick, heavy cotton,good shape. I was very disappointed and frustrated that I have to return this one,because I really like it,except the color. I ordered purple and I received brightly green dress with blue and purple spots here and there. Absolutely doesn't match Amazon picture. It's almost looks like camouflage. Disappointed. Returning. I really wanted purple, not green!!!The only purple thing was underline."
3.0,"I bought these for my daughter.  She says they are too tight and won’t wear them.  I tried them on, they didn’t hurt me.  I only wore for a minute so not sure if longer use would hurt."
3.0,It didn't fit  my 14 month old son as expected cute shoe tho I will give to my nephew
3.0,I like the look but they really attract dust
3.0,I do not care for the material and it hugs my body too much. it is not as attractive as it shows. It looks like it has some cotton or knit and it is not so.
3.0,"Smaller than the chart insinuates, but it still fits. Also the straps are hard to keep up, but with a little effort you're good to go! Cute for casual but classy outfits."
3.0,"So I'm between a 8.5 and 9 in shoes. Some of these actually fit correctly and others were too tight. Two of them had holes before I even put them on. Maybe I can try to hem them myself. One of the ones that fit fine got a hole in the toe after the first wear. Again, maybe I can hem it. They are really cute and don't slip off. They are pretty close to no-show and with the little bit of lace, it isn't awful if they do show. I would say that you really should have a size 8 or below if you want them to fit right. They are good for maybe 3 wears if they don't rip before that, but for the price, it isn't too bad."
3.0,This was a very pretty dress in theory and it’s incredibly comfortable. However the middle section made me feel like it was a maternity dress.
3.0,"The fabric and design are great, but the legs roll up. Fighting my shorts was an unexpected addition to my workout."
3.0,need bigger size
3.0,It's super cute but the zipper gives me alot of crap
3.0,I love The boot the quality is really good too they don't look cheap at all my only problem is that it is very very narrow so if you wear a size 9 you should order a 10 I thought they would stretch out after a while but it has not they're somewhat tight
3.0,Thought we were getting a &#34;kid's&#34; costume as that is what we searched for.  Usually a medium fits my 7-year old grandson perfectly.  Grandson loves the knife and mask BUT the jumpsuit was definitely mis-sized.  It's more an X-Large for a man.  Won't send it back though because grandson doesn't want to part with the knife and mask!
3.0,Straps are definitely too long and the lenght of it is way too short. I had to adjust the straps and I modified the outfit on the lefs to make it look like shorts.  It's a cute outfit just not really well designed.
3.0,"My husband got this for me as a Mothers day gift.  I loved how the Hispanic American Cameo lookd so authentic with amazing attention to detail, from the earrings on the mom, to the expression on the baby's face.  However,  within 3 months the cameo fell off the holder.  I called the company, who replaced it for free, but did not have another Hispanic American cameo.  I recieved a regular replacement.  I still wear it, and love it, but I am sad that it is not what I origionally ordered."
3.0,"The dress will be pretty once it is steamed, however I am shocked that the straps do NOT match the satin belt (that is not attached..) very dissapointing."
3.0,"The quality is not good, and it runs smaller than expected"
3.0,Received as advertised. I'm not impressed with quality of product .
3.0,"These gloves were not impressive at all. Looking closely, the material is not the best quality & feel weird wearing them. They were  funny for a one time use costume & that’s the extent of them."
3.0,"So this item is probably used. I really need it to work now for a gift though, so I’m charging it…and will update review if needed. Watch looks new, screen is good, though I’ve only seen the charging screen.<br />The plastic seals around the plastic product container appeared intact. I didn’t realize the inside zip tie holding the watch was already cut until after the watch was removed from its stand. On close inspection, the back of the watch is slightly scuffed. I hope it works as it looks like a decent enough product for the price. But I didn’t pay for a used unit."
3.0,Way too long for short people
3.0,Good price but not 100% my style.  Lighter tint than most.
3.0,"Nice canvas purse, but it is slightly smaller than expected.  The velcro on the front flap is starting to rip off and is becoming frayed and messy which is disappointing."
3.0,"Really liked it but after a few months began to pull apart, contacted customer service and they replaced it but it did the same thing. Really liked the fit but the quality was poor."
3.0,"The loop for my watch broke, so I bought this instead of replacing my watch.  Although it is too high, I am keeping because of also receiving the watch band remover tool."
3.0,"Liked the style, but was to large and the color was not what I exspected."
3.0,"The ring is nice and fits good, but the edges are quite sharp. The rings edges look a little rounded in the picture but they are not in real life. I still like it, sometimes it's not super comfortable."
3.0,Does not look good on a bigger woman. At least it didn't on me.
3.0,Got for wife and she likes them
3.0,"it's ok. It is so lightweight that any amount of wind will blow it off, definitely covers the face for sun protection"
3.0,Didn’t like the material nice dress tho
3.0,I wear a 14 comfortably but some 12s. I got a 3x good thing because it fits good. Anything smaller would have been to small.
3.0,Cute wallet but the stitching on the Velcro came undone quickly. Got a lot of compliments on it!
3.0,"Cute dress but far too small. I'm 5&#34;8 140 (size 4) and ordered a medium, I couldn't zip it"
3.0,"They are a little wide, even at the largest size offered. I was hoping they would be sized better than the small sizes. I know it's too easy to make them too narrow and that's not just uncomfortable, but dangerous to my lobes. Wide is better than narrow. I know I could have found something comfortable enough to sleep in somewhere else, but it's hard finding 2inch plugs that are affordable. I guess I got what I paid for."
3.0,The size did not match so I ended up wearing a tent. A very comfy tent but a tent. I wanted it as a summer dress for work with a short jacked or sweater but it was so big and long that I just cut it and wear it at home as a home dress. It was not wasted but it was not what I wanted.
3.0,The material is kind of cheap. The armpit holes are unbelievably large. I have to wear a sweater to cover.
3.0,"The olive green is more of a mustard green color and the fit it tight , way too tight for me. I like compression but it’s more squeezing."
3.0,"Pretty material but it isn't flattering (size L) would probably fit a very small girl fine, but with wide hips and a large butt, it makes me look fat."
3.0,Runs small. bought for 8 yr. old.
3.0,"We usually wear x-small or small but these were way too loose and long in sleeves, more like a medium or large. As much as we liked the material and style of the tops, we were so disappointed with the size. Wish they came in an actual x-small or even small as in the old-days. Nowadays it seems like smalls are more like mediums. The small would easily fit our sister who is a medium in tops. So disappointed!"
3.0,Don't wick sweat and very thin.
3.0,This costume is adorable and my sweet almost 2 year old wore it on Halloween and I thought that I would wash it just as the instructions said with cold water and similar colors. After the wash this is how it turned out. Never has this happened when washing anything else! Super disappointed as it was still pretty clean and I should have just stored it and now I have to throw it away.
3.0,Did not like the clingy static-ridden material. Perhaps a slip would have helped? The sleeves were shapeless and looked awkward. Returned.
3.0,"The material is pretty cheap, but the cut is OK.  Shoulders are tight."
3.0,Too tight on arms and made of o very itchy material. I would not recommend this to anyone
3.0,Very snug in the toe area!  Beautiful shoe!
3.0,I like the watch band .
3.0,The mask doesn’t say on face but I fixed it with a safety pin
3.0,"This is probably a great purse for someone else, but not me.  I thought I could put an iPad in one of the main body side pockets (on either side of the zippered area), but they only go down about halfway.  There's not a lot of interior organization, either.  Ended up sending it back."
3.0,"ok, product but, not comfortable"
3.0,"VERY SLIPPERY ... my son slides out of my hands, and zipper is very hard to zip all the way up because it may nick the neck skin ... wish neck opening was wider<br /><br />However, I did not give it 1 star because it's warm and otherwise is a good product ... but VERY VERY SLIPPERY ... seriously"
3.0,"I love the color,the texture of the fabric and the style but the inseam is no way as long as the picture shows,I put a tape measure on it and s it's 3"" .I wish they were longer . Will donate them don t want to wait another month for a refund being they ship from china."
3.0,a good costume jewlery
3.0,"This product was defective and was missing one of the snaps that keeps the sides closed. This makes it hard to use when there is a wind blowing. Otherwise, it's just your normal poncho."
3.0,"The outfit is not for everyone, bit is on the promiscuous side of you're looking to wear this out to a rave or nightclub. It is transparent so you're want to wear a bra or cover up underneath. There are straps on to tie on the other end. I got the medium size and it's just right, and has slight stretch to it. My measurements were 36c, 28 waist and 36 hips."
3.0,"The product is cheap, but so is the cost. My only complaint is that there were a couple small scratches on the lenses when I opened the package."
3.0,"Broke two days after use, but was beautiful. Very upset :("
3.0,"The color was described as being Heather Red, but in reality it was a plum/purple color.  Had to return it."
3.0,"The purse looked great and worked well, however after about 3 months the outer attaching fabric that held the longer strap has already torn away. Everything else on the bag looks and works well. Needs to be better reinforced for shoulder strap."
3.0,"I love the shirt and material.  I'm 5'2&#34; and 102 pounds.  From the reviews saying this was too small I ordered up a size and got a Medium.  It's too big.  So then I just ordered a small, however I was very disappointed to find the small to be the exact same measurements as the medium.  So now I have two of this lovely shirt that's too big. Bummer.  It's so pretty and sweet."
3.0,I thought this was an adult mask but it was way too small for an adult face.  I loved the design and color but could not wear it.  I did not try to return it...maybe I will find a child who will like it.
3.0,"I liked this for the winter months and I liked the size But.... there is a zippered pouch in the middle which kind of gets in the way. I guess you get what you pay for. Also No ""real"" pocket for my cellphone."
3.0,The glasses themselves looked great. They were trendy and stylish and the color was beautiful! However I only wore them a couple of times before the frame broke and I wasn't hard on them either. I'd like to see these glasses made with a bit sturdier material.
3.0,"More cropped than expected, but looks good with high waisted jeans."
3.0,"I am 5'2 around 145 lbs. I normally wear M or L for tops since I have a large bust. I ordered an XL and it fits fine, so definitely order a size up or two."
3.0,"The image is printed on one side and hardly visible.<br />You can't see it from the other side like a lot of nice clear gauges. Light plastic so I'm not sure what I was expecting, they just aren't all that visible."
3.0,Pretty and soft...Band was way too small.. I was always told if you go up in cup size you need to go down in band size--NOPE not the case with this one. Had to put 2 set of extenders (5 inches) Underwire have not poked though--yet--YAY-- I wear it most
3.0,Not high quality and the pockets make the hip area very bulky.
3.0,"Shirt was cute, fit well. Definitely a waist length dont raise your arms high length shirt which I expected, what I DIDNT expect was the space in the front at the faux tie. It left a circle space open on the waist in the center. You could not tie it to close it. I returned it, I couldn't get over the belly button peeking hole"
3.0,Nicely made but small and strings are small.
3.0,I usually buy small. but got medium based on comments. But it turned out bigger than expected. sleeves falls loosely
3.0,it was too small to fit all of my hair (I have A LOT) but seemed good quality and made for a nice &#34;hand-me-down&#34; to my sister
3.0,"I gave this as a birthday gift to a toddler but would have found another apron set if I had more time. Price was great, but disappointed that the fabric felt polyester-y and thinner than I expected. Hoping materials will become soft after wash, and the birthday boy will still have fun wearing it. Packaging was nice in a clean plastic clear envelope and I love the thought that it was designed by a mom."
3.0,it was okay considering the price but you have to have someone put it on you
3.0,I don't like the balls they fall off no matter what i do. i do like the sharp ends tho
3.0,"good, very durable, excellent product"
3.0,I normally wear a large or XL... I ordered a 2XL because of skeptical reviews and it fits perfectly... Sleeves are snug on the forearm as the picture and the shirt is lose...stretchy material
3.0,Cute comfortable
3.0,Broken lens when received the package!
3.0,The material is too heavy and not breathable.
3.0,"This is very pretty, but if you're less than 3 feet away from it, it's pretty cheaply made/quality"
3.0,It looks cute but is VERY sheer and tight.. so just be cautious. Also the sleeves were small so I could not lift my arms higher than my shoulders.
3.0,"Really like the look of this watch. Looks good and it's accurate for an automatic. Only issue is I have had the screw pins fall out a couple of times. I finally pulled them all and used locktite, that fixed the problem."
3.0,Really low price for a low quality garment. Just felt cheap and the material does not flow like I thought it would. Returned it easily though.
3.0,Very sheer. You will need to wear a slip or something under this if you intend to wear it in public.
3.0,The bails are attached by a very thin sliver of metal and break off easily
3.0,"The shape fits my smaller face perfectly, but I was expecting to get a black lens. It was delivered with a colored mirror lense. Not sure if it's advertised incorrectly, but I wish I was able to know which one I had picked out."
3.0,"Thin fabric makes it transparent in most light. I purchased two colors - same issue. But, this comfortable so I sleep in it."
3.0,As described.  A bit too small.
3.0,"Ok, but this case has no hard support in the walls.  It is basically a fabric case."
3.0,"Was about 2-3 sizes too small for me. I couldn't even get my arms in because of my shoulder width. It warns you that they run small, but they don't even have a size that would fit me. The quality seemed fine, but it certainly was not designed for a 6' 235lbs firefighter. If you wear a medium, a large or XL would fit you fine. Anything bigger and you might have some trouble."
3.0,"I have a shorter torso, and found that the dress was not as flattering as it appeared to be on those with longer torsos. The fit wasn't great, either; the top portion is tighter than I expected."
3.0,"I didn't realize the material was not a soft cotton, the picture looks like it is. It's like spandex :(  and the colors are not the same. Not happy with it but not going thru the trouble of returning it"
3.0,My toddler loves them. The do run on the smaller side of a 2T. In hindsight I wish I would have gotten a 3T. Over all not bad.
3.0,Fair quality.
3.0,"Nice sweater, ordered it in red and it is salmon in color. It gives color to the face and looks good. The fit is okay, boxy not flowy if that makes sense. It will give you volume on your upper half and it's structured around the waist, as it curls in. Being petite, it kinda makes me look larger than what I am...BUT it could hide flaws and it is uber comfy.  I am giving it 3 stars because it came with two holes in the sweater. Bummed."
3.0,"About a quarter of the rings wouldn't light up and many were already switched on when we opened the box.<br />The remaining rings were a big hit, though. A little more care taken when shipping could probably solve those two problems."
3.0,It looks sexy. But it keeps slip off from elbow...
3.0,Fits extremely tight. Gave it 3 starts because it looks as picture. But the fit was terrible and cut into my stomach. Should have sizing on here.
3.0,I like this product because of the adjustable strap in the back the only design flaw is that it is not really designed for all facial features and was sagging on the bottom otherwise this is a good product
3.0,"The style of these sunglasses are cute, and I love the pink lenses.. however, when the glasses are on.. you see blue not pink through the lenses. I wasn’t expecting that. I have had other pink lense sunglasses and you saw everything in a pink tint. If I wanted to see things with a blue tint.. I’d buy blue lenses!"
3.0,"Why 3 stars, when accuracy, ease of use, and comfort all got 5?  Because one of those accurate ""features"" is the ability to set 5 separate alarms, as well as an alarm that beeps every hour on the hour.  Setting these alarms and turning them on and off are easy enough.  The downside?  The alarms are INAUDIBLE!  If the watch is held literally next to the ear when the alarm goes off, it is possible to catch a very faint beep, but if the watch is more than 3 or 4 inches from the ear, the alarm simply cannot be heard.  Is it a big deal?  Not if alarms are just a frill that you don't intend to use (particularly when mobile phones do the job just as well or better), get the watch.  It's great.  Looks great.  Wears very comfortably (the strap is the most comfortable I've ever experienced).  Keeps marvelous time.  Never needs winding or battery changes, as it's solar-powered and obtains an atomic signal every night that keeps the watch perfectly accurate.  The caveat is that if you expect your watch to deliver 100% on all its featured functions‑‑-including an alarm that can be heard more than 3 inches from your ear‑‑-you will be disappointed."
3.0,Very cute shoes but they run small. My son wears a 9 and they are too small . I would recommend going up a size when you order.
3.0,"Ordered an XL, fits like a M. Otherwise, the material was as described."
3.0,A little smaller than I thought it would be. The small jewels have already fallen out and I’ve had it in less than a week. I could’ve ordered the same thing from Wish for much cheaper and would expect this about stones falling out so quick.
3.0,Do they float? Kinda of. We have another pair of bamboo glasses from a different brand that we paid about 50 dollars for that blew these ones out of the water in floating performance! LOL I will say I love the concept and don’t regret the purchase but you get what you pay for.
3.0,"A lititle flimsy for the price, runs a little small"
3.0,I love it but I wish it had a zipper better
3.0,"Cute goggles, comfortable, but they can only be worn for a short time because they are not adjustable in size. Very expensive for goggles that we can't use next year."
3.0,"Items is as pictured & correct measurements given. Item was listed as &#34;new&#34; but arrived with no tags, nor card that was detailed in description. Item arrived in a plastic package that smelled of household cleaner."
3.0,"esperaba que la calidad sea mejor, por el precio esta bastante bien de todos modos"
3.0,"Shirt looks nice, the color is a pretty dark green, there is a front panel undershirt but the back is see thru. I ordered an XL/Xxl and I was way too small, so I gave it to my sister in law who wears Sm/M"
3.0,I finally wore this shirt it is see thru. So don't where a black bra.
3.0,Update: I bought a pink one for the hot summer this year.  The straps were sewn incorrectly so they were not adjustable. I had to take it apart and re-sew it myself to make it work. Disappointed.<br /><br />Love this!! Cute but not too little girl-ish. Lace is a little scratchy but doesn't bother me that much.
3.0,Nice but too big gave them to my sister
3.0,"Originally gave it 5 stars because it seems nice, and it is for the price I suppose but, it's some sort of synthetic material bonded to a leather backer."
3.0,"Just received this today. Really pretty but bigger than I thought it would be.  And I read the review saying the size runs small but it doesnt.. I'm a 4.5 normally so I figured if it ran small the 5 would work great, but it's big on me.  Has a good shine for not being real. Guess we'll see if it turns me green and whatnot.."
3.0,Really cute but way too small even with the sizing provided. Order 2 sizes up
3.0,The toe box was too narrow for me. I have to send them back. Their real cute. I just have an on going fit issue.
3.0,Not as long as shown in the pic but it was ok. Washed once in cold water and didn’t dry it and it still shrunk about 4 inches in length.
3.0,"The graphics and shipping time was excellent, however the neck is super big, looks to be a grown man neck, and the length is not a 4t, more like 2t.<br /><br />But none the less my son loves it since it’s mustang related."
3.0,But I like it so much I took it to the cleaners to have it altered
3.0,"Super cute but made of really thin polyester. What I would call ""Halloween fabric"" because they use it for cheap costumes."
3.0,"Quality shorts but a little too short for my taste. Also, they shrunk a size in the wash and I washed on cold and dried on low."
3.0,These unraveled in the washing machine. Low quality.
3.0,"The product is ok for what I paid for it, but it is NOT the brand I purchased."
3.0,So the sizing for the holster was really big where there is no way it could hold a wand so I had to cut the leather and resize it on my own for it to actually hold a wand and the compartments to hold vials had rivets placed in the wrong spot so they weren't centered either which I was able to fix.  In general I'm giving a 3 stars because I was still able to make it work on my own. Although personally I don't think it's worth the 40 something dollar I paid when you can get the same quality from crap sites wish for 10 dollars and adjust like I did. I also want to make it clear that this isn't anything against Amazon I find the shipping services and speed to be amazing it was just the product that was the problem. But if you are familiar with leather working and are ok with making your own adjustments then this product is fine.
3.0,"It worked for a night, but we had to superglue the belt buckle back together because it couldn’t even stand up to being put on the belt."
3.0,Very small 34 waist.  recommend going up a size.
3.0,materia looks cheap but the shape is nice...its and ok product
3.0,the material is quite flimsy. and the string and back do not lay very nice against the back.  The price was ok for the product.
3.0,"Reviews said to size up x2 and me having a larger chest area I did. It was too big and was baggy as if it was ruched in the front. I could have gotten an xl because it was stretchy and not sheer. It was a last minute dress for graduation so I had to wear it. I only wore it to the ceremony, never took off my gown to take pictures and went straight home to change and take pictures with my cap on and normal clothes. Will be returning."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:f341983f2d5668265ab1e19b22eac1a3]] The clasp isn’t form fitting I know the vide quality sucks but I tried my best to capture it in focus
3.0,"This is my first pair of bike shorts so I have nothing to compare it to. However, I was a little surprised at how much padding is in these shorts. It goes from the front to the back and does help soften the seat during a ride. Unfortunately, walking in these is like having something stuck between my legs. I personally hate that but I suppose it is expected with bike shorts. The large is also a little loose on me which is surprising.<br /><br />Overall, this will be my first and last pair of bike shorts simply because I cannot handle the feeling of having a wad of gel padding in the seat area."
3.0,Its a bit to big even when you buckle it to the last chain...its all crammed together and doesn't look like the picture but over all its cute
3.0,"Datça Windows unnoticable most times, White hande eisible though."
3.0,The leather has an interesting scent like cleaner of some sort or maybe the leather just smells that way. Overall I have 3 stars the handles flopped more to one side and the bag itself was hard leather. I’ve used it once. Color is pretty though
3.0,"It would be wonderful if it fit 18s comfortably but unfortunately they are quite snug for an average 16. Not horrible,stretchy material but,very ""fitting""."
3.0,"Runs large,  I sent it back to exchange it, I haven't got the new one yet"
3.0,"The tatting is beautiful but the fake stone was glued on crooked so it is only good for halloween, not every day."
3.0,"I've never worn a large in anything in my life  135 lbs and 5""6 zipper would not zip in the under breast area, like rib cage area, a large gap and I chose a medium. Fits perfectly every where else but I think next size up would just ruin the look. Very nice and fun outfit, definitely need to cut the fringe at the bottom to  preferred length because it's very long and you will walk all over it otherwise."
3.0,"very cute, but does run small."
3.0,"I have several Popana tank tunics in this style; however, the black one is not labeled Popana and the fabric is much thinner than the other colors I own. I like it enough to keep it, but it's not as nice as the others I've ordered. I have a navy one, and a charcoal gray one, and they are much nicer fabric."
3.0,way smaller than expected
3.0,"For the most part,the dress is expected. However, the red is more of a bright coral/orange/reddish color than a true red."
3.0,"Cute dress, fits well, just see through and sheer."
3.0,"The fit is nice, but the material (black one) looks almost like a bathing suit material. It' well made, but he material makes it look cheap. I wanted to wear it with a high waisted wrap around skirt but it didnt look right. Very casual."
3.0,"Definitely runs small, ordered an XL but fits more like a medium. While the dress pattern is beautiful the material feels super cheap."
3.0,This was a comfortable bra but slightly smaller than another by this company. This style just wasn't right for me since the underwire and/or fabric rubbed under my breasts. I kept the bra but I don't think I'll buy another.
3.0,The lens were okay too wide for my face. went to send them back but took a discount instead.
3.0,This ring is very cute however my only issue with it is when im wearing anything the ring tends to get caught on it and rip out the seams of my clothing
3.0,"I really like the look of these sunglasses however, they did not sit on my face comfortably."
3.0,It was just ok.  Material seemed cheap and fit was small.
3.0,Love the colors but the little piece that holds the excess band broke on the very first day...
3.0,Got it for beach wear.  It's pretty short.  I really liked the color and it good for warm weather activity.  I think it is smaller than label size would suggest so I would order bigger size next time.
3.0,Very cute casual shirt.
3.0,"Little sharp, wish if the metal was a bit smoother."
3.0,I kept the dress because I needed it for the function I was attending but it is not washable nor will it survive but one more wearing...fit was as expected though.
3.0,"Soles are hard not cushioned enough.  They looked different then expected but considering the price, they are good."
3.0,The bottom is not very strechy and it feels very tight. I should have gone with a large instead of a medium. Sizes are just deceiving sometimes.
3.0,The shirt is ok the color does not look the same at all :/ maybe a diff color I would like this shirt
3.0,The top got but the bottoms were way too small! I'm a 34c and a 26-27 in waist
3.0,As others had mentioned the sequins were falling off right out of the bag. I was hoping it wouldn't be too noticable but my carpet was covered after just taking it out of the bag and trying it on. Overall the color and the style are as pictured - maybe a bit on the roomier side. Decided to return and I didn't want to actually wear the dress and leave a trail of sequins throughout the night.
3.0,"The quality is great and my daughter loved them. Unfortunately because of the inaccurate sizing in the description, they are way too big. I ordered a size 10 which is supposed to have an insole of 7.0 (size 27). I received a size 28 which has an insole of 7.2. I reordered to get the correct size and they sent me the same one as before. I don't care which size is which, as long as correct measurements can be taken of the shoe. You loose a lot of business without an accurate description."
3.0,It is pretty scratchy
3.0,Super push-up.
3.0,One of the pairs arrive broken and the remaining vary in quality some are flimsy.
3.0,It came with some scratches.
3.0,Nearly see through but ok for under clothes.
3.0,Super cute bag.  Unfortunately the chain and zipper broke after 3 days of consistent use.
3.0,The triangle is not symmetrical
3.0,Too small  length was good
3.0,"I ws looking for a nice new stiff belt, this was not it. Thin, floppy, doesnt hold its shape.  Nice color though.  Comes in a nice box, but they should have spent the extra dollar on more leather."
3.0,So warm and cozy Love...
3.0,They are super cute but too baggy by chapstick falls out.
3.0,It fits nicely but lint comes off on everything.
3.0,"Comfotable but very shiny. They weren't labeled that way, and they don't work for anything except very dressed-up events."
3.0,"These glasses are cute (on someone else). They are too big for my face. They're bigger than they look in the photo. If you like really oversized sunglasses, these are the ones to buy. Came with a nice case."
3.0,"Really difficult to get the pins out to change the size, it comes really big. The tool to remove the pins ended up actually breaking."
3.0,"I loved the sleeves! They were puffy and perfect. The T-shirt material was light weight but very thin and short in length. I don’t know if I’ll ever wear it alone. Thankfully I intended to wear it under overalls. It worked greatly for that. It’s not as fitted as in the picture, it’s more flowy & lose. I ordered L. I’m usually a M in tops."
3.0,"The bra comes up so high in the back that it shows no matter what I wear. The wide shoulder straps do not lay flat and they show as well, with almost every top I tried on over it. On a bright note, this bra is extremely comfortable and airy. Little support. Will work well if you are only looking for an &#34;at home&#34; comfort bra. Order your usual size."
3.0,"Thank god it didn't shrink in the dryer. Although it still fits &#34;snugly&#34; Wasnt worth returning the product, it is a $20 sweater, nothing too fancy. The whole dry wick system, we aren't a full believer in. Giving it three stars because they described it to be very heavy thread weight. Well, its not, its your normal run of the mill sweater, but for $20 maybe it will do for a NE fall. I will say this, this is the first sweater we've gotten with tags and packed nicely."
3.0,"The description stated there would be a bonus travel bag included, the reason I chose these particular muffs, to keep with my disabled child on her wheelchair.<br />Unfortunately,  I did NOT receive the bag, hence the reason for my 3 star rating"
3.0,"I like the style of the bag. As others said the opening feels a little small but it does state it’s a small messenger bag. The material is canvas. What makes me want to take it back is the photo is much different than the product. In the photo the blue is brighter and the strap is brown. In reality the bag is a darker muted blue and the strap is not brown but a lighter blue than the bag. It’s frustrating that the product is different than the picture. I wish I could get it with the brown straps, I would like it much better."
3.0,"I purchased these to complete my 4th of July outfit. Unfortunately the red is more like pink and unusable for the occasion. I  do however, like the quality of the earring."
3.0,Bigger then I expected
3.0,"Material was very thin, sleeves were a little shorter than usual. I usually wear a medium and that's what I got, but I should have gotten a large."
3.0,"The style was great, but the top part is way too small and wouldn't even cover my chest, is that small."
3.0,"Not a front pocket wallet, I figured the money clip would save space, but it doesn’t, this as bad as the George Castanza wallet from sienfeld with only 9 cards and 4 bills, love the idea of a convenient holder for the airtag, but I will have to keep looking"
3.0,"cute and good for the price but it’s super thin and gets caught on everything, bending it a lot. I wore it for a few weeks then took it off because it was snagging on everything and getting super annoying"
3.0,"It’s a nice cap, but is smaller in overall size than my other caps. I’m keeping it and giving to my grandson."
3.0,"It’s cute but my my most favorite fit!  I got it in green, I feel like a darker color would be better!"
3.0,Pretty band. You can tell the glitter won't easily wear off. The material (not leather) was highly uncomfortable for me. Had to go back.
3.0,It was a lot smaller than I thought. The clasp also breaks easily.
3.0,"It wasn't the same color as picture. It was a lot darker, almost black. I like the top just wish it had been the color in the picture."
3.0,Nothing wrong with it
3.0,"I bought these in blue and brown. I really like them as my go-to comfy summer outfit when I don't want to wear shorts. It's nice and loose and flowy. Probably my favorite thing is that there are no buttons on the straps and you can adjust the straps and tie them instead. It's great for us short ladies. The reason for my 3-star review? Well, one of the seams was completely open when they arrived, which I will have to fix. And it's not that the stitching became unraveled, the actual fabric was not cut properly so the fold I will have to make to repair them will be uneven. Also, the brown color faded a lot in the wash. I wash in cold with other dark colors, but it still happened."
3.0,"It's a good watch for the price, and does what it's supposed to do.  No frills, no &#34;atomic&#34; sync with WWV, just a watch like the one I wore decades ago.  I have two complaints that keep me from giving it five stars:<br />1) It's small, looking almost like a lady's watch.  I understand that everything electronic can be made tiny these days, but my wrist size hasn't changed all that much.  The watch is small enough not to sit snugly on my wrist<br /><br />(2) The LED light is completely worthless.  In the dark, I can't make out any of the digits"
3.0,It has a weird fit the sides  have 2 pieces that are hanging and look funny
3.0,It's a beautiful dress but can show crochet if you move wrong lol
3.0,If the sizes give were right the item would have gotten 5 stars. I don't like reordering because of someone else's mistake
3.0,"These are very small and skinny rings. Don't be mislead by the photos, which make them look bigger than they actually are. They are truly tiny. Not sure the price is fair for what you get. There are better deals for comparable size and quality."
3.0,The collar on these shirts is an uneven fit -- some seem stretched and sloppy and one or two might be good. Further washings will tell whether these are fit for public wear or just for backyard sweating!
3.0,To hard the material my skin get hurt
3.0,Pretty but the small fots like a med/large extra long
3.0,"Too small for my calves, couldn't get them zipped up, I bought XL seemed like a medium. The company was very understanding. I should mention, I have big feet/calves."
3.0,"SIZE UP!! I ordered a 13 for my niece who recently grew to a 13 in all her other shoes. She could get these on but barely. She complained her feet hurt within a few minutes. She would need to go up at least a full size, unfortunately they don't sell these in size 1 and up. That said, they seem to be very good quality, especially for the price point. The color is a vivid bubblegum pink, they were a bit brighter than I anticipated but I chalk that up to my screen and not the seller. I would 100% buy these again... In a larger size!"
3.0,Top isn't really wrap around. It is more of a crop top with ties at the bottom to pretend at being a wrap around. I'm normally a medium and it was a loose fit. Definitely not what I would call form fitting. Due to the way the top is made it fits a little strangely in places and you cannot really adjust the fit. Fabric seems nice. Not too thick or thin. Black was slightly see through. Not a bad top but I won't be buying again.
3.0,The material is heavy satin.
3.0,The quality of the product resonated after the first wash.  It looks and feels cheap.
3.0,The back locks and pin covers did not work.  Actual ear ring is of good construction.
3.0,"This is okay quality... you get what you pay for. That said, the elastic is very tightly woven, and all though it does stretch, its very snug and quite uncomfortable. The bow is only hot glued on, so i could see needing to reattach it in the future. If i had a much smaller waist and didn't need the belt to stretch as much as i do, i may have kept it. Unfortunately, i did return it."
3.0,"Super cute and breezy, love the pattern and color. Down fall: it’s not made correctly, there isn’t a second hole to tie the other string to, so it doesn’t make sense. Also the fit was great pre-wash- post wash...not so much. I wear a 16 in women’s pants- prior to washing it wrapped all the way around, coverage was great. After washing I have a huge gap around my upper thigh. Guess it’ll be a swim wrap now."
3.0,"Well made and lots of compliments, however, I believe this is 100% polyester and NOT 60% cotton as stated. It's very satiny/slick/shiny - feels good tho, just not when it's too hot. I do feel like $27 was way too much for this - like $10 too much."
3.0,Stretchy material. Did not fit
3.0,These are supposed to fit small adult faces but they too large on me and don't seal at all.
3.0,"This tunic/dress is lovely but it's too wide and too short. I had to pin the sides in the first time I wore it as a dress. Then after I wore it once, I washed it and air dried it. Then it became unreasonably short so now it has become a fall tunic to wear with leggings. To be fair, I am 5'7&#34; so it may suit shorter ladies. One other annoyance is the straps aren't adjustable."
3.0,"Love this bra, and the cup size. However, I found the bra was very short  from shoulder down. Even after straps were let all the way down the bra still sat too high. I ordered the 32b as I am smaller around, but it fit more like what I'd think a junior size would. Cute bra, and very comfortable otherwise. I was very disappointed though."
3.0,Looks really good. But the only problem is the band... gets always dark after few days<br />I bought 3 to check if wristband was something variable according w model but don’t<br />Is the only problem
3.0,Sleeves are weird and felt uncomfortable
3.0,Cute but one of them came damaged. They feel strong and sturdy which is a good thing but won’t be wearing them damaged
3.0,"These are very pretty, but don't stay on as well as other crawler earrings. I wore them twice before it broke."
3.0,It fits a little weird.
3.0,"Wow, first, the leather is pretty, it's a nice light color, stitched well but it reminds me of the tiny little wallets we used to get in grammar school that held a tiny comb.  I thought this would be good for me when i go to Conventions because I try to take a very small purse with me.  I tried it and can only put my drivers license and 3 other debit/credit cards in it before it gets tight and I didn't even get any bills folded to put in it.  I guess you have to choose if you want your license and a couple of bills or a couple of cards in there with it.  It is a very minimalist wallet.  I don't think it will work for my needs,  I like to have cash and cards in my wallet.  Oh well, this is for someone who doesn't carry much of that stuff."
3.0,"Only thing is I think the sizing might be off. the Size I got for my fiance' which should have fit him perfectly, is a little big. I have to figure out how to go about getting it sized now which is kind of a pain since I ordered this online. He loves the ring otherwise."
3.0,"The belt itself is constructed well and the color is true. The problem is I ordered a Medium (my husband has a 34&#34; waist) and the belt wrapped almost around to his back. I will be sending to exchange for a small, because he really liked the belt."
3.0,"This is a really nice shirt, but should be labeled as a golf shirt or other wicking-type of shirt because its too short to be a cycling jersey. I wear a size 12/L (sometimes XL) and ordered an XXL, which was still too small.<br /><br />If you do other activities and are looking for a good sweat management shirt, you will most likely be pleased."
3.0,"I am IN LOVE with this skirt!!!! Totalmente hermosa la minifalda! Dentro de ella tiene un short, en realidad es un short pollera lo que es aún mas increíble porque se puede perrear tranquila jajajaja<br />Wondering why only 3 stars? Because the zipper broke the second time I tried to use it, nothing I can't repair"
3.0,I like the fit however the material is alittle thin
3.0,A little snug but colors are great.
3.0,Straps are too short!
3.0,Little too polyesterish
3.0,Like them but there are see thru that's not what I wanted
3.0,Doesn't stay comfortably
3.0,Product is way to small.  I bought it for my wife but she couldn't wear.  I gave it to my oldest daughter (17 yrs old).  She couldn't wear.  I gave it to my youngest daughter (13) and she couldn't wear.  Now it's up in the closet waiting for Christmas so we can hopefully gift it to a relative that can wear it.
3.0,"Easy to assemble, but not a long-term investment."
3.0,"After reading reviews about the sizing, I originally ordered it 2 sizes larger -XL . When it came, the shorts fit great but the top was too big so I returned it and thought I ordered the L, when in fact i ordered the M. The top fits great, but the shorts are a lil snug. If I had the ability to just return the shorts for a larger size I would. My suggestion is to order a size up, 2 sizes is too much."
3.0,fabric is weird feeling.
3.0,"If you have a bigger bust, I don’t recommend getting this top. the material is not that great for the price to be honest. I’m usually a size M and I ordered a size L based on the reviews I saw and it still was super cropped, I could wear it if I wore a sports bra and didn’t make any movements with my arms"
3.0,"Hopefully, it will stretch out w/wear.  My head isn't that big LOL 7 1/2&#34;.  Feels like it would keep head warm in 30 degree temps - w/no wind."
3.0,Smaller fit than expected for my normal size. Looks cute just order up
3.0,"This item seems to ride up between my legs and is very uncomfortable. I'm returning it. However, if you're smaller sized in the thigh and behind area, it could be very cute!"
3.0,"I bought 2 for my 2 teens. One teen hated it, one teen loved it. The fur ball on the top is kinda heavy and creepy. the hat itself is cute. the ball on top can be cut off. colors are nice. they stretch nice and seem to snap back to shape fairly well."
3.0,"Adorable shrug!  Somewhat small, but glad I ordered a size up....  Receiving compliments!  Color is fantastic!<br />Maria P., Mamaroneck, NY"
3.0,"Very tight squeeze... I normally wear a size 8. I ordered an 8.5, and wound up giving them to my daughter, who wears a size 7 - she fits in them fine."
3.0,"One earring arrived wrinkled, not sure if it will straighten out with time. These are NOT double-sided, which was disappointing. Backs are white or tan."
3.0,not as small as described  doesn't fit in childs pocket
3.0,"so the material is comfortable and thick, it fits perfectly, it doesn't stink like a fabric one. those are the high points<br /><br />the lows is that it is so thick and stiff and a straight line that when the hold down straps come lose you end up with a tangent line sticking out from your wrist that hits EVERYTHING. there is nothing that holds the extra watch band straps in place so they are always falling away and this thing is ANNOYING when the extra band is sticking out. i would not buy this again and i am replacing it for this reason alone, it is that frustrating"
3.0,"It turned my arm red, but it is pretty"
3.0,if you have the perfect figure these would be great.  they are adorable. but really short
3.0,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting a lot from these for the price! They're really cute and very, very light. I like how they look and the style and I love the blue lenses. But after wearing once (in the car and then folded and put into my car's sunglasses compartment) I noticed that they felt weird when I put them back on. When I looked at them I realized that the screw on the inside right lens was very loose. I needed tweezers to tighten the tiny little guy and they were still a little loose (the other end doesn't have anything to anchor so when it gets to a certain tightness, there's not enough torque to tighten any more). I can still wear them but I have to tighten that one screw constantly. I think just opening and closing the arms is enough to jiggle the glasses so that the screw comes loose. However, these aren't RB or O sunglasses nor are they priced that way, and I certainly wasn't expecting 10 years of wear! Oddly, I might even buy them again for the price because they're so cute... perhaps I just got a bum pair and the loose screw isn't always a problem (the other screw hasn't come loose, so who knows!)...<br /><br />Bottom line? Pro: Very cute style, very lightweight and comfortable.<br />Con: delicate and quality control is about what you'd expect for the price ;)"
3.0,I get a lot of compliments on the necklace
3.0,"Loses a thread or two, but not bad for the price.  I've recieved compliments for it, so I suppose that's validation enough."
3.0,"La cámara es mala, la calidad de la imagen es muy pobre."
3.0,"Face plate and hand are not the same color, band is more rose gold.  It’s okay for everyday wear."
3.0,This is a really cute swimsuit but for the size it runs really small
3.0,I like the but it was too large and I decided I didn't need it so I sent it back. But the color was beautiful
3.0,"Very pretty pendant but not good quality. Broke in 2 different places the first few days I wore it. I spent about $25 on another necklace which is great quality, not a lot more than this. The design is great not quality. Wouldn't recommend."
3.0,"Item arrived as promised. However, immediately I wore the jacket, the front button promptly fell off! Also, as many others have already pointed out, the lining makes an annoying sound as you walk around."
3.0,The fit fun but don't lay fine
3.0,"Outfit was cute, but way too small for me."
3.0,"I can't say it's terrible, can't say it's amazing. I bought this to see if my husband and I could figure out how to tie a bow tie....we cannot there is not enough YouTube on the internet to help us. I do not think it's of epic quality as ours has never been worn for any amount Of time and it is obvious to me that the edges don't match. I didn't care cause that was not our purpose. I think it's a fine beginner bow tie to learn on. No harm no foul"
3.0,"It is really cute, but after wearing it a few hours one of the curls between the flowers fell apart."
3.0,Liked the material it is made from. Did not realized the design was not for me
3.0,"love how cute they are but the lenses are terrible to see out of, but i don't like the brown lenses so it may be just me.."
3.0,Very pretty but I didn’t care for how it fit
3.0,It's a little loose at waist. Made very cheaply but it's a $12 top... so to be expected.
3.0,A little bit asymmetrical.
3.0,"Very noticeable. The ball on the end is huge, so if you are trying to use this for work it’s noticeable"
3.0,"These short are made of good material and fit rather well but because I have very thick thighs,a round butt I ordered a size 3x,but after receiving them I found I only need a 2x."
3.0,These glasses were huge. They fit my head but the frames and lenses were way bigger than I thought.
3.0,"Super cute pattern but the neckline is completely different and almost straight across. The darts are horizontal, not vertical. The material is stretchy polyester which normally would be fine but not with this dress. I was hoping for a stiffer material. The dress itself has potential. Size up 1 size."
3.0,I like the red sequin but the pants do not look like the photo. The fit is loose and the pants are as fashionable as the picture.
3.0,Really nice dress but thin cheap material and a little shapeless in the back...needs a couple of darts.  If it was a little heavier it would be great! But I can still wear it and it looks nice.
3.0,"I got this very oversized to wear it as a nightshirt. I'm not particularly crazy about the material...it's kind of that slightly shiny polyester and is thin. It's not opaque (I got the light blue with stars), maybe the darker colors are better in their opacity. The fit is fine and the garment seems to be well made. The pockets are big enough for my iPhone. This will work for my purpose, but I'm glad I didn't get it to wear as a dress outside the house."
3.0,Still need to ware it to the veach
3.0,"I love the style, color, fit, and how flowy it is, however I do not love the fabric. It reminds me of the thin, cheap kind they use for basic Halloween costumes. That's probably how they make it so light weight. I would recommend wearing a cami  under it as the material is very thin and not good for cold weather."
3.0,"Nice Cufflinks the only problem I saw, the cufflinks are to small in size your web photo make them appear larger than they are. It would have been nicer if the cufflinks were larger"
3.0,Fell apart after one wear but I guess that was expected with the price. I was able to fix it and added some super glue to some of the pieces so hopefully keep it together better.
3.0,"This sweatshirt is nice and well made, but I ordered a medium and it was huge.  I had to return it."
3.0,...nice shirt but just too small for the size I always order L
3.0,"It's a very warm jacket for the New York winters, but the sleeves are too short. Also, the stitches are not that great, can rip off easily."
3.0,I would like to have a bra
3.0,"I took my ring to an independent appraiser who indicated it tested as Aquamarine.  Aquamarines and Morganites are both Beryls, but the appraised valued is under $500.  Much less than indicated. Appearance of ring is very clear and it is a beautiful stone - just not what was indicated originally."
3.0,"It was gift to self, but too small. Disappointed!"
3.0,Not quite long enough. It is 28&#34; and 32&#34; would be better.
3.0,It’s way too small and you can see through
3.0,The outfit was well overall. The wrinkles are the only problem.
3.0,This belt is really pretty and should hold up well but it doesn't fasten so tends to fall off while being worn.
3.0,The fabric looks cheap
3.0,"Beautiful charm, but after only having it for two weeks, the part that goes on the actual bracelet is already turning to a copper color"
3.0,"This shirt is comfortable, stretchy, and as pictured cosmetically. It arrived quickly, was offered at a very fair price, and I'm happy with my purchase.<br /><br />My one complaint is that after it's first wash, the seams behind the left sleeve began to separate. With a few stitches it was good as new, but this wasn't something I expected from a new shirt."
3.0,"The design and color is nice, true to size, however I am not a fan of the polyester material. It really looks like pajamas.<br />100% cotton or rayon is much better for a MuuMuu.  I will use it for a painting smock as it is easy to clean."
3.0,The fabric is icky quality.
3.0,Costume jewelry just to add to an outfit
3.0,This was the only thing out of all the allegra k stuff that was a little small but it still looks nice just a little too tight on boobs and stomach but my husband liked it
3.0,The gloves were definitely good gloves for gardening but the extra pieces on the fingers were just in the way. Just buy regular garden gloves.
3.0,For the most part it was nice although there were definitely threads that were loose and the mask was well….uneven. We bought a different mask that worked much better. Wish the shipping had been more accurate/faster but I guess that’s what happens when you purchase something from overseas.
3.0,"Body fit fine, but sleeves were way too large, both for me and for the body. This would explain why they don't ask you for your arm circumference measurements."
3.0,Like the fit. Top is a little too thick very hot. Bottoms are too thin. Can see through them
3.0,They're very pretty but so far I haven't worn them.  I can't get the strangely designed hook into my ear lobe. My son couldn't do it for me either.
3.0,"Band strap is stiff and not very comfortable.  I have medium size wrist (6 3/4"") but did not like how band fit me.<br />Customer service said they will refund me and I will not have to return band.  I am still waiting for refund after 3 1/2 weeks."
3.0,It is not a 2x. It fits like a 1x in the arms and chest.
3.0,"too stiff, hurt my feet, sent back"
3.0,"The eye wholes are too small and overall, this mask isn't built for people with wide set faces or big heads all together. It's also itchy"
3.0,Comfy but not sure what was up with the fabric.  I wore them for a summer and the butt tore along the pocket stitching.  I do not keep a lot in my pockets and all I can figure is the cloth was maybe over dyed which can make the cloth fragile
3.0,"I bought these mainly b/c of the color/pattern (tie dye black with fuchsia and cream). 5 STARS for color.  I was hesitant to order them after reading the reviews about them being ""shiny"". They do have a dull shine but you can't really tell by looking at them. For the material these are made of they are pretty comfortable, they are soft inside (I haven't worked out in them yet though). I am usually a small in Athleta/Lululemon but I ordered a medium in these b/c of the reviews saying to size up. I agree the waistband fits tighter than the rest of the pants so the medium works for me (waistband fits comfortably), I do wish they had a little more compression throughout the rest of the legging. I'm 5'2 so they are long but that's no surprise when ordering a regular length legging."
3.0,"I like the product it feels like it is quality, but based on the sizing scale they run large."
3.0,Order up two sizes
3.0,"After a few uses I decreased the rating and here is why:<br /><br />- the nose part is hard plastic and not adjustable. It pushes into my nose bridge and really hurts. If you have a not so tiny nose, this may not be a good choice<br /><br />-the back portion occasionally comes undone."
3.0,It's ok. Fits a bit large. If u are going to buy it order a different belt/sash<br /> It is no like pictured. It is very thin and rolls up. Plenty long enough and is semi flattering. Would look much much better on a woman with a larger chest. I am a bigger girl but I have small boobs. I will be wearing a thicker bra. It gives me a very flat appearance. But nice for the price.
3.0,"These are rather plain. From the photo, I expected something with a bit of sparkle but they are just printed and plain. Disappointed"
3.0,nice shoe but is not true to size.  It is not a wide like it says.  Don't order if you need it to actually be wide.
3.0,"Beautiful, but the wires are so thick they hurt to wear. Too bad because they really are beautiful."
3.0,"I ordered the black, royal blue and white hat. The black and blue are fine but the white hat came with a smudge on it. Not big but noticeable."
3.0,"Soft material. Clingy if you're not careful. The dress that came in was not the same colors as the pictures. There is blue in the design which I was not expecting and wasn't super happy about. The straps are thick, not thin like the shown. Overall, it's okay."
3.0,Tela mala caludad y muy sencillo
3.0,Pretty shirt but I didn’t like the material of the shirt and I also didn’t like the cut of the shirt around the arms. They brought the seam from the shoulders to mid bicep which I didn’t like the feeling of it on my arms.
3.0,Very nice fitting. Only cons are the zipper is made with cheap material and the outfit is a little thin. I have had several times where I had to refeed the zipper back together. Otherwise this is a cute outfit.
3.0,They are very pretty but a bit smaller then expected
3.0,"The back is flat, and thin"
3.0,These are tiny and work better as a cute cap than a snood. I should have kept looking.
3.0,This was pretty but way to long on the neck for a choker
3.0,"I bought this as a running shirt since I'm tired of cotton shirts that get heavy and clingy from sweat.<br /><br />Fit<br />I'm a slim 5'5&#34; and the small that I received is like a medium or large in other brands. The shoulder seams hit about 2 cm farther out than most of my other size small shirts, and the sleeves are long to begin with so they drape nearly to my elbows. The torso is several cm larger in diameter than most size small shirts, although the length is about the same. The collar is loose fitting, unlike some other polyester shirts with tight collars.<br /><br />Feel and Wicking<br />Fit aside, the shirt is pretty comfortable. When it's dry, the relatively thin and lightweight material is soft to the touch. When it gets wet, it remains relatively soft and for the most part, doesn't cling to skin. It doesn't wick as well as some &#34;high performance&#34; fabrics, perhaps in part because of the loose fit on my body, but it works sufficiently well that sweat doesn't drip down my body.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />I bought this along with a couple of other similar inexpensive shirts by other brands to compare. The Agusta Sportswear polyester shirt tops the (short) list of shirts that I bought. It has uses heavier fabric, has better wicking and fit, but it also has a tighter collar. If you prefer a loose collar or overall fit, this isn't a bad shirt, but in the future I don't plan on purchasing more of these because they just don't fit my body as well as I'd like."
3.0,They run super small. I got my size and they were a size to small. The large is more a medium.
3.0,"Got here on time. Pretty. It is cheaply made, so becareful trying to bend it to fit your ear."
3.0,"This outfit is very cute and breathable.  However, I ordered the 0-3 months outfit and it was far too large. It seems maybe it would be a better fit for a 6 month old. Furthermore, I could have been sent a larger size by mistake but I wouldn't know for sure because the size isn't labeled on the clothing."
3.0,I knew these would be tight so I purposely bought a size up. Still tight.
3.0,Catches on everything
3.0,Fog up but work fine.
3.0,"It's not that the boots are too small, it's that you can't get your foot into them without unbuckling them EVERY TIME.<br />Ain't nobody got time for that! There's no elastic even. I don't know about ya'll but it's not easy for me to buckle and unbuckle all the time."
3.0,Fabric is soft. Waist is very small.
3.0,Kind of narrow fits like s/m instead of l/xl
3.0,"Bought the 3-6 for my about to turn 6yr old who weighs 50lbs and is almost 4ft and these hit her mid calf if pulled up tight there few inches under knee between knee & calf but they don’t stay up for long, the foot part fit prefect but no room to grow they are very cute and nice thickness"
3.0,The collar didnt fit like the rest of the jacket. It was very loose. The sleeves and chest fit pretty well though. It has a great look and feel to it but im just very picky. All in all not bad for the price
3.0,"Mixed feelings on these - 3 of 20 were flawed, but seller responded satisfactorily.  Loved the ones that were not flawed."
3.0,The bra is a good bra I gave it 1 star because I bought these specifically to hold my phone while running!!!!!!
3.0,"its super cute if it didn't have the white part on top, kind of looks goofy with the white."
3.0,The cup is unattached and bunches up every time I wash it.  It is a hassle to unfold between the front and back fabrics.  There is a small hole but only one finger will fit.  I would rather have attached padding.  The fit however is nice and comfortable.
3.0,It’s cute but I’m not sure how much it’s creating a barrier between me and the next person. I’ll probably wear more in an “outdoor” outing with social distancing vs an indoor situation.
3.0,MUCH bigger than I expected. They are not good for sensitive ears.
3.0,tbin material
3.0,"The shirt was nice, but size was smaller than had expected and super thin, almost see-through."
3.0,"Looks fun, get bigger if available if your head is bigger.  MY head is small, and it worked, but it does not look as long as on the photograph"
3.0,He wears it for extra warmth on those colder nights and mornings.
3.0,Love this product when it first came!! But I had it for about 2months and the dangling jewels fell off. It took the ring itself a long time to tarnish though.
3.0,"I did follow the size chart and knew I would either fit into the biggest size or not fit at all. There weren't enough pics in the reviews to help me gauge my decision. So I took a leap of faith considering I have been looking high and low for a brown sweats matching set for so long. When it arrived, I could tell it would be super snug. They even shipped it in a vacuum sealed bag (which made it hard for me to put it back into the bag btw). The color was beautiful. It complimented my skin so well. The cut/shape of the outfit really brought out my natural curves. I sent pics of this outfit on me to my friends and they all felt like it looked great on me. The problem was that it was too snug... If I tried to raise my arm to shoulder height or higher, the crop top raised up too much... it looked like a bralette. Mind you, I wasn't wearing a bra when trying this on. So it would be worse if I had a bra on. Also I felt like the pants hugged me too well while standing up that if I were to bend or sit down, I couldn't guarantee that the pants wouldn't come down too far (although it didn't in the little instances I tried while in my room at home). Even the hoodie was too snug on my head without me using the drawstring. So that was the final deal breaker for me to return it. It broke my heart to let this set go. I really wanted to keep it! I feel like if I was just a few pounds lighter, I would've kept it. But I, personally, feel like I'm at that very thin borderline of it fitting/not-fitting. <br /><br />I took the pics at night but wanted to show the true color of the sweats so I took more pics when it was back in its vacuum bag in the daytime. Clearly, it is not the same brown as the model at all, but I still loved the shade regardless.<br /><br />Here are my current measurements:<br />Weight: approximately 197 lb.<br />Bra size: 38D<br />Height: 5 ft 4.75""<br />Waist: 38.5""<br />Lower belly (over the belly button): 40.75""<br />Hips: 46.25"""
3.0,"Nice looking socks, but they will not fit"
3.0,No pictures please
3.0,"I like the fabric a lot. I am 125 lbs, 5'3&quot;, 34DD, ordered an xl.  This fit more like a large. I did look at the size chart, but it was just too large. Having to return."
3.0,I ordered this dress for my birthday it fits well but it was a little itchy it’s not the softest fabric out there but if you want something to wear for one time it’s not a bad deal !!!
3.0,Bends a bit to easy for my tastes. They do work though.
3.0,Much brighter pink than photo. Smaller in size than expected.
3.0,Sleeves abnormally long and waist band tight.
3.0,Is really good product but the material is so thiny for that part needs get better confection
3.0,Nice fit but they all came apart at the seams within just a few times of wearing.  Wont buy again
3.0,I ordered what should have been a good fit but they were way too tight to even get on a foot.  Returning them.
3.0,"The material is great, as is the design. The length was way to short. This item is a nice shirt. I wear a large i purchased a xxl."
3.0,I start to get a headache after one hour of wear...Too tight even after max. adjustment.
3.0,"The shirts themselves are great - love them and have ordered them a few times, but the white one arrived with a giant stain from being wrapped up with the red one, so I had to deduct two stars since that one is ruined."
3.0,I love the big beautiful sunflower. I ordered a Medium which is what I usually wear in tank tops but there is no stretch with these shirts at all they are cut smaller than usual.
3.0,". Finally American sizes.  Thick and very warm. They wash well, but to prevent fading, I hang dry.  They dry fairly quick too. Unfortunately, they don’t fit well when I’m actively walking.  They sag down in my crouch area causing an uncomfortable feeling.  However, they’re thick and warm, but something is odd about the waist and fit,"
3.0,"Very good quality, but its a lot smaller than I expected.  My daughter has a longer torso, so I got one I thought would fit for a few months but its pretty tight."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this wallet, but the slots where the CC's go are very tight and make it difficult to use. On a plus side, lots of room and feels well made."
3.0,I like the boho look. I put it on and the watch didn't work.
3.0,I have to exchange for a small.
3.0,It's nice shirt but it's to big for my grandson who wears a 5T. He is a small guy but 5T always fits.
3.0,"The skirt was a lovely length, a fun color and would be a cute fit if the skirt didn’t run much too small."
3.0,"I had this beautiful pin before & it was super glittery.  This one is just black & white, no glitter.  :/ still cute tho.  I just liked the glitter."
3.0,I am going to give this jacket to my daughter-in-law.  I am sure she will enjoy it.
3.0,"I like the colour, but the top is too big and the rushing makes my top look bigger (some might like that!) I moved the straps to make them crossover rather than over the shoulder and that looks better.  Nice length and I will still wear it."
3.0,"It is perfect for what I'm using it for, however, I just saw the same exact thing at the dollar store for less than half the price."
3.0,The lace does not match the chain in color as it does in the picture.  It makes it look a little tacky.
3.0,"While these are very comfortable and cute, I hardly consider them to be “grey.” More like brown or taupe. But still cute and comfy enough to keep."
3.0,Good quality but it the size L (6-8) is too small for my very petite 6 y.o.
3.0,it's pretty and people thought it was real. but one small jewel fell out after a couple weeks.
3.0,"It was too small for the size they gave. Also, hems are not finished, just sergered. Very, very cheap, flimsily fabric."
3.0,The tag is cracked in 2 places
3.0,I like the bag but the strap is not long enough to be a crossbody bag. The picture makes it look like it as a long strap.
3.0,the front bubbles and makes the tummy area look bigger than it is.
3.0,"So these shoes do fit. I am a size 12W and ordered a 14 (size up!!) However, the arch in them feels too high for me, so I’ll be returning. The band across the fit seems large, but once it’s on, it’s good. The band across the toes is fine, too. It’s literally just the arch making it uncomfortable for me. Overall a cute shoe, but definitely size up from your size and size up twice for wide feet."
3.0,it looks good and hasn't turned color so far but it is most definitely not stainless steel...
3.0,Very beautiful once you put it on! Very worth the price!
3.0,The rings look really pretty and stuff but the flower one broke right off the bat the day I got it! That was my favorite one! Just disappointed but the other two are nice
3.0,"I order the dress in the CORAL color, upon receiving it I was disappointed to pull out a pink dress. Think bubblegum pink, or barbie pink!"
3.0,Fabric flimsy un attractive
3.0,"I needed a one-piece swimsuit to cover my stomach pooch, so I thought this simple V-neck black piece would be flattering. It's comfortable, and the spandex material and thickness are fine, but the V-neck coverage is way too wide and looks awkward (at least on me). I'm constantly worried about ""spillage"" and accidentally flashing people while swimming (the strap is adjustable, so I made sure to make it short and tight), but then again, I have small boobs, so it could just be me. Other areas fit fine, and I like that there's removable padding and decent coverage of my butt, but it's not the most flattering shape. I'll continue to wear it, but maybe only on occasions when I'm not too active. Mainly, I just wish the V-neck wasn't so wide."
3.0,Slightly thin material shows every bump underneath.
3.0,"Cute, a little stiff and has a weird chemical smell.  Hope both go away once washed."
3.0,It was the right size but the snap in front wouldn't stay closed.
3.0,"It would be a very nice shirt if not for the quality of construction (or, rather, lack thereof). It looks like it was sewn by a lazy beginner in a home-ec class. Loose threads everywhere, the pattern and the topstitching don't align, the seams may not last long. It is a shame, because the fabric is nice and lightweight, and the print is cute."
3.0,"I bought these shoes for work. They are true to size but there's no arch support.  Also, within the first 20 minutes at work with them, the front of the left shoes separated from leather and rubber. Not to mention, there's a hideous chemical-rubber smell to them, that although I let them air out for 4 days before wearing them, they still emit a very strong smell. The smell gets worse and  more obvious when worn and as your feet start to sweat inside of the shoe.  The smell is obvious to you and those around you as well. How embarrassing!!! ...I Regret having bought a 2nd pair moments after receiving the 1st pair just on looks alone, not aware of the long lasting chemical-rubber stench the shoes emit. :("
3.0,"Very basic quality. Too large for my face, but a friend say they look good on me."
3.0,Mediocre product not terrible but not great
3.0,It’s too small and I ordered 3 different ones and couldn’t afford the cost of returning them so I kept them
3.0,"Looks good, but as most staff made in chana too short for man size. Tool for strap is OK."
3.0,"I purchased these for my Husband, he likes them."
3.0,"I like the smell, they're real. They don't fit, the fingers are too short, the thumb is restricted and they barely stay on!<br />I bought XXL, instead of L, incase they were a bit snug. Men's M is too big, so these (supposedly) Women's XXLs should fit, or be roomy!!!"
3.0,"the plum is a much deeper purple than pictured, which I liked. They are also super soft, and fit well. Pockets are great and I like the zipper. but while overseas, I realized there was a dine-sized hole in the crotch! wasn't that big of a deal, since it didn't get any bigger, but definitely not great. I usually wear pants 27-28 and  got a Medium."
3.0,Looked cute in my bridesmaid but broke but the still looked cute !!
3.0,"Build quality was on par with $12 sunglasses. Earpieces rattled and required a dab of superglue to stay in place. Advertised as unisex, but the temples are extremely narrow - not really ideal for anyone with a noggin larger than a Texas grapefruit."
3.0,"Horrible Packaging on the case, the piece of cardboard was held together with rubber bands and a piece of strapping. The ends of the case were poking out."
3.0,"I'm keeping the dress even though it's a bit small.  Incentive to take off at least 10lbs.<br />Oops, I can't submit this review unless I add at least three words...Here they are....YOUR THREE WORDS."
3.0,"My husband likes the color, but the fit is more snug than he likes."
3.0,It was huge and I could not wear it. The material is thin. It would be beautiful if it was smaller.
3.0,"Really fun & sexy. Unfortunately mine broke within hours of putting it on, while I wasn't even moving around. It could've gotten snagged on something maybe, & just came apart later? Idk, but I was really bummed cuz I liked it a lot."
3.0,"Love it, but the fabric is kind of sheer."
3.0,Washed it a few times and still feel slippery also it's not as thick as I had hoped it would be.
3.0,"It's OK.  It looks cute, but the Credit card slots appear to be glued. This causes some of the slots to be glued together and some of the slots are deeper than others so your cards get stuck behind others."
3.0,The purse was not deep enough to fit my cell phone which is why I purchased it. The inside material was cheaply made.
3.0,"Runs small, order a size larger for the look on the picture....material was thin so hugs to the body a lot!"
3.0,"Not polarized, nice glasses though"
3.0,It fits as it is supposed to. The thing I don't like is the way is is in the stomach area.
3.0,"Interestingly, this looks better in the picture.  The front is not as graduated as it shows on me and it seems to be very short in the front and then about the right length in the back.  I am not sure if I am going to keep it. The red is also orange red vs what I see as a dark red here."
3.0,I love the print on this shirt but I already ordered a size bigger and it was still too small. And it wrinkles so easily!
3.0,The product looks good in pictures but when it arrived it had a bunch of things like string all over the place. It was way to small for me
3.0,Ordered for a gift. Did not receive the patterns selected. Seems cheaply made fleece material.
3.0,El polo tenía jalones
3.0,Love the small sole.<br />I ordered xl was only size 10.
3.0,Pretty but Too small
3.0,It is not as long as pictured and I am only 5'.  It is more wide than long so not sure if it can be used as a short dress.  The sleeves are tighter from wrist to below elbow hmmm.  I will either make it work or give it away.  It is nice color/print.
3.0,"it has a metal that keeps the V shape but its super straight so it sticks out in a very weird way. If you bend it to fit the contour of your chest it might work. I ordered the blue and also in red. ist not bad, the material its not super thick nor super thin and its a bit short but I do not mind it bc its me that i am on the heavier side. i think it looks good!"
3.0,Is too high waist  but comfy
3.0,I love the fit and feel of the leggings but the fabric dyes your legs and any light colored surfaces you sit on blue!!
3.0,"This is a cover up so it's meant to be loose and flowy. I am a small person, 5' 100lbs, and it was just too big to look good. Plus the material was SUPER sheer, to the point where I would feel like i shouldn't even bother wearing a cover up. If you are taller than me and don't care that you can see right through it (especially if it gets wet!), it will be a cute thing to throw over your suit. I personally returned it. Buy at your discretion."
3.0,"It’s a cute outfit but it ripped without me even wearing it. It’s flattering from the front but doesn’t do much for the side view. The band really should go all the way to the stomach for a more flattering fit. Kinda makes you seem like you have a pudge even if you don’t b/c the rest of the material is stretchy and the waist band a bit rigid. Seamless underwear is best or your panty line will be apparent. It’s not sheer though.I wore it to the gym after I sewed the hole up and it did a decent job wicking away sweat . Not worth it full priced. If I hadn’t gotten it half price it would be going back. It will be for my light active days. I wear size M in regular clothing and typically a 7,9 in pants. I got a M in this as well. Bra size: 32DDD"
3.0,So I’m 5’11” and it’s really short in length. It’s super soft and would be great on a warm day. A flaw is that it is very then and shows everything underneath it. I got the largest size and it’s still tight in my chest area.
3.0,I LOVED wearing these and got many compliments....but they broke after a few times of wearing :(
3.0,Very cute earrings but pearl came off after wearing 2 or 3 times.  Very disappointed.
3.0,"It's nice and goes along with my other new ones but I noticed 2 kinks in it that I don't remember being there. Overall,  it's a very cute piece added to my collection."
3.0,"These bras were way too small for me. Not sure what size I would have needed, but a 2X did not fit at all. Had to return them. *S*"
3.0,"I'm very disappointed in this umbrella. It looked so cute for a trip abroud with the bright blue clouds, but its only pretty on the inside! Outside is ugly shiny plastic looking black! Also seems much thicker and less lightweight than I expected. Have to decide if worth sending back."
3.0,"Ive only wiped my glasses with these a few times as if now, but i haven't noticed a difference. My glasses still fog. Not sure if i need to rub the lenses alil for longer or just use a few more times. It definitely cleans the lense well though!"
3.0,"Product was ok, looks a little cheap in my opinion."
3.0,"It runs big. It was just a hassle returning the item, since it was not amazon prime! Beautiful and good quality though!"
3.0,The color is not like the picture. My daughter was so excited to get this and wear for her birthday but the color is much darker than expected and back straps are way too big. If you want to return it they charge you 10 dollars.
3.0,The colors are great. I am trying to figure out what colors work the best for migraine and headache relief.<br />The shape is a little oddly shaped and the edges are a little rough. It could be a bit smoother.
3.0,"When these earrings arrived in the mail one of the earrings was bent. The silver was thin enough for me to bend it back into its proper position, but also thick enough silver not to break when I did so. Since I was able to fix it on my own, I was able to give them to my boyfriend's daughter as she had them on her amazon wish list. I would have hated to send them back for exchange seeing as they only cost me $10."
3.0,The jean top is too long. I'm hoping it looks better on my daughter next Fall.
3.0,"Love the facemask but having a hard time breathing since it basically gets sucked into your mouth when breathing in, I assume due to the fact that its polyester"
3.0,"This is a decent overcoat that provides good insulation from the cold. My coat arrived missing a button, so I had to sew one on myself. It's also really large in the shoulders and waist, and is pretty long. You might want to tailor yours."
3.0,The material is too thin not very good
3.0,"Its a bit toasty for sub tropical climes, will be fine on an occasional cold front Winter nights. Not a beach hat!"
3.0,"While this is really pretty, fits pretty well, & Is comfy...it is made awkwardly. Took me awhile to figure out how the straps go to get it on. Will be a pain to get on & off to use restroom etc."
3.0,"Top fit perfectly, but bottoms are too snug"
3.0,Really wanted to love these earrings but they are annoying as they keep rotating and end upside down no matter how tight I make them. They are also very small.
3.0,Super small for a Large size. I'm afraid to wash them lol
3.0,"A little large, and a little cheaper/flimsier than expected...certainly not the quality of the last set I purchased for about $6 per pair, but not so bad overall."
3.0,"Very cute, but they took a really long time to arrive & are  really small. My child is just going into a size 8 and these were wayy too small. I would return for a bigger size but I know it'll take forever and it ships from China."
3.0,Me quedó muy grande
3.0,"Too small, it might fit a child only."
3.0,"The cover itself is fine. The words are a sticker which is stuck on top. It does not appear to be particularly waterproof, as it appears to be a mostly paper sticker. For the price, I expected a higher quality waterproof sticker/ paint. We will have to see how this holds up to weather and car washing."
3.0,The dress is very nice and the material is great but it is the embroidery that is the problem. When ever I wear it it becomes very uncomfortable soon since the embroidery keeps on poking. I wish they had put a layer of cloth on top of the embroidery or used a softer thread.
3.0,I bought 3 I shared one with my landlord as a gift. My face is small. It didn’t fit me.
3.0,"Fit just a little smaller than I expected, especially in the bust.  The straps looked comfy in the photo b/c they're wide, but they're actually very uncomfortable.  When I adjusted the straps so the bust was up where it should be, the arm pit holes were cutting into my underarms.  Fabric is very thin, too"
3.0,Does not hold as many accessories as thought
3.0,"Bought for wife, she said: bra looks nice but very little support for d cup. Not ideal for large busts."
3.0,"While these do look super cool, the stud that goes through the hole in my ear is far to large."
3.0,"I ordered blue.  4 out of the five were blue/red the other one was black/ red  therefore one individual was not able to wear the bow.  Also, the pin came off the back of my bow.  I had to secure it with safety pins."
3.0,"I have bought this before in department stores and always wore a size &#34;Large&#34;.<br />However, these are huge.  Going back.  The upper arm sleve is enormous.<br />The shirt is nice and appears to be good quality, however, now I am out the shipping and return shipping costs."
3.0,They're pretty tiny but dont fall off too easy they do stay on but look kinda dangly
3.0,The bracelet was smaller than I expected but still was beautiful until it turned my wrist green.
3.0,Unfortunately it didn’t open wise enough for the visors in any of the cars I bought them for.
3.0,"The photo used in listing is deceptive and should be removed. The material is not flexible as pictured. Also, the lenses are not as clear as shown but very yellow. (Some blue light filtering lenses are yellow, but should also be pictured that way.) Quality product, just not as expected."
3.0,I got these for my team to wear in the memorial for a team members spouse.  They were understated yet noticeable but  you can hardly see one of the white lines of the tennis ball. Looks mostly just Like a green stone…
3.0,It Shrunk when I washed it…
3.0,The sleeves were a little tight and the back strap was uneven.
3.0,Great item son likes it .... just the material he wasn’t to crazy about it like a sports shirt material silky feeling /polyester but he likes the fit 👍
3.0,"Its,huge. The cowl neck is half as big as the sweater its self. It doesnt  sit off the  shoulders.  It goes down to my knees. The material is scratchy. Doesnt feel very warm"
3.0,"Fit great, super comfy and flattering BUT it had a hole in it, looks like from a snag during packaging maybe? I ordered a replacement so we will see how that one turns out. I'm 5'4 size 12/14 wider in the hips and thighs for reference"
3.0,I thought it would have a change compartment in it
3.0,"A little too long and too tight around the bottom, but comfy to lye around in if you don't have to move around much.  I have to lift the front a little when I walk or it trips me up. Also hand to dry,  do not dry in dryer."
3.0,Not as long as in the picture. Comes to about wear her bra strap ends
3.0,it was ok .
3.0,"Drawbacks<br />They are very very delicate<br />The clasp is hard to open. I was fine with that, but 3 of them ended up having the clasp on the wrong end, making it nonadjustable and too tight ( show in picture).  I plan on fixing them myself.<br />They keep shifting around the neck.<br />For those who haven't really paid attention to the bow like choker, it is actually a thin long piece of material, which you gotta tie around your neck and make a bow with.<br />Don't know how long they will last.<br /><br />Advantages<br />For the given price, they are apt.<br />They are not very tight on the neck, and you don't really feel like you are wearing one.<br />They are cute! and you have got yourself the choker you want at a good price."
3.0,good but size is not the same a bit small
3.0,L9ve love love the colors; purse closure broke after very light use!
3.0,Were way too large in danger of falling
3.0,We bought these for a football game luckily the football game was warmer than expected because they were really tight for an adult
3.0,"This is a cute dress, great color and hangs well to flatter the body. However, the material is super thin so you definitely have to wear a slip or something under it without it being totally see thru."
3.0,The dress just fits a big smaller than what the size indicates.
3.0,I dont like i return it
3.0,Too big for my 1 year old. Hoping she grows into them soon.
3.0,I love the suit but it was too small. I looked at the size chart but it clearly doesn't match what you get.
3.0,Way bigger than size i picked but nice item good price
3.0,"I liked that it tuned to a bag, but too pricey and when I washed it it got a lot of lint balls, I thought it would have been better quality for such a pricey sweater"
3.0,"Great fit, beautiful, comfortable, nice material , loved was going to buy another but the dress was doing something weird where the seatbelt rubs.that's why I gave it a 3 because it made that area appear worn."
3.0,They do not fit my feet tight; they are very loose at the top.
3.0,Comfortable but not pockets.
3.0,Looks super cute. Ordered for one-time wear which was perfect for the quality. Only problem was the dress kept riding up and had to be constantly pulled down
3.0,the color is beautiful I love the neckline and the way it drapes BUT there is NO lining at all in the cups it's mesh nothing else!
3.0,I went on a buying spree lately for winter stuff. Got a sweatshirt from LL Bean and this Russell at Amazon. The Bean is a lot better. Just softer and fits easy and smooth they way it drapes on the body.. The Russell feels stiffer (I did wash it) and just a bit less draped. (I know there is a better word than draped for the way a garment hangs on you but I can't think of it now) Not sure what's up with that. It's fine for a bang around sweatshirt but next time I buy I get another Bean.
3.0,"These pants are pretty comfortable to wear, but they are so thin I don't think I would wear them outside of the house. You can see through them pretty easily.  I almost feel like these would be a good pair of pants for the beach, where you would want to cover but not necessarily care if you can see through it.  The material is pretty soft, but not the softest ever.  I noticed it said one size fits all, but it considers all to be from XS-M, so note that if you would wear a larger size than that.  The waist does stretch, but it clings tightly once on, which I imagine would not feel comfortable if you needed a larger size.  Also, I think if you were tall and skinny these may be on the short side.  The pockets are nice, but not super deep.  There were a few random strings, which makes me question the stitching, but I didn't notice any specific issues."
3.0,"I was truely excited to get my vest in the mail. It was on time for sure. When I opened the yellow envelope there was a wreid smell all I could hope was gosh please let it be the plastic.<br />I pulled out the the clear bag it was in and sniffed it, the smell was pretty loud. I took the best out and smelled it..low and behold it was the vest. It smells like some sort of chemical I couldn't place what kind but surely I immediately threw it in the sink and washed it!<br />I don't recommend putting the vest on when you when you recieve it, No telling how it's being treated before it gets to the United States. This vest is made in China.<br />So if you breakout from it that probably why!"
3.0,My wife's Cardiologist suggested she start using compression socks. She wore them but one time and refuses to try again. She had large calves (22 around) and these are TOO Tight.
3.0,"Okay product, was too big for my nose, had to wire cut it to proper size I was looking for."
3.0,"Purchased these and got some lenses that are pretty permanently foggy. As I wear these mainly for fashion purposes and not really as readers, it is pretty annoying to have to constantly take them off when things get too foggy. Now I understand this may be a simple case of a defect pair but other than that, they do fit and feel good on the face.<br /><br />If they'd simply have some better clear lenses they'd be perfect."
3.0,"These earrings are much smaller that shown in the photo of the woman wearing the earrings. They are sized for a young child. Other than that, they are quite pretty."
3.0,"I like this shirt, however it really bothers my because the print on the back of the shirt is off center, and slightly tilted. Kinda bummed about it. Otherwise good."
3.0,"I like the design of the earrings but they are somewhat heavy. If they were a little bit lighter in weight, It would be much better."
3.0,"Really nice pair of cords , I wear my trousers and jeans 32w34l but these seemed a little short and a little tight. Won’t be returning them cause my brother fits into them better. Wish they sold 36l"
3.0,"I loved the print of this bag, but I hated the material. It felt cheap. otherwise it was perfect."
3.0,"The jacket itself is wonderful, in idea... but in practice it’s not so great. I got this so that I would be visible when taking nighttime walks as we don’t have sidewalks in a bunch of where I stroll around after dark in my neighborhood. The reflectiveness is spot on— incredibly bright and makes me so visible you’d have to be legally blind to miss me walking on the side of the road.<br /><br />The fit is right though and I got the biggest size hoping to be able to layer it. I’m not.<br /><br />And the construction is cheap. The zipper gets caught and the lining in the back has already ripped out.<br /><br />I know it wasn’t really that expensive, but for the money I’d expect it not to have torn on the first wearing. Oh well. I will still wear it. Even though it ripped, it’s still better than getting hit by a car."
3.0,Inexpensive watch. It was very late. But I received a refund which impressed me. I'll continue to shop. I hope my next order will not be late. Overall pleased with services.<br /><br />Keep up the good work under these circumstances.
3.0,I like the dress but the shoulder seams sit low more on the top off the arms not quite up on the shoulders but it's not a bad dress. I got it to go with a black cream and pink purse I got from amazon the go great together.
3.0,I think they are so large because of the loose fabric. My grandson has never worn them and I gave them to him for Christmas. It is mid-June. He was disappointed that the charge on the lights don't last long.
3.0,"No complaints about this product except that the legs were too long and showed from under my dress. I’m 50+ so these aren’t short, short dresses either."
3.0,Nice ring for the price. Gave it to my sister.
3.0,Way to big in the waist and the hip area.  It was like 4 sizes too big in those areas!
3.0,So far so good. But only received one pair not three.
3.0,"The fit and quality construction  is fantastic, but the notches aren't compatible with regular eye glasses. My husband still can't pull it down level from front to back because it hits his glasses."
3.0,"It's a fun idea for a ring, but it really doesn't work very well. Sizing runs big. Wouldn't buy again."
3.0,"The stone is beautiful, but the cord is so short that only a child could fit it around her neck.  I need to find a new cord before I can wear it."
3.0,They looked great on my gf but were a little too small for her so not a great choice for those with big thighs but otherwise they were great and they looked amazing
3.0,"The body fit gorgeous, but the arms and armholes are larger than they need to be and fit oddly. The armholes are cut so big that they went past my bust/mid rib. I look like a bat when I put my hands on my hips, as it pulls the entire bodice towards my elbows. The sleeves are too wide for my toothpick arms. It is quite long for me (I'm 5'2""/100 lbs and had to wear 4"" heels... the dress still dragged on the floor). Also came with unsewn parts of the seams on the waist, meaning there were holes. If i wasn't in such a time crunch, I would have returned it... But my event was the next day so I just sewed it up myself. Not worth the $40 in my opinion, although I got lots of compliments on it. I wish the quality was better. The fabric is ultra thin with no lining, and lights/photography can make it completely see through, revealing your undergarments (or lack there of). Also, the fabric snags on EVERYTHING. I'm bummed, as I really wanted to love this dress! Everyone told me how beautiful it was, but I felt uncomfortable with the fit of the arms and how see through it was. After two glasses of wine, I didn't seem to mind though 😉 all in all, pretty silhouette with a few things that bugged me about the dress."
3.0,Cheaply made of felt. Definitely not kid size as it’s big on my adult head.
3.0,"This is fun, looks cute but kinda on the larger size for my nose.  I wanted to see how it looked and so I purchased this.  It runs a bit big and I think it's falling out all the time but it's not.  My eyes water when I first put it in but I like the look and it's easier than the real thing."
3.0,"The mask is what was expected, however once one fits the nose clip, the wording is difficult for others to read."
3.0,"nice shirt but too small order size up, sadly no.large available"
3.0,I do like these but I primarily bought the because they had pockets to keep my phone in.  They were great but the dye rubs off on my pink phone case and now it’s black.  Disappointed and wanted additional shorts but will not buy these again.
3.0,Cheesy looking good for price
3.0,"Pretty, but pearls on the skirt all fell off."
3.0,"pros:  good size, nice color good design, stands on its own so things don't fall out<br />cons: cheap vinyl feel, the bottom is too wide that when carrying it with the straps on the shoulder, the bottom is the actual view, a bit heavy even when empty, needs a better quality zipper.  I bought 4 colors - one of them I have to return because the stitching on the side is open.<br /><br />Not worth more than $30.00"
3.0,"El reloj no es feo, pero en la foto el azul es más claro… cuando lo recibí lucia totalmente diferente"
3.0,Half of the backs came off during install. They are cute but I don’t think they will last.
3.0,Too long and overall it's huge
3.0,Much bigger than I had expected. Ordered for my 3 month old but had to send them back.
3.0,"I love the idea of a WWE Championship, as a ring.<br /><br />The overall size of the front of the belt, was smaller that I expected. It kinda gave off a “Crackerjack” toy vibe. I think I was expecting a fat ring, like most championship teams get.<br /><br />As far as ring finger-size fits, if you go one size up, you should be fine. I went one size up and it fits great.<br /><br />For twenty-some-odd-bucks, I got enough for my money.<br /><br />However, it will be interesting to see how long it stays in tact."
3.0,This product coloring looks the same as in the ad picture. Very vivid colors even after washing :)
3.0,I like them but they don't stay on very well
3.0,really big
3.0,"These boots look great out of the box but it only takes a few days before the glitter starts falling off in certain places and then they start to look cheap. My 3 year old was OBSESSED with these boots and as long as she liked them I didn’t really care, but if you’re looking for boots to last through the winter, find a different pair"
3.0,"Like it, too is way small but I’ll be wearing to the beach so doesn’t really matter for that."
3.0,"i like the hoops, the curved ones with the diamonds are bit bigger then the actual size and don’t fit in my piercing but the ones with just silver balls fit no problem"
3.0,"A good standard leotard but runs small in my opinion and I have a small wiry toddler. I got the toddler sizing which said 2-4T and my daughter is 3 yrs old, 30 lbs and 37 inches tall. Its doable but cuts into her shoulders. Order up!"
3.0,"The first picture online is accurate, the others for tint are not. I bought these for myself, since I have a small face and these were 50mm which I prefer. I really wanted a gold mirror pair, which this is advertised as, and was the only one I could find that would fit me. The first picture online shows a greenish tint, but I figured you needed to see it in person to really know, reflective tints aren't always exact online as they are in person. The other photos did not have the green look. I suppose from the right angle, these are kind of gold. Maybe it's just me, but I mostly see green. But they fit and the frame is sturdy. Though it's not the true gold color I was looking for, I still like them and intend to keep them."
3.0,"These pants fit my legs great! I am 5’4, 118lbs and athletic build. Biggest problem? The pockets are to thick that it looks ridiculous. They are long, deep pockets as well so they’re fairly long down my thigh. I mean, we’re looking at these to be tight and form fitting like normal yoga pants.. might have to settle for some that don’t have pockets or else they will bulge for sure. By the time I got to try these on, it was too late to return them. I will most likely cut the pockets out and sew them closed so I can at least use the nice pants"
3.0,Average quality
3.0,They were lightweight and flimsy.  High waistband rolled down.
3.0,Love the hat but it's so small I can't wear it.  On last notch I can get it on but it looks like a fez perched up there.  By the way...I'm a 7.5 hatwise.
3.0,Didnt last long
3.0,"It looks nice but, it comes incomplete."
3.0,"I had high hopes for this dress but sadly it came up short literally lol. The material is not the same as shown in the pic, it’s very see through as well. I think it looks more like a nightgown than a dress"
3.0,Extra large fit around just fine<br />Length too short shows my belly - not cool<br />Extra large should mean length also come on not hard people
3.0,"The shirt itself is nice, looks like the picture and seems good quality, however, the sizing is way off. I am usually a medium in women's tops but based on reviews I ordered a XL and it is still too small! An XL fits like a small, this is isn't even junior sizing it seems like they are made for children"
3.0,"Had to return it. The sizes run small. But I loved the color and the design,"
3.0,"Colors not as pictured. The color labeled red is really more of a peachy pink. The middle section of the blue was a faded dingy color. Didn't like the two blue sections together. Sewing not great on the blue, but no issues with the red.<br />The way the back keyhole is cut, entire bra strap shows. XL fit as expected. Lightweight. Red is a bit sheer. It is cute and comfortable. For the $16 price tag, an okay summer dress.<br />Lyaner makes a similar slightly higher quality version of this dress."
3.0,Bought a 2XL and the tshirt itself is very soft but the printed image is darker and not as defined as the image online showed.
3.0,"Bottoms for the swimsuit didn't fit true to size, I ordered a Large and they were very small. The top is cute and fits fine, but has the most complicated clasp I have ever seen on a swimsuit."
3.0,"It's cute , but this necklace gave me a terrible eczema outbreak."
3.0,wrinkly when fully compressed
3.0,Looked a little cheaper than the pictures and there is no mouth hole to breath from so I had to cut a hole for the mouth. Served its purpose
3.0,I can't wear this watch AT ALL without my wrist having severe irritation. It's strangely all with the wood back. No idea why. The watch looks great though. Just unreadable in dim situations.
3.0,Light weight and fit as described.<br />pricey for the fair quality. they will only last a few washings.
3.0,This piece has a spot right at the waist on the front which has had the nap rubbed off sort of in an hourglass shape.  sadness.
3.0,Not what I expected. The material is no where close to being a sweatshirt and is not flattering.
3.0,"They are pretty small, just worried how they will fit after they go through the dryer, and i even use low heat. Will update then.<br /><br />Also, only received one sock on one of the discs. Lol"
3.0,"Nice looking wallet, material feels good, but ID slot began ripping open and deforming with only 6 months of use."
3.0,I ordered 2 sizes larger based on reviews. The grey pair was at least 2 sizes smaller than the others. My husband shrank the black pair by putting them in the dryer. So that leaves me with 4 functioning pairs of panties. The ones that do fit fit good.
3.0,"The dress was super cute, but I ordered a 1X and it came in XL which was too small. I thought this was supposed to be plus sized... The return was really easy, but I didn't get to wear the dress for the event I was attending."
3.0,It's a  burned copy. Product does not match product detail at all. 3 movies on one disc. Quality is okay...  good movies though!
3.0,"Great PAIR of socks, but this is NOT a 3 pack.  Dont be misled.  Some colors are 3 packs, other colors are not.  Prices are pretty much the same for the 3 pack or the pair.  Great socks, poor seller."
3.0,"The material had quality, but it was very bulky, I sent it back. It was personally not for me, but on another person might be perfect"
3.0,"These slippers came too big by 1/2 to 1 inch.  Feel very loose, but comfortable otherwise."
3.0,"Don't like the. Loose gathering on the top center part of suit. Top is on large side,bottom on small size"
3.0,Could have done without the neck piece and a tad big but still super cute!
3.0,No real stainless steel as advertised.  Stared turning colors within minutes
3.0,"Very cute necklace, got a lot of compliments on it.<br /><br />I was hoping it'd help with my breathing more or have something that haptically felt nice when breathing, but it doesn't.<br /><br />The chain also broke after 9 months from regular wear and usage."
3.0,"I do not know why I did not catch it, I wanted a hoop, not giant but normal size, not something small in size you<br />Would put on a child.  Even in studs I like them 7mm at least, in size."
3.0,Tight on temples. No flexibility
3.0,"it's a heavy weight band, which is nice, but doesn't come close to matching the rose gold apple watch face.....I ordered another &#34;rose gold&#34; band that came with the watch face cover and this band matches that, so I wear them together..."
3.0,The decal arrived quickly and looked as advertised. I had a difficult time transferring it to the wall as it did not want to release from the contact paper. I have to assume that was a user problem and not necessarily a product deficiency.
3.0,Wasn’t as pictured
3.0,I ordered 2 other capris by 90 Degree in black & raisin.  The green is the only one that fits a little more snug.
3.0,It's a nice enough hat if a bit on the small side!
3.0,The styling of this shoe is great… but the quality is not so great. I didn’t feel secure in the shoe. Had to return them.
3.0,"This product was a little bit of a disappointment but at the same time it was pretty cheap. The material is really thin and honestly doesn't protect you from the sun at all, but if you just want it for style then it is perfect."
3.0,Easy on easy off HA not even close to it!!!
3.0,"The band is a lot flimsier than I thought. Its not as sturdy as I thought it would be due to how big the S2 face is. It's adequate for everyday wear, but if I try to really work hard with my hands, I'm afraid it might snap."
3.0,"I purchased this because it said it was a cotton and acrylic blend - which i wanted because all cotton sweaters are not as warm and also tend to lose their shape more easily. The tag inside the sweater says 100% cotton. it's a cute sweater, a little bit big, but that is ok, she'll grow into it more and more."
3.0,"Unfortunately, this face mask is only one ply. Most places require two layers of cloth for masks, and this is only one. Love the look and color. Stays easily on my ears. Just wish it was two ply so I’m not some jerk who transmits covid because I bought a cheap mask."
3.0,The suit is nicely made but the sizes run small.
3.0,"It was scratchy and cheap looking with lots of loose threads. I am 5'8&#34;, 125 lbs. I ordered the medium and thought it was a bit small...not oversized like the picture. I returned it."
3.0,Looked cool but broke after a few weeks.
3.0,"Was pictured with a chain, but not included with order. Corresponded with seller and<br />he was indifferent with concern."
3.0,Looks good I liked it once I got it
3.0,"This soft, lovely bag is so perfect.  It has a nice feel, large compartments, nice new smell and is comfortable to carry no matter how you choose to carry it.  It is a perfect color for all seasons.  However, the zippers pulled apart and nothing I have tried has been able to get them to close correctly, so the little pull slides back and forth with the zipper open on both sides.  ugh"
3.0,"Cheap polyester dress. Not worth $20. The pattern is cute and pictures are accurate. Buttons are decorative. Just wish it was higher quality, it is a cute dress."
3.0,More shrinkage than expected on the first wash.
3.0,good idea to order size up. runs small
3.0,cute but seems like it's made for Plus Size
3.0,Did not=like
3.0,Fitting is sorta lopsided
3.0,"The shirt’s design is so cute and comes in a beautiful bright color (yellow). However, the print on it is the kind of vinyl that pills off easily. I would hand wash this shirt if you get it."
3.0,"Hat runs a lot smaller than photo suggests. I like a slouchy hat but this one fits more like a tight beanie. I’ve been wearing it rolled down without the cuff, which fits better with more slouch, but then the seams show and the tag is upside down. Also worth noting is that I am female with a small- average size head (as a hairstylist I have a good idea of what ranges as average head circumference)."
3.0,They are super cute but way small then i was hoping.
3.0,Color is grey and they fit perfectly. Look forward to using them at soccer games at the same time I can use my phone for videos.
3.0,"Another reviewer already said that it smells like gasoline but I took a chance.. and mine stinks. I couldn't tolerate it so I hand washed it, soaked it and dried it with dryer sheets and it STILL stinks. So now I've covered it in perfume. It's not worth the money if you have to degrade the product by washing it so thoroughly to remove an odor.  It's warm so I like it besides that but I haven't used it yet. Waiting for the smell to fade."
3.0,"The label on the package said the correct info for what i ordered, but the badge holder was only 3"" diameter.  Just returned it via a UPS store."
3.0,"Love this shirt, a little tight but that's fine with me:)"
3.0,"This is a great, extremely lightweight coat with a belt.  It's great for travel and has its own travel sack to match!"
3.0,I was disappointed that they were way too small. But the refund was done with no issues
3.0,Actually would say I got 84.5 pieces. One of the spikes was missing from the package but I am not really tripping on that. Mostly the fact its always so hard to tell how big each of these are from pictures and when it doesnt give you measurements it makes it even that much harder. Some of these are just super small to the size and not big enough for what I was hoping for
3.0,"I thought this looked really cute in the picture, but when it arrived I had very much misjudged the fabric and pattern. This looked far more like a housecoat/mumu than a bathing suit cover up to me. The design gave a nightgown look that I didn't pick up on from the photos. What surprised me the most was the very thin material. I prefer a beach cover up that will absorb some water when I get out of the pool. This will not do that. This seems to be more interested in fashion than function to me. Sizing was a little small - if you prefer a roomy cover up, size up."
3.0,"The seller is accommodating. The seller sent me two dresses, but I could not keep the dress because it is not a lovely quality, but the color is fantastic."
3.0,"El producto es bonito y de buena calidad pero es demasiado estrecho, compré el size M y cabe poca cosa dentro"
3.0,"I brought this outfit because my sister likes navy blue and he was gonna get married so I bought it for her to use on her honneymoon almost a year ago, since then I cant believe this item never showed up to my door, smh. It looks good but I would not recommend anyone to buy it because it is not fun at all to waste almost 50 bucks on something you never get, smh."
3.0,"Im going to start by telling you, that if you want blue lenses then buy them from the brand itself. As far as lenses go, i do like them and wear them but the color is not the same as the picture, in fact they're kind of purplish dark blue and some hot pinkish dependong on the light. And i dont like that. But for the price i guess one can live with it. In addition i do not get a lot of compliments on them, I usually get lots of compliments if the quality of a product i buy is great regardless of the price or brand. So for these lenses only 3 stars."
3.0,"While the material and the asymmetrical drape is beautiful, this top was wrongly crafted - the waist is as wide as the shoulder. I am not a seamstress but I know that in order to bring out the beauty in the wearer, a peplum top is supposed to be hourglassly shaped, that's the waist is supposed to be made way smaller than the shoulders but in this top that's not the case. I'm greatly disappointed as I have to always wear it with a tummy belt to cinch it because without the belt it just looks ridiculous."
3.0,"Comfy, but see through!!!"
3.0,"The belt seems to be made well, and the buckle is as pictured. However, the white trim in the photos is actually tan like untreated hemp rope. So I had to return."
3.0,"Moisture from your breath, especially on humid days, will quickly make this uncomfortable to wear, but as a mask to slip on when going to the store, it's perfect.  Unobtrusive around the neck.  Stitching means is doesn't fray around the edges after washing, even if it likes to rotate around my neck to put the seam on the front."
3.0,"It's really pretty and very good quality....but it's a huge pain to put in! It took me forever (and some blood and pain) to get in. Also, it may be just the way my nose is shaped, but the end is very long and I constantly have to rotate it so it doesn't look like a silver booger isn't coming out of my nose. It looks nice though!"
3.0,Smashed Head - Glue and Splotchy Paint !!! Hair/wig is very thin. Paint on head is bad and splotchy. Second head I purchased. both heads were smashed in box.
3.0,"5’10” / 150lbs / ordered a large<br /><br />Thinner than expected, wouldn’t be able to work out in this — not squat proof at all, but pretty cute lounge set. Slightly more compression than soft material, wasn’t what I was looking for"
3.0,Very cute but run a little small.
3.0,Thought it was made of cotton blend...should have read description closer.
3.0,"The shipping was really fast, which surprised me. I was also pleased with how easy it was for me to put in the piercing and believe it is the right gauge... It is a little short lengthwise and smaller than I had expected, but I'm pretty pleased."
3.0,IT IS NICE BUT KINDA JUST OKAY
3.0,"In the photo, the T-shirt is more beautiful than in reality. I advise you to buy one size smaller. Synthetics are felt in the fabric."
3.0,"Runs small, color is as expected. I don't care for the material.  I still like the design. Just wish it could fit."
3.0,I know it was a great price but the fabric of the dress is coming off the same day she just wear it for 3 hours but she love it anyway.
3.0,XXXL fits more like a L. otherwise the suit would be ok
3.0,"The tassels were down to her ankles so she had to shorten them, but other than that she really likes it."
3.0,The item is very stretchy and the neckline does not hold its form. I usually wear it with a tank underneath as the neckline widens quite a bit.
3.0,"Bag is nice but a little to small for my intended use, so I am returning it and searching for one that better suits my needs.<br />Overall a very nice bag!"
3.0,I like the feel of the fabric and they are a nice thickness. The only thing I am disappointed in is that the crotch and waistband slide down a lot. Very annoying. I ordered an XL.
3.0,I ordered a size larger than I wear and it was still small. I wear L or XL so I ordered 2XL for a large fit. It was still too small
3.0,The color of the bead work is different. The quality was fine for the price. Had a few strings dangle off that we clipped.
3.0,I bought this for my daughter because she wanted it for school but her teachers suspended her just for wearing it
3.0,"This dress is beautiful, soft and silky, I was terribly disappointed that it didn't fit.  The seller didn't have this dress in a larger size, however was prompt to provide instructions for return and issued a complete refund in a very timely manner.  Would buy again if I could be sure of size."
3.0,"This set runs on the small side and didn't fit quite right after machine washing and drying.  The elastic on the shorts is very nice and stretchy.  The material is thin, but that's perfect for our summer needs.  Too bad it has shrinkage problems."
3.0,Ribbon was not secure and not the same length
3.0,"I was looking for a very lightweight wallet with space for lots of cards etc.<br /><br />I thought this one would be good, but my cards kept falling out of the card slots.  Had to give it away."
3.0,"Bought this for a small purse while aboard a cruise, something that wont be in the way and light to carry, the actually size is that of a medium purse, its just skinnier than a normal purse"
3.0,"These socks are made from good materials and cute, but the ankles are too tight and uncomfortable. So now not use it.."
3.0,not very quality
3.0,The suit was a nice suit but did not fit right. I have a strange shape. Small waist but big hips. Hard to find the right size.
3.0,"I bought a 3x thinking it would be more than generous and allow for shrinkage. It is tapered and cut narrow making it  fit so snuggly I am uncomfortable. I am returning it. Also, I thought this was a sweatshirt and it is not. Bummer because it's so very cute!"
3.0,Cute top it just didn’t fit right a little to big and it was small
3.0,Hard to keep tied on.
3.0,just a beanie - gave to grandson
3.0,Cute.  Will be a nice accessory with costume.
3.0,the black is a dark brown and not a black at all.
3.0,Larger than I thought. High quality though.
3.0,"I bought these earrings for myself and for the price I'm surprised how cute and nice they are! They are made a little cheaper but honestly I didn't expect much for the price I paid for them. The earrings are two pieces and at first are a little hard to get on. I feel like they would be too big for a child's ears but they are perfect for an adult. Great addition to my costume jewelry! They did not turn my ears green or anything but my ears did get itchy after prolonged use of them. Over all not bad, you get what you pay for :)"
3.0,"It was too tight, or I was too fat,"
3.0,"I liked the style of this jacket on, but the material and belt buckle was just too cheap for me to keep it. If it had fit my daughter, it would have been a great Sunday jacket for her as teenagers are more concerned with how it looks than how it feels. The sizing seemed to be true and it looks more feminine and less &#34;trench coaty&#34; in person. I would rate the style higher."
3.0,It's very cute but the only issues I have is the clamp is stiff. It doesn't open and close very well. It's a very importation reason of why I bought the key ring in the first place.
3.0,Material is quality - pretty thick. Decent for work.
3.0,I have ordered two of these now and both have broken . I loved them both but went to a buckle band this time around
3.0,Does not completely black out all light. There is a gap between eye and nose that's lets some light in while wearing.
3.0,"The watch is a neet, function filled, nice looking watch but the title says &#34;boys or girls&#34;. This watch is big enough to fit me so it is not a kids size watch."
3.0,The blue cord used in the bracelet ruins it. Gray Black or white would have been better.
3.0,"For the western male, the zipper pull is on this item is on the wrong side. The left. For modern apparel, zippers pulls are left for females and right for males. They are nice sweaters but they got the zipper all wrong."
3.0,Dull
3.0,"theyre nice so far, my only complaint at the moment is the backs are really big. id suggest using the backs of a pair of earrings you already own if you have smaller earlobes like me."
3.0,stiching on the outside coming apart
3.0,Sizes appear to run small.
3.0,The fabric is also heavy--and hot for the weather in the Southeast. I actually thought it looked like a girls size shirt rather than junior.
3.0,"A little large for women's wrist, great project for teaching granddaughter how to make survivor bracelets."
3.0,the tulip parts are really nice but the chain quality is terrible - it will definitely break easily...and there doesnt seem to be a link you can remove to replace it with a nicer quality chain.
3.0,Comes with poorly written directions
3.0,Sexy as hell but it did run a bit small.  Its not as flowing on my wife as it is this model and I ordered one size bigger in case this was an Asian fitting size.
3.0,Way too tight over instep.  Nice product otherwise and would have liked to keep it.
3.0,"I've been using this watch for almost 3 weeks and the scratches are a problem in this watch, the band is very poor quality but it looks very good."
3.0,For me tooo big
3.0,"The band is pink in the picture but when it came it is coral - a peachy kind of color and not what I was looking for, I don't wear it."
3.0,The front half of the underwear is actually kind of baggy.  Just needed some period panties and these work fine.
3.0,"There is 2 lawyers of material, the one closer to my face goes up my nose or in my mouth."
3.0,It arrived quicker than others available at slightly less price. Is a decent costume at a so so quality. We ordered a size up and glad we did especially for the pants. The hat is also a little small. The boots seem an appropriate size but are cheap plastic. Overall not as bad as expected.
3.0,"I purchased this mask because it looks as if it is a deep green velvet with the dragonfly on it, so pretty.  It also looks as if it is the smooth type, face formed type.  Instead it is a silky polyester material that is dark green in the center and fades out to a lighter green on the edge.  There are 2 folds similar to the surgical mask style.  The dragonfly is colorful however.  The style is fine if you were expecting it, I was not.  I fell in love with the picture, not so much with what it actually is."
3.0,"I bought a large as the description said it was true to size.  However, the sleeves were too long, the shoulders too big, the length was too long, and the hip was too narrow.  The picture made the top seem like it was a little bit of an A-line but this was not so.  Maybe I should have tried a medium but the fit on the hip made me decide to cut my losses."
3.0,"I commute back and forth to DC every weekday, computer in tow.  I think this bag was designed for bicyclers, but it suits my needs well.  I love the sleek design, love the way the straps protect the top from pickpockets, love that it holds a great deal more than I thought it would, and love that I can still hold my morning caffeine as I run for the train.  I pack it much like I would a briefcase, with a 17&#34; laptop, and too many files, and there's still room for things I would carry in my weekend purse, including a sweater (the AC on the train, when working, feels like it's sub-zero).  There's another smaller pocket accessible from the top that holds my kindle, phone, and glasses; and I slide my train pass and ID in a small side zipped pocket that I can reach without taking off the bag.  The straps were a little stiff, but have softened up some.  My only complaint about the bag is that the shoulder straps seem wide set to me, and slip off often.  I'm female, but certainly not of a dainty frame, and for as much as I paid for the bag, I'd hoped it would be a perfect fit.  Maybe this bag was designed for men?  While the buckles prevent the straps from slipping, even with the heaviest loads, there's no chest clip or other way to keep the straps from slipping off.  For someone trekking across town, I can see that this would certainly be a deal breaker, but I'll continue to use the bag for my commute because I am mainly running from car to train to shuttle, and not walking much (though Lord knows I should)."
3.0,These gloves were thin not warm at all. They are more suited for spring or maybe fall weather.
3.0,The fabric is soft but so cheap an other words  is a cheap dress for one time use
3.0,"Overall happy with the cover up. It does run very large so if I were to order again, I would go a size or two smaller. I had to take the shoulder straps down in size to make it work."
3.0,"The color on the website showed it to be a rich chocolate brown. When it arrived, it was more like a chocolate milk; very light in color. However, it fit perfectly; just as expected!"
3.0,"Ordered wrong size because of inaccurate size chart, it fit super large. The boots are cute though."
3.0,too small.  Picture and pricing are misleading.
3.0,"This purse is so cute! Petite and definitely genuine leather. My main complaint is that it came pretty oily, and everything metal was coated in oil. I'm still trying to get it all off so it doesn't get on my clothes."
3.0,"company is working on exchanging with me- issue is very very long arms and too short legs. Very soft though, and if fitted babies properly, would be adorable and warm"
3.0,Good quality just runs small
3.0,"Perfect the first time I wore it, and then I washed it. It shrunk so much in the wash - and I am high-maintenance when washing clothes (right temperature, check on clothes several times during drying to prevent shrinking, finish drying on a clothes rack, etc.). I have never seen something shrink so much.<br /><br />It's such a shame as the style and fit was so perfect prior to washing. It was also very comfortable."
3.0,"Ordered the 10 piece and received 8. Other than that,  I love them."
3.0,I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't what I expected. The purse is nice for a young girl maybe or I guess if you like tiny purses but it's a no for me. My phone doesn't even fit in it. I will be returning it
3.0,"Unfortunately this dress was not at all what I expected. It's material is really thin and a cheap polyester. It looks so much nice in the pictures. It didn't work for my, however I did give it to my friends daughter who seemed to be happy with it. It would be fine for a younger person say 18-25 possibly in my opinion. Just because it didn't necessarily work for me doesn't mean it wouldn't work for you. I normally do not purchase clothing on Amazon and thought I would give it a try for once being that I received this product at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,Beautiful but very rough hat
3.0,After aa huge mix up with shipping and a phone tango dance they came just before we left for my son party. In this order they all work.
3.0,"the belt holes do not lineup at all they are too big by far and my smaller belt barely fits as I have to use the largest setting and there's no leftover. So now I have to buy a leather punch to make a new hole or two in this belt, which will cost me more $$."
3.0,Ehhhh they can do better for $15-20 a pair. I typically wear bjorns and im tempted to oay the extra money
3.0,I've received a lot of compliments on this item but I'm rating it three stars because the color is not true to the picture. The front is an off white and the rest of the sweater is a light beige.
3.0,"Beautiful dress and the material is not see through but it runs very small.  I ordered a medium and it was very tight, it felt like a size small or xs.  I returned it."
3.0,"Seems the different patterns also are cut to different sizes.  Two pair ripped right out.  Cause they fit tight in the crotch/thighs.  One pair fits OK, the other two fit true to size.  I ordered large, my suggestion order a size bigger so they all fit comfortably.  The ones that did fit have held up well to numerous wash and dry with no special care needed."
3.0,"The masks I received were tiny. These would not fit most adults (and I have a small head). I’m donating to local kids. I got the tie dyed ones. Very cute, but runs SMALL! Also, they were not all the same size which I thought was odd."
3.0,It was ok. I just didn't expect it to be a little smaller on him but it was ok. Good material.
3.0,"To tight around ears.  Top rim does not shield eyes from sun. Other than that, these are great."
3.0,It is way bigger than I thought it would be and longer. I lost the actual necklace but it did come in package. It is okay good gift for someone who like longer and bigger necklaces. 6/10 :/
3.0,Cute top - just didn't fit the girls correctly.
3.0,I ordered the mirrored ones and received the non mirrored. I went back to the site and the mirrored ones were no longer a choice. I really wanted that style for my 16 yr old son. The quality is really nice but I feel the lenses are too big. They would look better a little smaller like normal glasses instead of safety glasses. The frames are thicker than the slim look advertised.  They are a gift so to try them  I did stand outside and look at oncoming cars and street lamps and they seemed to work really well. I want to get another pair but a different style.
3.0,lens is a little larger than looks but OK.
3.0,"Cheap but pretty and durable. They look nice on, but they don't feel super high quality"
3.0,nice looking. Post is extremely short as for children. Silicone backing hard to grasp; slips out of fingers easily
3.0,"The look, light weight material but not sure if it’s sturdy"
3.0,"The glasses look nice and very well using on sunny days. However, I personally think that I would expect the bridge between both lens is narrower.<br />And the cutting of plastic nose pad is poor. There was a sharp piece of excess plastic scratch my nose, so I have to cut and scrub that out.<br /><br />However, with the price, I'm OK with the quality."
3.0,"These are a good value at the price (close to $2/pair at the time I bought them). The material is generally nice but does vary between the patterns. The lighter-colored fabrics are softer and stretchier than the darker-colored fabrics. I have a 38&#34; waist and the Large fits me well in the waist. However, the legs are not as generous as the seat. For me, the waist is neither loose nor tight, the seat is baggy, and the legs are tight. I do have a large butt and thighs relative to my waist size.<br /><br />There are loose threads but most of them have not caused a problem. Out of 24 pairs, the waistband has come unstitched on one pair after about 5 wearings.<br /><br />They do have large tags that are likely to irritate anyone sensitive to this. The tags don't bother me most of the time but, really, why does anyone put tags inside underwear?<br /><br />The fly is also too short. Using a urinal requires a fun little routine that involves pulling the boxers down about 2 inches to get things started, then trying to readjust my shirt and boxers through the fly of my pants. I sometimes choose just to use a stall and pull everything down to avoid this.<br /><br />Having written all of that, I still give them 3 stars because of the price. Other woven boxers in the $2 range have been so bad that I simply couldn't wear them. I still wear these, though they are a constant reminder that cheaping out on underwear is a poor decision."
3.0,"Yeah, not very good quality.. I opened it and part of it immediately fell off. And it is ridiculously hard to get back on. I still haven't fixed it. the sturdiness is okay."
3.0,I should have made sure it was bigger so that's my faul
3.0,Smaller then what was needed.
3.0,"Absorbs, but there is side leakage."
3.0,This bra is well made but the cup size runs small in my option.
3.0,Cool little necklace... showed up missing an ear.
3.0,Top fits barely I’m usually size L. But bottom don’t fit unless you are small no hip no butt.<br />At least i can use the top with Another bottom.
3.0,"The material of these are a little itchy, not smoothing and definitely not high waisted.  They barely cover my backside."
3.0,Too expensive especially for the workmanship. Came folded and made crease unable to get rid of.
3.0,"The sewn in bra is weird and doesn't fit well, but the suite size is good - I followed their chart/measurements for sizing. But the bra part is totally not removable and when I wear it, it kind of stretches and bunches up.. I think I'm going to just cut it out. It serves its purpose though... Just use it occasionally for swimming exercise so I didn't need it to look good, just be functional, and it's functional enough, regardless of the bra issue. The pattern is nice too. Quality seems good too. Doubt I'll need another for a while."
3.0,"Because the jacket didn't cost as much as a lot of the others sold, I wasn't expecting much. The fabric wasn't the best but it looked accurate and good in pictures. If you want to wear this jacket as an average jacket I wouldn't recommend but as a cosplay, it's fine. The fact that it didn't cost too much makes up for it though.<br />Overall I would recommend this for a cosplay."
3.0,Pretty flimsy- wouldnt recommend colder than 50 degrees. Looks cool though ...and lets get real...wearing climbing brands is more about looking sweet than actually being able to climb.
3.0,I loved this dress wore it the first time to work and already had a hole in it when I didn’t notice it. So upsetting!
3.0,Thank you for sending the correct item. However the old saying&#34;you get what you pay for&#34; holds true although it is still pretty.
3.0,Love be the color.  The size was good.  I expected the matiral to be softer.  I'm hoping after a few washes it will soften up
3.0,Gotta snap. Definitely buy a size up
3.0,Fit and fabric all fine but had to return it because it had a small hole in the front (not on the seam) that could not be repaired.
3.0,The bracelet is very beautiful.  Helps the arthritis in my wrist some.<br />But I think more magnets would be better.  Would recommend to a friend<br />to try for mild arthritis.
3.0,"This hat is cute overall. The pattern is actually lace (i thought it was a screen print, which I probably would have preferred). However, it is pretty big. The back is adjustable but the sides come down too far and push my ears out. It fits more like a men's hat rather than a women's."
3.0,They need more ankle and a lot more arch support!
3.0,A nice band but toooo long for my wrist. Needed a small.
3.0,"The body of the shirt was fine, but the crocheted sleeves were a little snug."
3.0,At first I really liked them. Once I removed and reinserted a few times the middle tab started catching making it hard to slide into the watch.
3.0,It’s feel good on me
3.0,It doesn’t make it past about 10 washes before becoming totally stretched out. It’s sad I spend so much money on it.
3.0,Love the pendant just had trouble with chain but still a good necklace
3.0,Not the quality I was expecting...
3.0,Color fades
3.0,Wanted a lightly lined bra and this was padded.
3.0,"This is a really nice quality cover up, but it runs big and the sleeves were a little too much for me."
3.0,These run big. Maybe a man's size? Slips off of face easily. Overall..ok.
3.0,hat is just as described. Yupoong is what you get so I wouldn't blame. Only concern i had if they shipped them (i bought 2) in a box so postman would not need to squeeze them into the small mail box! they put two flat bill hats in a thin grey vinyl bag.
3.0,They are pretty but they are to short for me.  I will be sending they back.
3.0,Blouse runs very small.
3.0,"I wish these were a bit longer, perfect for a petite."
3.0,"This is soft and moderately warm, tightly knit, but the fit is awkward. It is a unisex hat but truly more of a men’s fit and I would not consider it to be a slouchy oversized hat at all which is what I was looking for. Not enough flop for me, it stands straight up, no flop at all actually. It also could possibly slide right down my face, won’t really stay put as you can see from the edge of the hat. Nice material but not so nice fit, at least for my needs."
3.0,It fit but had a major wedgie no matter what underwear I wore with it
3.0,Was not happy for the type of hat and the amount of money. It is basically a truckers black hat with an embroidery of a sasquatch/beast.  It also arrived with the front smatched and spots. I was able to remove the spots but I had to clean them off. For the description it saying that is made with organic cotton but I can't tell the difference from regular cotton.
3.0,I ordered the small and it was pretty big... I have this skirt in other colors from a different seller and I was shocked at how large it was around the waist.
3.0,"not bad for the money, so far like them. They also came with a case a bag and a cloth for cleaning. After wearing these for a while I really prefer other polarized glasses, these seem a bit harder to see then the ones I'm used to."
3.0,"I really like it, it was perfect size and pretty.. but after only a month of daily wear....... its silver now.. gold plate is totally gone.."
3.0,Flex fit is great
3.0,"This is cute, but it's something I'd expect to pick up in a dollar store.  The quality isn't that great, and I'm not confident it will last very long without breaking."
3.0,I like the item but the chains tangle up on my neck losing the 3 chain look I bought it for.
3.0,These run small.  A size 10 is more like a size 8 1/2.
3.0,This watch has a very loud ticking mechanism - I find it very distracting and annoying.
3.0,"This ran a little small for me, and was much shorter than expected. The bottom of the cardigan barely comes to my hips and I am average build and 5’8. It is a pretty thick material and not for a hot day. Overall, good quality but not true to what is shown in photo with length."
3.0,sole is not in good quality.you can just wear then inside.
3.0,The gift was appreciated but not sure it has been used yet so I am unable to give you any more feed back.
3.0,I really liked this summer dress and I got a navy blue patterned and Size: small (usually M/L) but unfortunately the color or I would say the entire color of this dress is very huge difference than the website description and now I am skeptical to order the other color maybe it has the same problem!!
3.0,Fit everywhere but the straps hung off of my shoulders.
3.0,Too thin for cold weather and the heart does not look that good.
3.0,Once washed the lace does not lay down and does a weird shrink/shrivel when ironed (even on low temp).
3.0,I love the style and the fit of this dress. I have it in black. The burgundy colored one pictured isn’t the color I received. The one I received was a dark pink shade. I sent it back.
3.0,This was a gift for my husband's birthday. He wore it that day and will most likely never wear it again. It is small so it looked odd on his tall broad frame. The material is slick. Not what you expect for a bbq apron. But for the money it was fun for the birthday party.
3.0,"Why I bought it:<br />- Was looking for ruched shorts for my home workouts<br /><br />Things I disliked:<br />- Stitching seems to be weak<br />- Fit is not as expected, it is tight<br />- Elastic band is not as broad and it rolls down after putting the shorts on<br />- Material is really cheap and the entire make is of poor quality<br />- I think other than first image, rest all images are different than the actual product<br /><br />Things I liked:<br />- Color and pattern are same as depicted only in the first picture<br /><br />Will I recommend it:<br />- I returned it, but if you are okay with the material and quality"
3.0,The glitter started talking off within a couple months.
3.0,These earrings look like they can only fit a baby 👶
3.0,was way to small for 2x. it fit my grand daughter fine and she is only 12.
3.0,"I love the colors on this wrap. I don’t like that it is only printed on one side of the wrap and the inside is white, no print.  This makes it difficult when you are wrapping it on your head because the inside non printed side ( white material) shows and it doesn’t look good to me. I don’t wear it often because it’s too difficult to make it look uniform.<br />I wouldn’t of purchased had I known this."
3.0,Very nicely made and very pretty..But not true to size.
3.0,I am 5'3 200 lbs and normally a XXL fits comfortably. I ordered the green polka dot and it was so small I couldn't zip it. Nice fabric. The item was well made. I'm so disappointed it didn't fit.  I am returning it. Very easy returns.
3.0,Love the shoe but after only wearing them a few times in 3 weeks the glitter is already starting to crack at the crease that forms when you walk. Else wise I would have given a 5.
3.0,"The sizing is off.  I've purchased this hat in two (2) different sizes, and truly as beautiful as it is....it runs TOO SMALL."
3.0,This is a good quality shirt but the color is not as deep as in the photo the deep burgundy color is a faded maroon color and the mauve pink is more like a bubble gum pink. I should've ordered a solid color.<br />The shirt fits well just not a fan of the actual color.
3.0,Great little wallet with good space for credit cards when using a small purse. My only complaint is that I ordered a red one and got a green wallet.
3.0,"Not quite true to size, definitely runs small."
3.0,"(Husband/wife shared account....this is the wife)<br />Ehhh, I love the big earring trend right now but I don’t really love these. You get what you pay for but I might gift these."
3.0,These charms are cute but two of the 39 that I received were broken so I really only have 37 of the 40 I was supposed to get. Not cool at all...
3.0,"Super cute color, I’m sad it didn’t fit my daughter. I ordered one size bigger but should have gone up two. Also mine came with a mark on the collar so I had to go with three stars."
3.0,"The color I bought (red) was great, the cut was great, and if you are going to do nothing but take a photograph, it's a great dress. The material, however, is easily wrinkled, very cheap feeling, and not at all comfortable. I haven't even worn it because I can't stand it on my skin! If this were made of something else or had a lining, it would be fine, but this cheap polyester-feeling stuff is just... icky."
3.0,"Cute but broke after wearing it only a handful of times. The strap broke off.  Otherwise, it’s thicker than I wanted for my 7 year old, but very cute."
3.0,I'm still confused with sizing. Hope it functions well in winter.
3.0,Alright for the price. They’re super cute just not thaaaaat comfortable. But comfortable enough that I’ll wear them pretty regularly. 10 bucks for 6 toe rings so I wasn’t expecting anything fancy. Great for the price.
3.0,My son is a drummer and these are just right for him to hang on his backpack.  It took over a month for the package to be delivered.
3.0,Noce product love their shirts but the coat is ugly but warm
3.0,"I like the design of this tee shirt but the embellishments feel as if they'll peel off when washed. As such, I returned it without wearing. Cute though!"
3.0,"Pretty small, Really pretty and I loved the embroidery. Pretty tight around the chest, but that's what happens when you order cheap things off of Amazon- still able to wear it, but I just don't wear it a lot."
3.0,it’s beautiful but it runs small. I gave it away.
3.0,Little lower quality then I was hoping. Couple of these are falling apart after 2 washes. Overall - Very comfy.
3.0,Shirt arrived very quickly but unfortunately it’s huge! I ordered a 2x and it looks to be a 4x I’m going to try to wash it and hopefully it will shrink a bit. If not I’ll have to order a different shirt!
3.0,need to order 2 sizes larger
3.0,So it’s comfortable it’s warm but the mask stretched out after maybe three uses
3.0,"Nice colors and seem durable but for a man's sock WAY too small. They also shrunk in the dryer. Well, now they're mine since they won't fit my hubber!"
3.0,"I like the shirt but I don't care for the material. It gets fuzzy little lent balls everywhere when something (arms, desk, seatbelt, etc) rubs against it."
3.0,Looks just like image but flower clip was broken in the back and the outfit runs very big
3.0,"On the one hand this is a thick and well made sock. On the other hand, it's advertised as a wool sock but only has 3% wool content. It's not a wool sock. It's a thick polyester and spandex sock. If you're looking for a well made polyester sock for winter, this will meet your needs."
3.0,"Beautiful but even snagged my satin sheets. Wore three minutes and bracelet got caught on at least 10 items: dress, sweater, sheets..."
3.0,Came from China did not know
3.0,The shirt was a nice size it fit. The material is a bit different but the shirt was pretty ok.
3.0,"Thick material. Looked good, but worry the fabric won't breathe and I would get too hot"
3.0,"Good price, color fades a bit after a few washings but not more than 5.11’s also has a weak snap. Fits smaller than 5.11’s also."
3.0,The dress size is very deceiving. Order a size or two up. Otherwise the cut is good and the colours and patterns are as vibrant as the picture.
3.0,The fabric is a little thin and there is a lot of loose 'fuzzies' when they're new. Sort of cheap feeling. the top elastic doesn't hold up well and they don't go all the way to the knee.  I wouldn't buy these again
3.0,"It's ok, it has nice reflectors on the front and I like the clasps in the front, but it just seems kind of cheaply made. Once you un-clasp the front it has a drawsting to open the top of the backpack and I dont like that at all. The two side pockets are open/closed with velcro, and I just don't like the material that actually make up the backpack. I'll sum up the review like I started it it's ok."
3.0,"The jeans are made nice, but they are a little on the big side, both around the waist and in length."
3.0,these glasses have a nice look & shape for that retro look.  they just feel flimsy & not sturdy at all. the lens aren't as darkly tinted as I'd like.
3.0,The fabric is not stretchy so I recommend getting a size bigger than you usually wear.
3.0,"VERY tight, they hurt so bad when I tried them on, they were cutting off circulation to my thighs. They product was not good, but the customer service was great, I had no issue returning, that is why I gave a 3 star. 1 star for the product, 4 star for customer service."
3.0,About 5-10 did not work and kids were really sad
3.0,Love the product but didn’t come with the gift box like it said would be included
3.0,its pretty but larger than i imagined. also the chain was too tangled for me to bother trying it on. will be returning.
3.0,It's ok. Worth what you pay. Doesn't come in blue but in green. It kind of looked cheap so I took the charm out and put it on a bracelet instead. Pendant is the size of a quarter.
3.0,"Several of them had bent posts and the the posts turn my ears green, but for the price they are ok"
3.0,"My sister in law always says this phrase to my son so I thought it the perfect special little something gift from him to her for Christmas. She loved it bc it's from him but the quality on the charm itself is not the best. Looks like peel and stick silver coating and there is a visible thick seam that runs around the whole round charm. the bracelet itself is nice and smooth and the little dangle charms are cute, but the large one looks cheap."
3.0,"Looks good in picture.  Once you wear it it, looks cheap with the thin synthetic leather.  Size is not true.  There is no way to adjust it to make it fit. Regret buying this."
3.0,"These are really cute shoes, however, the fastener for the shoes is poorly constructed. I wore them once and the shoe would not stay fastened. I returned them."
3.0,"These are bigger than I thought they would be, but then again I have small ears. Cute for short-term, but I wouldn't leave these in for longer than a day. I have sensitive & oily skin, and my ears are already turning from these earrings. I wore these out yesterday to a family thing in the park, and it's summer so it's hot and I'm sweating. I'm keeping them, because they're super cute, but know they'll probably turn your ear a little green behind the earring. Also these don't stay put very well--I keep having to rotate them back to where I originally positioned them. Probably one of those disk-backs would help."
3.0,I dislike the fabric
3.0,Good value but broke rather quickly
3.0,The material is not pleasant to the skin. The hole in the crotch for peeing is very uncomfortable. Put it on once and just could not wait to take it off and since then I thought I'm going to use it again but every single time just thinking about putting it on makes me to cringe
3.0,"Very cute bibs but I was a little disappointed in the quality, the fabric was VERY thin."
3.0,OK do not think the leather is actually leather.  Fit a bit long for the size.
3.0,Wrinkles after it’s washed. Clings.
3.0,Too heavy for my face.
3.0,"I like them, but they are longer than in picture"
3.0,"They ride up when you bend over or after sitting. But after a quick adjustment they pretty much stay in place and bonus, helps flatten any fat lines from underwear or jeans etc..."
3.0,"Not for me. Cheap, thin, wrinkle prone material. Pretty color, but bust was tight if you are larger chested, size up. Definitely need something under the lighter colors, not sure if darker are better. For reference I ordered a medium and am 5’4”, 32DD, and 155lbs. For $35, I expect better quality than this."
3.0,"It doesn't look as well-made as in the picture, but it's still a pretty cute style so I kept it. It runs true to size."
3.0,Doesn't look that much like a snowflake.  The flake kept sliding down the chain as well.
3.0,I guess for the price.....? Very under whelmed!
3.0,It was ok the design didn’t look 3-D at all.
3.0,"These are nice thick warm comfortable socks that go up pass your calves, great for lounging around the house in or may work good for snowboarding."
3.0,"not any where as good as the old one I've had for 30 years, but then what is."
3.0,It didn’t fit me well on the top or bottom so I returned it.
3.0,I have a few dresses from this company and I love them.  Have to say that they fell a bit short when it came to this dress.  Don't completely hate it but definitely wouldn't purchase again.
3.0,"As others have notated as well as in the description, this jacket runs small... however, it should be noted, it is &#34;slim&#34; fit, so that needs to be taken into account before purchase.<br /><br />After reading about this, I decided to error on the side of caution and order one in a men's large. It did not fit my husband who normally wears a large in t-shirts at all. Too short in the sleeves and too tight in the chest. Passed it on to me, perfect fit in the arms.. obviously as a men's slim not exactly designed to contour around womanly chests!  We are saving it for beach trips with the kids to use as a quick sun cover up getting out of the water instead.<br /><br />So the cons are most definitely the missed mark on sizing. That being said, if the sizing had been correct.. I would have ordered a few more for the whole family. I love the contrast between the black and white color theme and the material is very soft against the skin. My favorite part of the jacket is actually the breath-ability of the fabric. Due to a genetic disorder, I am allergic to sunlight so regardless of the weather, year round I have to wear long sleeves and jackets to stay protected.. as you can imagine, that can get very hot! This is the perfect material to feel cool. I will be keeping an eye on this one to see if the sizing gets worked out so I can try it again hopefully for the whole family.<br /><br />I received this free/discounted sample of this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review"
3.0,It has been over a year since the purchase of this belt and I use it regularly. It is time for a new one though as it shows normal ware and rare of usage. I rate it a 7 of 10 and will buy another to replace it
3.0,Not true to size. These were GRANNY PANTIES
3.0,"The fit is fine, but the finishing and fabric just give the overall impression that this is very cheaply made.  My wife got it for Pickleball, but she won't wear it."
3.0,they bust quick.  durability has to desired
3.0,"I had 2 minor problems with this item is the size. There is no sm/med/lrg option, its just huge.<br />I had to cut the back of the mask down and modify the back so it fit my head (Medium for most items).<br />I took the material I cut from the back to modify the jaw line. The mask is supposed to have a gaunt appearance, but due to the size of the mask the mouth area would not naturally cut inward giving the sunken feel that was intended.<br /><br />That being said, once I made the modifications to the mask it fit well and looked great Once I complete my costume for halloween Ill add a pic here. My suggestion to the manfacturer is to maybe market this as a One-Size-Fits all and have lines drawn inside to guid folks as to precise location to cut if a smaller the ""huge"" head needs to fit inside."
3.0,"Okay shoes. However, the material doesn't seem to hold up well. The first day my daughter wore the shoes to school, it had that old look to it already with some scratches. The quality was a little less than what I expected unfortunately."
3.0,I purchased the Xl based on the chart information but is was too big for me. Purchase I size smaller. I didn't like it does not have an adjustment strap.
3.0,Product was as described but don’t buy it in hopes of long term use. The straps started coming apart.
3.0,Parece un suéter sencillo
3.0,Got a 24x36 and it has slight pixelation. If you get anything bigger than 24x36 it will be painfully noticeable. Other than that the quality of paper it’s on is pretty good so you are not gonna have to worry about those tiny dents that reflect light.
3.0,It's.. Ok. Im 5'1 and it comes a little past my knees and a little baggy. My husband said it looked like an old lady dress on the way to church :(<br />Not really what I was going for. The fabric is very thin and doesn't feel like great material either.
3.0,"The only complain I have about the product was the fact that they were rusted when I took it out of the package. I was supposed to return them, but didn't have time."
3.0,"It seems to be constructed well and the business cards and credit cards fit nicely. However, it would be nice if the center pouch were a little large to accommodate some cash."
3.0,"These were just too big for the little girl I was buying for.  Also, they were ""steel"" and I returned for Sterling silver smaller unicorns. They were just klunky and heavy.  They pulled MY earlobe down when I tried them on.  Seller was good."
3.0,"Unfortunately the top came in with a ""run"" right in the front chest area. I got this for an event, it's a shame because the top is otherwise nice."
3.0,"I thought this would be a cute set of bracelets to wear with summer outfits.  I guess this is my fault for not paying closer attention to the ad,  but I was disappointed when these came and they are all attached in one piece so they can not be worn separately.  Because of the metal piece holding them together for the chain and clasp, they bunch up and do not space out nicely as shown in the photograph in the ad.  They overlap each other so it doesn't look as nice when you wear them.  I also found that from being packaged the leather bracelets have creases in them from being folded that don't seem to be going away.  The price is inexpensive so I wouldn't bother returning the item, but I was hoping it would look more like the ad and not a squashed pile on my wrist."
3.0,"I attached one of the badge reels to my lanyard, placed my fingers on the front and back of the reel to adjust it, and the glass bead on the front containing the pretty marbled image (the entire reason I ordered this particular set of badge reels) popped off in my hand. I should be able to glue it back on myself, but I sure hope the retractable cord part of this thing is more durable!"
3.0,Love the dresses!! So much that I ordered 3 in different prints. The only down side is the all 3 got holes in the armpits after the first time being worn. I had to sew each one to continue wearing them
3.0,"They fit well and a decent price, but there is a CRAZY smell with these leggings - insanely pungent almost like something is burned and I've washed them 4x times already, the smell is still there.  If I knew the smell wouldn't go away after numerous washings I would have sent back right away.  Now I'm just hoping by some miracle the smell washes out at some point."
3.0,"It's a cheap product.. and its definitely low quality matching the price. small print is really difficult to read a lot of bad ink. Inside the ring the 1 in 1st is supposed to be red. Requested a Kirby smart name. But got ""Bennet"" with the ""KS"" below it. Sizes seem a little large so if your an 11 get a 10. Overall worth the price tag. Shipping was about a week late came from China."
3.0,Although this had some nice beads the leather was very thin and not braided so it looked like it would fall apart or break easily.<br />Other bracelets I ordered from this Brand appear to be of better quality.
3.0,"Somewhat runs small.<br />I bought a xxl, after reading other reviews, but still too small. Very pretty print and lightweight fabric is pretty."
3.0,the top fit large
3.0,Nice umbrella but the anti fade claim is incorrect. Had mine for a year and it was in storage for several months but is has faded badly.
3.0,Good for a child 6 to 10 or so. One hat worked perfectly and the other one worked for about 5 minutes then the lights went out. Thought it might be the batteries so I changed them but still didn't work. Sadly these are being returned l. My boys really loved them.
3.0,It is a nice belly ring. The head is smaller than it looks in the picture so that's minus.
3.0,"I ADORE the bottoms. The top, however, for me personally was a joke. I'm a size 10/12 depending on the brand. And a 36/38D. I couldn't even get the top to stay up. I will say, instead of returning the set, I ordered a different top, because I loved the bottoms so much!"
3.0,This is such a cute set. My daughter & her friend loved them. For the price they are super cute but they break fast & easy. Not tough enough for a kindergartener.
3.0,Wasn't true to size. Small in the bust line.
3.0,The shape of the arm on the clothes is different from the actual picture.  The clothes delivered are short sleeves and the ones sold on Amazon have long sleeves.
3.0,Runs small size up
3.0,"It looks very cute and my daughter loves the bright colors, but the swim suit bottom is very loose."
3.0,It's a pretty ring. Runs smaller then some of the others I've purchased but pay attention to the silver PLATED. Turns my finger green.
3.0,was really looking forward to this but it was too small
3.0,"It’s cute and fits the waist but I have to wear a tank underneath bc it doesn’t cover the bust even halfway. In fact, it actually highlights your chest bc of cut. some ladies may like it but I bought this for work. It’s definitely not as cute as the photo. I’m 38D, 144 and I bought a medium.  I missed the return deadline unfortunately."
3.0,Made from sorta cheap material and backing bends to easily. Wore it a few times and now it fits to loose
3.0,"Wish this scarf was bigger, otherwise it's okay."
3.0,The color is different than picture shows. It’s more of a hospital blue.
3.0,I purchased these socks three years ago and then again just recently and they are not the same quality of socks as I previously purchased. The ones I originally purchased are much warmer but still thin. These are thin and not warm at all. I will use these as more of a spring/summer sock than winter sock.
3.0,We bought this for homecoming for high school.
3.0,Good for cosplaying and playing dress up :)
3.0,"Small and tight.  I even sized up. 5’5”, 130lbs. Tight neck and arms."
3.0,"Cute little necklace, the name is over an inch long, but mine was supposed to say ""Brooklyn"" and instead said ""Reese"".  It just so happens I know a Reese, but it would be weird to give my random half-niece a necklace with the card ""I heard the most beautiful word today and it was your name"".  Anyway, it's nice but try to get the proper name."
3.0,"They are cute, but small! :("
3.0,The chain breaks easily! Put it on a more sturdy chain before wearing
3.0,Are usually buy the same leggings in a medium and they were very small.
3.0,I like an needed the color ivory...They are too big but they are thicker..does not fit like tights....Get a size smaller ladies...
3.0,"This dress is really cute, but is super uncomfortable around the breast area. It is tight and makes your chest look smushed."
3.0,"Keeps time o.k. so far but the date changes  whenever it wants to.  I thought it would be at midnight, but somrtimes it doesn't turn over for three or four days at a time, whenever I set it.  I have just learned to ignore that feature"
3.0,"If a cap could ever be called ""formal,"" this is it. A little large for my head, what with the cross-sizing approach, but sufficiently structured that its panels grab and fit me well enough. I tend to prefer a more casual, slouch construction, I realize now. But I'm not returning it because of how well it's made. That quality of the cap, as well as its soft lay on the head, are very strong arguments for keeping it. And, probably, if a picky S.O.B. like me can be won over, the rest of you should have no issue."
3.0,"Well I've had these for a while now so I'll give you some pro's & con's.<br /><br />Pro's<br />The color's are beautiful! These bra's are way fun! They give you a bit more size on the bottom. Meaning they are a good push up bra. I've been told my boobs look bigger. How awesome is that! Great price for so many bra's! Received exactly as described & in a timely manner. Made pretty good for the cost. Comes packaged in a plastic bag so they are kept clean through shipping. Holds up well in the wash but I put mine in a wash bag & wash them in that. If you don't have one, I highly recommend you invest in one. They will save your bra's & lace underwear big time!<br /><br />Con's<br />The round piece that holds the strap to the cup is very flimsy & has broke on a couple straps. Not a big deal! I just sewed them back on & they look great. The sliders on the strap always slid back down to the cup. Does not let my straps be as tight as I like them. I also wish they were on my back not my front. They don't fall off my shoulders though so that's good. Just wish the sliders would stay where I put them. If I got an A cup this probably would not bother me so much. They are, how should I say, cuppy. I wear a 36B & they don't form to my breast right. I would suggest going down a cup size. They still look great on, they just have to much top cup room. So if you like to wear low V-Neck shirts & you bend over, everyone gets a boob shot because the bra holds the shirt off your chest but doesn't hold your boobs in the bra. Not ok!!! This is the worst part about these bra's!  But again, if I'd gone down a size it probably would not be a problem. Moving on... on the side's they are put together with an additional  seam that has a flexible hard something inside so that it doesn't curl up on you under your arm pit. I wear my white one the most & so it has the most wear. This spot has started turning into my side & drives me nuts! I no longer wear it because of this & am going to throw it out. Time for a new white bra. In other words they are around 4-5 month bra's with every day use. But really, for the price, that's not bad!<br /><br />So there's my opinion... I really hope it helps. Would I buy these again? Probably. You can't beat the value. It's worth it. And the colors are awesome! Was hoping for closer to, oh, around 8 months of use but heck can't complain."
3.0,"It's a nice robe but the loops for the belt are way too high. If the belt is through the loops, it's tied practically under my armpits. If you don't use the belt loops, as soon as it comes untied the belt falls to the floor. There's no win. Maybe if you're 5 feet tall it wouldn't be an issue."
3.0,The design of this romper was super cute but on me was very baggy. I bought a L and could have bought a medium with possibly a better fit. The top was baggy but the bottom half fit perfect. It just made me look like a blob.
3.0,The dress is nice quality. My issue is that the dress is way to big and the area where the slits for the dress is they are all werid and does not hit me where it should. Nothing like the photo. I'm gonna try to use a belt and see if that helps at all.
3.0,"with your waist 36,  better choose 40 or 42.  I chose 38 got only the last hole to barely fit.  The belt itself seems to be made with quality."
3.0,i ordered normal size m wayyy too big so i sent it back very long very strechy waist band could have gotten smaller size
3.0,Fits way smaller than the size should be. Unfortunately life got busy and I missed the return window.
3.0,Could've been just a tiny bit tighter
3.0,It a ring
3.0,Order a MUCH larger size than you actually need
3.0,"I liked the simple style of the necklace,but it came severely tarnished. That was disappointing."
3.0,"I’m a size 00-2, 32B/C and ordered a Medium. I should either be an Extra Small or Small. But Medium is still tight and runs a bit small. Reordered a Large and hope it’ll fit better without squeezing out any muffins around the pits area Nice material but don’t like how the straps are way too close to the neck rather than towards the shoulders and that they sit at the center of each bosom. The removable pads that came with these are oddly shaped that it looks like a blob of icing on top of a cupcake 🧁. I like them though, so I’m going to replace them with better quality pads and either cut off the straps and sew them where I want them or just not have them there at all like strapless bandeaus."
3.0,"Ordered the fender hat, received an NY hat. Definitely not what we wanted but ended up keeping it cause I used to live in NYC."
3.0,I like the way they look but i don’t like the material. It’s scratchy
3.0,Oversized really wanted to fit me but nothing like pix
3.0,"It's cute!  It's soft.  The flap does not naturally lie down the way it does in the picture provided but if you mess with it long enough, you can get it to fold.  The material is on the thin side, which isn't necessarily bad, just worth noting.<br /><br />The flap is my biggest peeve, and therefore I do not reach for this like I thought I would.  In fact, I've worn it once.  Maybe you could pin it down?"
3.0,sizes are not accurate.
3.0,"I did not get the colors that were pictured. The quality and everything else is great though. I'm sure I was a one time mistake, but still sad :("
3.0,"purchashed a size 14 for my 10 year old. It fits nicely, it is a litle big (expected this) but is very short. It barely covered her bottom, so she would not be able to wear this dress without pants. Ended up giving it to my 7 year old who the length fits perfectly."
3.0,Just had to put it in the trash after one season because one of the straps broke already. They are very thin.
3.0,I ordered a medium- I am size 6-8 in pants and small-medium in tops. This dress was way too tight but I am curvy. Not bad material & wish it had fit.
3.0,"They are okay. One of the favorites that I liked (Ying/Yang) choker broke without me even knowing it. It really hurt me cause I truly liked that one, but other than that they are fine."
3.0,The bands don’t seem to fit my watch correctly. Moves and clicks
3.0,"I finally wore these & liked them. When I 1st received them I was bummed/disappointed because the back is so ugly & I am picky ab that...but, I finally put them on for St. Paddy's & liked em:-)"
3.0,The headband itself was a beautiful turquoise color. It is also very well made. The problem for me is I have very fine hair and normally have issues with head bands slipping off. I was excited that this head band ran smaller than other ones that I have had. My hope was that it would fit. The material itself was very slick so the band woulld not stay on my head. Unfortunatly I had to return it.
3.0,"The socks are in a cute package and I like the variety and designs, but I found them to be a bit too thin and thus snug. I'm a sock aficionado and know that I can be more sensitive to tight socks so they might be fine for most."
3.0,"This item came with the chain broken in it's package. Thankfully I was able to fix it and it's going to work, but I was not impressed."
3.0,It's big but comfy.
3.0,"The sweater was extremely large. It went down on my knees, but the sleeves only went to my elbows. The fabric, felt cheap and itchy, but was thick and would keep you warm. The green was a perfect match to the picture. I ordered an XL, and I am 5’9” and 150lbs. The fit and quality are expected for the price. I did return this, but it seems that you could get 1-2 uses out of this before it tears or rips."
3.0,"This tank definitely runs small. I normally wear an XL and ordered the 2X based off reviews. Still pretty small and not flowy. Also really thin material, makes it sheer, I'll have to wear a cami under it.<br />The print is cute though, it'll work for the country concert I'm going to but I'll probably only wear it once.<br />For the price, it should be a better material and not so thin. Definitely a little disappointed in this item."
3.0,Wasn't expecting low cut.
3.0,"The 38D fit more like a 36C. As I tried to fasten the band, I felt some threads snap. I couldn't get it on to wear it to give feedback but it generally feels thin and flimsy. I passed it on to someone smaller than I am and haven't heard back. This one isn't one I'd buy in a larger size to try."
3.0,"Fits as expected but it's not the material I expected.  I specifically looked up this particular combination of cotton and spandex. It smells like sweat (as certain cheap version of cotton/spandex do) if you wear it once and it's hot outside, and I do wear deodorant every day.  Also, not the texture I expected.  I have nightgowns 95% cotton 5% spandex that feel cool and soft; this one doesn't feel the same."
3.0,"Kind of big a little bit, but it’s okay."
3.0,Thin material....short and small.  Will work as a shirt with leggings rather than a dress.  Order size or two up.  Great price and shipping was fast with nice packaging.
3.0,"its ok, affordable too. It is appropriate for the worker who work in a metal free zone or company."
3.0,To small in the shoulders
3.0,"My husband loved this set when I got it.  He has used it 3 times for work trips.  On his most recent trip, there is a crack by the wheel.  The wheel is still in tact, however, I don't know how much longer it will last.  This happened on the largest case.  The other pieces are still in good working order."
3.0,Smaller and thinner than I expected.
3.0,"I will say there was good coverage on the bottoms it wasn’t cheeky at all. I have a bigger butt so on me it did look like a biggo pair on granny panties. Top had very little support for D cup, felt like if I was swimming or at the beach something might slip. The material was nice and the color was pretty."
3.0,"I was looking for a short brimmed cap that wouldn't push down on my sunglasses when wearing a headset.  Maybe because I have a full head of hair, this didn't fit."
3.0,"These do not stretch AT ALL! If you don't have slim calves, you will not be able to use these unless you're okay with having them rest at your ankle. The colors are amazingly vibrant but the leg warmers shed like crazy."
3.0,"Love the shirt, being that it's cute and glittery you would assume it is ladies sizing. Don't be fooled.... I ordered an XL thinking that and it arrived as my new nightgown:("
3.0,"Everything as described except no, it doesn’t glow in the dark. Someone asked this and the seller responded “after a couple times charging it glows”; maybe I don’t know how to properly charge something that glows in the dark. I figured just, you know, being in the light for a long time. Maybe I should leave it outside for a few days and try again. 😂"
3.0,"The shirt itself is oversized, but the sleeves are fairly small!"
3.0,These run small! Go up one whole size for a good fit. Other then that it looks to be decently made. Not sure how long it will last though.
3.0,ok for the child i bought it for.
3.0,I expected it to be larger than it was. This is a Lil club purse or for a toddler.but it's cute
3.0,First day wearing it and the threads in one of the sleeves are coming out. I love the design and the material though
3.0,"These are pretty and I like the cotton content and feel against the skin, but they SHRINK in the wash/dryer! They also come out of the dryer all... crumpled? Which makes them harder to fold and put away. They are also shorter and smaller than I'd expect, and I only wear a size 8.5 women's. I would not buy these again or recommend them for the price."
3.0,Hurts my foot 😞
3.0,"They should glue or secure the rubber protectors, they come off easily without knowing it and scratch your lens"
3.0,"admittedly, I'm used to a small manual umbrella (perhaps too small because i can't find my usual one). this umbrella is fine.<br />however as neatly as i folded the umbrella frills of fabric, I have yet to be able to fit it back into its sleeve.<br />its sturdiness adds a bit of weight.<br />and not too sound too feeble, but it is actually a bit of a struggle to fold back up. like reloading a crossbow. the extra effort in folding it up detracts significantly from the convenience of a fast open.<br /><br />also, i was afraid the extra layer of fabric to cover up the moving parts would make the umbrella too bulky, but in retrospect i should have sprung for it because my hair does get caught up :/"
3.0,The quality is fine but the size is much smaller than usual。
3.0,"Looks like a pajama. The sizing is good, my Daugther wore her usually size."
3.0,good I like it.
3.0,"Handmade glass is one of my favorite things to wear in my stretched lobes so I am no stranger to sizes being off by +/- 1mm.  However, one of my squids was 7mm (a 1g) which was fine considering the nature of the product, and 2.75"" long.  The other is 6mm at the widest point (a 2g), and 2 5/8"" long.  This seems to be more of a QC problem when pairing and labeling the jewelry than actually producing it.  Because I don't plan on stretching my front lobes right now, as I'm already between a 0g/8mm and a 9mm - a 00g in some brands - I opted for my normal 0g size, and will just need to wear them with earskins, as they are a bit weighty.  This is fine for me, but it shows a bit of gap in my front lobe that O-rings would be able to slip through, but earskins would add a bit of grip and keep the hole the right shape.<br /><br />I love how these look the same on both sides though, so unlike some some types of dichro jewelry (these are not dichro) you only see the glass patterns on the 'fronts', and my ears don't face that way on my head.  The one thing I really don't like about this particular brand/manufacturer (no idea who made them and they were not packaged well at all - I'm surprised they didn't break in their box before I opened it) is the huge gap between the longer curved tail and the shorter spiral tail.  Obviously a gap is necessary in order to get them in but as you can see from my photo it's REALLY BIG.  Unless a person is looking at me in profile this is what they are seeing, which looks a bit awkward.  It isn't just the gap though, as there isn't much of a curve at the top to position them to lie with the design facing even slightly forward."
3.0,What caught my eye about this item was the color as I really like how royal blue looks. However upon receiving the item it wasn't as bright like the product listing. The small size runs a bit loose on me and probably goes a size down would help.
3.0,"I love the look of it, but it's HUGE! I bought this for my 6 month old, and it looks like It could fit a 2 year old at least. So it will go in his closet and I'll now be that mother who puts her 2 year old in a romper."
3.0,The bee is small. The picture made me think it would be more visable. They are still nice
3.0,"I want to really like it. It’s acceptable, and looks good, but the metal ring that attaches the paracord to the band sometimes rubs on the bony part of my wrist causing minor pain. It doesn’t happen all the time and if I feel it happening I can turn the watch a little bit."
3.0,Great watch but crappie components. Band broke after 2 weeks.
3.0,"lacks luster, but good enough for casual dressing. Comfortable to wear, sewn on a elastic band, no knots between pearls."
3.0,The bow does not match the suspenders very well. Quick shipping though
3.0,"I hate leaving negative reviews but here we go. First, I paid for the fastest shipping and it came 5days after expected date. Second, I tried contacting the seller could not get in touch. Third, I received a strapless dress when I did not order a strapless dress. Last but not least the measurements that they have for the dress are 1/2in off around the bust. Outside of that it is a beautiful dress!"
3.0,This product is exactly as described and it’s very pretty. The only thing I dislike is it’s small which makes it very tight on the wrist and I can only wear it for a short amount of time before it starts hurting my wrist.
3.0,Material is thinner than expected
3.0,"good boot, wrong fitting for me"
3.0,This material was thinner then I expected. The images make the dress seem as though it’s thicker then it came. It’s a bit smaller then I like but I’m in the middle of a new weight loss journey so I may use it as  goal dress. It fits buuuut I wanna be a show stopper. I just lost 7 lbs so far! 💪🏽
3.0,"Looked nice but after a few uses, the colored transferred to the skin."
3.0,I love the color and style if this shirt but qhen it arrived and i tried to wear it i found that it was huge on me! I made sure to order what the size chart said i would need but that definitely wasnt accurate. Its great for the fall or with layers though because its thermal material but isnt too thick.
3.0,The gloves keep my hands warm. I have to press hard on the phone screen for the gloves to work.
3.0,This pj runs small so a size larger is easier
3.0,Before 3 washes. This was super cute! The leggings were a baggy fit but still cute. Too bad it doesn’t hold up after about 3 washes. The leggings are super nasty faded. They look 5 years old after only 3 washes. The top however has held up great after washes. My daughter loves it either
3.0,It's a cute dress but made for someone wide in the shoulders and very narrow in the lower body.
3.0,this was smaller than ki originally expected based on another bag i own that is also 40l.. bought it for my husband but ended up keeping it for myself as it is more on the too small size for him.  i used it for a day bag when we are doing things outside the house.. haven't used it to hike yet but it has all the right pockets and adjustable straps so i am sure it will be perfect
3.0,I liked it a lot but even though ordering 2 sizes larger was still too small. Have to return and won't be able to reorder as sizes run small and I ordered largest they had. Seems to be very nice would liked it to have fit as it was what I was lookin for.
3.0,I have a bigger than average head but this thing comes all the way down and rests on my ears - the hat is too deep.
3.0,Way too tight and short for a 2X
3.0,Tight in the butt and elastic waist is snug.  They are a very fitted fit.
3.0,the quality of the shorts is superb. But don't put anything of value in the pockets as they are about an inch deep.
3.0,It was nice but he size 8 was really a size 7. But it was really pretty.
3.0,My son likes wrestling shirts
3.0,"You have ""Pink"" listed as the dark peach color & ""Watermelon Red"" as the light pink color. Is that correct?"
3.0,Too tight the size does not match my hand<br />Good product...
3.0,"I bought this necklace for my niece as a gift.  It was so pretty in the picture, but no so much when I opened the box.  still deciding if I will keep or return for something else?"
3.0,"This is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!!  However, it is WAY TOO BIG!! I was so excited to take this with me  on our trip to Dom.Rep. tomorrow, but there isn't any way it's going to work.  I usually wear a size 2 or 4 so I ordered a Small, but it fits like a Large."
3.0,"The quality is a little flimsy, but good at the price. I have been using them for a month now to store my dirty gym clothes, to avoid the reek from sinking into my gym bag. The seam appears to be heat pressed and separated a little bit at the edge closest to the top of the bag when I tried stuffing a sweaty judo gi in it."
3.0,looks great but leather wears very quickly
3.0,"The bottoms are great. However, the top is way too big. I am a 34DDD and the fit is all wrong."
3.0,They are cute but have a fairly strong chemical smell. Good fit including height.
3.0,I love the shirt but extremely small in size.  I ordered up and still not sure about the fit.
3.0,Runs small and very scratchy fabric.
3.0,Cut smaller than I expected...
3.0,I loved the fit everywhere but the chest.  It is so beautiful but would not button up.
3.0,"I returned it because it appeared smaller than expected. Also wish the straps to be a bit longer to carry on the shoulder. The look of bag is average, nothing special"
3.0,I had to buy a second one for my nephew because the first was small. Seller gave me a good deal on the refund & I did order the bigger size because i haven’t found a Dino suit anywhere else. Material is thin & kid probably should wear shorts under it.
3.0,"The glasses are okay.  The build is fine, the lenses are fine.  It's an overall decent product.  The main problem I had is that I was under the impression that they were silver, not gold.  The front picture is somewhat misleading.  I went back and looked because I thought I had gotten the wrong thing and found that they were indeed golden on the page, but frankly I wouldn't buy golden framed glasses on purpose.  When they arrived they were very much bent and needed serious adjusting.  It seemed as if someone had already worn them:  The nose piece was way off, the left arm was bent to contour a head while the right arm was not, the center frame stabilizer above the nose stabilizer was so badly bent and off that I had to take needle nose pliers to them being careful not to damage the frame using a felt cloth to bear down on.  The package states that it comes with a sleeve that I did not receive.  The glasses were in some sort of plastic when I got the box, with no glasses sleeve to be found.<br /><br />Overall I don't mind the glasses, but I'd rather have just bought a 5 dollar pair at Walmart if I wanted the headache of having to bend them up so much without an sort of case or sleeve to speak of.  Regardless of that, the lenses look cool and wipe finger prints away pretty easily so I'll still wear them, just not with the satisfaction I thought I would have."
3.0,These were smashed when I got them and you could see the underside of the rabbit fur. But that means they are real rabbit. The color was nice.
3.0,They are a little wider than expected
3.0,"They are adorable, but the bows are unraveling after minimal wear and no washing. It was also listed as prime shipping but then the seller unapologetically indicated it takes weeks, and it did.<br />So, if you order weeks in advance and want them just for a special occasion or photo, you'll be happy."
3.0,"It’s too bad these didn’t fit because they appear to be well made, I love the wide leg and the color is perfect for Fall! I could only get my thigh half way in the pants leg. I ordered my usual size and these don’t even come close to my size. Other than the sizing issue these are nice pants."
3.0,"These are not in fact, similar to the normal hospital socks that you would get. They are in a sense with the grippy’s on the bottom, but they shrink quite a bit so I would suggest buying a size up. Nonetheless, they fit, and do the same job."
3.0,I'm not a large woman... or large chested woman. This shirt has a major case of bacon neck. The shirt is only long enough to cover the bust and it flairs at ever hole.<br />For the price its..... ok.
3.0,Fit for the head is too small. Protection from cold is good.
3.0,These leg warmers were way too big and when I tried to wash them it made them even larger. :( Not too happy
3.0,"The pants fit good, I love the stretching material, it curves with my body. However the top was a bit small and tight around my arms. Also the band across the top of shoulders felt odd. I'm 5'6 176lbs ordered a Large 36DD"
3.0,Much shorter in length than shown by what the model is showing in the photo.
3.0,"Very stylish, doesn't offer a lot of shade in bright sunlight, the hd vision is slightly noticeable. The lenses however scratch pretty easily after I left them in my carrying case."
3.0,"I'd like to love this gorgeous watch but it hasn't been telling time accurately, I have to  manually adjust the time every 2 weeks , it goes about 2 minutes slow every 2 weeks, very annoying. I've had swiss watches before , consistently accurate, but this watch doesn't do it."
3.0,Nice shirt.  Nice quality.  Very fitted  but not too tight.
3.0,it came so vacuum packed that I still don't have all the hard wrinkles out of it
3.0,"Other than running a little tight through back, my biggest issue with this coat was that the shoulders stood up like something on a uniform. Not a good look."
3.0,"Nice material but if you are a taller girl, these run short"
3.0,Fits a litter shorter than stated.
3.0,Gorgeous dress but if you have a booty and want to sit without showing of your peach I wouldn't suggest. Or if you do want to show off your peach this is the dress for you! I'm 5' tall and it barely covers my bum.
3.0,"I ordered size 9 which usually fits perfectly. However this shoe came in a 10,  also it is too loose. It is adjustable but not to the point where it is tide enough for me, and I do have wide feet. The only reason I did not return the shoes is that I needed them with in days to wear with a certain outfit.<br />I do like the look of the shoe."
3.0,These were pretty small but other than that very pretty.
3.0,It fits a little small. The material is thin. The leg material rolls up and could cause chafing.
3.0,The dress is too small for 4 years old. Ordered 5 thinking it might be little big for her and she can wear it next year too but it is too small to wear it this year forget next year 😌 . Giving 3 star for the nice stitch and for these fabric. Very nice feel and well done. Will not order again though.
3.0,"Too big, but super cute and accurate.<br />I'm a small (5'6&#34;, 125lbs, 34-27-36), but I went for the medium based on recommendation."
3.0,"Muy lindos pero no son tan fieles al color  como en las imágenes, solo me llegaron 59 y el paquete es muy pequeño se estropearon algunos. Pero son funcionales."
3.0,I love the shoes but I had to return them because they were not wide enough.<br />The return was easy with no hassle.<br />I wish the shoe came in half sizes!<br />I gave them 3 stars because I really liked the shoe.<br />Also I am a size 10 but I bought an 11 because of some of the reviews.
3.0,"It was really pretty small... more than 'somewhat.' I could JUST get into it, but it was very very tight (and I normally wear a 12 in most jeans/shorts and ordered a 14 because it DID say it ran small...), and the little hook and eye popped off the first night.<br />I can't send it back, because I really needed it for a play I was in over the weekend for our local historical society, in which I played a lady from 1895 - and I WAS able to squeeze into it enough to wear for all three performances. I would have ordered a 16, but I waited too long and those appeared to be out of stock.<br /><br />Oh well. Maybe it will be an incentive to lose weight! I did get some nice compliments about it..."
3.0,"Se nota que es confortable, pero me quedo muy pequeño"
3.0,"I wear 1x but ordered 3x, the 3x for."
3.0,"I like the size of these lenses, but both pair I ordered have broken where the ear piece attaches and are not repairable.  To bad."
3.0,Material of this shirt from the description picture looks light and flowy. I was hoping for that. It’s much more stiff of a fabric and heavier. The collar is not distressed as it appears in the picture.
3.0,Didn't fit the way I thought. Pretty baggy
3.0,Holy Cow way too small!  ordered a large and it was still tight on for my daughter.
3.0,the size Large is too small.
3.0,Cheap. Design is very sheer - you can see through to the blue shirt. One use only.
3.0,"This slip on shoe looks cute and I'd hoped to make it my new wear-around-the-house shoe, but the size and fit is awkward. The toe box is more wide than what you'd expect from a show not identified as wide.  In hindsight, the fact that it's marketed for bunions should have been the give away. The shoe includes an alternate insole, which didn't really feel too comfortable. If you need a wider fit, this shoe might work for your feed. Sadly I'll be returning these for something else."
3.0,"I haven't worn it yet, but looks OK FOR the price it is nice, is the flower made from ivory, it looks like it  ."
3.0,It's for those who do not have a bust. It gets too short in front.
3.0,They sent me a small and I ordered a medium but the product is good. I really like the pants.
3.0,there was a hole in it but it does what it needs to.
3.0,It's an okay belt but the buckle broke after a few weeks of use
3.0,Just as described and as it looks in the picture but too small and the fabric is too heavy.
3.0,It was pretty but too small and somewhat tight around my wrist. But the bracelet matched the earrings I was wearing exactly so I wore it all evening and got used to the tightness. I am sure I will wear it again when the occasion arises.
3.0,I didnt get the free clear encasing that covers the screen. A lil bit of false advertisement
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:2961d34fdf8032d4c462a1d195d54471]] I should learn to expect lower quality for the price I pay 😂 but the material is nice? The buttons accurate.. it is just weirdly cut. The top is too baggy in the mid section, shoulders slopped strange, has shoulder pads, the arms are short and snug, and the skirt is just too small.<br /><br />I’m not sure if I want to return for large size because then the top will need major adjustments, but as it is now I will need to adjust the skirt.<br /><br />I’m a size 8 dress,  5’3”, according to size chart I’m a medium, but this Large is not even my size. Confusing"
3.0,First i ordered the pink and got one with crown spelled cronw and then i wrote the  supplier and received a replacement the wallet is a nice colour and pretty to look at however i am a little disappointed once u load up the wallet with all ur cards it gives trouble to close u almost have to force it shut but the qaulity is good and i will use it for a bit
3.0,The Face Mask is too small y like a S.
3.0,"Mask was super cool and creepy, my son loved it. Unfortunately, it shorted out before Halloween leaving him devastated.  We were able to rig up the wiring behind the mask and did get it to light up for trick or trick which was good."
3.0,"I purchased this shoe in tan and navy. They're nice looking on the foot. They fit well. In my experience, they were comfortable for short outings and sitting events. They were not for walking over long periods of time. The heel does not give and therefore feels harder and harder the longer you walk/stand in them."
3.0,"Very cute but cheaply made, again."
3.0,Order a size up. Definitely runs small.
3.0,The glasses themselves were very cool and sharp the only problem was within the first hour of wearing one of the main rhinestones fell out we were lucky enough to find it so I had to reglue it and it should be okay now but the craftsmanship is you get what you pay for they're not Armani's
3.0,The cleaning solution is a 10 out of 10 but the brush I give it a 6.5 out of 10 .  The Bristles in the brush just started falling off on the first time I tried used.
3.0,The colour was good but the fitting was not<br />It was too big. A size down would be a better fit.
3.0,Definitely not like the pic but I was still able to use them.. They were ok :)
3.0,This is a nice shirt! Its great material and my daughter said its very comfortable. However I purchased it for me but it is a size smaller fit than I ordered. XL fits like a M-L
3.0,I bought a larger than normal size hoping for length between crotch and waistband.  Too short in that area but legs are very long.
3.0,"Colors look as pictured, but material is very thin and see-through. Good for the beach, not for much else."
3.0,I ordered a bigger size and it’s still looks small but over a cute look and love the pants
3.0,This hoodie is too short bobied and I’m short. Poor quality but it was relatively inexpensive so this is an example of you get what you pay for.
3.0,I measured my body and ordered the XL size. According to the data image on the product page an XL compression shirt is the correct size to order for those with a chest measuring 39-41.5in. My chest measurment is 43 so I ordered XL expecting it to be very snug in the chest and a bit loose in the waist. It's a nice shirt that fits generally skin tight but it offers ZERO noticable Compression. I'm not unhappy with the fit but it's certainly not fitting like the compression shirt that I thought I was ordering would. I will probably exchange for the smaller size.
3.0,Funny story I ordered this product and picked the pictured product and picked it in black and got something totally different in a dark navy.  I'm still giving this 3 stars because they are nice....  funny that they are not even close to what I ordered.
3.0,I it doesn't fit.  I ordered  the wrong size
3.0,"I bought it for my 16 months old daughter. The shoe looked great and she loved waring(walking) it. But after couple of months use(indoor), one of the  squeaker stopped working."
3.0,"The sweatshirt looks awesome and the fabric is very soft, but the confection is wierd, too tight on the arms and mainly because the white band in the middle of the arm is from a different fabric that does not work as the rest of the fabric and it (the band fabric) shrinks when you wash with cold water"
3.0,Dress is true to size and perfect for the Sock Hop Party.  It is high maintenence woven cotton with no stretch.  It will be difficult to care for when unpacking on a cruise.
3.0,Dress colors are nice; fit perfect I’m 5’5 180 lbs bought a large — only complaint is the material .. it feels very cheap. Not sure how it will hold up after a few washes
3.0,Bottoms are too large. I wish the top and bottom were sold individually or that you could choose the size of the top and the size of the bottoms. Not all women are shaped the same. We all need individual sizing.
3.0,"usually wears medium, bought the large but doesn't fall the way it does on the pic"
3.0,Keeps choking my bisepts. If there were a bigger size I would not have a problem.
3.0,I sized up for this product but the top ended up being too big and didn’t stay put during my workouts. Absolutely love the bottoms! I wish the fit was better.
3.0,VERY SHORT i’m 5’5 140lbs and it was like a t-shirt but i made due. this is my mikan cosplay. it’s fine quality. came with a nurse hat? didn’t have any way to attach it<br />insta aiire.exe<br />tiktok aiireee
3.0,Looks good but too snug in waist.
3.0,"A little thinner than I had hoped for, but a nice shape."
3.0,"Product: Athmile<br />Athmile Men's Compression Leggings Pants, Baselayer Running Tights, 3/4 Cool Dry Sports Capri Pants, Camouflage, Black<br />Color: Grey Camo/black half patchwork<br />My expectations were so high with this product but it was not what I am thinking. It is somewhat small so order one large size more than your actual size. I will give 3.5 stars for this compression because they don't look what the money you are asking about. The pants are also very well constructed and should last for quite some time, the fabric seems poor quality but may be I am in a hurry. I will wait for few days then I will update my reviews about this product. I know what gonna affect your feelings if someone spends $12.98 for this compression and expect that its a worth of money and he or she had a great deal.<br /><br />Thanks, team Athmile, Appreciate your efforts for this Compressions. Best wishes"
3.0,"Cute shirt, order an XL. Was closer to a medium. Had to give it to someone else."
3.0,"So far it looks good. But as to whether it will tarnish, hard to say at this point since I just got it. But loosk good"
3.0,This is a tish small....and I have a small head....but I can wear it....and I probably will...
3.0,"For the price it is acceptable.<br />When I found this I thought I was getting a bargain, it looked like a decent costume piece make of a thicker fabric, with a loose cut.<br />What came in the mail was something different.  It's made of a thin polyester, the quality is good, but it's not what it looks like in the picture.<br />I ordered the XXL cause I was hoping it would be on the large side.  I'm 5'7"" 200 lbs I'm on the stocky side, I have broad shoulders and am deep chested.  That being said it fits tight and long.  Even the arms are tight, which look like they should be roomy in the pictures.<br /><br />I'm hoping that it will work for our trip to the ren faire at the end of the month, but I'll probably re-enter the market, or maybe I'll seriously look for something there despite the high prices cause I can't find anything that fits here online."
3.0,This shirt is really thin and seems cheap.
3.0,These are very warm and cozy but definitely run large. I am a 5'1&#34; women. I can wear them but they are too bulky to<br />Be &#34;stylish&#34;.
3.0,Thought it would be thicker.
3.0,The color and size were perfect but was not impressed with the material.
3.0,"I'm an avid SoCal paddleboarder and have purchased about 6 waterproof socks from Amazon and other vendors. I was looking forward to these socks because of Sealskinz reputation, but they did not work - socks filled with water - I could feel it seeping through the material. So back they go and I going back to my previous waterproof socks! Sorry Sealskinz!  UPDATE: I emailed Sealskinz and they told me socks were not meant to have waterline go over top of sock."
3.0,They stretched a bit after washing but like the colors did not rin.
3.0,"Thought I bought all Five, pictures are deceiving must read quote entirely next time...."
3.0,"Nice jacket although some of the button holes were too small.  I had to cut them to make them big enough for the button to fit.  Ultimately not a big deal, I'm just hoping that the material does not ravel in those areas over time.  Other than that it's a quality jean jacket that is pretty soft, not too stiff."
3.0,"Not as long as expected, very light, see through, looks good."
3.0,Im 5'5 and 135 IBS . I had to get it tailored just a bit
3.0,This is a really nice dress on and nice material. The arm holes are small can feel  tight. Unless you have teeny arms it gets annoying after a while.
3.0,Attractive but when it's cold out my fingers freeze.
3.0,Not too amazed with this dress
3.0,"I am a total Whovian, so I was pretty excited when my wife got this for me, but it isn't perfect. Mostly, I would have preferred the sweatshirt to be Tardis blue instead of the dark navy blue, and I would have rather had it be a more athletic/fashionable fit. I am in fairly good shape and this hoodie fits my shoulders, but is very baggy in middle. It reminds me of the type of cheap sweatshirt you would whimsically buy off a street vendor while you were on vacation. The good news is the material, while not very soft, seems very durable and will keep you warm on a brisk day. The silkscreen has held up to quite a few wash cycles as well. The &#34;FOLLOW ME&#34; on the back will eventually attract a mentally deficient person and they will follow you until they get distracted, so be prepared for that.<br />Ultimately, if it was a lighter blue and had a tailored fit, I would buy 2 more."
3.0,Thinner than I thought they'd be.
3.0,"First Pair I tried, all pearls went lose."
3.0,Flips and flops with a slight wind
3.0,"If you aren't planning to use these for exercise (but rather for lounging around the house), these are perfect. So soft and comfortable, which is why I was disappointed that the waistline does indeed slide down if you bend forward. I'll be regretfully sending these back, but gave at least 3 stars for comfort level."
3.0,The only problem I have with this shirt is the picture depicts the shirt as flowy this is a very stiff that shirt it is not going to flow it's more like the look of a trench coat then a flowy shirt that's the only problem I have with it other than that it's super cute
3.0,Not form fitting at all.  But I will make it work
3.0,Dress was smaller than expected and print doesn't look that nice up close.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:bdd66069a8fa87719a033441302d954d]] I love this watch band,  I've had it about 2 months and when I put it on this morning this happened.<br />I am disappointed because I didn't even wear it every Day,  only to work.  Never got it wet, not sure what happened.<br /><br />It's very comfortable & bigger than  you'd expect.  I wish it would have lasted longer!"
3.0,I ordered an 18 inch sterling silver 18 karat gold plated chain--I received a small chain which just goes arond my neck.<br />Don't want the hassle of returning it--but I wish I had received the size chain that I orderd.
3.0,"My granddaughter has not worn it,  she is 13 yrs old."
3.0,Bought same dress in a different color from a different seller and sent this one back. Sleeves were too big and did not fit as nice. Paid $1 less here. But had to return.
3.0,This isn’t a good top if you have a boobs. I’m 34C/D and it stuck out around my chest/arm holes.
3.0,"Bought the first pair, loved them. Substantial in weight, clasp worked, although a bit hard to open at first. However, they only lasted 1 month before the post broke off. Ordered a replacement pair, and they are gorgeous, but not Rose gold in tone. Gave 3 stars bc if the quality st the price point. Beware of inconsistencies in color."
3.0,"This shirt is really difficult to review. If I were judging based solely on the appearance, I would give it 5 stars. It's truly beautiful, with bright and bold colors and a gorgeous design. The material is light and soft, and falls nicely.<br />If I were, however, basing my rating on the fit... I would give it one star. I honestly can't say whether it's too small or too large. It's just not right. I followed the instructions and chose a size larger than normal. Admittedly, it does fit. But the neckline dips nearly to my bellybutton, while the rest of the shirt fits pretty well. I'm not entirely sure what body type it was designed for, but it certainly isn't mine. It's really unfortunate, as this shirt has such potential to be fantastic.<br />I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
3.0,"One was sort of broken, but the other 2 were fine."
3.0,Pants fit perfect. I bought the pack of two to save money but the shirts was definitely too small. I would have liked to be able to buy the package deal but with two different sizes
3.0,"Ok, not great but does the job. Looks like the dome is on a generic base cut for multiple domes."
3.0,"Jacket was pretty nice. But while we thought we used the sizing chart correctly, they appently run very small. Had to return it at my cost. Not a particularly happy Prime Customer. Return shipping was 25% of the jacket cost."
3.0,"It fits well, looks super cute, needs a petticoat....but thr fabric is cheap and I can't get the wrinkles out from when it was shipped"
3.0,"The tank top is cute, but too small and needs to be returned because of that. I bought it as a gift for a relative who is thin, and she needed an extra large."
3.0,for a price these are good gloves. They are thin and breathable but i worry they do not protect as much as i would love.
3.0,"surprisingly, this is a chunky and weighty ring.  unfortunately, the quality wasn't great.. the ring was irregular and slightly damaged... but it was okay for the price."
3.0,The perfect gift for my daughter!
3.0,I gave 3 stars because it’s the same as the pic but they cut the bottom of my lip and press up against my gums
3.0,"Bought it as a birthday gift for someone,  was Very disappointed,  the blue ring in the middle wore off, and so did the  black finish on the ring,  it's not worth the money."
3.0,Was not as heavy as expected. Bottom of band needed to be tightened. Returned this item. 😞
3.0,nice fit but way to long for us short people
3.0,"Took it out of the shipping package and my hands turned blue. Wearing this when doing yardwork and hoping it doesn't rub off onto my hair and face. Can't wash it or it probably will be ruined, so I'm hoping the pigments ""cure"" and stay. The hat is unlined and the material seems a bit thin."
3.0,"Good quality, but too tight"
3.0,the stitching on one shoulder/sleeve is poorly done.  Otherwise nice item
3.0,"Cute style, thick warm material. However , the material develops pills. I haven't even washed it... pills developed in a couple days wearing it. I wear medium clothing... I ordered a large. Fits too good... in afraid to wash it."
3.0,"Way to small, size misrepresented at purchase screen. Nevertheless, it was very pretty and delicate. Will be giving to my granddaughter in a couple of years."
3.0,"Love the look, but the frames are too short, my glasses extend blow these."
3.0,"Elephabt is really pretty, the gold of the gold necklace is really too gold, tacky looking, but can easily switch necklace. Also, it was bigger and heavier than i thought and its for a ten yr old girl, so i might put it on a keychain. It really is very pretty, but not so sure i can use it for the gift it was intended to be"
3.0,The shirt did not run as an xl size.  The shirt fit my daughter perfect and she wears a small size in shirt. Something was wrong with the sizing.  The shirt overall is beautiful and material is good.
3.0,"Coat was actually very soft but was it worth the money? No. I believe you should maybe go with one size higher than what you actually wear not 2 as mentioned by other reviews. The cut of the coat is very squared and stiff, no body contour at all so when you wear it you end up looking like a giant black bear. It did have 2 hidden clasps to close from the front but I will end up returning as I was not satisfied with the fit or quality."
3.0,One of the screws came off after a couple of week of light use. They feel a little cheap. They are comfortable and provide good vision.
3.0,They arrived already with a tear. Cheap stitching.  Do not buy if you plan on working with these on.
3.0,"For $20 you can't really go wrong, especially with the Timberland logo.  They fit a little tighter than I expected.  Still not quite sure they're polarized but the sticker on the lense said they were highest UV protection.  I'll have to go fishing soon and test the polarization"
3.0,Unfortunately these have absolutely no compression. Decent tanks for working out but definitely not what I thought I was buying...not worth the hassle of returning...
3.0,"Super cute outfit! Top was awesome the bottoms are long enough but there is a lot of fabric at the crotch, it almost looks as if you’re sagging. I wouldn’t buy it again because of that."
3.0,"I've had these for a few months, but I've worn them no more than 5 times and saw this in the seam in between my legs. Normally this happens after 1-2 years of regular use for me. The texture of this legging is nice, is very soft like others mentioned. But I prefer a cotton for breath ability. And this is def a full synthetic material. I also like to wear leggings under maxi dresses and these created static for me."
3.0,These were just ok. The ruffles were gathered more on one which gives them uneven appearance.
3.0,Chain easy breaks but otherwise pretty.
3.0,"I ordered this product looking for a masculine but stylish pendant and necklace. It certainly looks fine, but the forehead of the lion has a large notch in it, as if someone had struck it with a jagged object while the steel was still hot. I'm able to pass it as wear and tear, and it gives a more rough appearance, but it's definitely not what was advertised. Furthermore, the clasp was broken on delivery, and I had to buy a new chain the day I got it. It's alright for a one-time purchase, but I would definitely search for a different brand next time."
3.0,"These arrived quickly and were exactly as pictured, though a bit larger than I anticipated.  They were carefully packaged and arrived in perfect condition, very well made, however they are way too heavy for my ears.  They were uncomfortable as a result when I tried them on so I'll be returning them.  Disappointed because they look so cute on!  Maybe will be okay for some folks, but I'm afraid they'll pull through my ears."
3.0,The dress overall was decent quality HOWEVER the stripes of the dress were showing through Santa’s white beard. This made the beard look really weird and I ended up returning. I’m not sure why they didn’t throw in one extra layer of barrier fabric between? I know the price is great though so maybe it’s worth a shot if you can get past this flaw!
3.0,"The crucifix is not as I expected but okay. The chain it came with was not that great either. But, because I spent $25 plus shipping, i didn't send it back. I purchase a smaller stainless steel crucifix and chain for less money from a competitor  and it was a real nice."
3.0,"I thought it was going to be more like a messenger /duffle type bag. It's small so the pic w/ it displayed around a lady is misleading. It has the potential to hold lots of small items. It's more of a purse for a teen. I had plans to order more colors but not at $18...They are worth $7-$10. If the price drops, I'll buy more. And it came very quickly!!! Thanks for that."
3.0,"This product is cute, but it came tarnished. I tried to clean it up, and it mostly worked. Just disappointed that they would send it in that condition. Should have been sent looking new."
3.0,"So, I ordered 5 keychains and they all came today. A couple are very different than the 3 I had gotten for my husband. This is my last review and it's on the two I had my kids do for their dad.<br />The quality of the pictures aren't as great , the engraving is actually nice. But I'm very worried about the picture chipping as is my husband as these are his gifts.<br />I ordered two different style keychains for my mom and sister and the picture quality is crazy different.<br />So these will work for now, but will be ordering from ones I feel are better quality."
3.0,"I thought it was a beautiful product until I put it on, went to tie it and then it cracked at the nose in half.  Now it's useless.  Not sure if it a defect or because I live in a colder climate."
3.0,"Cheap materials,  but fits as expected"
3.0,"It's not the best cardigan I've had. It's kind of frumpy. The worst thing about it for me, is this material. It wrinkles so bad. I ironed it this morning and when I got to work I got out of the car and it was a wrinkled mess. Gross. Won't buy again"
3.0,"These yoga pants are pretty but the sizing is very small. These were supposed to be for me, so  I ordered an XL size.  They fit my 13 year old daughter that weighs 97 pounds."
3.0,It was toooo small for my husband!!  Need to return<br />Thanks
3.0,"I am a floor nurse with high arches and plantar fasciitis. I love these shoes as far as look, fit and comfort, but in just 2 months I have a hole in the fabric."
3.0,It was cute for the price
3.0,These are super cute but very wide. My daughters were tripping over their feet and I had to return them. Super cute though...
3.0,"The furry part came off after two hours of using them, had to glue them back on.."
3.0,Thick & soft.<br />Teen son with hyperhidrosis (excessively sweaty feet) likes these a lot.<br />They hold a LOT of sweat. Also hold water from washing long. Recommend drying separate on low or line dry.<br />Our experience is that they can get holes fast so definitely going to try drying differently to prolong life of these socks.
3.0,"I have smallish hands and ordered the medium, but it was far too small and so I had to return the gloves unfortunately."
3.0,"I really like this cuff for certain events, it’s pretty and really sparkles. For long use wear the wire inside starts to rust and the beads will fall off.. again nice for show but not long term use."
3.0,Smaller that I anticipated my laptop barely bit. More purse  than a laptop bag
3.0,Did not expect it to be so small.
3.0,"My daughter still wears it, but its fake.. Even though its fake, it fits as expected, and has good material!"
3.0,I had to cut out the shelf because it was WAY too small. It hardly covered just half of my breasts.
3.0,"Cute dress, picture deff makes it seem cuter than in real life.  Deff size up.  It IS NOT A FLOWY as the picture shows.  Ended up returning."
3.0,"My wife is not 100% convinced that these pants are a good value for the money. The overall fit was reasonably comfortable (though there is only a modicum of stretch), the material is breathable and light weight (not what I had expected from wool). The lack of belt loops seems a bit presumptuous as the the perfection of the fit (my wife likes belts).<br /><br />Overall, these are environmentally friendly material, but the fit and features did not appeal to my wife."
3.0,Very nice fabric but found it on the large side - too wide.  It's also a bit see through
3.0,The sock is fine but the toe is a little too big and bunches up.
3.0,"They’re great but I have 1 pair from Amazon (grey) and got 1 from barstool (purple) and they’re slightly different material, both super comfy but the Amazon ones shrunk so bad in the wash and I’ve washed the barstool one numerous times and they haven’t shrunk a bit"
3.0,This was very wrinkled whether I air dry or put in dryer.<br /> I do not have time or desire to iron a work hat. I want something that comes out of dryer smooth.
3.0,I like the lite weight and flow of this style pants and these met my expectation
3.0,Snap closure broke off after a few days.  My son still uses it because he said he doesn't need a snap anyway.
3.0,"it is beautiful, fits perfectly......but I can't wear it.  on the bottom row of sparkles it came with a patch of missing sparkles....so sad."
3.0,I don't know why but this is determined to get tangled in my hair. It's so frustrating I don't even wear it. But it is definitely cute and the quality is surprising!
3.0,"This is see through and a bit rough. Even after washing and drying it was rough. Cut is very boxy and not very flattering. The shirt is made well, but nothing spectacular."
3.0,"These glasses have nice lenses and come with a variety of colors, which is nice. I don't like the frames though. On one side the ear piece can hyper extend past the normal position significantly. I think this is so that they will fit on a variety of face sizes. They issue I have is this then makes them feel uneven on your face. The earpiece joint doesn't hold in place as good as it should for being adjustable.+"
3.0,head piece kept falling. the color was more of a rusted silver.
3.0,Leggings are nice but it's not made for a woman that has a slightly bigger behind. Maybe overtime from wear and tear it will fit properly.
3.0,"Really cute shirt, nice quality but it fits me weird. Probably because I have wide hips and a small waist."
3.0,They slide right off my head.
3.0,The zipper is on the left which is very weird and hard to get used to.
3.0,"Another one I had purchased for my Mother's 90th birthday.  A little too dark for her, but a very nice dress.  I returned it but never received credit for it however."
3.0,Pretty nice very nice design in front and the backing nice all swirled at a great price.I like it.
3.0,"These glasses are exactly as they appear in the photos and I really like their optics. On the other hand, they arrived with one of the nose pieces bent  and both needed adjustment. Also, these are extremely light weight glasses making worry about their durability. For comparison, my previous pair of polarized  aviators, which cost about $4 more at Academy, are much heavier with a thicker metal frame. For the price I paid I'm happy and I plan to keep them."
3.0,They are very cute..only thing is that on one if the shoes might be the left one.  At the top its a slash in it and could be the way its made. I return one pair and purchased them again thinking it was mistake...
3.0,The shoe is elegant but is narrow at the toe.
3.0,I had to return it because of the size 😭<br />It is so pretty though
3.0,Cute but not as high cut as it looks. A good cute “mom on the go” bathing suit that dad will like mom in.
3.0,The fit is exactly like any other juniors clothes and I'm happy with that (do not buy expecting them to fit like women's or misses shirts). The black and gray are a bit see through (though not as bad as some others currently on the market) which I'm not thrilled about. I want my shirts to be opaque and this is the only reason for minus stars. Great shape and very pretty overall.
3.0,They didn’t fit my expectations they fit too loose and are made of flimsy material. Not something I would personally wear out of the house Incase it would tear. Ok to wear around the house. But for the price it’s better than a pair of flip flops :)
3.0,not bad quality for the price.
3.0,"love the style, but the first day the clear gems came out. cheaply made"
3.0,Great material. Run small tho.
3.0,Item was good until you try to touch the screen of the series 7. Edges are partially covered do to the protective cover.
3.0,did not go a good job with glare  fit well
3.0,These are nice and tall but they don't stay in place well and they don't do much in the control department. I will not purchase more.
3.0,Too thin. Non lining
3.0,Decent quality socks but they are NOT non-skid. There is no grip on the bottom.
3.0,Love them EXCEPT for the fact that they are partially made of wool.  Would prefer 💯 cotton.
3.0,I like this watch. It looks amazing but it was way smaller than I expected. This is still a great dress watch.
3.0,There were only 3 in the package and the description says 5
3.0,heavy
3.0,"I tried the dress on, it doesn't fit and I ordered a size up to have more room.  My daughter can wear it...that's why it wasn't returned"
3.0,"CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP! The front clasp is made of plastic so if your top heavy, the material goes lopsided where the clasp connects. It fit perfect... but it was made fairly cheap."
3.0,You have to get a size larger than original size
3.0,"Cute for a while but the “rose gold” wore off after month or so, so I had to buy new ones.  You get what you pay for, I guess."
3.0,"Hat to small for my head! Still very cute, I’m going to try and stretch it out when I get a chance!"
3.0,Cute but thin metal
3.0,Fit small. My child is 3 but wears a size 10 shoe. Looks like they are assuming size 2T-4T is size 4-7.  I should have looked closer.
3.0,"definitely NOT this shade of purple....appeared to be larger in the photo's (says' messenger bag, however it is my fault for not actually looking at measurements....) I would not have purchased if I had known the true color, and size...but my error, I will donate to local thrift store."
3.0,Bigger than planned
3.0,"Nice size = good, only printed on one side = bad, made in China."
3.0,"These earrings are pretty nice, very cute - but not  3"" long nor 1.3"" wide as stated in the description.  They are actually only 2 3/4"" inches long and only 7/8"" wide.  I was disappointed.  Gave them to my daughter."
3.0,I like it enough to keep it but I did buy for y teenage daughter and the quality is low and the threads were already pulling.  The material is very thin. I won't return it because at the price I guess the product is what you would expect.
3.0,Super cute suit- it just runs quite large.  The baggy aspect looks good in the picture but when it is on you looks super saggy.. have to return it
3.0,"Pros-nice looking.  Nice feel.  Fits well.  Cons-supposed to be a shapeware item, however the elasticity of these shorts is minimal so not a shaping product.  If I was only purchasing as stretch shorts, they would rate higher but not for the reason purchased as well as advertised"
3.0,"Print location on dress looked odd in mirror, maybe okay to lounge around in, but I returned it, it was thin and needed something under it."
3.0,"The colors are pretty, but the dresses are cut to hang like a tent.  The fabric is thin and loks cheap. I am retuning the outfit."
3.0,"For single-use, disposable gloves, these serve their purpose, although the size says large, they fit a normal-sized hand just fine.  They also do not cause as much sweating as the thicker disposable gloves.  There is one problem with them, they are very difficult to open at the wrist end so you can slip them on. Takes me five minutes to get at least one of them open every time I want to put them on!"
3.0,"I bought this dress for New Years. I ordered it 2 sizes up in a 16, I wear a 12 normally. Its was maybe a US size 10 when it arrived. WAY too small, I couldn't even get it completely on. Very sad."
3.0,Nose piece on goggles broke the first time used.  Balaclava is good and wind proof.
3.0,"Cute belt, fits perfectly"
3.0,Good looking  but it difficult to use
3.0,"Very snug in the arms, even after following the suggestions from the size chart."
3.0,I ordered a Medium and the bottoms fit perfectly! Just the right amount of booty being shown and fit great around the waist. Thick fabric good quality but the top really lacks in design. It’s not as big as the picture shows. It’s a lot smaller. Like a tub top with a choker. The top wasn’t flattering at all considering I don’t even have boobs. Had to send it back for a different suit instead.
3.0,"Not under color I expected, it was Light green turtle shell color."
3.0,"I bought these particular pants because a Youtube reviewer said that they're bomb proof. They are not. And the back pockets look really weird.<br />  On the whole, they do their job and are comfortable. Just don't expect them to last."
3.0,"First off, the good stuff...  It is beautiful in style, true to size, and soft and comfortable.  But the negative...  I ordered the rose red.  What arrived must surely have been a wrong item.  It was the brightest, gaudiest shade of hot pink I have encountered in a while.  I should have just sent it back.  Instead I tried to dye it darker with RIT dye.  It worked - sort of.  Now it’s a deeper hot pink but still way brighter than I like.  Keeping it but not thrilled.  Still, I love the style. I may reorder later in a different color."
3.0,"The chain is way too short, and the clasp doesn't work well.  Get a different chain.  Annoying."
3.0,It doesn’t work. So I sent back. Got new one very fast. It doesn’t work either
3.0,"Like that it's rayon, not polyester. Dislike that it runs smaller than what I bought 2 years ago. No, my weight did not change, but their sizing did. Actually, this is a decently made product but they need to upgrade the prints with the times."
3.0,"Cute, smaller than preferred, and the colors were actually red and blue, not purple like it looks online, but still okay.*Update* just under two months and it broke..."
3.0,"I got this for my grandma, since she was never really a jewelry person, and she loved it! Only issue is that it broke off the chain it came on, so now she kind of just carries around the charm. So definitely be careful if you get it!"
3.0,"** 2.75 stars **<br /><br />The dress does not fit true to size. Size L fits like M so you would need to order size up for comfortable fit. The color is vibrant, the top part stays in place, and the straps hang in the middle of the upper arm just like the picture indicates. The front of the skirt consists of two flaps one on top of each other but they are not connected at al,l and when you walk or wind blows, your whole front is wide open down to your underwear! Honestly, who proof wore that dress!  Either a pair of leggins is required or good skills with a sewing needle!"
3.0,Fairly see through.
3.0,"Made decent enough for the price, but are so small, I cannot comfortably wear them.  Tight fit in every area."
3.0,Great swimsuit however it lasted only for a couple of weeks. I had bought it for my daughter as a early birthday gift but the sides ripped after she swam for a bit. My daughter was not the happiest but it was great while it lasted!!!!!
3.0,"I like the watch but it's not very petite as far as the band goes, My wrist is small and the band is way to large for me. I hope I can take out some of the links to make it smaller."
3.0,"estaba bien emocionada esperándolo para el viernes de luna llena y poder activarlo. Llego hoy domingo (tarde) y llego rota la cadena. a mi gusto es extremadamente delgada. no se si tenga que ver el precio por que antefiorimente nunca había comprado algo parecido. Esta muy bonita el empaque bien, trae una toalla para limpiarla. pero simplemente no podré usarla por que está rota."
3.0,Comfortable but a bit long for my style.
3.0,They look as advertised but shrink horribly in the wash.
3.0,Not too bad. A little small
3.0,Sizing is very different from previous purchase of this dress.
3.0,One of the lenses popped out on the first day on the field. Embarrassing
3.0,Cheap quality and material but looked great on
3.0,They are comfortable and the price was right. They are not made to last and the fabric is very thin
3.0,"These masks are pretty, and they seem well made.  They run a little larger than most masks.  My wife says they feel like a loose diaper.  She loves the pictures, though, and wears them regularly.  But they aren't her first choice."
3.0,The coat is a nice coat but I had to return it due to the bust area. I have a large bust area and even though I could zip up the coat they were a little smashed. The coat is not too thick. I think it would be okay for a mild winter but not extreme cold. The length was long enough and I had shoulder and arm room. Overall it was an ok coat.
3.0,Its pretty wrinkled after drying. Not a sift shirt for sure. Just ok
3.0,"A great deal for the money as it is a very pretty scarf, but it comes all the way from China and it took three weeks to get here."
3.0,"More for younger girls! I have average sized calves, but they are to tight unless I use them only with ankle boots"
3.0,Looks great and feels very nice. Had a small tear in it upon receipt along a seem. Will have to repair
3.0,"these are really big. I'm 5'5' 140lbs and these are too big! plus they are hard to put on, the holes are huge!"
3.0,"I love kickboxing--in fact, it's one of the few forms of cardio that I truly enjoy.  Unfortunately, I found this DVD to be disappointing.  The moves themselves were fun and the combinations were mostly interesting, but I did not click at all with the teaching style of the instructor, Ilaria Montagnani.  In this workout, Ilaria teaches very LONG combinations of punches and kicks.  Although she teaches in an &quot;add-on&quot; style, starting with a few moves and then adding on new moves, each time she goes back to the beginning, she does NOT cue the moves!  For example, she will simply say &quot;let's start again,&quot; and then the reviewer is expected to recall all the moves up to that point WITHOUT Ilaria saying what they are.  This is made even more difficult by the camera angles--e.g., sometimes the camera is focusing on Ilaria from the waist up only, so you can't see the kicks that she is doing.<br /><br />If each combination was short and repeated many times, this might not be such an issue, but as noted above, the combos are quite lengthy.  I have described each below.  To make matters worse, the combinations are DIFFERENT on each side of the body--in her Introduction, Ilaria says that this does not matter, as you will be doing about the same number of punches and kicks, but it definitely felt uneven to me.  All times listed are approximately.<br /><br />WARM-UP (5 minutes)<br />Mostly alternating punches front, including jab, cross punch, hook, and upper cut.  The front push kick is included as well, but no other kicks are practiced in the warm-up.  I set of push-ups is performed at the end.<br /><br />PUNCHES (7 minutes)<br />Here Ilaria introduces a long punch combination.  The combination is performed for many sets (12-16?) on one side, then repeated on the second side.  These are the punches (slashes denote where each piece is added on):<br />jab-jab-cross / hook-cross / upper-cross / fast 3 right-fast 3 left / jab-cross<br /><br />KICKS (10.5 minutes)<br />This was more drills than combinations and was easier to follow.  Ilaria begins with a front chamber/front kick.  Next is a side chamber/roundhouse, building up to three roundhouse kicks.  The third kick was the crescent, starting with alternating knees to the side and then adding in the crescent.  Finally, the side kick was performed with a chamber/side kick, then moving on to a double knee/side kick/squat.<br /><br />COMBINATION #1, LEFT SIDE (6.5 minutes)<br />knee-double front push kick / opposite knee crescent / walk around, opposite knee roundhouse / squat-roundhouse-knee / double roundhouse / jab-cross hook-cross upper-cross<br /><br />COMBINATION #2, RIGHT SIDE (6 minutes)<br />jab-jab-cross / front push kick, 2x / opposite leg crescent / walk around, opposite leg roundhouse / squat, roundhouse x3<br /><br />COMBINATION #3, face forward (10 minutes)<br />hi level block to side / mid level block to side / alternating sides with side kicks / karate punches<br /><br />STRETCH (3 minutes)<br />This is a very brief segment that includes a low back release, a lunge for the hip flexors, a standing side stretch/backbend, and a standing triceps stretch.  It did not feel adequate given the overall length of the workout (over 50 minutes).<br /><br />I actually liked the moves in Combo #3 the most, but I also found this combination to be the MOST frustrating!  Ilaria's cuing seemed almost totally random here, as I could never figure out which side she was going to next; I don't think she worked the sides evenly at all.  It didn't help that the music sometimes would drown her out (and on top of that, I found her accent sometimes difficult to understand as well).  I will say that Ilaria DID give excellent form pointers throughout the workout.  Personally, however, I wish she would have spent more time actually cuing the moves themselves."
3.0,It's ok.  Doesn't lie flat on me.
3.0,"Pretty shoes but they pinched my toes and were loose in the heel, so I couldn't size up."
3.0,Cute nightie but sizing runs very small.
3.0,It’s too big but I like the color so I will keep t
3.0,Be aware that if you order small the actual tag on the shorts will say large.  Is a bit confusing.  Shorts do fit well!!!  Easy returns!  That is a plus if you don not like them!
3.0,Fit is larger and the color is not anything close to skin color. It is comfortable though.
3.0,They run a little on the small side
3.0,"Es lindo pero la tela es como naylon, es más pequeño que la talla que compre"
3.0,"Sillier fabricates brighter color than expected. Seems well-made, but runs a little large."
3.0,Extemely small for youth size. They are difficult to put on. I got them for my special needs student. Not a good purchase.
3.0,Very small for a 2T
3.0,Mui grande
3.0,"Very comfortable but wrinkles and rides up the legs, that was a deal breaker for me so I returned them"
3.0,Ordered one size larger than usual and still really tight.
3.0,"Not for curvy girls like me. I'm skinny but have large hips and big butt, it does not work for me. It's high waist, I could still try to style it with a belt but it does not fit me well. It's small on the thighs and large on the waist. The style is cool, but the fabric is cheap and not soft or nice to the skin. Not comfortable. It might work for super skinny girls with no curves."
3.0,"I wish I had read the reviews closer before purchasing this wallet. Like the other reviews, the credit card slots are pretty useless. The cards fall into the slots and you can't easily pull them out. The slots go down the length of the wallet instead of just being the length of a card. This was extremely disappointing and I doubt I will ever use this wallet because of that unless I can figure out a way to fix this. The wallet otherwise is super cute. I love the black exterior but the bright colors on the inside. If the credit card slit issue was resolved, this would be a super awesome wallet, especially for the price!"
3.0,"It does what is it says, I would use it as a finishing polisher, need some instructions for it's care."
3.0,Not as nice as the ones I’ve worn fir years. I think they discontinued those. I needed new ones still on the lookout for something better.
3.0,"Socks feel pretty warm,  but they are the largest size and they nearly are too tight for me. I got them for my dad and his feet are larger than mine, no way he can wear them. My feet are size 10 and they are really tight on me!"
3.0,They're alright I guess... rhinestones aren't as fine as the picture looks. And  I don't like the colorful rhinestones though
3.0,Me quedo pequena...debi comprar talla M
3.0,Flowers are not near as pretty. Fabric is blurred and not near as bold as picture. Luckily the price justifies the purchase.
3.0,"Lovely dress. WAY too small. She wanted a picture in it when we tried it on even though we couldn’t fully zip the zipper. She’s 10, wears a size 10 primarily. We ordered an 11-12 and had to send it back as it was too snug in the bodice."
3.0,It broke in two places with in a month. as long as you don't try to adjust it it would be great
3.0,The top does not look as it pictured. I ordered red color size small but it surely lose. The artpits are wider and flowy. The material is soft and light weight. It does not stick body.<br /><br />It is cute for casual wear.
3.0,"This watch band is nice and comfortable.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it snags on my cloth, especially sweaters."
3.0,They feel great on the inside. Nice and soft but my hands still got cold unless they were moving. Keep your hands and fingers moving and they will stay warm (could just be my circulation). There were a few things that I did actually have to remove my glove to accomplish such as finding the right key on the keychain and putting it in a keyhole. Overall a pretty nice glove.
3.0,This is absolutely adorable but I have a 3 year old who is small and it is almost too snug. Definitely size up maybe 2 sizes.
3.0,"I haven't worn the dress yet but the fabric is very flimsy - again, your pictures led me to believe it was a more robust weave."
3.0,Thin material makes me a little uncomfortable to wear in public. I guess I lack confidence lol
3.0,"Ordered my size and way too tight in the bust. I am returning it. Nice fabric, I’m thinking about ordering the next size up."
3.0,La calidad es buena pero el tamaño es más grande que el esperado
3.0,There is bit of a confusion about which side is front or back due to the cut. I have found that the white tag inside the shirt should be on the left side when worn. I hope this helps.
3.0,material thinner than expected. The color was not as crisp. I liked design on shirt. I think my Grandson will like it
3.0,"Just OK. The band is short.<br />The light is worthless. Maybe one tenth of the area is lit at all.<br />A cheap, lightweight watch."
3.0,Looks pretty! Didn't really like this. Doesn't fit. Looks weird on my ear. My ears are pretty small. So I assumed it would look nice. But it looks bulky in my honest opinion. Not a fan of these
3.0,"Despite having used the sizing tool on the Amazon site, the size 10s were too short, even though my husband wears a size 10 shoe."
3.0,"It's my belief these have been tampered with. Each blind box was glued and taped shut. Inside the bags were fine and unopened, but you can tell by feeling the bag which food is inside. I believe the more desirable foods were cherry picked then the boxes were sealed back up with tape and glue."
3.0,I thought I would love it but for some reason it's hard to find the right shirt to go under it and for me to not look huge but it's comfy
3.0,The posts tarnished.
3.0,"First, the order said it wouldn't arrive until the end of September, but, it came early, sometime in August. Upon opening the package I knew immediately that they probably wouldn't fit. But, thinking maybe I wasn't figuring correctly, I tried to don said panties and found that they were only a whisper and a prayer away from fitting. Pretty to look at, but comfort was not key here. I kept them hanging on a small hook to remind me to not buy clothing on a whim and to stop shopping while sleepy. Lovely color, sweet silk fabric could use softer thread in the elastic, but a lot of panties are this way and several washings might have changed that. If I were younger, I'd probably try to squeeze into them once in a while, but now... not so much.  Beautifully made, lovely color, soft fabric but not so soft at the waist because of the elastic which is actually below the belly button."
3.0,Good quality rubber
3.0,Too small for a larger melon. So-so quality but prolly worth the $10.00.
3.0,"Has a tendency to stop randomly. However, it looks GREAT and I wear it for formal occasions."
3.0,"I expected the shirt graphic to look a little bit worn and faded because it's supposed to be a retro look, but it's not colorful at all. It's like they ran out of ink -and the green color of the t-shirt tints the entire graphic. It's not bright and bold at all  like it says in the description -very disappointing. The shirt itself is soft and thin, which I was happy about because I prefer that type of t-shirt living in hot Florida."
3.0,Does not look like the picture at all and will be returning. They look cute but they are almost a gym pant material and definitely not accurate for workplace pants or dress pants.
3.0,Size recommendations are incorrect. Comfortable but a bit loose to run and carry a cell phone.
3.0,Super small but cute..thought it was stretch material
3.0,"Pretty tapestry bag, but I will have to buy a black LEATHER strap with nice hardware.  I bought it bc I adore the puppies motif!  The strap it comes with is awful and ruins the look of the crossbody bag!  I knew from reading the description that it comes with a faux leather strap, but did not expect it to be so cheap looking.  A high quality leather strap with good hardware will run about 40$."
3.0,"The colors are nice, but the formulation/consistency is super thin.  You really have to layer it to get a color/thickness that you can't see through."
3.0,Very Nice Shoe Embellishments! But I had to hot glue the clips to the satin bows before attaching them to my shoes! Overall! Very Cute!
3.0,The top fits vey small. You would have to be very flat chested to fit the top. Originally ordered a large and it was way too big. It would fit a 2x. Then i ordered the small and the top was way too small but everything else fit perfectly. Customer service was great and issued me a refund right away.
3.0,It's nice but a lot shorter than it looks on the model and thin material. I am 5ft3in tall.
3.0,This bathing suit is cute and fits well but you can see right through it.
3.0,Material is very thin and a lot shinier than expected.
3.0,"The fit was a little off compared to others in the same size.  The price was right, and you kinda get what you pay for with undies."
3.0,"Product is advertised to have a 12hr/24hr feature, it does not. If it does, no instructions on how and I have tried everything.<br />If you need or want the 24 hour time feature, don't buy this watch<br /><br />Update: After leaving my comment about the 24 function the seller displayed information on how to go from 12 hour to 24 hour display.<br />First, thank you for this information, I believe it would be helpful to include it in the small paperwork included with the watch.<br />Second, this watch does display 24 hour, however the steps and method to switch the display requires changing the time (cycling through the total 12 hour display (both AM and PM) then setting the correct 24 hour time. I was expecting a simple press of the 'function' button, that cycle through Alarm, Stop Watch, 12 hour display, 24 hour display.<br />I would describe this watch as OK, and the watch is a 12 hour OR 24 hour display. There are watches that will switch between 12 hour and 24 hour with the push of one button.<br />My son wanted a watch that displays 'military' time and he is ok with this one."
3.0,"Very cute boots, but the instep was to low for my foot.  Also the sole was so very slippery I couldn't walk easily on either carpet or hard floors.  I'm sure with time, it would have scuffed enough for more secure footing."
3.0,"I purchased these to wear in my 2nd hole but unfortunately they did not look good and hung past my lobes to be used as a 2nd hole earring.  I have them to my step daughter instead of returning them.  SUPER cute earrings, just disappointed they didn't work out for the reason I purchased them."
3.0,this cut is for slim fit
3.0,The top is to small
3.0,Super cute but it runs a little small I ordered an XL if you're 130+ please get an XL!!
3.0,I loved these sandals I just wish they lasted more then one summer.
3.0,"I am 5&#34;7 and 230 pounds I got the xxxl in red , I usually wear a XL or 1x  (16) pants)  it is a bit tight in the breast area and I am not big chested,  I carry more weight in my mid section , it is a bit tight but it is Stretchy and I will wear it , I am wearing a vest over it anyways , but is it a good shirt for the price of 13$. And is so soft ,  comes right to my top thigh , also it is kinda thin you can see my bra threw it but that might be cause it is tight on me ..idk"
3.0,"I'm 5'9, 189 lbs. I just wished for certain outfits they had models that are my size. The dress looks amazing on the model shown in the photos but not on my body. Had to return it. Moving on to something else more flattering."
3.0,"The reason for three stars is these socks are very bulky.  I cannot wear them with by current boots or shoes. They are just too thick.  They make great slippers.  I love how warm they keep my feet.  I would recommend as a slipper, wear around the house kind of sock, not a hiking sock."
3.0,"The OCP shirt I received it’s pretty close to the picture, and description of the item, but it’s definitely not what is advertised.  As a purely personal matter of choice ... for the price, and what I did receive - I’m going to keep it.  Really though, it’s not what was described by the seller.  For starters the collar does not have the Velcro stays.  Also, the side pockets are not the top flaps, but are side zippered.  Lastly, the elbows do NOT have an internal (or external) pocket for elbow protection inserts.  They simply have an extra elbow patch material, like any sort of standard jacket you’d probably buy.  We’re these deal breakers for me?  No.  Those differences I mentioned weren’t things that were “must haves” for me.  Really though, it’s NOT what I was expecting to receive.  If the price had been a little higher than it was, I definitely would have returned them as they are not what was described.  From what I can tell what I was sent is a Gen1 or Gen2 Combat Field Shirt.  The product description (and picture) is clearly for a Gen3 (or newer) Combat Field Shirt."
3.0,"The outfit is cute but not very durable. The feathers on the wings were falling off before she ever even wore the costume. I had to glue them back on. If you moved the wings from one place to another, feathers would fall off. Otherwise the dress fit well and she looked great in it."
3.0,"NICE, JUST STRECHES OUT, BUT STILL  NICE"
3.0,Its okay but not what I was expecting
3.0,These are soooo cute and I was so excited to wear them! I fortunately they are not very sterdy. I wore them a few times and the fish feel off the end :(
3.0,Liked the cap sleeves and feel of the material but the waistline was too short for me so returned it.
3.0,comfy leggings
3.0,Confy but fabric and termination very simple.
3.0,Some of these earrings broke right away.  I’ll use those for parts.  Otherwise a nice set of earrings.
3.0,"Good quality, but runs fairly small"
3.0,Just in picture looks beautifull
3.0,"Very cute, but turned my arm green after only wearing for 3 hours for a beach wedding. I will not be wearing it again."
3.0,They're cute earring but they're pretty cheaply made. They look better from far away. Also the post is extremely long.
3.0,"Very retro-looking shirt. However, it shrunk after I washed it in cold water and hung dried it. Can’t even wear it..."
3.0,"It's a cute shirt.  But it it definitely not for bigger busted people. Im 38G and I ordered up 2 sizes thinking it would work, but will need to return it. Also, the red, is like bright cherry red. Which is fine, just not the red I was looking for"
3.0,"Thin material,not exciting,not attractive,functional and warm weather appropriate.."
3.0,"I am 5'11.  Its a bit short for my body length so it didn't sit on my hips like hers, the dress part was more like at my curves.  Nice material though.."
3.0,"I bought theses because after working 12-13 hour shifts as a nurse, my legs ache!!! I bought the blue ones in size 8-10.... They are sooooo long!!! I am 5'5 and wear an 8.5 shoe. These socks go way up past my knees and are too tight to roll them down. If they were right under the knee as the picture portrays, they would be perfect!!"
3.0,So cute but very uncomfortable. It dogs into your skin so bad that you’ll have red marks/ a rash by the end of the night.
3.0,"great design, however too small for an adult male face. looks great on my fiance."
3.0,I washed it twice and the material is too itchy and not soft
3.0,Difficult to change lenses.
3.0,"I am 5’3” and weigh about 160. I wear size 12 in jeans. I ordered an xl and the waist fit fine. These shorts would probably look better on someone who is more curvy. I am shaped like a square and don’t have much butt, so these shorts were very unflattering. The leg and butt area was way too large while the waist fit. I will return these, but if you’re curvy, you’ll look excellent!"
3.0,a little narrow and i do not have wide feet. They are very hot so would be great if you live in cold weather but I live in Florida. I will wear them and hope they break in and get a little wider.
3.0,"I bought these shoes for my 10 year old. The picture accurately depicts the color of the shoe. It looks great in person and is made of materials that can be easily wiped clean. I cannot, however, attest to the comfort of the shoe. My son is a big Nike fan so I felt comfortable ordering online as I knew his shoe size. I ordered the shoes a half-size bigger to ensure a good fit and growing room. Unfortunately, the shoes still ran too small. I ordered a 3.5 (he wears a 2.5 in other brands and a 3 in Nike) and the shoe is at least a size too small.<br /><br />I contacted the company for a return, but decided to keep the shoe for his little brother to grow into rather than pay return shipping.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great color<br />Easy to clean material<br />Shipping was unbelievably fast<br /><br />Cons:<br />Sizing was off (way too small and a bit on the narrow side)"
3.0,"Ordered up a size (L) for some freedom of movement during sleep; fit is as expected.  A couple of things that could be changed for the better:  (1)  Get rid of the (very) scratchy tag at the back of the neck; (2) Get rid of the ribbon at the front--although cute, it has a tendency to get wet when bending over the sink to wash your face.  Economical PJs, should last a few years."
3.0,wish they were lower rise
3.0,The logo on this shirt is off center.  I requested a refund and return from the seller 5 days ago amd have not heard anything from them.  Now I will need to file a claim with Amazon.<br /><br />The replacement shirt arrived today.  Thank you for making this error right.
3.0,Cheap material but I still wear it just for the saying.
3.0,"The bag is little but it’s so cute and perfect for those days you don’t want to tote a big bag .My wallet, phone and lip gloss fit perfectly."
3.0,The zipper broke after 2 months of light use
3.0,"Not really a push up colombian jeans, but for the price is a good jeans"
3.0,My daughter loves them but I wish there was a few stitches in the roll so they didn't unroll all the time. She has gotten to the point she wears them unrolled like Bermuda shorts but definitely not as cute unrolled than rolled.
3.0,Had a screw fall out of the locking enclosure after 3 days of use. My husband found one a little different in his collection and used thread locker on the screws so they will not come out again.
3.0,I wanted to love these as they are super soft but they roll down with every bend over. I wouldn’t buy them again.
3.0,Too small! Cute fabric but way to small.
3.0,"Mine doesn't come with the clip. The case is ok, not super durable, but good enough for daily use."
3.0,Size 9 (40 EU) shoe. These were way too small for my foot. I'm saving them for stocking stuffers for my smaller footed family members.
3.0,Purchased for my 7 yr old daughter. They are as pictured and definitely very pretty. Unfortunately they were very short on her. They did fit in the waist tho.
3.0,"These stainless steel hoops are the perfect size that I was looking for. With that being said I feel they are a bit heavy, pull my lobes down some. I do like the darker silver gray color of the metal. Very secure closure."
3.0,"I bought this dress for my aunt's wedding. It's so pretty and flowy! However, there are a few reasons that I don't give it a better rating. First off, the dress is cheaper on the seller's website so I suggest checking there. Second off, when I recieved the dress the bottom stitching holding the jewel in the cleavage had come undone so I had to sew it back on myself.<br />And finally, the straps for the dress are made of a very abrasive material with no give. My shoulders were red and irritated after only trying it on. I thought about removing the straps completely but I don't have much to hold it up with and the dress doesn't seem like it would be able to stay up on it's own. I tried to ask around for advice on what to do about this but people just kept giving me ways to cover the straps, not fix the problem."
3.0,"I really like it, but the stitching is very weak. Fell apart after a few uses. Had to have it sewn back up stronger"
3.0,"I received my dress on time, was very excited when it came only to see a hole in it. Very disappointed. On the positive side it does fit according to the size chart. I'm 38DDD bust, 36 waist and 41 inches hip, i ordered a large it fit perfectly. Unfortunately i cannot wear it"
3.0,"Sweater is nice and fits well. Unfortunately, there is a hole under the left armpit. It'll take forever and a half to get a new one."
3.0,Came exactly like shown they are super cute and shipping was super fast but one of the nose pieces came broken.
3.0,Will keep yo use as a maternity sweater next time I am pregnant: the fit is odd.
3.0,These rings are cute and good for the price. The size was the only issue for me. I have small fingers and these rings fall off easily.
3.0,"These shoes are very fun. I hate to complain because they are so cute, but not at all worth the price. I was sort of disappointed because of the price I thought they would be good quality. Not at all the case. The fabric they are made of folds or puckers at the toe, they are large and not true to size so order a size smaller. There is also no arch support so by the end of the day unless you have flat feet they will hurt bad. No cushion in them either. Only reason for 3 stars is they are very cute. But not worth the money just for looks and that's all you get trust me...."
3.0,"Not durable. You get what you pay for. It stank (smelled all chemical-y), so I washed it right away. The lettering/logo started breaking down immediately. After the second wash, it got a small hole in the back."
3.0,"When I insert these insoles in my shoes, it made my shoes fit too tight. It would have fit better with 1/2 to 1 size bigger shoes"
3.0,So i just got it n b4 my bday n im supper happy about that . I love the way it looks n yes small n not a real crystal but it's still gorgeous
3.0,Looks OK.
3.0,Disappointed that the price advertised was not what it ended up being. 8.95 to 11.95 is a huge price difference. That not tax
3.0,"Very beautiful ring, I love it. I give 3 stars because the top detach from the bottom on the very first day while I was only looking at it."
3.0,The style was actually good but the boob pads made me look like the characters from Austin Powers where they shot bullets out of their boobs.  Had to return it because they were not removable but the fit was good and very cute.
3.0,I got this because it said it was a lavender like color. It's like a blueish grey. I don't love the feel of the silicone and think it's not up to par in quality. It's okay if you switch out your bands a lot but I wouldn't use this for everyday wear.
3.0,"I normally wear between and 7.5 - 8 shoe but based on other reviews (which said this ran small) I ordered a size Large. The package sticker says the product inside is size Large but I received one slipper in Large (bottom of the slipper says it's 9.5 - 10) and one in XX-Large (bottom of slipper says it's 11-12.) The Large was too small and the XX-Large was too big so I'm returning these and re-ordering in size X-Large (which I'm guessing is their 10.5 - 11.)<br /><br />For reference, the Large measures 10 1/2&#34; from heel to toe on the sole. It barely fits the length of my foot and the thong is tight. The XX-Large measures 11&#34;. That one is comfortably loose but the length is much too long. Hopefully the replacement will be good."
3.0,the bill was not sewed on very well. but the embroidery looks nice.
3.0,"I was disappointed to find that the ""pocket"" is just a strip of fabric.  (I have the different style with the piping and it has a pocket which is important for me).  It also runs a bit smaller than the other style.  Will donate."
3.0,"I had to change my review since I washed it. The tag said that it could be washed, but the bottom skit stained the lace on top. Also, I washed on delicate and the lace started coming apart.  So sad that I only got to wear it once."
3.0,They're beautiful but a little hard to put on and are painful to wear for more than a minute
3.0,Way to small and I got a xL But really cute I gave it to my 12 year old she love it
3.0,"I ordered a medium based on waist measurement and the waist was the correct size, however the butt and thigh area were way too roomy and also the legs were too long for me. I'm 5'4&#34; and 130lbs and this cut just didn't work for me. I think if I exchanged it for a small, the waist would be too tight and I would still have to hem them so I'm just going to return these. Too bad because the material is pretty nice and the zippered pockets are great. Only the knee area is mesh, which is a bit scratchy and feels like it might be uncomfortable wearing them for longer."
3.0,I love that the set has 3 pieces. The colors are bright and vivid. The size was good. The only negative is the material is way TOO THIN!
3.0,"I love this cammo design, looks awesome, is very comfortable.<br />Just 2 things that are not a deal breaker (1 of them is now at least)<br />1. I wish it have a guide to adjust it, since it have belts and Velcro straps everywhere, and I dont know why are they for.<br /><br />2. I am M size, and I ordered L, and fits awesomely, order a upper size or 2 or will not fit.<br /><br />UPDATE: The material got stock on a tinny spike and got ripped a little on the leg, so is not very durable, also the elbow pad slots dont have Velcro to keep them in place so the elbow pads get lose really easy."
3.0,"This sweater was true to size and arrived with the cool headband. However, buyers should note that this is not a cotton hoodie and the material is very shiny."
3.0,Very cool sunglasses but heavy on the nose.  Not very comfortable because after only a few minutes they hurt and leave a dent so you can't wear them for long.
3.0,Beautiful but they don’t fit the holes in my sisters ear the hoop part is too thick! Birthday present fail 🙈
3.0,These look bigger than pictured and weigh a bit so they pull down. Very pretty though.
3.0,The fabric was lower quality than I expected. I returned it with no problem.
3.0,"I like the design and fit of these, and bought two sets of them. Unfortunately, they're not terribly well made-after a few washings, several already had holes or fraying threads, and that has only gotten worse over time. If you don't plan on wearing them more that a couple times, they look nice, but if you're looking for something that you can wear on multiple occasions (as one typically is, with undergarments), they might not be the best choice."
3.0,"It's a great dress, just very uncomfortable and itchy when it's hot and you sweat since it's not cotton."
3.0,"Warm, soft, does look slightly cheap in the material. To be expected with the price I guess. Love the design though!"
3.0,I was not thrilled with this skirt. It was too short and full and did not look good on me at all. The fabric was just okay. I had to return it.
3.0,"Hope the material has better quality, the design is nice but the material looks cheap."
3.0,"Liked the length, Just didn't care how the top fit."
3.0,"Nice set but the gold tie bar has two imperfections right on the front of the bar which makes it unwearable for me. It seems to be a blemish where the color isn't quite the same. I love the set, the size and the box but i think i'll be returning it because i can't wear the gold one. I will however be reordering the same set hoping for a set without any imperfections."
3.0,"The scarf is wonderful. Thick, cushy, soft and warm. Love the warm fall creams and browns.<br /><br />The hat, though...I have a normal to smaller size head. This hat is TIGHT on me. I mean, leaves-A-Mark-on-my-forehead tight. I don't like the hat at all.<br /><br />So, 5 stars for the scarf, 1 star for the hat...3 star product."
3.0,only wore once; was too small
3.0,I love the feel of these. They are leggings that fit and feel awesome. I would've thought the plus was a little bigger. But they'll work under a big shirt or dress. Like liquid butter.
3.0,Quality sock but they are too tight... I wear a 10-10 1/2 men’s shoe.
3.0,Was much bigger than expected.
3.0,The fastener is too large to fit through the circle on the locket I had hoped to wear on this chain.  I need to take it to a jeweler to have the locket attached.  That was disappointing.  I love the chain....just hate that more expense is required to use it for the locket.
3.0,It was a little more smaller than expected. It's fine though.
3.0,"Decent strap, came wound up so its permanently swirling.. looks weird when wearing but it does the job"
3.0,"Read Mr. A.I.Shears' review if you haven't yet right on this page. I should have listened to him. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate the sweater. It's okay. That's it.<br /><br />The picture makes it look extremely sharp but when you see the fabric in person, it doesn't look as smooth. It definitely makes you look older when you wear it. It is comfortable though, so that's a plus.<br /><br />As for the size, it fit me just fine. I'm 5'9, 175 pounds. Usually wear Medium for T-Shirts but for outerwear I'll go with a Large. So if you only care about it fitting as expected, then this fit just fine for me."
3.0,The hangers will break easily.
3.0,"This necklace set is ok, a bit cheaper and flimsy than expected.  One broke after wearing less than an hour."
3.0,While there is much I liked asbout this dress the body con style was just too tight especially in the bust. Made of a soft ribbed fabric it falls mid thigh. The fit crosses f rom snug to uncomfortable. The cold sholder detasil is adorable; probasbly one of the most attractive treatments I've encountered but the arms are also tight. It does seem nicely made and could serve aws a cute tunic top. If you have any  chest at asll you probably want to size up. Othersie a super cute dress.
3.0,"This is such a cute product, but it looks as if it has been used. It came in a package as if it were brand new, but it looks like someone already wore it and even cut a few pieces of the hair. I shouldn't complain because the wig is so super cute and I plan to only use it for one day. The price was great and it is going to serve the purpose that it was intended for. I guess that it was just not as pictured but it is still cute."
3.0,Was a little bit big and the quality wasn't good the way they show on the picture
3.0,This jacket is made of pretty good material and the overall fit and finish was OK. I had an issue where the battery would not stay connected to the USB cable or there was a short. It would run for 30 min and cut off. then i had to take the battery reconnect it and start it all over again. I did this like 10 times the first day. I am returning it because of this and the USB connector seems iffy. I bought my wife another brand and it did not have this issue.
3.0,The selver Brand name fell off
3.0,"The picture does not show how it sparkles in the sun. It's rather cheap, too (it's only $8 so that can be held against it). But it sparkles. Badly."
3.0,I bought a few of these since I am In charge of getting the bridesmaids robes for our friend's wedding! They arrived today and one of the robes is missing the belt which is not a great look for pictures!
3.0,The order said size large and i dont know what size because the back ticket was erase
3.0,The pants fit to low on the hips.  I won’t wear the pants out side.  I will wear them as pajamas.  I purchased another brand that fit perfectly.
3.0,Fabric feels cheap but it does the trick
3.0,It's soft but it's not thick enough still made my hands cold throughout the winter storm and when get it's wet the gloves is wet had to dry it out and then rewear it. Gloves is to lose its not very tight to stay one and plus the touch phone screen it's not working for me it's not everytime I try touching my phone I have to press it couple time with the gloves on.
3.0,"Nice bag, actually, but NOT large by any definition of the word. Not even average size."
3.0,It’s extremely short. I can pair with leggings but I was hoping for a dress. The fit is fine just very short.
3.0,Was what was expected just too tight
3.0,"So I ordered two of this rather run of the mill timepiece.  One is for modding of course and the other as my beater like when doing yard work and lawn mowing.  There's really nothing special about this watch.  It tells time no better than my G-Shock  To be fair, my G-Shock is atomic and solar powered.  Oh well,  I may buy a few more for gifting as some may find this watch appealing enough.  :;)"
3.0,"fits smaller than expected, material cheap looking"
3.0,"Shoes looked nice enough, but the size 13 was way too small for me, couldn't even get them on. I normally buy 12.5 or 13 shoes."
3.0,Not very high quality or supportive but fine for bed. Be careful washing it.
3.0,Received this item in RED NOT WINE RED! I’m so disappointed! I so wanted to wear this wine red with the wine red pants but now it’s to late! I’m so sad!
3.0,"Really odd fit. Very short waisted and im only 5'1. Zipper is terrible, sticks. Material looks and feel cheap. Its going back."
3.0,"Although these moccasins are cute, don't bother to size up for your kid expecting they can wear them now, and still wear them next season too. They won't hold up that long. I bought two pairs for two kids. The inside fur sole comes unglued and drives my kid crazy, and the outside soles also came loose at the toe very quickly. Ugh."
3.0,This is a good ring if you like it to be tiny
3.0,"The colors and fabric of this shirt are great, but order at least a size or 2 up."
3.0,Good jeans - fit as expected.  Good quality - but waistband gaps and they keep falling down.
3.0,"I have two of these watches and I love them because they look so stylish, however, they both have fallen apart several times. I take them to a local watch guy and pay to get them repaired because they really don’t hold up very well! The bands and buckle/screws are not very good quality."
3.0,"From the photo it looks as if these earrings have a slight texture and a tiny nub on the bottom.  They do not.  They are an absolutely plain, shiny circle.  Really quite boring and rather cheap looking. Disappointed but too lazy to return them."
3.0,This is a small bangle.  Don't think that its large enough for a man but as a woman it wasn't big enough for me.  You have to have a small wrist for this flow.  It beautiful though.  Great buy and sleek.
3.0,I just wish that had a couple more holes to tighten it. My watch can't check my heart rate because the band is too loose ☹️
3.0,It's so cute but it has a rip in the bow.
3.0,great boot for someone with a narrower foot but the leather is very dsoft so should stretch a bit after they are worn for a couple weeks.
3.0,Nothing like I thought it would be. It has no pockets and it is really stretchy material. I use it to put the supernatural series dvds in though and I love that!
3.0,This mask is hot. The breathable material is very hot on your face.
3.0,It is a pretty little bra but is more like an XS instead of an Large.
3.0,Too small and the length is was too long. Too expensive for the quality you get.
3.0,Good quality product however Size chart was not accurate so they didn’t fit.
3.0,"Fits perfectly on standard 205/75/15 trailer tires and would be somewhat of a deterrent. The wrench access door would not lock because there was a metal tab missing on the cylinder lock. The tab was probably 1&#34;x3/8 inch. I sent a picture of the lock where the missing piece should have been. They distributor didn't seem to understand the problem, but offered a $20.00 refund, which I refused. I fabricated a tab and soldered it on the lock because I couldn't make a small square hole. It wasn't a real big deal, just another aggravating bump in the road. The type of person that would want one of these probably would have the creativeness to fix most things. You should also buy one of those coupler locks, but not one of the $15.00 yellow ones. They are cheap cast metal that could be broken off with a hammer. I think a 3/8 chain through the spokes and around the spring with a good lock would be as effective as anything. Make the bad guys work a little."
3.0,It was a gift for my daughter. Necklace is ok. Seems cheaply made and name is hard to make out. Get what you pay for or in this case a little less.
3.0,"Decent slippers . . . good price, pretty warm, easy on easy off. Not real durable. I have owned them less than a year of moderate use . . .  and they need to be replaced. Probably will switch to a warmer, higher quality (more expensive) slipper."
3.0,"Although this product description stated &#34;Women's&#34; sizing, I think it is more like Juniors sizing.  I generally wear a women's small, so that is what I ordered.  I am 5'5 and 135lbs (pear shaped / B cup).  The shirt was quite a bit shorter than expected (came just below my waistband).  I loved the texture and feel of the shirt and the softness.  A larger size may have made up for the length, but I went ahead and just returned it."
3.0,Go a size larger
3.0,They're cute and look like the pic but very dilicate. One broke on me the very day I got them. Luckily some super glue fixed them however be warned!
3.0,"Perfect size, VERY VERY VERY difficult to put on by yourself.  Someone lese needs to and honestly the only easy way is to use pliers."
3.0,Picture was misguiding. Product was cheaply made but for the price I can't complain.
3.0,I gave it a low review because the pants are see through. I can't wear it on my runs or people WILL see my underwear
3.0,All was there but one of the earrings were broken but all in all good
3.0,Too big for a standard face. OK on a large head I guess.
3.0,These are beautiful but both of the backings broke within a week.
3.0,They fall off easily
3.0,Very nice shirt but Wrinkles makes the shirt not look good. 🙁😠
3.0,"This tank is great. I'm 5'5&#34;, 140 lbs, 34c, bought medium and it fits well...BUT it is not a friendly oak tank top."
3.0,"I liked the quality of the dress and the color. Unfortunately it was too small and I couldn’t use it for the wedding I was planning to. I am a size L and I thought it was gonna fit me, I should have gone with an xl or maybe 2xl. It also depends on your body! Also is really long!"
3.0,"I thought it would be easy to adjust like to taking off links, but I had the hardest time getting the pins in and there’s no directions to help. I had to YouTube it. I still haven’t been able to wear it because the pins didn’t go in correctly. I wont be able to put it back together until I get another pin.<br /><br />I will say though I had another band similar color and I got nothing but compliments! So if you really like it and are comfortable adjusting watch bands go for it."
3.0,"Great for the price, but prefer the Swarovski CZ studs I purchased after. With shipping they weren't much cheaper since I'm a Prime member"
3.0,"Better size up while ordering. Material is ok,not transparent."
3.0,"This is a good looking strap, the silk is a step up from the nylon. Colors nice and a shine from the silk weave is classy.  The hardware is a little butch for silk, but the tang isn't, it is too lightweight and a good pull will fold it over.  That cost a star, the other star lost is for the poor design of the double strap setup.  The shortness of the second strap forces the wearer to put the hardware on the outside of the wrist (at least on larger wrists), and it looks and feels stupid. Way stupid.<br />I already wear socks with my sandals, tie-dye and a 70s haircut, and I can't afford any more dork cues, so I cut off the unnecessary little strap and can wear this as a standard fabric strap, with the hardware on the inner underside.  I should've taken a pic first. The same goes for the Zulu straps being mislabeled NATO. WTF? Why can't I find decent 3-ring, 4-stitch NATO straps??"
3.0,"Good wallet, just much bigger than I anticipated. It is more like a small clutch purse. Hard to fit in my purse."
3.0,"Very thin, some raffles"
3.0,Did the job but was a little snug for my 9yr old grandson. He wore them to a Chris Tomlin concert.
3.0,"Had to buy a second pair after the first pair broke right out of the box. Learned a lesson. You have to oil the hinge before you try to flip the glasses up or they will break. When I got the second pair, I immediately used WD40 on the hinge and very gently worked the hinge back and forth without forcing it. NEVER force the hinge if it's giving resistance - the plastic will break very easily. Other than that, the glasses fit well and look really cool."
3.0,Doesn't fit properly but does work.  I use this lens during sports or whenever there is a strong possibility of getting damaged.
3.0,Looks great but broke easily.
3.0,I bought these because I was looking for some small little cute huggie hoops and these did the job for abt 1 WEEK until one fell off my dresser and stopped attaching to the back part……….
3.0,I had 9 of them not work when I received them.  I have used them 3 times for 10 minutes each and I have another 6 that are dead.
3.0,"Nice frames, decent quality.  The frame is not flexible but a hard plastic, making them fit too tight for my comfort. I will be sending them back."
3.0,Seams  already coming apart and I have only put it on once
3.0,The face needs to be stronger. I already broke one of the face barely hitting it on something and expected this one to be much better being that it was $100 more than my first.
3.0,Love that dress
3.0,"Kind of small, looks inexpensive. Long enough though."
3.0,Fabric look cheap
3.0,Very pretty but has zero support. I am a 36 D and this does not hold them in place.
3.0,I really Like the design and may order another but I had To return bc it was not sized correctly.
3.0,"Okay, so it’s alright. It will ride up occasionally which I don’t like. I’ve had others so this one is probably my least favorite. It doesn’t make you sweat a lot like my others."
3.0,"Cute suit - but the sizing is ridiculously small, even after having followed the size chart to a T.<br />Disappointed that it didn't fit -- too much of a hassle to return."
3.0,My granddaughter loved it till the chain broke. I was disappointed in my purchase. Not to mention embarrassed the chain was so cheap .
3.0,"The dress itself is very cute.  The (side) zipper bunches and so I will be returning.  I saw a lady in it this weekend and the side was at an angle and I'm guessing because of the zipper.  Again this dress is super cute, bright color, looks like the picture, and good quality.  Perhaps the zipper needs some ironing to flatten more...I don't know.  I bought it as a gift."
3.0,Fits good except the zipper keeps going down especially when you are moving. It needs something like a hook to keep it up.
3.0,"Cute shoes, but the velcro often comes undone and the shoe falls off my daughter's foot while walking."
3.0,"Love this belt, looks very nice, it is nice not having the extra part of the belt hanging out and the buckle is sleek and good looking. But today the buckle broke and it will no longer hold my pants up. The little ball on the end of the pin that goes into the hole fell off."
3.0,El color no me gusto
3.0,"My phone fits in the compartment, but it will not stay snapped shut. Not too crazy about the zipper compartment, it's too small."
3.0,"I wear a 36B and received a small. It fit wonderfully and held tight without becoming uncomfortable in any areas. The bra does sit rather high, which will make it visible under lower cut clothing, but for my purposes, it was fine. I even wore it for an entire day at the amusement park and had no troubles. It never shifted nor did it leave any sore marks nor did I ever feel unsupported. I was afraid I might have to pull it back into place every now and then, but this wasn't the case. It also was fine in the 90 +degree weather. It's a bra I'll be wearing often.<br /><br />Added: It 's now a few weeks later, and I'm changing my review from 5 to 3-stars. I've worn this with several different shirts and have to admit that it doesn't sit well under all of them. T-shirts and anything slightly clingy tends to work its way upward and sit weird on the top part of the chest. I constantly had to pull at my shirts to get them to go back down and not look strange. Also, the bra doesn't support quite as well after a couple of washes and while it's still okay, I find myself wishing I'd just worn my regular bra with straps to offer more support.<br />So, this bra is okay but not as great as I'd hoped."
3.0,"Arrived in a vacuum sealed bag which made it look very wrinkled. The fit is nice, but the fabric quality is very average."
3.0,It looked a little cheap when I tried it. I guess I should have ordered larger size than my usual size.
3.0,"I loved the dress, BUT as soon as I opened the package there was an overwhelming perfume odor. Had to return unfortunately."
3.0,Could have been better polished
3.0,"is actually grey, not white"
3.0,To bulky for work related tasks. But probably ok for being outdoors in colder weather.
3.0,"looks real nice, other reviewers say it looks wine colored not deep red but the last time i looked at a glass of wine it was deep red, maybe im crazy, but its a nice tie, wish it felt better and was a bit longer but its a good cheap tie."
3.0,"These are ok.  I'm not sure if it's a design flaw or what.  But I can't walk in these down the sidewalk, but they work for reading on the beach just great.  Just don't move with them on....Which means you need two pairs of sunglasses.  Regular ones and these.  Ugh.  Keep in mind that I am kinda new to the whole &#34;old lady&#34; glasses thing, and only need the readers for reading, I don't wear regular glasses.  If this walking thing was not a problem, I'd give them a solid 4.5."
3.0,Not great but super cheap
3.0,"according to what I received in the mail, I don't need an XL , I would need XXXXXXXL , I am 5 5 tall and weight 165 lbs. just to give you an idea."
3.0,Not sure about the no fly in boxers. I guess it's over the fence not thru the gate. Going to give them a try.
3.0,"I love the ""gucci"" concept here but the red is more orangy and the green is waaaay too bright and light colored to emulate gucci colors.<br />Sleeves are too short. I still wear it but only when dressing very casually."
3.0,Not enough room at the top and in the toe area for someone with diabetes.
3.0,wanted a higher turtle neck and a thicker top otherwise everything was well
3.0,My shirt is too large
3.0,Did not like how they fit on me
3.0,Cute but somewhat boxy. Shoulders are a little wide for me - so a little droopy. Material is nice and soft but snags easily.
3.0,I like them. The gages are big for my tiny ear holes. Craftsmanship is fine for the price. One of the pieces is pretty sharp and hurts going in.
3.0,I like the dress but the material is not very good quality and the dress does fit loose. I am going to get this altered and hopefully it will look better. The colors are bright and the dress is very summery.
3.0,What can one expect for $30?
3.0,Nice earrings but the post or clasp is crooked I one of them.  Not sure how I am going to fix it.
3.0,"One side snapped in great, but the other did not, it's fallen out once while cleaning the glasses.  These are acceptable, but I do wish the tolerance/fit was a little better."
3.0,Not satisfied with this particular color or the quality.
3.0,"I know it's only a $9 pair of sunglasses but I expected more from them. The hinges seem very weak and my head is too wide for them to fit properly. The nose piece doesn't even reach the bridge of my nose so it doesn't feel very secure. Nice to wear for a selfish or if you are just sitting or driving but if you are walking or doing physical activity, forget it"
3.0,"Product came on time and without damage. Not suited for lip rings. Not true to size and is not jewelry. This is basically a crafting bead as their is a hole the entire length of the bead as opposed to a simple indentation on the top & bottom.<br />This bead is not a true 4mm bead, and will pop out repeatedly. My orginial lip ring bead has never popped out, even when bit accidentally, this is how I know that the sizing is a tad off.<br />If you were to use it in a brow or ear ring, it would probably work just fine."
3.0,"Did not for me well, but embroidery was beautiful"
3.0,"Nice leather by the looks of it. Had to dock the ratings because the pins are shorter than advertised. They will not securely hold your watch on your wrist, so use at your own risk."
3.0,They look cute but the fit is not good. Not comfy. Tight and narrow through foot area. I returned because my feet hurt just trying them on and walking in kitchen. I was bummed because they are super cute
3.0,Weyyy too small I wear medium and it's short and tight. A large may not even fit. Would need an extra large but the quality of the dress is good. I like the dress.
3.0,It  was a bit small i gave  it to my daughter
3.0,Already little strings coming off after a few weeks of wear.
3.0,"We were missing the ""W"" letters. The ""M"" is not interchangeable as a W because it looks weird as an W."
3.0,"This coat is true to size and it warms up very nicely. With that being said, I am wondering if anyone else has actually timed their battery life? My husband went out with it in the morning and hunted with it on for 1 1/2 hours and then at night for the same amount of time, battery shuts down just a little over 3 hours of use at low setting. When he asked me about how long the battery life was to last (I bought it as a present for him) I told him it said 6 hours.<br />He tried it again, this time he for sure timed it. Again, lasted only a little over 3 hours on low setting.<br />Anyone else actually time their battery life? I tested it out today, just turned it on and timed it and yes, it doesn't last past 3 hours 15 minutes.<br />Wondering if it false advertising on Milwaukee's part or the seller's"
3.0,"The quality seems good, but they do not seem to work for me. Maybe it's just my body. I don't know, maybe I'm doing it won't, I'm really not sure. I have 3 stars for a neutral review. These may work very well for someone else, but did not serve my purpose at all. I'm disappointed I couldn't use them & they didn't work out the way I intended. No support what so ever. Seems your breasts need to be firm & perky for them to work. I wouldn't need to wear anything if mine defied age & gravity! Oh well! Guess I'll save for implants, lol!!!"
3.0,"Pros: Having a (partial) e6b built into the watch is a nice feature. I use it for fuel burn calculations every day. Atomic time is great and so is solar power. Changing timezones is easy and UTC time display is a nice touch. Overall build quality is pretty good.<br /><br />Cons: The biggest drawback is that pressing the illuminate button does not illuminate the entire watch. It only illuminates the digital window. As an EMS pilot, I fly at night a lot, so it's a pain. The only way to tell time at night is by setting the bottom selector to the time function and having it set to the same timezone. The display itself glows, but it only lasts a few minutes after exposure to light.<br /><br />Overall, decent watch, but disappointing oversight for night flying."
3.0,Brown and Black look almost similar. You cant tell which color you are wearing
3.0,"The earrings are so cute. Received lots of compliments. However, the Rose Gold finish rubbed off after just 3x's wearing them.  The silver seems to be holding up better, but I bought this set because of the Rose Gold."
3.0,"THE buckle is not well made but looks good, I rather pay few dollars more to have better buckle."
3.0,"I was planning on using this garment for lounging. The length is too long and I am considered tall at 5'8"".  The chest area was too small. The rest fit well so I am going to exchange it for the next biggest size, xxL."
3.0,"Took FOREVER to get here. It is nice, but I got one inblack last year that fit differently"
3.0,"Feels like a plastic raincoat , but does look good on. If you’re busty, go for the bigger sizes or the jacket definitely won’t fit . I’m a large , Xlarge at most and had to buy the 5x. They cut “very small”. Overall I’m okay with this purchase"
3.0,"very cute, fits well but the glue smell is very strong"
3.0,"I usually buy Small, but I brought Large so the shirt doesn’t fit too tight and I like loose shirts for gym. But this felt like small because of the material."
3.0,Chain is cheap!!!!  While this appears two tones it isn't.  Disappointed in the quality.
3.0,Size is way off.  Pretty dress but I gave it to my niece.  XL. Was like a size 6.
3.0,It's nice but you need to use something inside because it's a bit transparent.
3.0,"They are cheap but do the job. However, the thumbholes taer very easily and have already frayed, so it's tacky being shown in public."
3.0,They break really easy good for like a one time use
3.0,"It came before the expected delivery date so I was pretty thrilled :) Fair warning, the skirt has no elastic and you've got to fight the zipper a little, even when you're not wearing the skirt. The material's good for the price, it is a bit see through but it's bearable. The reviews aren't kidding when they say go a size up, like seriously. If you think a size is perfect for you, just go one up just to be safe. Also I also the XL. I'm 5'9&#34; and a little bottom heavy. Just a little. I like to crush it on leg day. That being said, with the length of the skirt being short as it is, combined with my height, and then with a bottom heavy musculature, the skirt is short. Like, REALLY short. I tried putting my compression shorts on underneath and the skirt just wasn't having it. But the shirt did fit, it's lightweight and a little stretchy, and it isn't that tacky, itchy material you've probably worn when dealing with other online costumes. Also for the price, you could always just get the set in black and white, and if the skirt doesn't fit, you could find a black pair that does. Pleated skirts are in this year so I'm sure you'll find one that matches the shirt. Sucks that the skirt didn't fit, but I kind of already knew what I was getting myself into, so I'm not mad about it :)"
3.0,Too shiny.  Too wide.
3.0,One of the locks came undone twice. I have another brand that seems stronger and no problems with it.
3.0,"The top is super cute. Read sizing reviews! I am 5'2&#34; 144 lbs and a British cup. I ordered XL and the top is perfect. The bottoms are a joke, unless maybe you're very slim and want to show some bum. But honestly for the price, just getting a great top is worth it to me."
3.0,"Feels a bit cheap, definitely not as nice as my other watches.  The band is stiff too, have not been able to break it in yet."
3.0,"The little loop that holds the end of the strap broke after 6 weeks.  Returned to Amazon for refund.  Before it broke, my daughter loved it and it is a beautiful watch."
3.0,"Ok, I really like these...simple, cute style. However, on one of the spiral earings, the end that you're supposed to put through your ear is too big. It will not go in my ear. I even tried filing it down, but got no where. Plus one spiral is longer than the other...doesnt match"
3.0,My wife likes the look of the see through mesh on the legs.  They do add a bit of variety to her typical yoga pants.  The sizing seems to be a bit different than what we usually get.  The legs seemed looser than we were expecting but they still look cool.  As it warms up you might want to consider a similar style yoga pant. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
3.0,Nice quality but way too big. I got the 6-7 yr and it's more for I'd say a 10 year old
3.0,"I wear a size 10 / medium in dresses but went by their size chart and ordered a large. Sleeves too long, bottom too much fabric. The reviewers were right about the belt. 31"" belt for a large dress. Tell the manufacturers that their belts need to be at least 6"" longer then the waist size they advertise. The good:  very pretty lightweight fabric. I really like the collar and zipper. With the belt on your bust is enhanced. I will gladly order in medium, in multiple colors if they can fix the belt length. The belt really adds to the overall look of this dress."
3.0,"the fabris is strange, not a sweatshirt as it appears."
3.0,"Like:  Not too uncomfortable, fairly well made<br />Dislike:  Fit is really strange.  Too big around, but order cup size at LEAST once size up.  I purchased a similar item - same size and the fit was better all around.  However, this was a less expensive item, so I am not to displeased.  I would not order again.  Would I recommend?  Probably, with reservation."
3.0,The material is very thin and you can see right through it. Not very durable but it’ll do for the kids to play dress up
3.0,The metal on the side keeps turning on Siri and sending out the SOS. It did call emergency services the other day.
3.0,"The suede upper arm protection is great. The actual gloves are thin and do not offer adequate protection, I wear another pair of gloves over these when working with thorny plants."
3.0,It is not clear in the description but these boots are for people with large calfs.  It says it on the tag of the boot so I wish they would have put this in the description.  I ordered normal width but I guess that was for foot width.  Beautiful boot but not for me.
3.0,I feel they are a little short..<br />Thought they looked longer in the picture.
3.0,Love the design but runs large
3.0,Incorrect  large size.
3.0,Shoes are a whole size too big.
3.0,"The material these pants are made out of feel silky on your skin. Lightweight and comfortable, lounge pants. They were long on me with an XL and I'm 5'5''. They are a stretch waist so you can wear them high above the belly button or low whatever your preference. The drawstring keeps them in place. They are moderately see through however in the teal color. For that reason I returned as these were purchased primarily for work. No issues with the return."
3.0,"Dress was nice, however, it has a big girl issues. I took my measurements and ordered accordingly, but the dress is still too snug in some places and loose in others. It could be my error and perhaps a different color would look better. The white dress makes me feel like I’m wearing a 80’s poof wedding dress."
3.0,these are very comfortable and i like the feel much more than other leggings of similar semi-shiny-type material. the fleece is very thin so they stretch well. BUT i was pretty embarrassed when a friend let me know that they were totally see thru when i bent slightly over.
3.0,It fit ok. Slightly loose.
3.0,Slightly too big and the inner material was a big scratchy. Otherwise a well made item
3.0,Very rough material
3.0,"Bigger Watch, but very cheap."
3.0,"I usually wear 36C, ordered large, feel too tight around bust."
3.0,"These came REALLY quick, like scary quick! Did not anticipate that, as I live in the US and they came all the way from China!<br />Anyway, when I took them out if the packaging, they looked really small, so I was about to be upset, until I put them on - They're very stretchy, the same material as stocking tights. This was nice for me, because I wear tights every single day! Only thing I don't like is how they roll. I'm not huge, but I'm definitely not stick thin (I wish I was, haha), so they won't really stay up when you walk. I'll have to invest in a garter; before purchasing, I suggest the same for others :)"
3.0,These slippers are wearable but only with socks.  My feet slipped through the front opening.
3.0,Smaller than expected.  Shirt is more of a crop top.  Shorts are comfy though
3.0,"This is the most popular Casio watch and I've had one before that lasted for years.  The one I got this time came with the light not working right out of the box.  The seller very quickly processed a refund for me because it wasn't his fault, but I was still disappointed in the watch."
3.0,RUN LARGE
3.0,Would have liked deeper vents on the bottom sides so it would lay nicer at the hip but this a soft and comfortable sweater. Very oversized.
3.0,"I love the style of this blouse, but it's rather cheaply\hastily made. I love the color. One of the sleeves was sewn smaller than the other and pulls and the hem is unevenly sewn. I'm keeping this one and making modifications myself, but I doubt I'd buy another one."
3.0,"Come on Nike, I expect more from you than this flimsy piece of cloth you claim is an exercise bra😡"
3.0,"Tried them on, I'm a size 12, they were huge, at least 14 sent them back and choose to buy a different shoe."
3.0,I like the quality of this dress. It runs really small. Go up on size if you want to order. The style is really nice!
3.0,Too tight and long. Im 5'2 120 and bought a medium.
3.0,"This dress is very very pretty, however it was too small and very long. Such a shame, I would've been lovely for the occasion"
3.0,"these sunglasses are really cute but they don't suit my face shape too well. I was surprised when I got them because they actually feel more expensive than they were, if only they looked better on me.  I would really recommend these to the right person."
3.0,Daughter likes it (12yrs old)<br />Looks a little cheap but priced nice.
3.0,Bought this for a snowman tree topper. Works great for what I bought it for but not as tall as I thought.
3.0,I like it but not worth 20$. Cheap material and I'm praying they last me at least a year and not a week.
3.0,Wasnt as pictured. Totally different belt than was pictured but if I would have read the description I would have realized that. Still a very pretty belt. Just not what I thought I was getting.
3.0,The product is not as pictured
3.0,The dress is well made and looks great. It is just a bit too thin for me. I would need to where something under it to avoid the see through effect.
3.0,no back to it
3.0,It was a little too big in the grouch area but other than that it was a good fit.
3.0,Very pretty but quite large
3.0,"These arrived defective. The hangy ball was not at all attached to the stud ball. I thought the string had fallen into the larger ball and tried to fish it out but there was no string to be found. So basically I threw away the larger bottom ball and now wear these as stud earrings. And as studs, they're still pretty nice.<br />These came from China and were so inexpensive I decided against trying to send them back."
3.0,"I love these shoes they are SUPER cute. True to size for my little man and he adores when they light up... However I can only get one of the shoes to hold a charge for more than a day which isn't the biggest inconvenience but I don't like having to charge his shoe every day. The main reason I bought these was because reviews says the charge hold is great, which for one if the shoes it is..<br />But for shoe quality outside of charge.. 5 stars."
3.0,A stretch to call these “wool” Sox...
3.0,I like this ring but when it arrived the paint was already peeling off so I’m a little disappointed. It is a lot smaller than what I thought too.
3.0,It's pretty but size was deceiving
3.0,Not as wide as I needed
3.0,Seems to be of good quality but they are way way too small. Bought for my brother who wears w35/36- I bought 38 and he cannot fit in... disappointing....
3.0,Should have sized up one or two sizes to get the fit similar to what's on the model.
3.0,Returned.....I live in Florida. This is very very thick.
3.0,"Amazon Driver dropped it off to the wrong address, when I spoke with them they stated I have to wait until the next day 12-2pm for them to do something. At that point I was very upset 😡 And wasn't going to wait for then to return my money or my packages, don'teven ask me what I had to do to get my packages back so unprofessional,  one of the worst-case with delivery even they grt enough money for shipping&delivery. It is very rude that the driver couldn't go back and ask for the packages they delivered and drop it off to the right address. This  is just like the picture it looks great but, it was missing a stone"
3.0,The sleeves aren't long enough but it's comfy and was delivered on time
3.0,"I am not sure what I expected, but this wasn't it. Was too thick and didn't have that grungy look like it shows in photos."
3.0,I thought it wd be more Of a sweatshirt but it’s thin material that’s kinda itchy
3.0,Cute suit just didn't fit
3.0,Disappointed that the text was so small.  They did not use the space on the key-chain as it is shown in the picture.  Kind of looks ridiculous.
3.0,"I had a simular hat just like the picture with red and blue hat band, which i liked. The hat I received had a gray and black hat band'. The hats were made by the same company. The large size in my older hat fit perfect"
3.0,I ordered two of these recently for a short trip I was taking. I put one of my duffel bag and one on my rolling bag. When both bags arrived on the carousel for pickup only the duffel bag tag remained. I like the size and look of these but was a bit disheartened that one would fall off after a 45 minute flight.
3.0,I ordered an XL and It’s either a 3X or a huge one size fits all.  I liked the style of it so just took it in 2”on each side.
3.0,I purchased this shirt for my 4 year old granddaughter.  We have booked a trip to take her to Disney World in a few months and she will love to wear it!
3.0,Cuter in picture and is the size runs small. Had to give away.
3.0,The ring runs quite small.  I ordered a 10 to wear on my middle finger.  It only fits left hand ring finger as I typically wear an 81/2 or 9.
3.0,"I bought this as a replacement for a Lululemon jacket I love and it's way cheaper. Well its also made cheaper. The zipper isn't that great, it runs very small, and some of the stitching has come loose after one washing. It looks decent if you don't look at the details of it. It's not the best active wear jacket ever but for the money it is ok. Just don't expect to be wowed. A few reviewers I read had rave reviews. I wouldn't echo that sentiment. But if you have average expectations, this jacket is right on."
3.0,"I love the look, it is a bit large but it had a strong smell. It is pretty."
3.0,"Im 5’9 175# and wear bottoms between an 8/10 and since I have bigger legs, I went with a size L. It was too big and was baggy around my waist and groin area. I think that if I got a Medium, it would be stretched too tight and make the leggings see through. On my run, my leggings needed to get pulled up frequently (without putting my phone in the pocket). I didn’t sweat much, so I couldn’t tell how wet it would look for a profuse sweater. Overall, they were just OK and I would not buy another one."
3.0,The pajama bottom is soft but very long .good fit for a large
3.0,Seem cheaply made. Serves purpose for what I needed them for
3.0,"The fit on this dress was awkward.  Although it was a nice pattern and comfortable fabric the top of the dress was cut in such a way that would make me feel self conscious all day.  I will wear it around the house, but not outside."
3.0,"Not all that to look at. If wearing watch to work on vehicle or carpentry, might be worth taking the time to install."
3.0,"Pros: Has a large, easy to read, dial.<br />  The band feels smooth and has some elasticity<br />Cons: The smaller time keeping faces on the watch are just for show.<br />  The band's eyelets are not fully punctured; easy to punch out though.<br />  The prong is not long enough to touch the frame.<br /><br />It is a tad difficult to wear so I will probably attach it to my bicycle."
3.0,They wear out to fast
3.0,"Pay the extra and get a Necklet! I purchased this one, bc the double necklet was out of stock and you can totally tell the difference. I like that this is thinner than the original BUT you can definitely tell the difference in the magnet strength. It’s okay, but I wouldn’t trust to wart an expensive necklace with."
3.0,Too long to wear with flats.  55 inches is quite long.
3.0,"Had this keychain since February of 2020, but I noticed that back in late June, it started to turn into a brassy color, plus the metal piece on the back of the dolphin had just fallen off randomly . I was at the grocery store when it fell off, and thankfully I had my keys in my purse; when I got home, I noticed the back piece was in my purse . I'll need to buy a new keychain soon, because it's now September, and the whole thing is completely brass, plus it has an old metal smell to it ."
3.0,"Belt itself is good to great, the buckle needs some improvement. I ordered a 2 pack and within a month the hinge pin fell out of the buckle rendering it useless. After 4 more months the other one did the same. Neither has had a hard life."
3.0,"Top is very cute, but it's sheer, you definitely have to have an undershirt. It's snags super easy and I've already got two small snags, and I've only owned it for two weeks. It does run small, I'd say order at least two sizes bigger then your normal size if you want it flow-y like its pictured."
3.0,"Bought the dress unsure if the sizing was right.  (Usually wear 3x).  When it arrive, significantly bigger, as Women Within usually are.  Returned it with the plan to exchange for a size smaller.  However, VERY disappointed to see that the $42 price I paid the first time, jumped up to $80+ the very next morning.<br /><br />If you are looking to buy this, #1 the striped dress is not as soft colored as it appears in the photos, is definitely darker.  #2, order down a size from what you normally wear.  And #3 buy it before they jack the price up again."
3.0,"I received my socks but I notice that the elastic is WAY to tight for my feet, I may iron some of the elastic to make them softer and THEN wear them....heat helps with those elastic items that you may find a big stiff. :-)"
3.0,The shade of jade was much lighter than shown in the picture.
3.0,"These ""fashion"" earrings, made of cultured freshwater pearls and some unknown metal, were priced right, at least.  They did not win any accolades from my lady, as she found them uncomfortable and obviously cheaply made.<br /><br />We obtained these based on the lovely photos.  In person, though, the earrings lacked the elegance of those in the photo.  The pearls looked simulated rather than real, while the teal cardboard box and plastic wrapper did absolutely nothing to help bolster the earrings' appearance (or giftability).<br /><br />My lady found the posts unconfortably thick, and the metal that came into contact with her ears made her ears itch.  She only managed about an hour of wear before having to remove them.<br /><br />While the price was right, too much else was wrong to merit a recommendation from us!"
3.0,"Really lovely top but runs a size or two, too small. It was for an outing but buy the time I returned it, it was too late to wait for another and I was forced to shop local"
3.0,Unfortunately the dress was way too big.
3.0,Love it!!! Great look. But lasted only 2 months... It's falling apart.
3.0,VERY SEE THRU.....PINK COLOR IS WHAT I GOT AND I WEAR A CAMI UNDER IT SO ITS FINE.  VERY LIGHT WEIGHT
3.0,Fit was ok but cheaply made.
3.0,"Cute design, but definitely not solid sterling silver — the plating started wearing off and the copper was showing through after about two weeks of wear. Regardless, my gardener daughter still likes them!"
3.0,"When I recieved the shirt there is a little red and green string sewn in the shirt! shirt fits well, but i am very angry about the string."
3.0,"The color was not as shown and the handles were too short, so I returned it."
3.0,"I normally am a size 6, so I got a medium.  Based on how small it is and my worry about any shrinkage from wash, I should have ordered a large.<br />The fabric is really light, almost see-through.  There is an added short slip under the skirt so you can't see through to underwear, but that doesn't extend to the bodice area."
3.0,"It’s great for those that like it but for me the charm itself is the exact size of a dog ID so it looks like one, the bracket was cute. My charm was damaged, it had pits in the metal"
3.0,Nice slippers but run Small ... the width runs small also
3.0,The colors and quality are great. I have a small wrist so a S/M doesn’t work. It was more like a large.
3.0,"I received the suit and there are two un-sewn pieces on the sides - I think they are supposed to be looped so the strings can go through them and then tie together. I haven't seen this happen to anyone else, and it's a pretty easy fix for a tailor (or someone skilled with a sewing machine) to seam, but it is so strange that it came unfinished! Once I get it back from the tailor, I'm hoping the suit is not see-through in the water, which I haven't tested out yet. But when I tried it on it was so soft and comfy and fit well."
3.0,"I loved this dress. Unfortunately, the main leather strip of the belt was too big for me by about two inches, even though I ordered the smallest size offered. It look odd to try and overlap the main strip of the belt over itself, even though I crossed the tassels in the back and wrapped around to the front. The left tassel broke off (TWICE) within the first five minutes of my trying the dress on. In the picture, it looks like a silky, shimmery chiffon. The actual material is a little more dull and just a sheer chiffon.<br /><br />I ordered the dress two weeks before a wedding with two day shipping, expecting that the dress would arrive the Wednesday after I ordered it (on a Monday). On Wednesday, I tried to track the package and saw it marked to arrive A WEEK LATER than expected. The promised 2-day shipping was not 2 days from time of the order, but 2 days from the time that the package was READY TO SHIP (hence, they took a week and 2 days to prepare the dress for shipment, but then shipped it in two days once it was ready). That was a let down since I needed the dress ASAP for a wedding I was in.<br /><br />The dress MUST be worn with a belt, but since the belt was broken and too large, I had to do last minute shopping at stores as soon as I received the dress. I finally found a belt that could be worn with it after searching through five stores to find a style that fit with the dress.<br /><br />Overall, beautiful dress, just many unexpected hiccups between the later shipping dates and the overly large and broken belt."
3.0,"The scarf is very cute however it's way shorter than I expected so I can't really wear it like the way they have it in the picture, otherwise the ends just end up a right above my chest... which is shorter than my usual scarves that end around my hip bone when I do wrap it around."
3.0,"Very cute sandle, just too small."
3.0,Very pretty! However the large ones are super heavy and do not sit on my earlobe very well - they sag a bit :(
3.0,The costume is very thin.. too much activity and it will likely rip... The belts a much to short on the 2x.. Which is odd since the 2x pants and top fit fine for a 6 foot 280 dude!  Over all its okay for the price... But maybe pull out that extra 20 bucks for something thicker with fitting parts!
3.0,"This is cheap fabric and has threads hanging off from the seams. I don’t think it will last very long, but my son loves it because he can be Spider-Man any day he wants."
3.0,disappointed based on the raving reviews. they tend to ride down.
3.0,"This wristlet is very pretty and the perfect size for my iPhone 6s Plus.  For the most part, it seems really high quality, but the &#34;metal&#34; parts are plastic.  When the little zipper pull piece came off (as shown in the company's photo on the top left), it won't go back on because the zipper top won't hold and cannot be adjusted.  I had to pull the wrist strap off of the edge and use it to close the wallet.  That part has been super disappointing because without that, it simply won't last very long."
3.0,The fabric is nice and the color too
3.0,"Not bad straps are to short or something is off with it on me, but it's still a cute suit"
3.0,"Bigger than I thought they would be, but not in a good way. Also don't like how easily they fall apart when you open the clasp - it's annoying."
3.0,"Really cute first time bras,but strap broke on one within the first week of wear"
3.0,Perfect fit between the middle of my shin to the middle of my thigh. Everywhere else is tight.<br /><br />They look nice. Feel durable. Gonna order more in a larger size.
3.0,Too small for my ears better for kids i would say since its smaller that you expect it to be.
3.0,I will have to get used to the large size of this backpack.  Other than that it is as advertised.
3.0,Cute little casual top.
3.0,"The pattern is adorable, but they are a bit smaller than expected. WARNING: They are thin and somewhat transparent! I recommend going for a larger size and wearing some black leggings underneath for more modesty."
3.0,"I like Pampili shoes! Very cute styles for my daughter. I purcashed a size 1 for my daughter and recd the package in good condition however, the shoes are VERY BIG on her. She's a size 1 and other shoes fit her but for some reason this Pampili Amore Ballet Pink run a bit too BIG for her. I have purchased Pampili before for her and they fit but these run a bit big however I love them and so does she but she cant wear them and now its about 8 months and still big. I bought these shoes for school year Sept 2011. I purchased them March 2011 and she tries them but still BIG. She will wear the size 1 Pampili Amore Ballet Pink, once they fit...."
3.0,This is a very good product
3.0,I loved the style and material but it definitely runs big. My weight is up and down right now so I ordered a large but I definitely need to reorder a medium now.
3.0,These look good. I get compliments on them all the time. My only problem is they are bulky. I took an unplanned nap on the couch and woke up to my ear bleeding. This might be because of my small earlobes but the pressure caused by these when you lay down mixed with the weight of them leads to serious discomfort.
3.0,"Ordered these socks to be worn on an upcoming trip.  Delivery was to be by August 13, 2021.  Product was not delivered until August 18, after I had left on my trip.  Now that I have returned, the socks are as advertised and the fit is as expected."
3.0,I bought this to take pictures of my son for a pregnancy announcement and they turned out super cute. It’s been washed only a couple of times and the graphic is peeling off a bit. I got my use out of it though!
3.0,Fit was bigger than I would like. Double the price for my correct size. Worked for a costume but material was not like in the picture. Felt very plastic.
3.0,"These are comfortable and have a lot of stretch, but they don't get loose after wearing for a while. Since these are light-colored they aren't squat proof so I wouldn't wear them to the gym or working out around people. If you have any cellulite which most women do it will definitely show. I also noticed I get a camel-toe in these, and that's usually not an issue for me. Wearing them around the house with long cardigans or flannels is comfy though."
3.0,"My daughter is going to be a flower girl in a wedding.  These shoes were the ones recommended we purchase.  Deliver took more than a week.  At first glance, the shoes were cute and seemed well made.  But the shoe size ran 2-3 sizes too small.  The shoe was so small she couldn't even get her foot into it.  I will return these, but because of the long delivery date, I'm not going to risk ordering another pair that might not fit right."
3.0,This bathing suit faded so bad.  Would not recommend.  It also stretched.
3.0,"Funcionó excelente, pero por 20 días, después no funciono."
3.0,"Beautiful colors, just the size is tricky, for me too big, need extra small."
3.0,"Don't  get me wrong it looks decent, however, i don't  think it's  something  you'd  give to a really  good friends, maybe a young niece or something of the sort. The chain is really thin and tangles really easy and i got it for my niece  who just adors the colours so i mean its a win in my book."
3.0,Theses are cute but they are a little big and slide down as my little one crawls around.
3.0,Held up for about 5 months. Not buying Reefs again.
3.0,They look cheap and are very narrow.
3.0,A lot smaller than expected and I'm not 100 % sure the stones are real. Feels like cheap beads.
3.0,The quality is good for the money you pay. But they sent me the wrong size two times. The description shows something different than what I ordered. This second time I'm just going to return it and not buy it again. But so far if you get the right size the product is worth it
3.0,they work but are fragile
3.0,"This is a very cute coat. I am 5'9'' and ordered an XL. It fits good but barely reaches my hips, my preference would be a bit longer but am going to keep it anyways and just wear a longer shirt."
3.0,Color of fabric and lace don't match at all well. I hope after several washing they may blend better. Had to add elastic to the sleeves as they were loose around the wrists.
3.0,Beautiful bracelet and great quality.  But I have only had it a little over a week and the band is already broke and will have to get a different brand. Really sad since it is so beautiful
3.0,Barely fit my son who is a 2T. I purchased a 2T so buy a size big
3.0,"The clasp broke on one right after I opened it. Kind of cheap, but that's okay, it's a fad that won't last long."
3.0,"Very pretty, but a little larger and heavier than expected.  Shipping was very quick, item arrived in great shape.  The first time I wore this pin, it fell off, but if secured tightly (by adding a thick piece of rubberband onto the pin next to the clasp) it stays just where it needs to be.  When I sent a note to the store to say the clasp wasn't secure, they were very quick in stating they would replace it.  The rubberband did the trick and I'm quite happy with my purchase."
3.0,"This is good earring, reason for 3 star because if it was just the green stone it will look great, but because of the white stone looks cheap."
3.0,"I've been using the organizer for weeks now and for the most part it works as advertised. However, I'm noticing that some of the elastic bands are loosening as the days go by. The organizer also does a poor job of holding a computer mouse."
3.0,Awkwardly tight in the chest/shoulder area and I've got a smaller chest
3.0,It's okay! This shirt looks good but I was expecting it to lay a little different.
3.0,"Shoe fits a little long, strap broke off within about a week of my kid wearing them (3-4 times total at most)."
3.0,"It's kind of cute, but couldn't get over the odd shape. I got a 4-5 and my child wearing a 5T in most every brand. This leotard runs huge! It is so wide and doesn't even make sense. Not a good fit for us."
3.0,Nice sweater but not true to size.  I ordered what I always wear and always think I could have gone a size smaller.  This was supposed to be a loose fit and it definetly wasn't.  very disapointing!
3.0,"They're a bit stiff, almost in a crunchy way, after washing them. But they hold up okay, and are reasonably comfortable, and do what is intended. They've gone through my crappy washing machine many times in the past few months and have not fallen apart, so they hold up okay. I would not buy them again, but I am not throwing away the ones I have. I would neither encourage, nor discourage you from purchasing them."
3.0,Pretty lace. Top of dress looks great. Skirt is nothing like the picture. Not full at all  Tulle was only 1 layer thick. Even with full underskirt you can't make it look like the picture.  Overall not pleased with dress.
3.0,Strap was to tight. Chest area was too big. And the Bottoms were not sent. You will need to order one size up.  But if you have a small chest and broader shoulders it will not work.  Made for skinny and big chested women.
3.0,Cool gift item
3.0,This turned out to be so small !  It is the size of a coin purse and not a clutch purse.  Otherwise it is colorful and cute and hopefully I can find a use for one that small.  I ordered it before Christmas for a gift for my granddaughter but it didn't arrive until late January.  I didn't realize that it was coming directly from China to my home.
3.0,I like the watch its very nice and just what my wife wanted but it was 10 days late on delivery with no explanation as to why until we looked into it after it was a week late.
3.0,So far so good... I am very hesitant to rate them high so soon due to the clips always breaking or not clamping down all the way. Will update in a month again.
3.0,"Got a large, and ...its large. But the material is decent. Not thin, like I was worried, but very stretchy and definitely not as long in the front as the picture suggests."
3.0,"Nice color and a soft material, couldn't see thru when squatting but they were very thin, showing imperfections easily."
3.0,very cute! needs to maybe be tighter where the hole in the bust is and needs more elastic under the bust & near waistline. not form fitting enough. but a few adjustments with my sewing needle & sewing a bra into the bust & i will look pretty close to the model if not better! :)
3.0,This outfit is very cute but very small. Did not fit.
3.0,"If it were up to me we would be sending this coat back. However, my daughter likes it & wants to keep it. For starters, the bows & buttons that I thought were black are a deep purple. Not a huge deal. The coat came vacuum sealed so it is very wrinkled & will need to be steamed before she can wear it. Problem is, there aren't any care instructions so I have no idea what this fabric will withstand as far as heat. It is a little ill fitting (loose) for my liking but I'm hoping once the wrinkles are gone, it will hang a little better. As a mom, I would suggest going with a better quality option."
3.0,It fits fine however the sleeves are very short. It looks like normal short sleeves in the picture but if you are trying to hide that fat under your arms some of us get with age don't buy this shirt. But other than that it's a cute shirt just wish the sleeves worked for me.
3.0,"Multiple sellers are listing the same product, but I chose this seller because their photos made the red actually look red, not brown like the other sellers. I took the chance and paid slightly more, but I was very disappointed when I opened it, and it was straight up brown. I would not say this is anywhere close to red. I would have even been okay with a darker brick-red but nope. At least I have the black one as well, but I would have saved some money and purchased black only if I knew.<br /><br />That said, the actual product seems to be good quality, so I am giving this a mixed review.<br />5/5 for quality.<br />1/5 for false advertising of color.<br />I have only been using it for a little less than a week, so I cannot comment on longevity, but it feels like it is built well, and it works very well for my needs. I am enjoying it much more than a standard carabiner to clip my keys to my belt loop and tuck into my back pocket. The door does open directly where you naturally put your support finger, but as long as you can get in the habit of holding it a different way, it works well."
3.0,"The strap is too long, not made for ppl with thin wrists like mine. Also not super comfortable, my wrist got itchy after wearing it for like half an hour. No rash tho."
3.0,I gave them to someone smaller
3.0,Great looking watch. The clasp wouldn't stick so I had to take pliers to it. I cannot get the date to set correctly. It's always 12 hours off. Frustrating.
3.0,Waist fit good but the butt and thigh area were too large
3.0,"I can only give a three star rating because we have yet to figure out how to assemble it. The directions are nothing but pictures and are extremely hard to follow. The quality looks be very good and if we can ever get it put together, I am sure it will be awesome."
3.0,There nice looking toes but very thin quality. They serve the purpose.
3.0,They are nice glasses but just not my style . I wore them once to breakfest and while walking out of the diner a homeless guy made a comment on how nice they where and I gave him the pair .
3.0,"The fit was nice, but the short part was longer than expected. I am only 5'2, so that could be why as well."
3.0,Get what you pay for. Something to blow nose in.
3.0,Tested it on the newer model tenor glasses and did not work
3.0,"Comfy. Serve their purpose.<br />BUT, have a pair of Oakley Flak Jackets and the stitching on the straps was too tight to go over the arms of the glasses.<br />Had to cut the stitching and resew it with a larger diameter."
3.0,"It's cute, a little tight in the thigh area, I guess I thought it was more of a flowy silky material but it is a stretchy costume-like fabric. definitely not as it looks in the pictures but it's still cute."
3.0,I just got all of the same one. I was hoping for a variety :/
3.0,"I ride and also planned to use this for a Halloween event. I like the artwork, but would like the skull image was a brighter white."
3.0,"Honestly, this is one of the flimsiest backpacks I’ve ever had. I know it’s not a school backpack, but there’s no padding- anywhere. Not in the back or even on the straps. So if you put your stuff inside, it sticks out because there’s literally no structure. However, if you’re looking for a good hiking backpack that’s super light (albeit with now structure) I guess it’d be good for that. It’s a good backpack, just know what you’re buying I guess lmao"
3.0,"The quality is not the best, and it looks like it belongs on a child. I have had bad experiences with Amazon lately. I will stick with Etsy and Tradesy."
3.0,"I really love this shirt, it’s simple and light yet colorful . However I ordered a med and they sent me a lg. So it is huge on me.. I’m about 5’6” 140lbs, a med would’ve been much better maybe even a small seeing how big this lg is! I may return it but for $10 on a lightning deal I’ll prob just keep it and knot it up in the front or something, too much hassle for $10! Very cute shirt tho!"
3.0,I am 5'5&#34; and weigh 140 lbs.  The shorts were really too tight.  But i liked the suit and it fit well every where else.  So after the first wearing i stretched the shorts over a chair for a week.  Today i wore it and it felt almost ok.  Going to stretch it for another week.  But honestly they did not need to make the shorts so darn tight .  The suit is a 4XL.
3.0,"Im a true size 26/28, 5'8. I purchased the black and white stripe top and was so in love. Perfect to wear with leggings. So naturally ordered a second top in Purple. It is by no means the same shirt. Different fabric and runs way small. This shirt fit my 5'3 16/18 mother perfectly. The cut is off and the sleeves were too small. Hesitant to buy any others."
3.0,Put it in the wash before letting baby wear it and one of the ears already came loose 😒 But it's still cute and wearable once I fix the ear; the material is pretty stuff though; was hoping washing it would soften it a little bit but no such luck
3.0,The sleeves are too tight and poorly constructed.  I was only able to wear this three times before I had to throw it away because of the seams ripping.
3.0,"Pretty nice, except it started peeling almost immediately."
3.0,It may just be me but these made everything blurry.  I got the normal reading  strength I usually need.  Also the frames are very tiny and the ear pieces were uncomfortable.  Maybe I have a larger head :)  They just didn't work for me.
3.0,It kept bending & cut my finger with the edge
3.0,thinner than expected - also runs a little large - returned mine
3.0,"These are nice shorts but their posted sizing is wrong. I have twenty plus pairs of shorts and pants that are all waist 34” to 36”. Actual 35” fits me perfectly. I ordered the short size claimed to fit 35.5-37.5” waist. It is to tight and fits me like a shrunken pair of 34"". I’m ordering the size that claims to fit 37.5-39.5” waist. Hopefully this helps.<br /><br />Update the next size up fits. They’re nice but run very small."
3.0,I LOVED the bottoms! I mean they were very cute. However the top was tiny! I ordered the XL in this just for the top to be big enough but it may have fit if I was an A/B cup anything bigger then that don't waste your time ordering.
3.0,"I took a chance that it would be correct as some of the other reviews said theirs were correct, but the one I received was not.  It is missing the word ""by"".  It's still cute, but not as cute as it was supposed to be."
3.0,"The wallet was okay. Attractive leather, zipper worked fine, and nice wrist strap. Only complaint would be it did not have credit card sized slots.  The only &#34;tight&#34; fitting slot would have been for a driver's license. The slot for a passport was a little too tight for an actual passport. I guess the lack of card slots was made up for the numerous paper currency slots."
3.0,Cheap material and fringe but decent dress for Halloween costume.
3.0,"For $25, this isn't a bad dress. The dress material and make fits the price. It does compliment my body well, and I ordered the dress according to the size chart provided by the seller under &#34;Description&#34; (not the Size  Chart.) It does run small when compare to US size (I copy and paste the sizing below from their Description for everyone to see.) However, I decided to return the dress for the following reasons. Because there is no inner lining and the stitches aren't flat stitching on the inside, parts of the stitches  around the curves creates a crease instead of hugging the curves. I don't want to have to iron the stitches flat every time I wear the dress, so I am returning it.<br /><br />Here's the sizing provided by the seller under Description.<br />Size: S,M,L,XL,XXL<br />S<br />Bust/33(INCH) Waist/26.6(INCH) hips/33.6(INCH) length/40.1(INCH)<br />M<br />Bust/34.5(INCH) Waist/28.3(INCH) hips/35.3(INCH) length/40.1(INCH)<br />L<br />Bust/37(INCH) Waist/30.5(INCH) hips/37.6(INCH) length/41(INCH)<br />XL<br />Bust/40.1(INCH) Waist/33.6(INCH) hips/41(INCH) length/41(INCH)<br />XXL<br />Bust/44(INCH) Waist/37.6(INCH) hips/45(INCH) length/41.6(INCH)"
3.0,"I don't think I would buy these particular glove socks again. They are anatomically incorrect in their design for adults. My outside toes keep coming out. No one's toes are lined up in a row at the top of their foot. Most feet are angled and toes connect to the foot along that angle. These socks are made for feet that have no angle, like a babies foot."
3.0,"I purchased a small and I'm 5'9 125-130lbs.  It is as pictured and looks great on the model but it looks terrible on me.  Am I wearing a maternity dress or a babydoll nighty?  I'm going to keep it and try to make it work, maybe leggings will help.  The neckline is too low, the length is too short, and on me the bottom hem line sits slightly high-low (front to back) which makes it look like I could have a baby bump but I'm not pregnant.  Really unflattering on me.  In the pictures I'm wearing a flattening Bralette with heels, and a push up bra with slides, but I can't make this dress look acceptable to be out in public.  Also in the pictures, I'm sucking it in and trying to make it look good, so it looks even worse in real life."
3.0,This can only be worn as a cover up.  I was so excited to get this because I was just going to belt it and wear it like a dress.  But the batwing cut off the sleeves makes this look impossible and uncomfortable.  But don't let this discourage you from rocking this bad boy at a pool party.  It is very cute and a true off the should cut.  Which says a lot because some of the items that I've ordered as a plus size dont fit off the shoulder.
3.0,"I wanted to love these leggings. But the fabric itself fits loose. The size is correct but it won’t hold up if something goes in the pockets. Speaking of pockets, these are horrible. The pockets are deep and go down and to the back of your knee. My phone just slides all the way from my hip to behind my knee… it’s too awkward."
3.0,"Arrived quickly. Nice packaging. Product seems like good quality.  The bra is just much too small though. Definitely runs small, I would order a size or two bigger next time."
3.0,"This bag is really cute, but, after about two weeks of regular use it starts to look worn out. The material on the front is very fragile and small lines from it separating appear, the bow starts to fray a bit, etc. If you're getting it as part of a costume or for one event it'll be fine, but it doesn't hold up as an every day bag at all."
3.0,"I bought the striped floral pattern and was intending to wear it wrapped around my waist and tied in the back for a more fitted look but it was just too much fabric.  I'm normally a medium (5'6 135 lbs, 36C or 38B) and I got a small instead but it just wasn't possible to tie this fitted around my waist, there was still too much excess fabric around my back and shoulders (and I have broad shoulders!).  If you are looking for a loose fit maybe it will work for you.  I also didn't like that the pattern is only on the outside meaning when you tie the bow you are going to see the white, non printed side.  The fabric is very thin polyester and has no stretch."
3.0,The fit is large on the waist and small in the calves.  My only.complaint is the zipper doesn't stay up all the time..
3.0,The dress is well made. I didn't realize it was glitterery (I don't know the correct name of the material) but it's kind of for a holiday. My boobs look great in it. My hips aren't full enough so the lower half hangs just so so. I'm for sure keeping the dress.
3.0,It's smaller than I imagined and could use a zipper pocket and a cash slip pocket. But it looks nice and was quite handy.
3.0,It did not fit my form very well.  Dress to shapeless.
3.0,Had a small hole in it.  I got an  XL. I'm 5'6&#34; 148 lbs.  It is loose on me.  I like the material.  I won't bother returning it for the hole.  I can still wear around the house.  I wouldn't buy again.
3.0,Do not buy if the intended wearer doesn't have very narrow calves! They do not have much stretch to them.
3.0,"Some of the pearls came off straight out of the package. Lies a little weirdly due to the construction/weight, but can't complain for the price. I wanted a necklace that looked like popcorn, and this fit the description but ended up not working out for the outfit."
3.0,Well-made and would be comfy if you get the right size.  A little tight; should've ordered a medium rather than a small.
3.0,"Run big size down. Nice stretch. Good material, take it to dry cleaners."
3.0,But they came bent 🥲
3.0,"Overall runs big, I had to return it."
3.0,Band seems very sturdy and looks great! Only issue was the tool that comes with this broke the  first time using it... Now if I want to change it back I will have to buy a new tool which was one of the primary reasons I went with this band.
3.0,"I don't really like the fabric, doesn't have the texture I was hoping for, feels cheaply made. I'm still searching for a super wide and long black scarf/shawl that feels like real woven fabric, like a cotton/wool blend or something. But it was on sale, and nicely long, just not wide like a shawl, and has a very poly feel to it, the weave is not consistent, so it just comes off as cheap. I'm hoping my daughter will like it enough, as it's a gift."
3.0,I wore these for Halloween. And that's all they lasted before the bunnies fell off and started losing stones. Oh we'll. cute anyway.
3.0,Way too big-  is more for a toddler.
3.0,Insides a lil itchy the fabric has like a synthetic metallic threading mixed in or something so it makes inside of shirt slightly roughish
3.0,"I bought this when I didn’t know much about crystals and overtime learned more. This is not citrine, this is baked amethyst."
3.0,"Looks sturdy and practical with compartments for a lot of “stuff”, but it arrived squished and does not really look so good. It should have been shipped with some padding inside in order to keep its shape. A good little bag to have but the appearance is not great<br />Renee L"
3.0,"Came broken, cute tho"
3.0,"very cute, easily scratched, kind of larger than expected but I wore them to a music festival and got lots of compliments!"
3.0,"Shirt is beyond scratchy. Love the pants, tossed the shirt."
3.0,Like the quality of the zipper and material. Make sure that you're ordering the correct size...XL is a larger than sizing chart. I returned the XL and immediately ordered smaller size.
3.0,"It is very thin material and doesn't hang very nicely. I'm about a 2/4 on top and a 6/8 on the bottom. The waist and bottom were great, but I didn't fill out the top and had big sideb00b gaps."
3.0,"First bag got LOST somehow and never made it to me. Had to call Amazon and they re-shipped another one. Ended up waiting over 2 weeks to get my handbag. Overall seems like a nice bag. I ordered the light tan. It doesn't look cheap, hardware seems sturdy, and inside looked nice. Unfortunately, this bag was too big for me. I carry pretty good sized handbags but this thing was HUGE. I sent it back. Be sure to check the measurements before you purchase. Seeing as the pictures don't actually show a person holding it you can't really gauge the size of it well."
3.0,I got a xxl and it's smaller than I expected. Although I do like the swimsuit itself.
3.0,My daughter complained about how difficult they are too put on and the button that switches the colors is uncomfortable
3.0,I ordered one size larger than what I usually wear and it was still a bit small.
3.0,"Wore this dress for a pageant. Without the belt it looked huge, but it was okay with it on.  After the second wash it came out covered in lint pills that I can't get off, so I can't wear it anymore."
3.0,Fit a little around the waist but legs were very loose and baggy. Does not match the fit in the picture.
3.0,"This is a beautiful watch, but it is too big for my taste."
3.0,Long enough i also order a half size larger in flats..fit ok...however wide since i have narrow feet
3.0,The watch is very cheap looking. And it squeezes my wrist super tight to the point where I can't wear it comfortably and I have bony wrists. It came earlier than expected which was great! The packaging was tight and secure as well. I don't think I will be purchasing another watch from here anymore. I uploaded some pictures for others to see.
3.0,Nice Cottone skirt! Great Value
3.0,"I have three star for the fit and softness of the shoes. it is a very flexible and comfortable shoes for a very active toddler. However, unfortunately the it ripped from the side in just one wear"
3.0,"Fits strange, front is like a crop top length, material pretty cheap feeling"
3.0,"This mask was thin but it does the job. It is large but after washing and drying it fits better. My issue with it is the adjustable ear loops- the clasps that you adjust sit directly behind/on your ears which is painful. This mask is fine, but I would keep looking if I were you."
3.0,ordered too small
3.0,Material is much thinner than I thought it would be.
3.0,"Within a week, two of the pockets have holes in them. I wasn't expecting much for the price, but that was disappointing."
3.0,I have a small wrist and this was way to big. Otherwise it was just what I ordered.
3.0,Well made nice material just to large
3.0,The dress it self is super cute however I only gave it a 3 because two of the buttons fell off as I was trying to put it on for the first time and Im pretty tiny Im 5'7 120 pounds and A size a cup The breast area was more for size training bra I would for sure go up a size on the dress
3.0,It was nice and just like it was described
3.0,Well product description says 13% Spandex and 95% Rayon. Simple math says that is impossible. It came with no tag description of fabric. It says no tumble dry. I would have not bought it had I known this fact. It is soft and comfortable. Front hem line is longer than the sides. I also would not have purchased had I known that fact. I may return it. It is not navy as pictured but more of a royal blue. I would say overall description is very incorrect.
3.0,"I ordered the five pack, plus sized. 3/5 fit, and some how I ended up with two that were small.  Out of the three, I'm pleased. They are both soft inside and warm not to mention comfortable. However, I won't order these again."
3.0,Not really compression tanks. More like a tight fitting tank. But still pretty good.
3.0,"Arrived on time, beautiful packaging. The necklace is as pictured, gorgeous. But the necklace arrived with the delicate chain completely in knots, 1 hour to get apart"
3.0,The dress is beautiful just as pictured. Came quick the only problem is I wear a medium ordered a large an I can't even get it past my shoulders . way way too small.
3.0,Make sure you order one size up.
3.0,Loved the color but I ordered a size xl thinking it’d fit me. I’m a size 14 normally and it was a squeeze.
3.0,I had ordered this similar style dress from another vendor on amazon and it was not available anymore so gave this vendor a try.  The cut was not the same and ran smaller in size I got the large and normally wear medium to large and seems like I could have ordered an x large. I kept the dress however not one of my favorite dresses to go to.
3.0,Nice blouse for elegant backyard party and or everyday wear.
3.0,"Quality it nice, but run small and are Capris"
3.0,"I’m 5’7”, these were a little longer than expected and came mid knee. Otherwise it’s a nice pair of shorts."
3.0,"It's cute but the Large is actually more like a 6/7, not an 8-10 as advertised. It's a thin coat, no inner lining. I am returning it."
3.0,cheap flowy too big for me I am almost 6 ft it is just a really awkward fit perfect for a quick bikini cover up.
3.0,"I liked this purse for the price. The zipper broke after a month. I planned to return it, but didn’t get it in the mail in time. It’s cute. I sorta disliked the ‘triangle’ shape of this bag. It was difficult to see what was in it with only the small opening at the top."
3.0,"I am giving this 3 stars, because it's REALLY SMALL! Unless you have little bity wrists, this will be too tight  on you! It's super cute, & I like it alot, just wish it was bigger!!"
3.0,shorter than expected.  Fits my 12 year old not my husband.
3.0,"gave as a gift, no complaints rcvd, do not use product myself."
3.0,Dress is comfortable and washed up nicely but a little too long. I'm 5'7&#34; and it should be hemmed to be cuter. It's not a &#34;midi&#34; type dress.
3.0,Xxl fit like a medium
3.0,Cool for 4th of July. Little hard to see through
3.0,Runs a bit large... love the style and pattern but the material on the skirt portion was very stiff. I ended p returning it.
3.0,The size is too small.
3.0,Love the color and the style. Was expecting the coat to be a bit thicker. I’ll have to purchase another coat for colder days.
3.0,"The band is not 38 as advertized; it is about 36, so the product runs small. The problem is getting a B Cup with a real 38 band."
3.0,It was much larger than I expected and not delicate.  It is a bit heavier.  It isn't horrible--just not my style.
3.0,"slightly see through, love it otherwise"
3.0,"I am 6'0 tall and weight 185lbs with mostly hips and butt, it fits but the legs are way too short, of course. I tried thrm on and liked the look but, I worry about the &#34;slicing of my peach&#34; showing when I sit down. It stretches enough to accomodate my curves."
3.0,Fits small. Got size I wear and it is a little tight.
3.0,"I would have given this a 5 star review because I really love the jacket and it's super warm.  However, a week after owning the jacket, I washed it per the instructions on delicate.  When I went to hang dry it (for it not to shrink even more), the seam on the arm was shredded from wrist to the underarm.  It's not even repairable because it completely frayed.  Anyway, I ended up buying another one just because the price is so cheap.  Next time, I'll hand wash it.  If it tears again, I'll need to upgrade to a Top Shop jacket.<br /><br />The jacket does run small, so size up."
3.0,"It looks just like the picture and isn't too big or small for my wrist, but the snap buttons get stuck and end up coming off the band. It came in a nice black bag and was carefully packaged."
3.0,Pants fit great. My only complaint is the material. Very thick and hot. Not for summer.
3.0,Like? Cute as a button.  Dislike? Runs small :-( .
3.0,"VERY COMFORTABLE and VERY EASY TO PUT ON and TAKEN OF. BUT__THE PRESSURE IS NOT AS RATED; I AM USING SIZE S/M. The pressure was rated on AMAZON site 15-30, but it FEELS LIKE ONLY 10. For me, it is not sufficient for medical reasons.  I  need at least 15 pressure."
3.0,"As another reviewer noted, the only place where there is a lace attachment is on the neckline and the rest are pretty much printed to look 3D.  Its what you'd expect for a $60 Disney costume.  It would be hard to add real embelishments such as the gold coins unless you can find oversized ones that fit the exact dimensions.  In the very center front and 1 row  across the bodice they used a shiny gold circle to look like an embellishment, on the skirt its all printed.  The center blue shown in the photo is a very small blue section printed and doesnt look like an underskirt at all."
3.0,Returned item. Size too large.
3.0,I like the look of this unique chain but it doesn't have the luster of my other silver/rhodium chains.
3.0,It's ok. Needed something to cover my arms.
3.0,Very cute pendant my daughter loves it. She wore it to school the very next day. But when I picked her up from school she wasn't wearing it. The chain had simply just broke in half. I couldn't fix it she was upset. But it's so easy to buy a new chain. The chain is very thin keep in mind. The pendant has held up so far. But it's only been worn once.
3.0,"Very hard to attach bands. other than that, they seemed OK."
3.0,"I liked the necklace, good length, size ect. but the way the chain is hooked to the cat makes it keep turning.  Every time I look, the necklace is turned backwards and looks dumb."
3.0,Bought two bags.  My friends bag’s handle attached after about two hours.  She used as side shoulder instead of cross your body.  I asked if I could send back.  She was going to sew it.
3.0,The size is too small.if you order please order the next size up.
3.0,"This shirt is just as cute as in the picture but I ordered the black one and the buttons are snap-style buttons that are silver. The silver buttons almost ruin the shirt for me, but other than that the style and fabric are good"
3.0,It's cute but I don't think I could wear more than a year because of the material.<br />But I liked it.
3.0,These run extremely small and after my son tried them on we’re pretty sure they’re womans
3.0,"Cute swimsuit. Not made for women with real boobs. There is no support in the top. Still able to wear it, just not as flattering as I had hoped."
3.0,Nice...but a bit pricey.
3.0,These plugs were shown with BLACK horns When we got them the horns were white and felt more like a plastic or acrillric.  Shipping was fast and rather cheap. But I was a bit upset they not only didn't look like what was shown but seemed to be some type of plastic horn
3.0,"I guess I only have myself to blame. I thought these would be so cool. &#34;It'll look like there is a screw in my ear&#34;. What I failed to realize, was that it would also be impossible to lay down or lean on your ear with being impaled by said screw. I would recommend only wearing them for a short time and definitely removing them before bed. Also took forever to arrive."
3.0,"Had to order the 13-14 for my 7 year old. Granted she's tall, but they definitely run on the smaller side"
3.0,The sweatshirt had a hole when it arrived. My son was too eager to wear it to send it back for a replacement.
3.0,Fits way to big.
3.0,"Really cute, a little too big."
3.0,Cute design but ran small even going up a size.
3.0,"The V is super low, expect to show a lot of cleavage."
3.0,Too tight for my husbands foot. Way too narrow and  he doesn’t have wide feet. Had to send them back
3.0,SO SMALL I GAVE IT TO THE WIFE
3.0,Kind of an awckward fit but it’s still cute. It rides up my ass so best to wear a long sweater with it
3.0,"These are nice overall, they kind of look like they were printed on word and stuck in there. However, they'll serve there purpose and from a distance it won't matter."
3.0,"UPDATE!  I was able to remove the odor from this wallet, and am using it.  LOVE it!<br /><br />I would have given this darling little bag a 5-star if the foul smell it arrived with hadn't taken me repeated attempts to get rid of it!!!  I tried baking soda in every pocket, with no results, and just now washed the whole thing in scented soap and am drying it out.  If I've damaged it by doing this, of course I'll expect a full refund.  Hope the soap works.  There's no way I could use this bag stinking the way it is."
3.0,"It says it's for Full Figures, but it only has 2 hooks.  Fuller figure bras need at least 3 hooks.  The band is thin in the back.  The cups fit as expected.  It's not a top quality bra.  It's not a good value.  You could go to a store like VS or Dillard's and get a nicer bra for the price of this bra.  If the band would be wider and more hooks, then I would consider it a better value.<br /><br />I received the black bra.  The color is as described."
3.0,"Somewhat small, doesn’t fit my chest area all that great but it’s a pretty top."
3.0,"Love the color and cut of this sweater however, the material is cheap and balls up easily. Looks very worn after only a couple times wearing."
3.0,"Didn't stay on very well, but for the price it looked super cool"
3.0,"The color and the sleeves look great, but fitting around the waist is somewhat strange"
3.0,Like the material and all but it fit to snug and  I went 2 sizes bigger
3.0,"good, I bought two, they look cute I am afraid they will tear at snap.  the plastic pocket tore on first use."
3.0,"The watch itself is very nice , however the band is very small"
3.0,"I really dislike reading reviews that are so petty over such a basic, inexpensive product.  This one had every complaint you could think of.  I just received mine and it met my expectations, however, I sized up based on the reviews and shouldn’t have.  I’ll be returning for the size 7 red I should have ordered in the first place.  They have good skid proof bottoms, soft, seem comfortable, and as for durable that remains to be seen.  I’ll get back to you after I’ve worn them for awhile."
3.0,It wouldn’t stay close
3.0,"As other reviews had noted. And honestly, worth being heeded. It's not a bad product, but the heart is rather large, and borders on gaudy for sure. It seems to take away from possible quality by being so large, it appears more costume-like. If this is for someone that enjoys larger jewelry this may be a great gift, but for someone that likes a more subtle jewelry look, this is probably not the product for them.<br />This product was provided at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,"I have loved every piece of smartwool I've purchased...except this one. The comfort, material, wicking and anti-odor properties are great. But the design is way off. The length of the straps seems too long, and I can nearly pull this down to my waist. I've worn it on and off for the past two months and the seem on the one strap is already frayed and coming apart. Also, this wouldn't be good is you need support for the ladies (ie, running). This is for low impact activities (ie, hiking, yoga, biking) where the ladies won't be bouncing around. I'll be making a satisfaction guarantee claim on Smartwool's website."
3.0,These are very pretty but are thin. The filters are not enough. It should be a little thicker.
3.0,"Cute, soft, but barely rouches on the side or drapes in the front like it does in the pic.<br />The color is more coral than pink."
3.0,Chain is too long and the pearl looked dull.
3.0,Love the dress. Purchased it in yellow but have to return it because it’s completely see through.
3.0,"Fit super tight in the boobs. Size. Hart is a little off. The elastic constantly flips, falls down in the back, hard to keep in a comfortable spot. Sent back for a refund."
3.0,Just but too small
3.0,Material is kinda flimsy. Doesn't really hold shape
3.0,"These were larger than I expected! I found them well made and good quality especially for the price, I was hoping for a smaller earring to replace the silver one I lost. These don't come close but they are nice and I wear them."
3.0,Bars looked great but the measurements did not work for me i needed one size up. I however bought the small for my daughter  and she loved it
3.0,"Great colours and design but the material is very thin. Babydoll fit,  paired well with a broad leather belt."
3.0,The visor is easily lost and so certainly not a key fob for motorcyclists
3.0,Washed it once as instructed and the material loosened up and started to tare
3.0,"These sandals are beautiful. Unfortunately they hurt my feet, so I had to return them"
3.0,Blue pair was missing
3.0,The design was great. Buy one size up.
3.0,It is really cute and looks just like the picture but don't trust the size chart!!!! Mine is several sizes too big!
3.0,No receipt and it arrived late.
3.0,"Very lightweight shirt, NOT flannel."
3.0,"I bought this for the Sony A6000.  The interior side of the strap is rough and not very comfortable, but this can be fixed by filing the inside surface.  The metal ring is only attached to one end of the strap, the other end is unprotected and make the strap feel flimsy.  I've added photos to give the buyers a more accurate view of the strap."
3.0,Holes were drilled wonkey other than that they are beautiful
3.0,Very pretty but fits a little tight around the shoulders
3.0,"Fit is nice but material feels cheap and a little stiff. Not as flowy as I expected, but you get what you pay for"
3.0,"in the picture it  looks better, especially the belt"
3.0,They're snug boxers.  They're Ok.
3.0,Was pretty but broke after 6 months of light wear and it was never worn in shower or anything.
3.0,"Proportions are funny. It’s super high waisted-  almost to the underwire of my bra. There’s more material around the hip area and I’m already pear shaped. looks much better If I fold the waistband over,  but then it’s not so smooth under clothes. I followed the sizing chart and waist size feels perfect. I really like how slim the legs look though. Length is also perfect. Material is so soft inside and out. Still like them enough to keep them."
3.0,"They looked great when they came, but after just 1 week the chains tarnished and look terrible. So far they haven’t broken. There good enough for around the house"
3.0,"The material is thinner than expected. However, the jersey knit material is breathable and good for summer. These aren't sweat pants. The one big thing I don't like about these is that the draw string is way too short. There is barely any length left to tie it. The ends of the draw string will probably get stuck inside the waistband, too. Overall, I guess they are ok. I will just be wearing these around the house or when I'm doing things in the yard. Not really the kind of pants I'd want to wear in public."
3.0,"I bought the red Christmas patterned band, and though it fit well, the red paint began to wear off of the outside, exposing what appears to be white plastic instead of leather (I could be wrong, but it sure looks like plastic/vinyl). I only wore it 5 or 6 times at most before the red coloring began to noticeably wear off. I should return it, I suppose. I won’t be able to wear it next December due to the wear."
3.0,The other reviewers were right when they said you have to keep pulling them up. I really wanted to like them. I loved the color! But they were very annoying to wear.
3.0,"Cheap material, on the large size. Looks like it stretched out"
3.0,It's slightly too short but a little wide. I get a few compliments on the shirt but I think it's the print on the sleeves.
3.0,"It wasn't as much of a thong as expected, and it fit very tight.  My wife is petite 5ft tall and it was not comfortable for her.  It is really short and had to be stretched a lot to get it on.  We sent it back."
3.0,Cute bathing suit but the quality isn't that good.
3.0,"Is pretty, but started irritating my skin rather quickly."
3.0,"The &#34;random color combination&#34; I received isn't what I'd have chosen, but that's a gamble you take. I wear women's size 8 1/2 to 9, and they fit snugly. You probably shouldn't buy these if your feet are much bigger than that. They're soft and warm and the soles are slightly thicker than regular thick socks. If they hold up well in the washer, I'll probably buy more so I can wear a fresh pair each day. (I work from home, usually in lounge pants and old t-shirts, so they'll get lots of use from me.) If they don't hold up in the washer, I'll update this review."
3.0,"The item was beautiful super silky soft but shorter than stated length, to be fair it still would have been too short for me to wear as a beach cover up, maybe as a sexy bedroom robe but not out in public and I may still keep it as that or decide to wear it as a beach cover top instead of beach cover  dress. One other thing I found disappointing is the fact that the drawstring that the pictures imply is attached to the garment in someway is completely separate which I don't like because I think it would be very easy to lose especially if you plan on taking it on and off or live in seasonal climate areas like I do."
3.0,Not as good of quality as I thought.
3.0,The neck holes are extra large on these. We've ordered others and they are fine
3.0,Looks fantastic in the picture but not the best quality. Same material as a thermal shirt but thinner.
3.0,I was so bummed that the toe box was too thin for my big toes and had to return them. I have the more recent version which are my go to shoes due to regular sonic wave treatments and I want a second similar pair as house shoes.
3.0,"Not for normal sized women. I usually wear a 12, so I am pretty average. I thought this would be cute but I looked like a shapeless cupcake. Possibly cute on thinner women."
3.0,"It’s very clingy but cute, nevertheless. Cellulite showed through the dress. 5’5, 175lbs and ordered an XL."
3.0,"It runs a little big. I have big thighs so the bottoms fit there but too big in the waist. For the price, worth hemming the waist to make it fit for an upcoming vacation. Quality is just ok...it's what you'd expect at this price point."
3.0,"I really love this top; however I'm only giving it 3 stars because of the hassle I've had with it.  I sent back a small to get a medium because the description said ""long sleeve."" The sleeves are actually a bit longer than 3/4 length. The small fit perfectly everywhere else, but I thought it was too small because the sleeves didn't reach my hand, but rather, an inch above my wrist bone and  so it needs to be rolled or worn pulled to the lower elbow as the model shows. The medium was too big as the shoulder seams fell 3 inches below where they should have been, and the sleeve is still a little short for a long-sleeve top. I will now be sending back the medium to get the small. I'm okay with the way the sleeves actually fit, but I wish it had been described as a 3/4 sleeve. (pictured us the medium top)"
3.0,"Ordered 3 of these to stack, all 3 arrived discolored and even after cleaning remain so. Very poor quality, would not wear these."
3.0,"The sweater itself is soft, but the material feels pretty thin, almost like a tshirt. And the color is a bit brighter in person, so I look more like a Tiffany’s jewelry box than a cool mint."
3.0,"The mask is extra large, I had to regift"
3.0,The bandanas are nice and a good size but be aware the pattern is printed on one side only. That was a surprise. If that doesn't matter to you these aren't bad.
3.0,"I loved these bags, I used the polar bear one twice. The second time I used it, I started to remove it from the car using the short side handles, and one ripped off!!  There wasn't that much in the bag, so disappointed!!  They are cute, and seemed like they were really sturdy.  Will still use them, but now I know I can't rely on the side handles on the other bag."
3.0,"ok, it's too big and has to be fitted, and the &#34;jewel&#34; face is weird.  Bought it for the copper color, but the face cover is a bit too fancy."
3.0,only thing I don't like is they keep falling down when I turn my head.
3.0,"The material is very thin, but it does not affect the look. It is very cute on."
3.0,"The fabric is thick and feels a little heavy on your face. After wearing one of the masks only a few times, the stitches opened up where there is a wire above your nose."
3.0,So it’s not terrible but it’s not great either.  The fabric is that fabric that clings to you and cause you to get electrocuted every time you touch something metal.  The belt is pretty flimsy. I also got it a size 20 which is 2 sizes larger than I would normally wear and the boobage area buttons pouch up and leave open gaps so if I wear it I’ll have to stitch the area closed.  When you wear the belt the dress doesn’t really flair it bunches up on the sides which could  be because I got it much larger then I would typically wear.  Not sure if I’ll actually wear it most likely it’ll be used for a photoshoot or costume.
3.0,"After a couple month's use, the buckle piece snapped off and the belt was no longer usable."
3.0,the ankle is a bit too tight for comfort.  The foot part is quite comfortable.
3.0,Shirt runs very wide
3.0,I really like my new nose ring! Perfect fit and looks great.
3.0,"Runs small, but is really cute. The tie across the neckline is cute and the cinched waist help give definition to your body while the fabric is flowy and fun. Nice animal print is in style (when isn't it?). I don't know if I would dry clean, but a lingerie bag and gentle cycle will probably allow it to stay shapely."
3.0,This dress is fit different and not in a good way. Loose in chest area and I am a 44G and extremely tight in the mid section. The dress would be better if it had elastic around the waist area. This dress had so much potential but failed.
3.0,"This dress is adorable. The print is even cuter in person. Love! The material is a little thin and see through where there are white spaces in the pattern. I should have ordered a S, but went with M. It's a little large in the bust and waist. The fabric is soft and stretchy. It's a very comfortable dress!"
3.0,No biggie
3.0,"Well, you get what you pay for.  I was going to return these, but in all honesty, they are super comfy for a lounging bra and super cheap.  Don’t buy these thinking you’re going to get an decent support, but if you want a sleeping bra, or even a casual bra, these are worth it."
3.0,Dont think would buy again cheap made but guess it's ok for a kid
3.0,"I have four other pairs of 90 Degree leggings - two cropped (90 Degree By Reflex - High Waist Tummy Control Shapewear - Power Flex Capri Legging - Quality Guaranteed - Black Medium), two full length. They all seem to be exactly the same and are staples of my wardrobe. They all have lasted for several years, too. When I saw a pair with pockets, I was thrilled. Well, the material is not the same as my other leggings. It's a little bit thicker, with a sheen to it, and the material is very slick. I don't know if it's the slippery fabric or the cut, but they slide down throughout the day and I have to hike them up. I also find that any slim fitting top I wear over it (in winter I usually wear a longer layering tank under a sweater) slides right up over the slick material, so I'm constantly having to pull my tank top down from where it's ridden up around my waist.  I wish the company would just put a pocket on those other leggings.  I wouldn't buy another pair of these."
3.0,The bottom fits me well. The top doesn’t have the best support but it works and fits. I wear a 38C. I usually wear a size 16 with XL. I would say try to find a top that has straps so it’s easier to put on. Also this may be better for smaller chested people. Anything bigger than my size would probably look bad in my opinion with out proper support. Although this is cute!
3.0,They run a little small but overall I like them.
3.0,This shorts a re bit smaller than a large size boxers if you need a Large order a XL
3.0,"UNACOO 3 Packs Loose Fiting V Neck Stretch Tee Shirts Short Sleeve for Boys and Girls are pretty thick and heavy for a tee-shirt.  So, I would say these are not for a hot summer day.  They don't really feel like 100% cotton.  There is quite a bit of stretch in them.  Therefore, I honestly think they are 100% cotton.  Especially since I washed then and they barely shrank.  So, I think they are actually a cotton/poly blend with some elastane.  The size I received was a 9-10T.  I have no idea what size that is, but my 7 year old now wears a size 8 or Medium in most clothes.  These fit him perfectly with room to grow, so I will have these t-shirts for longer than just one season.  (So long as he doesn't get them too grimy!)  So, I would say that the 9-10 is actually equivalent to an 8-10 or medium.  They are kind of boxy, but overall a decent t-shirt set.  Says 3 pack, but what you actually get is 3 t-shirts.  I like these better than the crew neck ones by this brand because I just like v-neck over crew neck any day."
3.0,"Almost, I little too short!"
3.0,Not totally satisfied with the item but but may do with it for my photoshoot lots of adjustments needed to be made
3.0,The top was too hard against my feet.
3.0,"I’m returning this item to size down. The fabric is very soft, more like a jersey stretch cotton than a typical dress material. Also, the black dye has a very off putting pungent smell; I’ve encountered this before with fabrics from over seas.  I wish that the print wasn’t one sided on the bell sleaves, as the inside shows regularly around the wrists and is white with bleed through of the design; it would definitely look like a more high end quality garment. I’m 5’7”, 15O lbs 34DD average-slim waist, average-wide hips 34-28-38; I have an athletic to curvy build and based off the reviews I ordered a Large, but the arms, chest and waist are very baggy, so the shape is not as flattering as in the images, so I’m retuning for a medium! I’ll update. I did love the keyhole detail with tie and look forward to wearing this with OTK black boots!"
3.0,I really like the scrubby brushes on the gloves. They are a little big for my hands but will do.
3.0,"Material do thin, a hole already<br />Occured from just one use of a pair.<br />I likley will have a short useable life with these socks. They are soft but my early observation is they are not durable at all."
3.0,The pants were too long.<br />Confortable.
3.0,"Returned: I really liked this dress. It was discounted so I thought I would try it. I typically wear a medium so I ordered a 3XL. It fit fine on top. I am 5'4"". It was too long. Even when I added 3"" heels, the dress still touched the floor. I loved the color and the material. The straps were kind of strange and took me a minute to figure out. This dress was not for me, but I think it would be really cute on someone a little taller and possibly more slender. I discovered that I have too much weight in my middle to pull off that much of my back showing. :("
3.0,"The earrings are beautiful but the color is not black as I ordered. It looks more like dirty green. Overall, not bad."
3.0,"Good durable watch, but loses 2 minutes a week."
3.0,"Kinda thin fabric, shrunk a lot after 1st washing"
3.0,3 Pom Pom balls fell off the first time my daughter wore them. They are not sewn on tightly.<br />It’s a cute outfit otherwise but the shirt was cheaply made.
3.0,It didn't look like the picture
3.0,"Im 5'1 and 115 pounds and this dresses tightness fit me well but the length was WAY too long and will need to be sewed. The sewing on the hip was not done well and had a wrinkle and fit awkward, the sequins are very itchy on the inside of the dress and the zipper is hard to zip up and down with the sequence in the way. Overall for the price the quality is expected and after getting the length adjusted I will be wearing this dress to a senior prom :)"
3.0,"The dress is lovely, but being 5""6 and hippy, it has a tendency to ride up and it is already above the knee so that gives the appearance of being too short and unprofessional and this dress was purchased for the office.  The picture gives the allusion of being to the knee as depicted on the model, but upon putting it on, it was apparent that was NOT the case.  I've had had to return so many items to Amazon lately due to misrepresentation of the items so I did not want to send this back as well."
3.0,Beautiful but the elastic was weak and stretched easily.
3.0,The color of the dress is very pretty (does match the coloring posted) but the material is very thin and the jacket was not the same size as the dress.  This dress is made for someone with the physique of the model tall and thin (im average 5'7 somewhat large chest area). When I put the dress on it did not look at all like it does on the model (I could hardly tell the low/high hem which is the reason I bought the dress) so I had my daughter (who is 6ft and built like the model) put it on and the dress looked like it did on the model but the jacket was still too small on her (no way that jacket was a large).  My opinion of the dress is that it is very pretty (true to color) but very thin and will not give you the same look the model has if you are not on the tall and rather skinny size and you might have to forgo the jacket because it was not true to size very tight/little.
3.0,"The reason I gave 3 stars is because it’s very small for an adult. It would fit a small child .<br />Other then that the color , material and stitching was great ."
3.0,The concept is cute but the sizing is off
3.0,"good, not for long time living in the beach"
3.0,"These are so cute. Was looking forward to wearing them, but they smell awful. I'm gonna try to ""air them out"" in my garage for a day and see if it goes away."
3.0,This dress is super cute but way too small. I am usually a 4 but every once in a while I'm a 6. According to the size chart a 4-6 would be a small. The picture is me wearing the small. I'm returning and reordering a medium and hoping it will be big enough.
3.0,"The material is very cheap, and it wrinkles easily but it is cute, not entirely flattering though due to loose fit."
3.0,Ok not what
3.0,"I like the look of the product. It's just ok. I was hoping for something a little thicker. It doesn't have an tag for washing instructions. Not sure how long it will last. At 6'3"" the xxl is a good size"
3.0,"The band is nice, the pace of delivery is not you pay for Prime. Amazon is protecting its bottom line essential goods are either unavailable or over priced."
3.0,"First off I love these pants! But, they just haven't earned 5 stars! 1) They are supposed to be Men's XXL, which I (5'2"", mediumish build, female) picked because I like extremely baggy close. I have to unzip the bottoms just to lift them over my calfs just to put socks on, wich gives an overall view of the entire pants. As for the pockets they are all small, too. I can't even fit my small slim half size wallet in the back pocket... Way too small for men's xxl. I could have overlooked this because even though I prefer baggy they are still fairly comfortable. But 2) the clincher was today after only wearing them three times, one of the cargo pants zippers broke. I specifically picked these for the cargo pockets. These pant could have been my dream pants and I and simply disappointed. I hope whomever made these reads this and puts out a similar line, just bigger, with stronger zippers. If they would do that I'd buy one in every color!"
3.0,"A little to snug, but I love the style."
3.0,We returned it because we thought it opened or something. But it is just a plastic mold. Buttons and switches do nothing. Good for a younger kid that doesn’t care.
3.0,"Worth the price, not the greatest.  The lining seems to get snagged when you slide you hand in or remove your hand.  As you remove the glove, pull on each finger and remove them slowly.  They have served their purpose.  Not as thick as a similar style glove I picked up somewhere but they keep your hand warm when it is cold and that is what they are supposed to do.  Not ideal for skiing or snowball fights.  Need to keep them dry."
3.0,"The material is nice, only if your hips are wide (like mines) you will look fat"
3.0,I’m usually a L probably could have ordered a small
3.0,Quality alright.  Nothing wow. Color and length nice.
3.0,"Product review<br /><br />I would give it a 3 out of 5<br /><br />I received this product with a huge discount in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The blue in the dress is very vibrant, and beautiful<br />-It feels so silky and comfortable to wear<br />-The pockets are deep, and can fit most everything I need in them<br />-All in all great quality of the dress<br />-I'm 5'5, and the dress comes mid thigh, which makes it nice to wear without pants or anything underneath<br />-This dress makes a very good base for adding something too it (ex. Scarf, necklace, leggings, belt)<br />-It doesn't wrinkle at all<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The sleeves are oddly shaped, making my shoulders look bigger then they are<br />-If you don't have some kind of a figure you look like a flat board<br />-The dress took forever to ship here<br />-The way the pockets are places, it makes my hips wider looking<br /><br />I am size small, 2 in dress and weigh 110lbs, this dress fits pretty well. Again it's a good base for putting thing with it. It could go with any accessory, and look really cute! I wish it is​ a little tighter around the waist, and the collar was a little lower. But all in all the dress is really cute. I don't think I would buy it again, but I definitely like having he one I have."
3.0,"Bottoms are so extremely small. I bought a large and the bottoms would maybe fit a toddler! Top was really cute and the quality seemed well made though. So if you are extremely tiny, buy this. If not, don't even bother."
3.0,It did not sit on my shoulder.  I had to safety pin it to my shirt
3.0,"Not the orange shown in the photo, very dark burnt orange."
3.0,"I can see how this necklace would be nice for someone between the ages of 9 and 15, but it is not of a quality that is fitting for an adult unless that adult is using it solely for a costume or themed event/outfit. From the description and pictures, I had much higher expectations. Even when I am photographing the necklace, my own photos of the beads pull more turquoise when, in real life, the beads are actually blue, not aqua or turquoise. The pendant has a cute sun design, but the material itself feels cheap. The beads look like basic beads that can be bought at Hobby Lobby for quite cheap, and it looks like the beads are strung onto fishing line. The clasp does seem sturdy, which is a positive for this necklace. The necklace is flexible, but it does not lie correctly or evenly when I have it on. The shorter necklace definitely is not a choker, which would have been more attractive. I just wonder if I got a necklace that was a fluke because the other reviews really rave about the necklace (which is why I selected it), and even their pictures show the necklace to be of higher quality materials as well as lying flat and even against the neck and chest regions. I'm pretty disappointed, to be quite honest. I typically love beaded necklaces, but I'm sorry to say that this one is a solid no for me."
3.0,"The dress is beautiful and comfortable, for the price you pay, but it is always big in the front, there is some weird cut in the cleavege that is not flattering at all. I started ordering the L, because I didint want it t be so tight, then exchanged for a M, and then for an S, and still look large and I am a 36B...."
3.0,Very very thin tshirt dress. I like the feel but I definitely have to wear a slip underneath. But good to wear it around the house. It does fit true to size. I got a small and I am 5'3&#34; and 130 pounds.
3.0,Nice quality but the XL is so small... it fit someone who usually wears a small size swimsuit.
3.0,Okay shoes for the price quality was not so great
3.0,"DEBERIA SER DE MEJOR CALIDAD, PRODUCTO MUY CHINO"
3.0,"The band has no fine adjustment, as other bands. Could not get it to fit properly, l will have to go to a jeweler and get another band with fine adjustment. If it was not for the band I would have given 5 stars."
3.0,"After debating to order, based on the reviews, I decided to order just to try. They fit very snug, I have always been a size L in yoga pants, but these were so tight, you could see through a great bit. I ended up returning. I recommend ordering the next size up."
3.0,"Thought it would fit tighter or have a draw string, something to make it a little more snug."
3.0,"Well it's green, from Volkswagen and is a shirt. Pretty basic shirt, not very well made in my opinion, but it holds together, fairly thin shirt. Its ok, not enthused at all."
3.0,The suit was very cute but did not fit my body type. Perhaps someone with a longer torso and larger bust. The color was more orangish red.
3.0,shorter/smaller then expected
3.0,"I got This for a wedding because the picture shows it being much more flowy and wide legged, but it isn’t it is straight legged and it is also pretty revealing so i did Not wear it to the wedding. But it is very cute for a vacation or girls weekend away or something."
3.0,The shirt is about a size to a size and half too small. Good product though.
3.0,"Nice heavy material.  Like many other products made in China, the size can vary and they seem to get smaller each year"
3.0,"Runs small. I ordered a large and it's a fitted medium and not very long. Falls right at waist line. very light thin material, you'll need an under tank."
3.0,"I’m 5’4, 135lbs and I ordered a medium (my usual size) and it was a bit tight around the thigh. Besides that though, they’re really cute shorts. Nice material."
3.0,I like the look of this shirt but the material is awful.  It is hot and does not breathe.  Hugs more around the neck than expected.  I did not return but I would not purchase again.
3.0,Not as long as it shows in the picture.
3.0,I normally wear a large so I ordered a large even if it's smallest r setting it was much too big
3.0,I’m not rough with jewelry...just washing my hands A LOT...I looked down and my ring lost a stone!  I’ve had this ring for a month and it’s my wedding ring. It’s out of the return window so don’t know is it worth trying to buy another one?????
3.0,a little narrow for my glasses?
3.0,"I was always told that you can buy cheap shirts, pants, ties, etc because they won't harm you in any way, but that you should never buy cheap shoes because they will affect your feet or cheap glasses because they can damage your eyes or, at the least, give you headaches.<br /><br />I just needed a pair of cheap glasses to throw into my glove compartment for when I forget and leave my good pair(s) at home. I liked the way these looked, I liked the fact that they are polarized, and I liked the fact that they're inexpensive and if they get crushed in my glovebox, no biggie.<br /><br />And that's pretty much what I got. They're really no different than the sunglasses that you buy at the gas station when you realize that you left your good pair at home. They look good and I'll give them points for a good polarized lens. Note that I said ""good polarized"" because that what's good about them. The lens itself is thin plastic and so likely to scratch and more importantly, likely to distort in time (not that they are optically perfect now) and that's when the headaches start and your eyes get tired after a day or even after a few minutes of wearing them. There is no substitute for good optics, but good optics are costly, especially when you get a designer name thrown in.<br /><br />The frame is cheap, but what did you expect? I saw a review where someone pointed out that the arms are hinged; well yes they are but they are not spring loaded and are not very flexible. The frame itself is a cheap brittle plastic with not much bend or flexibility, and the arms are a low-grade metal but thicker and stiffer (which is good) than I have seen on similar pairs. These won't likely survive your accidentally sitting on them and dropping them lens first on the pavement will almost definitely scratch them.<br /><br />On the other hand, they do look nice, the polarization is good, the nose bridge is not adjustable but it is comfortable and the ear hooks can be bent to shape if desired.<br /><br />If you like the style, and if polarization is important to you, you could do worse than these. They are as the seller describes (with typical sales hyperbole) and no one is being misled to thing these are the same as a $250 pair. They are what I was looking for; a throw-away pair to stash in the car if I forget my other glasses and I am happy with the purchase. But I would never think of these as my primary pair; do your eyes a favor and pay for good lenses, and keep these as a spare pair."
3.0,Pero dependiendo para los con los osos también
3.0,"This is an interesting Jacket. Using the sizing chart they provided the Jacket fit and size was correct. The overall construction of the jacket was very good and the fleece used was just right for a cool day or evening. If the temperature were to drop below 40F. I would recommend a heavier jacket or layer with a heavy sweater.<br />The initial appearance makes one to believe it's a tactical or military style jacket, but with the odd placements of zippers leave much to be desired. I found the hand pockets placement to be somewhat impractical for keeping ones hands warm. There are no inside pockets to speak of, so a placement for gloves or a wallet are out of the question. I have no idea what the two back pockets do. I believe they are listed as game pockets, but they are very small for that application.<br />Overall I would give this jacket a 2 1/2 stars out of 5 stars because of the odd locations of the zippers. I did get very nice remarks on the overall appearance. As a nice jacket it looks ok, if you are looking for a tactical jacket, then this is not the one to buy..."
3.0,nice product too small for me
3.0,Pretty cool but it's not the size of a normal dog tag so if you have a larger head it might not fit around. The chain is also a bigger size than a normal dog tag chain. Still really cool but sowmthing to keep in mind when purchasing.
3.0,Padding is awkward. Not something I would buy again.
3.0,"Love the shirt, quality material, but ordered XXX, and shirt says XXX. Made in England. Maybe it's a metric XXX."
3.0,too small - I'm a size 10 and it didn't fit  -
3.0,it is nice but I bought L and it was big.
3.0,I purchased  XXL for my daughter and it is actually more like a size Small<br />Fits my stepdaughter instead of my daughter and it is super cute on my stepdaughter
3.0,my son said that when he put in his ear it bent so now affraid if wear it will completely break off
3.0,"I only rated this a 3 star as it's pretty cheaply made. I get tons of compliments on this band bag though and it fits the basics for going out. A small wallet, my cell phone, lipstick and mascara. You get what you pay for."
3.0,"The skirt was cute but it was so small I could barely get it on.<br />I am 5.1 & 155lbs & med is what I normally get. I am not even sure if an XL would have fit.<br />Also, no give whatsoever."
3.0,"I like the shirt, but while this is totally my fault for not looking harder, there are 2 things I don't like. First, it doesn't have a front pocket...didn't even notice, though I should have...but want to point out in so you don't make the same mistake. Second, and much more important....this is NOT wrinkle resistant. Not even close. I have another shirt that is not wrinkle resistant and this one is a wrinkle monster compared. Hope you have a good iron for this one!"
3.0,Just ok.  Great price but not a great shirt.
3.0,Well they haven't. Torn up yet
3.0,Extremely sheer. I think it slims be more suited as a swim coverup. I was hoping for more of wearing it as a kimono with casual clothing.
3.0,"I loved this suit. However, I wore it in southern Cali in the ocean and sand got trapped between the fabrics in the top. Makes it look super dirty. 6 mos later I have been able to get some sand out but not all."
3.0,It is very small in the shoulders and you can tell that the flannel will shrink a good inch at least.  I like the color and the style.  I will reorder in a larger size.
3.0,Product worked but the sizing was a bit off
3.0,Loved this when I bought it but it tarnished after only one wear :(
3.0,"I had such high hopes for this dress.  The photo is really good looking, but the actual dress is NOT pink, but a  salmon color stripe.  We are taking a group photo all wearing light pink......this would have been the only orange dress!  So sad, but had to return it and find something that was actually pink!  Cuffs were very nice, not loose or baggy.  The tie on my dress was very thin.....not the nice wide one pictured.  It was skimpy compared to what I saw in the photo.  Fabric soft, could probably have been a comfy dress."
3.0,Really cute except it definitely is not as long as the picture shows.
3.0,Way big!
3.0,Don't like the way they fit in the thighs.
3.0,This dress is cute but poorly made... it was hard to unbutton because the button holes were frayed which made it difficult. Also it’s pretty sheer you would need to wear something underneath.
3.0,"The quality & color were good, but the fit was too small/short. I’m 5’2” 140 lbs, and bought a large. It felt too short and pushed my boobs down. The boob without a strap has zero support. A larger size would have made it worse. I really wanted to like it, but it’s getting returned."
3.0,"These are big, used for one winter and full year when needed waterproof shoes.  Lasted pretty well, waterproof did not last the whole year and they started developing cracks at the stress points after about a year of fairly heavy use."
3.0,a little looser than they appear in the picture
3.0,"Cute, nice qualilty for costume jewelry"
3.0,The watch is very pleasing in appearance but much to difficult to distinguish the time at a glance. Watch was returned.
3.0,they are super wide! i don't think any humans feet are that wide! never seen shoes sold like this before.
3.0,Very cute design. But did start to turn from skin to surgical steel contact.
3.0,"Nice looking, but not super well constructed. The fabric is kind of rough, and it chafes a bit after a while. Looks great and fits as expected."
3.0,A gift not yet given
3.0,Issues with Strips and the middle piece on the bra that should have a button or diamond stud clamp is missing
3.0,"Just a bit too small.  Better order one size bigger. Other than the size issue,  the Keens are nice"
3.0,"Shipped black instead of tan. I don’t mind the color. The fit is good, especially under my ear protection. Otherwise 4 stars."
3.0,"I got this for lounging around the house, so fit wasn't that important, but be aware that large is very large."
3.0,Cool socks but I was expecting more of a crew sock and these are more for dress socks. Ran a little small but they worked.
3.0,Very pretty but had to give them away too heavy
3.0,Pretty good for the prrice. Waist fits great. Tight in shoulders and arms
3.0,This is NOT a low profile hat it has a high mid point on the head and makes you looks like a cone head.
3.0,"Nice belt, not as sturdy as expected.  Pulls heavier jeans..."
3.0,"The watch was very nice - if you are looking for it to sync to the app, that becomes a problem.  I would only recommend if you did not want to use the app."
3.0,Should of got a small
3.0,I purchased several color variations of this cap. I’m a dental assistant and wear these for work. They are fun patterns and comfortable to wear all day. My only complaint is they wrinkle significantly after being washed and dried.
3.0,Details said it was a pack of 3. I received 2
3.0,I ordered two of the Sterling Silver Filigree Tree of Life to give as gifts.  Now I am having second thoughts.  Both items were terribly tarnished.  The chain was a tarnished grey.  I was very disappointed.  I have tried to clean he necklaces with a little tarnish remover and it helped a tiny bit.  The chain just stays grey.  I am wondering if the plastic bubblewrap that they used for packaging created a reaction with the metal.
3.0,it doesn't look as good as the picture.
3.0,"I liked this shirt.  It's a nice weight and has a cute daisy design on the front.  It's a cheap shirt, though, and pilled after a few washings."
3.0,Too narrow of a fit for me.  I usually don't need to order a wide width but I also don't have a narrow foot.  These run narrow.
3.0,I had to return. Way too big.
3.0,Too small but pretty.would not buy again.
3.0,Keeps sliding down off my nose
3.0,"Runs very small, not true to the size"
3.0,"It's a pretty shirt, but it's not cotton, as it was described, it's pure polyester.  I'll probably give it to a friend because I need cotton."
3.0,It an nice dress but don’t like the way it’s fits me but the dress in very beautiful
3.0,Run a little big. Got an xs because that is what fits me in other brands but they were about 1 to 2 sizes big.
3.0,Had a missing stone and looked a little cheap for my likings. Returned it.
3.0,Container  was only half full.
3.0,I have a long torso and this suit did not fit me comfortably. Otherwise i liked it.
3.0,Wore three times and a grommet fell off already
3.0,"I'm 5'4 and 110 pounds. I ordered a size small size I barely have A cup breasts. The bikini is way too small, even for my small chest. I have a booty so that was too small as well. Even though it didn't fit me well, the bikini is nice. Just order a size or two up."
3.0,"Looks great and does the job, but scratches and paint gets scuffed easily. I guess if you want to buy 1 a month and change them out often, otherwise after a few bumps you pricey watch starts to look trashy."
3.0,"This dress was very cute but much too short for me in the front. I am only 5'3&#34;, in my thirties and would prefer a dress to be just above the knee. This dress came to my mid thighs in the front. Other than that, this is a really cute dress, it was just too short in the front for me."
3.0,"Great keychain... For about 2 months... Then, the hinge-pin # decided to check out, and stay checked out..."
3.0,These are very slippery socks.  They don't go well with my current shoes.
3.0,"Worked for my costume, just thought it would be longer."
3.0,"The shirt was really beautiful but seemed to be poorly made, which I've never had a problem with before when buying this brand. I would have given it another star or two but within the first 2 hours of wearing the skirt I lost three buttons. Fortunately the buttons were only there for decoration but still frustrating none the less."
3.0,The end of the holders do not stay attached to eyeglasses.  Make sure that you use the included temple arm piece.
3.0,"Bought the Avenger Scarlet Witch Age for my tiny wife, size XS, and it fits well.  The leather wrist bands however must be one-size-fits all as they are an inch to big in circumference.  Jacket is from Pakistan and the leather is of the quality expected for the price. It won't last a lifetime, but it is a fun jacket. The styling is successful. Brash. Fun. With the right shirt and boots the wearer looks a bit intimidating. Almost punk."
3.0,"Maybe its because I should've ordered a small instead of a medium - I'm 5'10, 125 lbs - but I went with a medium and while the pants fit relatively well at the top/waist, the ankles are a little too big/wide; the length of the pants appears to be inseam of 29 since they are a bit too short.<br /><br />On the plus side its a nice rayon blend so they're very stretchy. But I'm not if I'd purchase again..."
3.0,nice everyday watch and comfortable
3.0,"Fits al little tight, but the glasses itself are very nice."
3.0,"Cute hat. Seems like decent quality, but arrived smashed so it had to be returned. Soft lining.  Way way too big for my (admittedly small, but still) 3.5 year old with a roughly 18.5” head."
3.0,Thin and easy to wrinkle
3.0,"Ordered this for my newborn niece, and ordered the newborn size, received the 12 month size. Cute, and durable, but got the wrong size."
3.0,Sending back due to too tight in shoulder & back.  Otherwise I love the purple color & style.  Order a larger size than you normally wear.
3.0,"My husband loves the style, but the structure lasted about two weeks. Better for a lightweight man."
3.0,I am 5'9'  and it did not cover all my parts.  Looks even smaller but when you put it on it changes.  Gave a 3 start because if you are a shorter person this could be a cute dress.  Size up!!!!!!
3.0,"Update:  After about 6 months of use, the band regularly disconnects from the fitbit and it falls off my wrist.<br />This is a great watch band to dress up my Fitbit Luxe.  Unfortunately, the color is a coating on metal and is already starting to come off where the wrist typically connects with surfaces."
3.0,Good every day purse. However after the third day the strap started to unravel where it connects to the purse. Thankfully I am crafty and was able to re-secure it before it got too bad. Still using it now.
3.0,"Earrings are very small, and hard to put it ear. Post is to short. They are pretty, but not real happy with them."
3.0,Burgandy color is brighter than regular Burgandy color.
3.0,You have to have a small leg for them to fit
3.0,The buckle is strange. Bought these for 4 year old for dress up so it will do! But I wouldn’t recommend using them for lots of walking around because the strap doesn’t seem like it will stay in place for long.
3.0,"This card case is super cute, its what I wanted and for the price I'm pleased. The interior pocket is hard to open and the small loop of material used to connect it to the key loop looks super weak and fragile. It looks like its about to rip right off."
3.0,"I like the fabric quality. Soft and stretchable Good for casual wear. I wore it all day and I walked easily. However, its tight from the top. Very uneasy when sit and stand . Other than that it’s good ."
3.0,"The earrings are beautiful, but the posts are very thick and not appropriate for a child’s peircing. I bought these for my 7 year old and while the design style is perfectly age appropriate, the post were way too big to fit into her ear hole."
3.0,"A hit too large, but adjustable with hook."
3.0,Excellent dress for my daughter. However it lost color when washing in hot water.
3.0,good material but size wish runs very small
3.0,"You might want to order a size up.  These didn't have enough room in the seat to be comfortable on me.  Otherwise, they're quality boxer briefs, so they may work fine for you.  They're currently Prime with free returns, but I wouldn't want to return underwear after trying it on unless I put another layer in between, which would make it hard to test the fit.<br /><br />Review of: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PNP9ZKJ?th=1&psc=1<br />""Awesome 360 Men's Cotton Stretch Classic Fit Boxer Briefs, Black, 3 Pack"" (Color:  3 Pack, Multicolored; Size: X-Large)"
3.0,"The fit is on the small side (I ordered a 7, and my big toe rubs against the end of the shoe).  Overall it's a cute shoe."
3.0,"I only like one out of the 5. But overall I’m satisfied. A little bit on, even on the last hook."
3.0,It is cool.
3.0,Love the shirt but it just wasn't long for me. I constantly had to keep pulling it down all day long.
3.0,"These are way smaller than other ear saddles they offer! In comparison to the saddles containing abalone these barley come below the lower edge of the ear lobe. Not saying I hate them but definitely not what I was expecting from them. I always get compliments on other saddles I have gotten, these are just way to small for how beautiful they are unfortunately."
3.0,"When I first got it the clasp was really hard to open, but after opening it twice it wouldn't close well anymore. I was able to get it to close and stay closed again for a few days by tightening the band more to my wrist, but then it got to the point where it wouldn't close anymore at all. If I pushed it back down it would just pop right back up. I really liked the look of the band, but this clasp just doesn't seem to be very good. Maybe it's hit or miss and I got a bad one."
3.0,Nice and light but the stitching is poor so be careful putting on and taking off.
3.0,"cute, but not the soft fabric in the picture, they are pretty stiff but they are comfortable."
3.0,I like them but they're too small.
3.0,I wanted to love this swimsuit but I bought in a small (my regular size) and i couldn’t even get it on. Then a medium and I couldn’t breathe. And there wasn’t a large at the time
3.0,"Very soft and great color. looks exactly as in the pic, however too runs too small. I usually get a medium but ordered a large, it was still to hugging to the body. So returning it."
3.0,Heavy frames that are uncomfortable to wear
3.0,Small but cool
3.0,"It's a great shoe...for my 10-year-old daughter.  I bought it for me, a size women's 8, and they are a child's 5, so either the wrong item was sent, or these are grossly inaccurate."
3.0,"I got a lot of compliments on this, but after about a month the lanyard started to break off of the ID holder, and there is no way to fix it"
3.0,The hat is not very snug at all.  There was easily 2 inches between the top of my head and the top of the hat.  It was really odd fitting.
3.0,The frame is a little flimsy but I like these. Not sure I would buy again tho
3.0,I love this shirt but it runs a tad bit small
3.0,It’s a pretty product but for really skinny wrists. It also turned parts of my wrist green after just one wear.
3.0,"The front is very open and on both sides there is sewn a small button,  not  sure if this was supposed to be a closure if some kind. I removed them both and will sew it closed. Also the belt stitching came apart and I have to sew that, but it was on sale for $17 ( I think) so I didn't expect much for quality. It does fit nice everywhere else and the material isn’t see through."
3.0,The earrings don't come with backings and I feel like the cats are going to break easily. But the look good.
3.0,"Material is fine for the price. The cut is very figure flattering. Does not run true to size, it's small. Wouldn't recommend for busty girls."
3.0,"Had to trim up some strings, but it is cute."
3.0,Love the dress in the picture... Though Thin material and some what see through.. Tbt priced too high for this obviously cheaply made dress
3.0,The dress is very beautiful it fit somewhat small. I normally wear a size 14-16. I ordered the XL in fear that the 2X would fit too large in the breast area but I'll make it work.
3.0,"I don't believe these are actually polarized which is false advertising with the &#34;Premium POLARIZED..&#34; name that they have for these. I have a pair of actual polarized and you can tell the difference. Although not polarized which is actually a big selling point for me, they do look cool and are comfortable"
3.0,For the price it wasn't a bad shoe. Just not a high quality shoe. Good for playing outside. Cannot wear without socks or the edges hurt.
3.0,This romper was okay. The elastic material was nice but inexpensive. The lack of quality this product contained led to a rip in the romper the first time I wore it.
3.0,These are comfortable panties & they fit perfect when I first put them on; but an hour or so later they’re too baggy.  Maybe I should’ve ordered a size down.  They also don’t leave visible panty lines.
3.0,"The shirts are nice and light and fit well under the arms. Unfortunately they are a bit short for me, as I am 6'5 223 lbs. I am rocking a smaller dad bod, but most of the places they are tight is in the chest, and shoulder areas. They hang a little loose off my midsection,  but tighten up quite a bit as soon as it hits my lower chest. They sent me a 3XL which I was luck they dis, as I thi k a 2X may have been way too small."
3.0,"The masks are fun and cute designs and the material is the perfect thickness. However, size wise they fit my 4 and 8 year old but too small for my 11 year old. I don’t like that there is not a bar or something to keep the mask snug to the nose - slides of face."
3.0,It's a really cute shirt but the XL fits exactly like a small. I normally wear a medium but wanted to be sure that it fit so I ordered larger.
3.0,sent it back...the chest area was too baggy and you'd need three boobs to wear it or two super large ones.
3.0,"Fits perfectly. I bought it for my kindergartener for her first day of Kindergarten.  The pants are baggy and look more like pajama pants. I decided to get a pink skirt to go with the shirt. Love the shirt, though!"
3.0,Way too small. I wear a size seve shoe and these socks were too tight. If you have feet smaller than a 6 they’d be great. The quality seems good and the colors are nice but they don’t fit me.
3.0,I love the way they fit and perform however the quality vs price is not worth it not happy!! Tried to submit a request to at least get a replacement frame but they don’t do that.
3.0,Loved it well made better than I expected
3.0,I loved the bracelet up until the tiny jar fell off the cork. It wasn't too secure to begin with. I'm just bummed that I lost it somewhere at the store and can't put it back together.
3.0,"Their ok is all I can say, I see them lasting wearing a few times just be careful with them because their made pretty cheap is all I can say also."
3.0,"It is a beautiful dress BUT only for an Asian figure so if you are very slim, short, and your bust is less than C, then yes.<br />It is not cut for for the most of us.  Customer service seems great, may be they will listen and adjust."
3.0,"The earrings are cute, but the print is so small you need a magnifying glass."
3.0,"Good material but it doesn't cover up much &#34;down there&#34;... I mean if your into that then go ahead, but was kinda dissapointed. Was also dissapointed at the size. Extremely small, but ill make it work"
3.0,"Attractive piece, but way overpriced in this bead bracelet market. Look around at elastic band bracelets you can find 10 times cheaper and better build, the metal accents on this piece make it look nice though.<br />Here is the issue: After a few months the wire started to pull and expand the length of the bracelet leading to gaps in the bracelet and wire showing through.<br />Poor build for $99??? Come on dudes, more like $9.99  Dudes come on now!  Peace out..."
3.0,"I had to take off a couple of stars for the sheer frustration of trying to get the pins into my Fitbit.  The fabric is thick, making this process difficult and time consuming.  The fit is very snug.  I have fairly tiny wrists, (6"" circumference) and this band leaves marks on my skin.  It doesn't cut off the circulation, but would if I had even a slightly larger build.  Some people might prefer a tighter fit and this would work well for them (once they get past attaching the thing to their Fitbit).  The print is super cute and it's nice to be able to slip the watch over my hand in the morning."
3.0,"this was so adorable in theory, but I don't think it's compatible with my body type :( It was as if it ran large but was also not long enough. I wanted the waist to be fitted like in the picture but it was the only loose part which was disappointing. I did like that the top is adjustable.<br /><br />For reference,  I'm 5'6, 117 lbs, 34-23-35. The small didn't work for me, but I don't think sizing up would fix the issues I ran into. I think this one would only work really well on shorter people."
3.0,"I love em,but didn't get to use them since they arrived after the time frame I needed them for. Oh, well, maybe next year?"
3.0,Just the basics for a layering t
3.0,This wasn't the BEST outift... The sleeves were WAY too small and I ordered an XXL ( Usually wear a L or M ) and that is just ridiculous. It is very hard to take off and is not worth the price I payed. I ended up having to take it to a shop and alternate it/ readjust it which was another fifty dollars. Think twice before buying.
3.0,"The material is really cheap so you could really only get 2-3 washes out of it before it looks like crap. It's a little short , I would size up."
3.0,"Not bad, i thought the midsection would be tighter"
3.0,"While the product fit as expected, I do not recommend the style for short waisted women with cleavage. It was not tight, just unflattering. I returned it."
3.0,Not bad for the price but they have better pieces than this one.
3.0,Charm  is larger than expected almost too big!
3.0,"The half bar part is too curved for how short it is that it doesn’t fit nicely on my wrist, and I have small wrists. Returned."
3.0,Nice quality but sizes are not true.
3.0,"The charm is pretty, but the glue stopped working about a week after I got it. It came apart as I was putting the bracelet together."
3.0,It looks to cheap.
3.0,Love the look- would be comfy- just runs a little big had to return. DEFINITELY not High Support- maybe medium? Should say that in description
3.0,Much less improvement in night vision than I expected from the information provided.
3.0,"I am a  size 16, 38c. I ordered an XL. Bottoms fit snug, thats ok but Top is too small."
3.0,Do not wear in water.  I rusts very quickly.  I also thought it would have real stones.  But it does not.
3.0,good quality frame but the lens are dull.
3.0,So this is more like a rain jacket not a winter/fall jacket. I also didn't realize it came with the skirt thing. But it fit great and is really good quality. It matches everything. I have not washed it yet which im kinda hesitant to. I definitely wont dry with heat just tubmle.
3.0,I would buy more if they were US made.
3.0,"Does not look like it does in picture, also the stones are not even placed correctly in the holder for it, I will give to my niece to play with instead of wearing this myself. Looks as if It came out of a gumball machine. Not happy at all."
3.0,It's cute and perfect for a mother to give to daughter because of its meaning.
3.0,Kind of to smaller framed guy about 170 lb 5’ 9” and these were way to big for me. These are definitely made for a stockier wider man.
3.0,Not sure if I like this.  I haven't made up my mind.
3.0,Color is not exact but fits nicley
3.0,"Pro--the heating elements work nicely--keep fingers just barely warm without feeling hot.  This is a glove LINER, though, so unless you have another layer outside of them (I use mittens), the rest of your hand will feel the cold.  Fine by me as long as my fingers are not numb and burning!<br /><br />Con--they are sized by length of hand, not circumference as many other gloves are.  If you have squarish hands, they may be too narrow if sized by length. For me, they are impossible to pull on with the battery in  place, and if I put them on without the battery (still somewhat difficult), it is impossible to insert the battery into its pocket.  I slip the battery between my wrist and the glove cuff and cinch up the elastic closure and that works OK.  I may install Velcro to attach the battery to the outside of the glove.<br /><br />If I had it to do again, I think I would pay a little bit more and get a full-up glove that I could just put on and go."
3.0,Love the look and feel of this watch. But for some reason this watch is unable to keep correct time. Either it gains up 15 minutes a day or looses the same time. Very frustrating
3.0,Did not know what to expect from this but everything just looks orange !??
3.0,"I only put 3 stars because I wish it was customizable. Font, name addition."
3.0,Fit nice but the bill was too long. It was awkward to me so i returned it.
3.0,Too big for women
3.0,Looks fake lol
3.0,"When my package arrived, it had been nearly destroyed. The bag inside with the shirts was torn and taped back up with the shirts wadded up inside. Instead of receiving 3 shirts, there were 2. I don’t know who would see that and think it’s ok to send out. Good shirts, just wish they had been honest."
3.0,"This would be a cute kids gift but not so much for an adult. It looks cheap but, you get what you pay for."
3.0,This top is really cute but it is VERY large!  I will be giving it to a friends mother to see if she likes it.
3.0,These tear and break very quickly.
3.0,"The color is a little faded, nice material but the mid area doesn’t sit right on my waistline and it just keeps pulling up.  I had to return it for a refund."
3.0,"Look like quality shirts, nice graphics and material. However, the sizing is way off. Purchased a 3T, fits like a 4T/5T, HUGE!"
3.0,Even after a few washes they still turned her socks blue. Other then that I like them.
3.0,"I liked the idea of a random assortment, but I bought these a while back and I only use a couple of them. The others are a combination of kind of weird colors with a lot of white in them, which I don't love."
3.0,The materials looks with a poor quality.
3.0,Not as deep of a v as pictured. Goes up to my neck
3.0,The top is too large and the bottom is too small. I had to fix the bikini but now looks good. The quality of the tissue is good and the colour is nice. If you are an M  I recommend to buy L. Be careful with the size of the top if you have big curves.
3.0,Did not fit like my size 36 pants.. Not true b to size
3.0,I’m glad it is real metal for the coin but saddened the provided nice cord is too small for my small man neck.
3.0,Definitely go up a size ladies!!!!!!!!!
3.0,"Awesome cute shoe for the price, but runs way too small. I ordered a size 10 (41) and they fit my mom who's shoe size is an 8. She loves them and says they are super comfy too. Wish they had them in bigger sizes and I would order them again."
3.0,Es algo transparente no me gusto tanto
3.0,"As a plus size woman there's already limited selections when it comes to clothing. But plus size maternity clothes? You might as well forget it. Now dont get me wrong, these still run small, but they stretch enough to fit for the first trimester. For a perfect fit I'd definitely need them in at least 1 size up but like i said they still work! My only 2 big complaints are that they're way longer than in the picture, and they slip down while walking even for a shoet period of time. For reference, I'm 13 weeks pregnant, 5'3"", and 248lbs (as of right now.) Pre-pregnancy my waist was 40"", and my hips were 56""."
3.0,"Necklace is very pretty but it is much smaller in person and the quality is not great. Although it was intact when I received it, some stones already look loose after wearing it one time."
3.0,"Feels more like a very thick felt as opposed to leather, so dirt or hair does stick to the material. I kept having to tighten it because the strap would loosen itself with movement and there is nothing to hold it in place."
3.0,"I thought I was getting a mid length, but got a full length which was to long.  I had to get it shortened because I needed it for St Patrick's day dinner."
3.0,Dress is really cute but I order according to the size chart and it is way to small.
3.0,"The best feature of these socks is price: at $2.33 per pair, it's a good deal. I only give them three stars (which means they're OK) because the idea of selling ""one-size-fits-all"" socks in a size range of 6 to 10 isn't ideal. I wear a size 10 shoe, and you can see by my posted photo that, although the socks fit OK, they don't come very high above the ankle, which means my bare skin shows when I sit. These would fit better on those with size 6 feet than size 10.<br /><br />The quality of the socks themselves seems pretty good. The advertising says they have a ""heavy cushion"" that keeps the feet relaxed all day, but there's really no difference in the material thickness anywhere. They are quite comfortable, though, and 100 percent cotton. They don't seem to slip down to my foot, which is good because they wouldn't have far to go, given how short they are."
3.0,This is NOT NAVY blue It’s more of a dull swamp blue. The cap is more on the fitted side.
3.0,Very cute but material doesn't give at all and wrinkles VERY easy
3.0,They are still cool but a little cheap. I will keep them
3.0,The structure is stiff and it is cumbersome to put on the boots. I wish they came in wide widths.
3.0,"The fit is perfect. The zipper is cheap, and I have to cut threads after every washing.  Now, after three wearings, the zipper is separating from the dress at the bottom.  If this dress lasts the summer in one piece, I will be surprised.  But I do look good in it...LOL"
3.0,Not a fan of the red tint
3.0,"Looks great, just didn't last long. Considering the price I didn't expect much. The auto winder overwound itself and broke during a hiking trip. I guess you need to be active to keep it wound, just not too active? Luckily the manual wind still works, but there are a couple odd bits floating around inside the watch from whatever broke when the auto winder bit the dust. Still waiting for one of the little screws to jam in a spring or something, but it's been like that for about a year without further issues."
3.0,Disappointed in the quality of the sunglasses.
3.0,"Sizing runs small, I wouldn’t even know what size to buy that will actually fit with this brand after filtering their sizing guide.. bra shopping is already super frustrating being smaller band/larger cup size"
3.0,This top has more of a men’s cut than feminine.  It would be fine but it’s no where near as long as pictured. It is soft and the sun is cute so it’s fine for around the house.
3.0,"Pros - 3/4 length sleeves, knee length, good price, light weight, lots of colors, roomy, pockets, not see through. Quick editorial - Long sleeves are terrible in the kitchen and potentially dangerous when they catch on things...been there. This is a good cover up, ok to greet the mailman, and everyone needs pockets. The fabric has a waffle pattern but is relatively soft. It doesn't fade.<br /><br />Cons - 3/4 length sleeves a bit long on shorter persons, but not a deal breaker. It feels warmer than expected in warm weather. It doesn't pill, but almost.<br /><br />One problem is how high it rides on the back of the neck. Even for someone with a longer neck it goes into the hairline. Hair sticks to it. Also, if you use a leave in hair product (conditioner, color, etc.) you would have difficulty keeping it from being stained. For this reason, would not buy again. Didn't think about that when buying, but will in the future."
3.0,They are just okay.  One broke after just a couple days.
3.0,It didnt fit
3.0,"This is a sturdy bracelet and will hold any hair tie, the only problem is that I mistakenly ordered a large and it is way too big for my wrist (I have an average sized wrist).  Having said that, if you have large wrists this would not be too small like many &#34;large&#34; bracelets that do run small.  The bracelet is also a bit heavy, but again very durable.  Another thing I liked is that the photo is a great depiction of the actual item.  The edges are very angular and if you prefer rounded edges this is not for you.  I will be giving this away to someone who can use it."
3.0,was too small compared to the same size I normally buy in a store
3.0,It is very lightweight. It runs small so you might need to go up two sizes.
3.0,"The overall quality of this tie is fine.  As follows are a few reasons I knocked off a two stars: It's a bit on the short side, the color is much duller and muted than I had hoped, it ties okay, not great, and it is much skinnier than the listed specs which was also disappointing.  The tie still looks good but it's not one of my favorites as I thought it had the potential to be."
3.0,Bought for my boys to use in the pool during swim classes. They've had them for few months now. One of my boys complained that his leak after several weeks and we got him an Aegend pair since we've had them before. They scratch easily but for the price that's not unexpected. They are easy to put on and adjust. They are fine for casual swimming but since my kids need reliable goggles for practice and meets  I'll look for a different brand next time.
3.0,"These socks are quite thin, soft and comfortable and fit pretty well. The only problem is I've had them for less than 5 months (I wear them once a week) and they have holes in the toes. I had hoped they would last a year. But for the price it's still a pretty good value."
3.0,"The dark navy is nice and the hood is just the right size so you don't feel/look like an Eskimo. But it only gets 3 stars because it is billed as a Cold Weather sweatshirt and it quite thin. It'll be good for spring or fall, or a cool summer evening, but for winter (I live in NYC), you'll need a long sleeve shirt underneath for sure, which may be a challenge since the sizing runs small and after the first wash it shrunk."
3.0,The pattern is cheap and fake looking but I love the material and they are comfy so I do wear them.
3.0,The product is great but the material is to thing  for being a Swisher
3.0,"I struggled whether to give this hoodie three or four stars, but since I had to return it, I ended up on three. Fabric, great. Nice, but not too heavy. Color, pretty darn good. Construction, very good. Style, very good EXCEPT for the hood. It was just odd. Too big. Too heavy. I just couldn’t get it to lay comfortably and smoothly and i really tried. My best guess is they just made it too big as they sized up the garment for my plus size, a common mistakes clothiers make:  You can’t just add two inches everywhere for plus size clothes."
3.0,"If you have anything larger than a B cup do NOT buy this suit unless you want your girls hanging all the way out! I'm 5&#34; 7&#34; 165 lbs with a small C cup and I was barely covered in a XXL sz 14-16. Run small. Don't get too excited about the tummy control either it's not much at all. I will be returning it. Looks great on the model, but not for us busty curvy gals."
3.0,"One thing that should really be in the description is that this is not a solid ring.  The part with the birds is a separate band that spins around and makes noise.  The sizing is also very small.  I ordered the size for my ring finger, but this fits my pinky. I'd say it's about a half size difference."
3.0,With a 33in waist mediums were tight.  Should have gone a size up.
3.0,made kind of cheaply. i had to glue some feathers back on. but they still looked cute
3.0,The fit at the waist is very comfortable. The look overall is weird. The shorts flare out so much at the sides. It almost looks like a skirt. I’ll still wear them every once in awhile but would not purchase again.
3.0,I was not real happy with it since it made me look like a really old lady!
3.0,sewing needs to reinforced as it is easy torn.
3.0,Ugh these are adorable BUT they are scratchy and a bit tight on the calves for joggers. I wanteddddd to love them but I had to return them.  Not comfy to wear around house or to run in.
3.0,"It is unusual, but it would be more appropriate for a young child than for an adult."
3.0,It's ok nothing special
3.0,"Didn't work for me. Too rough contrast with the bifocal portion. But quality seemed ok, light and nice looking. Vision seemed ok. So i give it 3 stars. For other people it may fit better."
3.0,"The design of this bathing suit is beautiful. But it runs extremely small. I am a 4-6 but this did not fit me. Also, the chest part is bear and does not have any padding, FYI. I decided to order this since I had a baby and have a few stretch marks at the bottom of my stomach. If the design would have fit it would have been a very nice bathing suit."
3.0,"It would be good as a cover up for summer.  It's almost like a dress but a little too short and it's bigger than a tunic to me.  The material is nice.  I kept it, but don't see me wearing it except as a cover up."
3.0,Ok- kind of cheap
3.0,"had to return, was not flowy like I expected it to be"
3.0,"It’s exactly what I thought; a small cheap black purse, probably won’t last very long."
3.0,"While the price and set is perfect and beautiful, this is not at all what I ordered. The dress is not the same as the dress pictured. I specifically purchased this dress out of all the others that I found because I did not see any snowflakes on the dress itself. It is COVERED in snowflakes. I ordered this to alter and make into a Rosalina costume from Super Mario which is why I ordered one that didn’t have any snowflakes on it."
3.0,this outfit was super cute for my daughter's 1st bday. I only wished the headband was more sturdy.
3.0,They're fun but shrink.
3.0,Nice looking but no cotton at all. This is a synthetic fiber. Cut is large. I ordered a Small and normally wear 15-15.5 slim cut shirts. This was too large.
3.0,It's okay but not as full and nice as the phot would lead you to believe. Nor is it as long and flowing. Too bad!
3.0,It’s alright ! The zipper broke after the first wash though !! Hence 3 stars
3.0,"The product is ok, although I personally didn't care for the fabric, kind of a shiny nylon.  The fit on me was tight in the leg opening. I got a medium based on the size chart, which I fit right into the middle of.  But it does a good job for control and for that I would recommend them."
3.0,The style of the shirt is great and it fits as expected. I got the pink top and it is slightly see through but looks fine with a tank top underneath. Great for work or casual summer top to add a little style to a daily outfit
3.0,"It's very thin, but it takes the edge off of a cool summer morning nicely especially if your moving."
3.0,"The socks are decent. This is the first pair of polyester socks I have ever owned in my life. I always buy cotton socks and this buying decision wouldn't make me stop.<br /><br />First, I really liked the colors and pattern which is why I bought the socks. I love brown and earth / orange tones. I'm not into seasons or holidays, so that wasn't a buying decision for me. The socks fit snugly (not as forgiving as cotton is) but not too tight and they come up to the calf although I wish they were higher, but most socks are this standard height size so they aren't any different here.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the polyester is as you put the socks on, the fabric stretches and thus the colors shift and get washed out because it's a synthetic fabric reflecting light.  A little bit of a bummer hence they look better when I'm NOT wearing them. When you take the socks off, they go back to their original retention (non-stretched look) and the colors become solid and unwashed / unmuted again.  The other minor issue is that the synthetic fabric is slick, so when I wear my sneakers, the socks are slipping in my sneakers a little bit and my sneakers feel slightly loose as a result.<br /><br />Overall, I give the pair of socks a 3½ star rating (Amazon ONLY allows whole star ratings; you should change that Amazon). The socks are wroth no more than 5 or 6 bucks rather than 10 bucks. Mildly recommended."
3.0,"Should have read description more, thought had rhinestones but is just print, not what I wanted."
3.0,Just a little bit too long. Otherwise I love them.
3.0,It fits baggy and little long. Although I’m 5’5.
3.0,"They are cute but fall apart if you put them in the washing machine.<br />They loose there consistency , wash by hand please ."
3.0,Cute. Fits well. Does not stand up to washing. It pilled and faded quickly.
3.0,If I wear it for so long It leaves marks on my face
3.0,Too short of torso for me
3.0,Product is nice.  Good fit.  Just not nearly as thick as it looks in the picture.
3.0,The waist is not high waist. There is no tummy control. Just thin material. I wore shorts over the leggings so that my underwear would not show thru.
3.0,love the color! not a great quality
3.0,"Disappointed. Ordered 2 other dresses from this same company that fit as expected (one medium, one XL). Those other dresses came in two pieces. I was worried about the fit of this one because it is one piece with just a side zipper. I followed the measurements the company/amazon posted and ordered a 3X based on my measurements. The bust was too small and the upper arms were tight. The dress was super long so we hemmed it and added the extra fabric to the side seams under the arms.<br />On a positive note the dress came faster than the given time frame (it came in about 3 and 1/2 weeks).<br />Also they still sent the belt even though it said they didn't send it for extended sizes. Don't know if this was the mistake; the belt doesn't fit anyhow.<br />I would suggest ordering a different (2-piece) dress from this same company. Or be prepared to alter the dress to fit you."
3.0,"I really wanted to like it; it’s a third swimsuit I ordered and the third that has to go back. I am 5’6, around 140lbs and I ordered large. The bottom fit fine (perhaps a little bit too large, but doable), however the top was I’ll-fitting. It was way too short for my liking. It made my torso look extremely short. It was just weird shape. I love the colors, but sadly it has to go back."
3.0,Looks exactly as described but fit smaller that size stated. Would recommend going up a size for good fit.
3.0,Loses over 4 minutes a day.  If you just want it to count BPM it’s fine
3.0,"As many other reviews would suggest, it is indeed sized smaller than average. I took a chance following the advice of many and ordered the next size up and it fits comfortably enough, although not loose or &#34;flowy&#34; as the description suggests.  The material is also very thin and sheer, so if you plan on wearing this in public I would strongly recommend getting black or midnight blue unless you want to wear another tank under it."
3.0,I usually wear L or XL depending on the style. I chose a L and it fit a little snugger than some of the other styles I chose in the same size. I wasn't crazy about the fit(probably should have gotten the XL) or the thinner material but decided to keep it as it works for a comfortable shirt around the house.
3.0,The sleeves are a bit too long and the skirt is also too long (under my knees) but it's okay I can do some sewing.
3.0,I like these but I found them difficult to put on. One of the stud wires has bent and I’m unable to wear them now. Disappointed. But they weren’t expensive.
3.0,Seams are snagging very easy and causing a thread ball that gets very tangled in other clothes. Works great for under shin guards for soccer
3.0,I ordered red my sons favorite color got grey boots.
3.0,Fits but very uncomfortable about the ankles.
3.0,"It was too small for my Dad's feet, but I was able to exchange them and get a larger pair, almost immediately!"
3.0,They are thicker than I wanted.
3.0,The size appears to run on the small size.
3.0,"If you like very large and bulky pendants, this is perfect for you. Read the measurements carefully, though to make sure it's not going to be too large for your tastes. It was too big and bulky for my husband's."
3.0,It is very cute but the sizing is not correct. The small looked like large. I had to return it 😢
3.0,Very nice. My boyfriend loved it.  The only problem is the where the verse says 'as we forgive' got chipped or smudged. He didn't mind. I guess it was a production or print flaw.
3.0,This set seems to be good quality and well made. However the sizing is WAY off. It says it should fit boys 8-12. The scarf is fine but the mittens and hat are adult sized. I’m fact the hat is too big even for the adults in my household.
3.0,"Too short, would recommend wearing tights underneath."
3.0,These pants are the right size but a little stiff.
3.0,Different variety
3.0,"Fabric is cheap, when worn underwear is visible, should include lining for protection."
3.0,"It was a lot too small for me, I was not even able to zip it up in the back. The chest area was also really really tiny and the mesh fabric itself was not the most comfortable."
3.0,Lo large ...
3.0,These look a lot nicer than they actually are and are slightly larger than expected. My son says they are okay feeling but nothing special.
3.0,They can fit me and my son so I'll  just give them to him to wear in our Mercedes I just bought for us. Cute  though I will  say buy it. Takes to long to ship  though so have patience.
3.0,"The pin kept sliding out on a daily basis. After 12-24 months, the buckle broke."
3.0,"Made the mistake of going up a size, not necessary at all. This is true to fit, I may have even needed to go down a size. Cute, but cheap fabric."
3.0,The top where the tie is did not  stay up as well.
3.0,"Fabric was okay, however the fabric over the chest runs small and wouldn’t cover the majority of my chest. If you size up, should fit larger chests, but the the rest of the dress may be too big then.<br /><br />Cute print though!"
3.0,My only issue is how easily it scratches
3.0,"Way to small, so go up several sizes before ordering one of these dresses. It was so tight. Not for me at all!"
3.0,3 stars because the visor fell off and was lost after about two days on my motorcycle key.
3.0,"I would say these sunglasses are exactly okay. My the screw to one of the nosebuds fell off after about a month, and the polarization is slowly peeling away after 3 or 4 (I don't remember when I bought these nor do I care to check)<br /><br />However I will say that I have thoroughly enjoyed the style, and they are in fact polarized, which I wasn't really expecting."
3.0,The straps are NOT adjustable but they are stretchy. Too stretchy in my opinion. You want stretchy but you also want the top to stay in place. That's why I gave the star rating I did.
3.0,"Cute shirt, soft, comfortable but the graphic peeled off  after only one washing. Also longer than I would have preferred. Not worth the price I paid--it is slightly less now."
3.0,"I only gave this 3 stars because it came with a stone unattached.  Lucky for me, I have jewel glue.  Once glued in it was cute and looked more expensive than it was.  Would I buy it again? Maybe. It looks good, it arrived quickly and it was very inexpensive."
3.0,It's got a good sized but I found it too big.
3.0,"I wish I could have kept this, I'm a size 10 and bought the XL it fit perfect on the bottom, however, I am a 34DDD/36DD if you have any sort of chest it's just not going to work for you. It does not have enough side coverage. I tried this on with my bra and without thinking I could wear a front tie strapless bit, it just won't work. Also, the ruffles don't lay like the photo, they were long, all over the place and just looked bad. It's super cute though, just didn't work for my curvy shape."
3.0,"The chart says to order 3xl if you're a US size 12-can't even get it zipped. So, in light of that I'd order 3 or 4 times your regular size."
3.0,Material very thin. Not exactly what I expected.
3.0,"I do not like the &#34;hidden expandable waist&#34;. The design of the waistband is unnecessarily complicated and may break causing the pants to be unwearable sooner than expected. However, the fabric content is great for active wear in a variety of indoor and outdoor conditions."
3.0,Very soft material and color!
3.0,so so quality. It’s too long and big to be a size M
3.0,"I ordered the pumpkin & skull leggings in Large; I'm 5'3"" & 135 lbs.  They fit well & feel good - EXCEPT they're on the short side. (Check out the pix.)  When it's chilly outside, it's best to have longer tights so your ankles are covered; these will not do that. They're the right material for running tights (not the soft, cottony feel of most leggings), so they'll be good for jogging/running, but maybe not good at keeping your legs warm when you're out and about or just relaxing at home. Also, if you're taller than I am, these will probably not be long enough for you.  I may return these."
3.0,They get the job done but they're way too loose
3.0,Its oryt
3.0,"I love the colors nice and bright very vibrant however, the Material is so thin. Very light not what I expected. A bit disappointed on that part other than that I like it."
3.0,small in the shoulders and bust but large from the waist down.
3.0,"Second time purchasing this watch, the knob broke changing battery out. Also, the watch doesn't look as green as the picture, a lot darker"
3.0,"Just received these panties and I was very hopeful that they would work when I saw them. However, after washing and putting them in the dryer, they shrunk significantly.  I would advise shoppers to keep that in mind. Either size up or air dry."
3.0,I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more fullness to this skirt. It's an easy design so I can add to it but I'm not super thrilled to do it.<br />A huge plus though is there is tulle is sandwiched between 2 silky pieces of fabric so it doesn't stick to the dress or rub on little legs causing a meltdown. The adjustable waist is also a plus. Once I add more layers my daughter will be able to wear it for years.
3.0,The hat was WAY too big; had no adjustments to accommodate various head sizes.
3.0,"Cute, soft, but the Nike logo came off after a month."
3.0,"Great material but poor workmanship, I've had 2 pair come apart at the seems."
3.0,"Wanted to love this shirt. I’m 5’3”, around 120lbs, I have a larger bust and lots of my T-shirt’s from amazon are M and fit smaller than this size S. It’s just so Long! And not baggy long, just long cut. I have a short torso, so sadly it just didn’t work for me. But it’s cute! If you have a longer torso, I say buy it!"
3.0,"A nice purse, but the clip on the end of the strap was broken."
3.0,"I usually wear a M/L and bought an XL.  It was very roomy on me, although it might shrink considerably after washing, you never know with these cheap items.  Material is fine but the zipper is very cheap. Not worth keeping for that sole reason so I'm returning it."
3.0,"They don't really look as real as in the pictures, but they're cute leggings.  Just don't feel comfortable wearing them as jeans/jeggings.  More of a layering piece, was hoping it'd be a standalone piece since I can never find pants that fit."
3.0,I sent this back. The shirt was very big and very thin.
3.0,The ribs don't stay in. They're very pretty but it is difficult to get the ribs back in and then they don't stay in.
3.0,"My 7 year old loved the pattern, but it keeps slipping off. It could have been a good one if it  stayed on."
3.0,The fit is not great
3.0,"Fit (2T) was as expected for my slightly larger than usual 19 Mo. old. The&#34;Spikes&#34; tend to lay flat against sweatshirt, somewhat losing their whole Dinosaur appeal, especially after a few washes. When the spikes are up, the shirt does get a lot of nice reaction from other kids and parents."
3.0,"I liked the color, material. It’s beautiful."
3.0,Mmm
3.0,Not as soft as I hoped.  XL was a little too large.
3.0,"Nice material, but runs small! Ordered a large, I usually wear medium and it was still snug, would've ordered XL if I'd known."
3.0,Thin material cheap!
3.0,"The fit is really small and the strap section, what would cover your bra strap seemed to be odd, really close to the neck.  Maybe some stretching would pull it closer to fitting over a normal bra strap."
3.0,Super thick for a cotton T-shirt
3.0,"These were super cute,  I just got a dud pair. They were missing a screw and fell off my face and the lens fell out because of it.  Returning and ordering another pair since it will be a fine product as long as it's not missing a piece."
3.0,I used this as a cover up.
3.0,My wife liked it but sizes run small returned.
3.0,so comfy but too much camel toe
3.0,"It's a yellow bow tie, not much to say."
3.0,"The dress is lovely. It looks as advertised. The fabric is sturdy and has good give. The lace is soft - not itchy. I'm currently between a 10 & 12 size, 36D bust, 5'4&#34; tall, hour glass figure. The 3 star rating is for 2 issues I had with the dress: 1)the non-functional zipper. I was able to get it down to try it on but when my husband tried to zip it up it was a no go. The zipper stopped half way. It appears the fabric on the inside gets stuck when the dress is on. This is not a problem if I'm not wearing the dress. And it has plenty of give - Not too small. 2) There is extra string in the bust area of the lace. It comes from the seem that give the dress a great fit in the bust.<br />I will request another in exchange for this one. Very cute dress. I think it is best worn with a petticoat."
3.0,Nice but too thick and heavy - too hot for me
3.0,Not like picture.
3.0,"I ordered a few sizes up according to reviews.  They fit and we're super comfortable- but they're not great quality, which I had expected. The crotch split the first time I wore them so the stitching is poor quality."
3.0,"tight in arms for an xl, i have bought other items origniatting in Asia and they have fit appropriately."
3.0,This definitely runs small. I ordered using the size chart and It's too tight to be comfortable. Cute design though!
3.0,Excellent if you want to accesorize or use them for safety glasses.
3.0,Latch is a little hard to release.
3.0,Very boxy little shape to cut but still soft
3.0,I wear smalls in all bathing suites. I am 5’5 & 130lbs - the small top fits perfect & I love it. The bottoms are tight & too revealing for me. I kept it for the top though!
3.0,Runs big and wrinkles very easily when sitting. Deodorant is also very hard to get off. It wont rub off like some materials.
3.0,I had to do lots of alteration to it & the material does not last after one time wash
3.0,glass scratched
3.0,"I have been training hard for the past few months at the gym. For info, I have a 18.5 in shoulder width, 40.5 inch chest and 32 inch waist.<br />This shirt did not fit well at all. It was extremely loose at the sides, comfort level is good though.<br />However, due to the ill-fit, I decided to return it. Cannot say that it is a bad item though, because it's my preference to have a better form fitting shirt at the gym. Others may like this due to its loose fit and comfortable fabric"
3.0,"I was told about moldavite by a friend and to be quite honest, I was impressed by the craftsmanship of this necklace. Is it gender neutral for those seeking something along the lines. And the crystal does possess a noticeable effect.<br /><br />I recently learned this was not moldavite but perenhite. To be honest I am still happy with the crystal and pendant but I feel deceived by the listing."
3.0,This mask I absolutely loved the saying on it! But<br /><br />1st it took almost 2 months to get..<br />2nd the mask is HUGE it takes up your entire face and if you were it to where you can actually see you can’t even read the words. They give you filters to put in it and if you do that you REALLY can NOT breathe.<br /><br />Don’t like this mask and would NOT recommend it to anyone. I’m going to look for other one.
3.0,"I really like the material these pants are made out of. The only thing that I have to say that's negative for these pair of pants is that after wearing them for a couple range and training days, and one or two call outs, the seat has started to separate. I still like them, however I am undecided if I'll get another pair."
3.0,It’s a cute backpack but it’s really expensive. I guess I paid for the brand name.
3.0,Nice pair of earrings.. But the lock is so tiny...
3.0,I would love these if they were actually RED! Unfortunately they are very very pink in the sunlight... Where you'll be wearing them!
3.0,Knee is already wearing from kneeling on grass/turf after only 3 wears
3.0,More like child sizes.
3.0,"I wish they were as dark as the picture shows. In daylight, they are a medium blue, not quite light, but definitely not dark enough to match my ring, which is why I bought them. I would like to use them as a gift, but the backs are cheap plastic, and nothing in the box to let the recipient know that they are genuine, nor that they are gold. Still thinking about sending them back."
3.0,"These are really inexpensive gloves so not complaining too much but the tab with the velcro on one of them came right off when my son tried these on. Gloves fit, he didn't even pull on the tab hard and it came clean off.  We'll see if we can sew it back on.  If these were more expensive, with this type of craftsmanship, I would have given it a 1-2 star rating."
3.0,"won’t stay on your face. I think they are cute, but I regret buying them."
3.0,Not liking the fit.
3.0,"5'6.5, 120 pounds usually a size 6 in dresses. I ordered a medium, which wasn't too bad of a fit, but could've gone with a small. Either way, the material is too thin for my liking, even with a slip under it you could tell that I had a slip on. Really cute dress, but I returned it."
3.0,All four are very nice but they fall down every time you move your head.
3.0,I liked this dress. It's very different and unique. It's exactly like the picture except that it's supposed to have longer side slits and in person it doesn't.
3.0,"I ordered this in November as a holiday dress. It arrived past the deadline and too late for me to use. Also, I ordered an XL according to the size chart, though I normally wear a medium. It was a little big. I probably could have gotten away with a medium, as it's stretchy. For reference, I am 5'3"" and weight about 145. The material is very heavy, so I wouldn't recommend wearing it dancing, which is what I had planned to wear it for. If you can get it in the right size, it will be pretty and flattering. I eventually got a refund but it took a lot of work and several phone calls."
3.0,"It is only possible to read the watch under bright light, both hands and numeral markers are very hard to see"
3.0,Very cheap and I feel dissatisfied
3.0,I love the bag but less that a month of having it and one of the clips broke on the long strap. Hopefully I can find a new one
3.0,[[VIDEOID:841ffad15a302cfa7e8aa9e93728cad1]] Update: they sent me another pair in black to rectify the problem. These pants did not have the same sewing defect so I’m updating my review to 3 stars.<br />I ordered the gray and black and while they fit perfectly and I love the pockets there is a sewing defect. The waistband is not sewn down properly into the back of the pants so the seam flips up. Will be returning. Disappointing.
3.0,The color is gorgeous just what I was looking for but....my feet slipped right to the front and I just knew I wouldn't be wearing them often like I do my other heels by GLAZE. I would have ordered these from that brand but they didn't have this Burgundy shade. Anyway the material is stiff and the fit is just uncomfortable. I wanted to keep them but I knew it would be a mistake to do so. Sorry these didn't work for me but the return was a breeze and I'm happy about that.
3.0,Difficulty finding way to return
3.0,"I sized up so it wouldn’t cling, but then the waist was too saggy. I did have it altered. Had the waist tucked and made the sleeves elbow length. I love it now. It is nice for postpartum pooch and works for breastfeeding. I wish there was some print dresses like this. I would buy even if I had to get them altered"
3.0,"This watch band is super adorable and stretches really nicely (which is sort of a must with how stiff the clasp is and how hard it is to open). I never ran into any issues with the pins popping out, but I did get a rash from where the metal clasp touches my skin. The only thing I've had reactions to is nickel so I can only assume there's some in the steel. Real shame, it's a perfect band otherwise."
3.0,Does anyone do QC here? The stitching on most of the dressy shirts I find on Amazon are junk. Super nice looking until you inspect the product yourself and find that the stitching is horrible. I’m not even a seamstress and can do better! The lighter pink wack job should of been double stitched. Really anything should be and yet who ever does cost thinks it’s better to not use double the thread.
3.0,Cute but no support for the girls
3.0,They were uncomfortable to wear
3.0,I bought a size up and it's still too tight and fits strange. Adorable design and color but weird fitting top.
3.0,"The shirt was of good quality.  Washed up ok.  Color was a bit off.  But, I purchased it for my daughter for school uniform.  The cut is not a junior cut which it is advertised as a Junior polo.  She doesn't like it because it's too baggy, loose in the middle and being a junior she wanted it &#34;fitted&#34; with the curves.<br /><br />I thought it'd be a great way to get what we needed quick instead of shopping the busy stores at Christmas time but I wasted $32 instead.  :(  Later I was in the mall and found exactly what she wanted at Aeropostle for $12 each.  Score.  :)  What do I do with these two shirts that she'll never wear?  I wore one for one day.  Not my kinda shirt either.  Duped."
3.0,They weren’t tapered
3.0,The draw is nice but the fabric is very unforgiving for body types over size 2.
3.0,Bought these because they claimed to be a good lulu knockoff- I would not agree. They feel soft and fit nice but they are not what I would have expected.
3.0,"Earrings are very cute, but the gold color is almost orange-toned. They aren’t too heavy for the size."
3.0,I got these as a Christmas present for my 3 year old niece who loves shoes. They are an odd fit. Her toes were sticking out. I think the front was too roomy. She liked them though.
3.0,"Beautiful, well-made dress.  The inset pleats, in four places made the skirt billow at the hips.  The picture showed the skirt hanging down without fullness at the hips.  I normally wear a 14, but could not zip it up the back.  It took a long time for it to come(from  China) so I was not sure I could get a larger size in time for our daughter's wedding."
3.0,"Very short, not made for tall girls"
3.0,Was really disappointed
3.0,"Top fit perfect. The bottoms were at least three sizes too small! Price was cheap enough, I kept it. I wear the top with other bottoms and threw the bottoms away."
3.0,"This is a gorgeous watch! The rose gold face and grey band appear very elegant together and although the face of the watch is slightly larger than a traditional watch, the size is not overwhelming.<br /><br />Despite this being a beautiful accessory, I cannot wear this watch. It ticks so incredibly loud that it has become a distraction to both myself and my coworkers when I wear it. I can hear the watch ticking when it is laying on a table several meters from me. If you can ignore the abnormal loudness, this is a great watch."
3.0,This is so cute and I wish it ran just a little bigger. I think it runs about a size smaller than normal.
3.0,They work well for the shower as long as you don't have to walk a long distance.  The rubber piece that goes between your toes is uncomfortable when you walk with them.
3.0,"The pattern of the suit itself is really nice, but the fit is so awkward. the armpit area sticks out and the tie up part is just a little too high on your neck. I tried to adjust it but I just cant wear it"
3.0,"Arrived on time looks just like the picture. Small dainty cute design, however it is used."
3.0,it's more like a swimming top than a bra
3.0,Order one size larger than you need.  I like the shoe but it is way too narrow if you order your normal size.
3.0,They are not real silver.
3.0,"Fell in love with it when I got it, but the liner is coming loose and I don’t keep a whole lot in it.  So not happy about spending that price and it doing that especially when it had a price tag on it for a cheaper price?"
3.0,"Wand broke immediately, butterfly fell of the middle of wings and daughter broke the bracelet with the thin line. Headband and tutu seem to be holding up"
3.0,I really liked this top until I realized the lace around the neck started standing up and looked funny. My boyfriend said it looked like a lion mane. I think I'm going to cut the neck lace off.<br /><br />Otherwise I like the fit and it looks nice!
3.0,This charm is very tiny  and not as big as  like Pandora style. beads
3.0,They were bigger than I expected and the decorative piece around the “stone” was really thin and flimsy looking.
3.0,It was torn but needed it for the next day
3.0,I didn't love this necklace because the 3 ropes are actually one solid piece. I ended up giving it to a friend and she actually really likes it and wears it often :)
3.0,"They look nice and are what I expected. However, I ordered white and purple separately and received the blue and purple. Also, the purple is quite a bit larger than the blue."
3.0,"A little small for my face, going to use them for vacation."
3.0,"Cute, warm, and as pictured but it small for the size."
3.0,It’s very comfortable when it’s untied. I’m a plus size woman so it doesn’t really stay closed unless I tie it uncomfortably tight. Maybe if the tie was at the sides instead of the front. I even ordered in a bigger size so that it would close but it still doesn’t close effectively.
3.0,Wayy too small !! Order 2 sizes up please trust me here. Super cute leggings but I ordered an XL... it's tiny.
3.0,"This pack is mostly built quite well. The storage space in it, and the comfortability make this bag decent for long-time wear of light to medium loads.<br /><br />I have had a problem with the zipper of the main flap from day one. The zipper frequently wants to eat the flap, and I have to pull the flap from the zipper to open or close the main section.<br /><br />Another weird part is the front tiny pocket is... just odd, I mean it works for small things, but I feel like the vertical zip is wasted with the cloth behind it that catches items from falling out. It's just a minor weird design thing.<br /><br />Overall, I say you could buy this bag, but you could also keep shopping. I'm half and half on this one."
3.0,"Not completely waterproof! They do look great and my kid loves them so I assume they’re very comfortable, but his socks are wet."
3.0,Short in length but my son loves when i wear it
3.0,"thin, and weak-undecided.  Priced more than worth!"
3.0,Pretty good gets lose after a while
3.0,"i thouht it would be a little larger, it is hard to get both ends of a scarf thru, but i still like it."
3.0,"Its pretty small on me even though I followed sizing directions, plus the material is really thin so it kind go shows everything :D. It will work good poolside though because I can just keep it unbuttoned and no one will care."
3.0,Pants are good for the price but it is stupid they don’t waterproof the knees. I don’t understand the purpose.
3.0,very soft and cuddly
3.0,I ordered this because i thought it was yellow but it was black. I did not use it but it seemed to be very flimsy.
3.0,"The Ritchie SS watchband does look good and the quick release on the clasp seems as if it would be helpful.  The problem is that, so far, I cannot install the band on my watch for two reasons.<br /><br />The first reason I cannot install the band on my watch is that the pin that attaches the band to the clasp is just a straight piece of wire -- it falls out of the band.  I am glad that it fell out immediately upon my receipt of it in the mail.  Now I know that I cannot trust this band to secure my watch unless I am able somehow to fix this issue.  I hope that the band is too large for my wrist requiring removal of one or more of the links and, if so, the pins from the removed links can be used to fasten the band to the clasp.<br /><br />The second reason I cannot install the band on my watch is that the Ritchie band is shipped without the spring pins that fasten the band to the watch.  The pins from my old band will not work as their diameter is larger than the Ritchie band will accept.  Hopefully I can purchase suitable spring pins from a jeweler at a reasonable price.<br /><br />It is a shame that such a nice looking band is fraught with these difficulties.  It does make me very concerned on how well the band secures my watch to my wrist."
3.0,I needed just mesh shorts and these have the built in bathing suit bottoms. Fit ok and seemed like a good quality but not what i was looking for. I returned them.
3.0,Slides all around in sleep.
3.0,I love the color but the quality looks extremely CHEAP! It’s not smooth like other bands I’ve purchased from other Amazon!
3.0,"Runs small, feels thin and cheaply made. The letters are the type that stick together when dried and were stuck together from the shirt being folded in the package and are already peeling"
3.0,"I bought these as earrings. Good quality, male sure the balls are screwed on tight though. I've already lost 2."
3.0,Pretty but clasp is very difficult to secure.
3.0,"Vert warm, but a little tight."
3.0,Smaller than i anticipated
3.0,Seems cheaply made but for the price I guess that's to be expected. Had some trouble getting it into the ear but it seems ok after it's in.
3.0,"I’m only 5’ so I expected them to be longer on me, but they go up so much higher than my other pants from this same company and they are very loose in the waist."
3.0,"So dissappointed, the outter weave looks very shiny ( vinyl)... but the smell Of the bag is borderline toxic...I should have returned it ( Life happened) I Loved the two side bags, one has  a great lock on it  !  Also for my needs its smaller than I wanted ( also has a dark cloth linning I ts harder to find things for me  LOL even with the many pockets !"
3.0,Cute but the shorts are awkward fitting. Not comfortable
3.0,"Extremely well packaged. Each shoe is individually wrapped.<br /><br />The toe area was comfortably wide enough for my daughter.<br /><br />The color is more of an ivory white, not a bright white. Gold colored side buckle on the strap. The strap attaches by Velcro; the buckle is just an accent. Which I like.<br /><br />There is a double bow on top of the toe with rhinestones inset in gold colored brooch. The top bow is the same ivory material as the rest of the shoe. However the bottom bow is made of a thick silvery glittery ribbon. In my opinion, the silvery ribbon really clashes with the gold accents and the ivory white of the shoe.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment of the shoe, though, is that for some reason they made a toddler size shoe with a narrow heel. Why skimp on the heel width??? Usually heels are the same width as the sole of the shoe for toddler shoes. My daughter said it was just too wobbly when she walked. So even though she liked the look of these shoes better than another pair we tried, we are returning them because they are too hard for her to walk safely and comfortably with such a narrow heel."
3.0,Some of the hoops change colour easily but the rest are ok and not to mention cute.
3.0,I've notice the band is stretching out already and I've only been wearing it a month. have to keep tightening it and don't think i'll be able to tighten it anymore in a month or two. Will stop wearing it during golf or while running as I think that makes it wear out faster. Love the way it feels compared to the original garmin band though.
3.0,Nice but it doesn't lite up like it shows.
3.0,"Mine is not completely black, the cooper shows through the coating a little. I've only worn it a few times and already have a couple of scratches  where the copper can be seen. Note: I have been know to be a little picky so if you don't mind the small things, the bracelet does wear well and the magnetic benefits (reduces the arthritis pain in my thumb joint) are great!"
3.0,Material is thin and cheap. Stitching is poor. Fits a little loose and frumpy. But the color is vibrant and looks just like the picture. It’s probably only worth about $10-15.
3.0,"I absolutely love the graphic on this shirt. However, the material is kind of a disappointment. I normally don't buy shirts online for this very reason. Just a weird feeling, it's not soft which is what I expected from cotton. Not as flattering as I wanted. Fit is true to size."
3.0,"Although very cute, the fabric on this item was not as described. It advertised as tee shirt material, and the fabric was something much less."
3.0,"I like the style of the dress and the fabric and color are very nice (I ordered the green).  A lot of dresses I've bought online have poor seams or rough edges, this dress had none of these problems.  This dress does however run pretty small.  I usually wear a size 6/small, but I ordered the medium to be safe and I'm glad I did.  It fits well from the waist down but is pretty tight in the bodice (and I am not large chested at all) and since there is NO stretch whatsoever to this dress it is not a good look."
3.0,"I like this dress; it’s cute, good quality and it is nice. The only issue is that it fits a little bit weird over my chest, and requires a lot of readjusting and pulling down. I got the correct size because it fit well everywhere else. I would recommend this, but for people with smaller chests or size up a little bit if you have a bigger chest."
3.0,Great glasses for the price but Three starts because I only got 9 instead of 10 :(
3.0,Just wasn’t real happy with the quality
3.0,Rather cheaply made.
3.0,"Looks much bigger online than in person, one of the cheaper looking pandora products purchased."
3.0,The slippers are super cute but they are really really hard. It's like walking on light bricks covered in foam. Hahaha idk how else to explain it. They dont hurt but they are not comfortable either. They also shed quite a bit....but I mean...there cute 🤷🏽‍♀️
3.0,Elastic is very tight. They feel fine except for the tightness. I will try the next size up and hope they are not to baggy.
3.0,It runs a little small of the bathing suit worked out ok. Go with one size bigger it should fit fine.
3.0,It was smaller and shorter than expected
3.0,"This jacket arrived, fit well, and looked nice up until the point my wife noticed a thread hanging where a button should have been.  Unfortunately, will be returning as there were no extra buttons included with which to mend."
3.0,Runs a little small but nice shirt.
3.0,"Ok but smaller than what it looked online,  not made very well on inside, figure it wont hold up for very long unless you carry very little in it."
3.0,"Fabric stains very easily, fits fairly well"
3.0,"They are exactly what they look like in the picture above. However, my ears had a horrible reaction to the type of material they were made of. I've had gauges for years now and I have never had any problems with them in the past. I just don't believe these gauges are real stainless steel. Or maybe I just got a bad Bach"
3.0,Not the best quality but nice bag for the price and looks good with my snake skin shoes.
3.0,Love these shades but they are a bit big for my face. But they look really cute
3.0,"Love the storage compartments and the looks of this bag.  However, the zippers are very cheaply made and will not last.  Started having trouble with the zippers immediately after I began using purse.  I do still carry it regularly because I can find what I need quickly and it goes with most all my outfits.  I bought it in gray."
3.0,I liked the watch and dial watch well done. The band began to fray a little after about 5 wearing's.
3.0,Felt soft... I normally wear 2X... So thats what i ordered..and it was like a fricken nighty. Huge.even having a largw chest.So be aware of sizing...
3.0,"The online description says “Made in the USA”, these are not. Both inside labels say “Made in China”.<br />UPDATE: These now say ""Made In US Athletic Regular Fit."" The casual reader would think they are US made, they are not.<br /><br />To start with all of my other slacks and jeans are 34 but I ordered a 38. I've ordered one size up (36) in the past and they fit like a 32. (I've found mens slacks and shorts tend to run very small on-line.) This 38 actually fits like a snug 34.<br /><br />My issues other than size.<br />- The overall look of the shorts is great but build quality is another issue. The front fly zipper is about an inch shorter than all others I have. Which means in most cases you'll have to pull your shorts down to use the fly.<br />- The left back pocket is actually non functioning pocket. The internal webbing and structure is identical to the other side. The only difference is it's sewn shut where a zipper would normally go.<br />- The zipper on the right back pocket works but is so small as to be almost useless for practical use. You would have to leave it partially unzipped to be workable.<br /><br />Other than the above issues the shorts are very light and comfortable. The front and leg pockets are very roomy and ideal for general use."
3.0,I like the design but it’s too small
3.0,cool looking socks but they don't hold up very well
3.0,Definitely too small! I ordered 2 sizes up as recommended by the supplier and it's still too small. I need it for my birthday in September so I'll work on me and make it work by then! Beautiful material and will be amazing if I'm able to trim down to fit into it!
3.0,"Shorter than I liked, need to wear shorts with it. Shrank first time in the wash. Love the pockets, though!"
3.0,Legs length are to short and cloth is very thin.
3.0,Runs Small and doesn’t have the logo on the arms Like the actual top used by the players.
3.0,Pros:<br />Fabric and seat cushion support are of good quality.<br />Cheaper than most on Amazon because it's shipped from China.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Waist elastic is of poor quality and very loose. Rise is some what short so it keeps slipping down while biking.<br />I have also bought a $40 Made in USA shorts and their quality and fitting is much better than this. Also I can return it in case it does not fit well.
3.0,"these are pretty comfy but are pretty thin (not quite sheer, but close) and leave little black lint balls from the unfinished edges. I wouldn't run them through the wash, they're probably better off hand-washed in the sink and hung to dry."
3.0,Its nice but had to buy 2 sizes bigger. Not sure why
3.0,"My husband has a number of shirts from this wonderful brand.  He wears a large.  We've received these that are way too big and way too small.  We've returned them several times trying to get the size right and in some cases, it just never worked.  Such a hassle.  The prices are good but we may give up and just find a storefront to purchase these so he can try them on.  Not sure what's going with the sizing but something isn't right."
3.0,Size unmachted but good
3.0,Took a while to get here
3.0,"The band looks great and the links come out pretty easily, BUT if you have pretty thin wrists even removing all the links won't help. So, petite ladies, watch out for that if you're going to purchase this band. Had to return just because it was way too large."
3.0,"Item came in original clear bag for the whole world to see,"
3.0,I bought this necklace because I lost mine. The necklace I received has only 4 beads hanging instead of the original 5. Was described as excellent condition.
3.0,Weak fabric - advertising was for a small head but it was a very wide fit.
3.0,Thinner then expected. More of a lite weight sweater.
3.0,It’s true to the product discription
3.0,Band is way too bulky.
3.0,"The chain itself is fine for an inexpensive chain (no one would ever mistake it for gold). It didn't work for the pendant I had hoped to use it for....the clasp and connecting jump ring are too large for the opening on the pendant. Because of the design of the chain, I am not able to easily remove the end, slide on the pendant and then reattach. I did work for another project I'm working on though."
3.0,Cute pendant for the price but the chain snapped in one day
3.0,Super cute bright suit. Came a little lower in the front than my 8 year old felt comfortable with so sent back.
3.0,these are think and run very very small. i bought a large and the just fit me. i have a very small hand
3.0,It was too tight in the chest area
3.0,Definitely see-thru. The material isn't very soft either. I was expecting comfortable leggings that I could wear out of the house. These are not it.
3.0,La tela no me gusto es muy gruesa
3.0,"Cute and comfortable,  but they don't look like they'll last long"
3.0,"I loved this band... I loved the way it looked with my rose gold sport apple watch 38mm. It was nice enough to go out with as well as wear it day to day. But after 3 weeks of daily use, the bands started to show signs of wear and tear. Nice look but quality not worth the price.<br /><br />Update to my watch purchase: i have issues with the screws. i lost all the replacements already and can't seem to find the page to write the company  Can anyone help me?"
3.0,Did look like I was thinking it would.🤦🏽‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
3.0,Cute outfit just didn't fit as well as I'd hoped.
3.0,"Keeps feet nice and warm, but leaks feathers all over the place.  This was not caused by rough use; only wore indoors for a couple of hours.  But they did keep my feet warm."
3.0,"Decent earrings, just a little heavier than I am used to.  Hard to go from lighter white gold earrings to these.  However, I do wear my earrings all the time without taking them out, so eventually I got used to the heavier weight.  Nice easy clasps.  Planning to go back to white gold."
3.0,It's cute but very poor quality.Lets see how long it lasts
3.0,Fabric is soft. Fit a little snug. possibly could order a larger size(?) I will not because the inseam length isn’t long enough for me. gave me to mid calf
3.0,Good prices but China products so maybe in a month you will get it.
3.0,This dress is very loose and would look better on a full figured woman.
3.0,Looking for an oversized robe this is not it. Purchased a larger size but sleeve length was still short and constantly opened in the front while tied. The hood is cute and the robe is very soft.
3.0,"I felt the dress didn't flatter my figure as much as other dresses I have. The fit was not too bad but the seams that should go under the bust were a little too high for mine. I think I'd have to wear my pneumatic lift bra. The seam at the waistline stuck out, maybe it would go down with ironing. But my biggest peeve was the material -- some kind of stretchy but stiff fabric that I fear may require constant ironing since the dress was pretty wrinkled coming out of the package.<br /><br />On the upside, sewing quality seems good enough though and I liked the cuffs. I think an XL might have worked better since the material is stretchy, but I think I still would not have liked the feel of the fabric."
3.0,"Definitely order 2 sizes up from what you are.  All the reviews I read that is what I saw a lot.  When I got my order in, 4 fit me perfect and felt nice and 2 pairs were tight and felt small.  Material was nice and washes well."
3.0,"This is listed as pony size, but its nearly too big for my 13hh welch cross with a fairly average size head.  I had to use the tightest hole and I may have to add a hole or two.  I'll add a picture of her later."
3.0,"I was very excited to get these! My hunny works 12+ hrs on her feet everyday, so of course this would a great gift for her birthday, only the slippers came damaged as if they were cut with a razor blade before the were shipped, gonna give one more chance because I really want her to have these slippers! *sigh* the things we do for love"
3.0,"I had been looking for some short black western boots, found these at such a great price couldnt pass up.  When I got them, they are great except for the fact they are more pointed at toe than you can tell online picture.  It might be cause I dont like pointy shoes.  other than that I love them, just have to get used to the pointy toe.(crunch)"
3.0,"Is good  but with the use, it loses the adhesive feature."
3.0,The picture looks like a half hat. The white head is weird. This is a complete round hat.
3.0,"If there were a single color i could choose from the rainbow that would go the very worst with my skintone, it would be the color of this "" rose"" jacket. The picture in the ad is brightened and glorified. The color in real life is ridiculously awful. Dull, even with a bit of a gray tone. Almost like a dirty mop. I will however give this 3 stars due to the fact that the jackets feels great on, provides a decent amount of warmth and seems to be well made. I normally wear a small but after reading the reviews, i went with a medium and it fits just fine.I would consider a different color but this was not super cheap. So therefore I'll need to call this purchase a loss. Ugh."
3.0,I would give this coat 5 stars if the insert attached to the outer shell! Other than that it's great! :)
3.0,"Lo único que no me gusta es que tiene cero lumen, NO SE VE DE NOCHE!!!!"
3.0,I was very pleased with the pajamas and the very timely process by which I received them.  I would definitely use this company again.<br />Carolyn Roderique
3.0,Fits looser than expected. A bit tentish instead of a semi fitted shirt. Is super soft.
3.0,"They look nice & do the job. But, they are cheaply made, and I really don't expect them to last very long."
3.0,"1.The watch band material stands up, but the cross straps broke early on. 2.The stem is hard to pull out for changing time. 3. Having said that, I am well satisfied with the watch mechanism and the appearance, as well as the price."
3.0,I use this sleeve to protect my skin on my fore arm because of my skins sensitivity. They are not light weight.
3.0,Sleeves are way too short but hubby washed before I could return it.
3.0,Material is very thin and a bit see thru. It highlights every belly bump and lump. Like cottage cheese lol. But it's true to size and soft.
3.0,Although I live the color pattern it does not provide enough coverage . I’m a 34C chest and 40 hips and ordered a medium and the top was to large. The style is sexy but it didn’t work for me.
3.0,"Cute but butt area is see through , especially if you have a lot of junk in the trunk bc it stretches the material , front part was not see through , 5’7, 155, 42” hips , 30@ waist, 31” bust, 33” bust with padded bra"
3.0,2 sizes too small. Super thin. Not worth it after you dry it. Shrinks at least another side.
3.0,"I liked it, just runs too big."
3.0,Buena calidad pero el tamaño resultó pequeño
3.0,"Why buy all new watches when you can buy difference bands? Get that all new look while still using the same Fitbit Blaze in a different color band!<br /><br />This white band is not bad at all. It has a very familiar feel to the genuine Fitbit band but at a much lower cost. While the material is a bit different, it's not different in a bad way.  The white has held up, cleans up pretty easily, and the metal on the band matches the factory color pretty well. The only negatives I can really say about it is the little tab on the ring, of sorts, that keeps the band secure once it's on your wrist doesn't really do the trick. It ends up sliding off most of the time. It appears the tab either doesn't protrude enough or the one on mine is broken. It also took slightly more effort to attach the bands to the case than the Fitbit bands. Other than these two things. I would say this is a good product!<br /><br />I waited about a month after I got this product to review so I could see how it would hold up to actually being used. I have been pleasantly surprised with it.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product free or at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. The discount in no way impacts my opinions on this product."
3.0,Somewhat small but very flattering
3.0,"Great idea but since the silicone tube is actually cut in half except on ea end, it loses holding power."
3.0,"Very comfy and I like that the straps are adjustable, however, it is slightly see through so I will just use it as a cover up for my bathing suits most likely. Also, where the pockets are it kind of excentuates your hips so keep that in mind as well."
3.0,These were a little smaller fit then the same 36-38 regular boxer shorts I wear
3.0,The color called Latte is not even close.  I would call it Burnt Pumpkin (more orange than brown).  Not what I expected but the material is soft and it fits as expected so I'll keep it.  Haven't washed or worn it yet but will update this review if needed.
3.0,"I am giving the skirt 3 stars because when I walked it made a loud swooshing or plastic wrap crinkling noise. The fit was great (I'm 5'10"" & 185lbs and an XL fit perfect), the skirt came just below my knee....due to my height not all skirts that say they go below the knee actually hit me below the knee.  If it weren't due to the noise it made when I walked I would have kept the skirt. But I can't see myself walking into my office sounding like that. Lol"
3.0,Comfortable causal dress made out of thin material that seems to wrinkle easily. Looks super cute and is longer then expected but that’s probably just because I’m short. Perfect for this up coming cruise season.
3.0,Just okay. Nothing fantastic. Was disappointed that the belt isn't even attached.
3.0,Cute but one flower was already off one shoe upon arrival. I'll fix myself.
3.0,They ripped the 1st time I wore them. never got a chance to send them back.
3.0,"bottom fit great, top is entirely to damn small I had to give it to my niece."
3.0,I really liked this sports bra. But after only a few uses the zipper stopped working.
3.0,"This is an ok umbrella weight for using on the beach or if you have a table with a hole in it for support, but it's really not good for using without a table since there's not enough stability. It holds enough weight if you're at the beach and can sink it a few inches into the sand also, but won't hold if you're on solid ground."
3.0,"Good luck trying to unscrew the ball off. Now that I finally put 2 piercings in, I'm just curious how well they'll stay on."
3.0,"I normally love smart wool footies! I have multiple pairs that I wear frequently. However this cut rolls down on the heel, despite the non slip patch."
3.0,"This bag looks great but is a little on the small side. Still, there's a lot of compartmentalized storage. Some gripes: the tassle zipper is a little sticky, and the flap pocket is not lined. Overall, though, I'm satisfied with the purchase."
3.0,"Nice gloves. Decent quality for the price. Just a note, they are pretty shiny."
3.0,"These are fine for what they're for, and wash up well.  My gym trainer commented, Oh, we're looking very '80s today."
3.0,Nice hat but they need to do a better job on sizing
3.0,"Nice, but nothing to brag about.  I like the pearl pendant better than the cz.  For the money, its ok.  Im not sending it back so that says something."
3.0,could be nice if it was not so big. Changed my mind about getting it again.
3.0,It was a little too tight in the arms.
3.0,This dress was short... I would size up 2 sizes if I were you. I am normally a medium and bought a large and it is too short.
3.0,Decent quality. Tighter fit than had hoped for.
3.0,"This is a really cute dress for short people, or a cute tunic for taller people, but the fabric is too thin. The outlines of my bra & panties showed through in back, even though this is a loose swing style. Love the style, wish they used better fabric."
3.0,Decent for cost very delicate
3.0,I LOVE this shoe but was disappointed I couldn’t wear them. I read the reviews that suggested you to size up! I wear a size 8 and ordered a size 9. I should’ve ordered a size 10 because even the size 9 is waayyyy to tight. I had to change my outfit last minute due to not fitting my shoes. Super cute tho but I will be returning them
3.0,"Honestly, choose a much bigger size then you normally are.  The seller was great to deal with!"
3.0,The mask looks great n looks like its strong n not a cheap plastic the only problem was that the shipping process took to long.
3.0,"Definitely does not look or flow like the picture shows. The size I ordered fits a little on the large side. And even with that, it doesn't flow or look anything like the picture. I was disappointed but have decided it can be used as a swim cover up."
3.0,Looks nice for the money but one of the pins bent and broke after wearing it maybe a dozen times. The watch is no longer wearable.
3.0,The design of this case is my favorite part. It also protects my phone very well when the phone is dropped.  The flip portion of the case does not work very well and you can only put 2 card OR money in.  If you add more it does not close well.  After a few months the closer is already wearing out and I expect it will be breaking soon.
3.0,Nice rings sizing seems a bit small but I like them a lot
3.0,Had to re-gift because it was somewhat small
3.0,"Its ok, big for a woman and I don't like the clasp.  It falls off easily and since its so light, you don't hear it drop. Would be great if they changed the clasp."
3.0,"They get hot!!! Not good for summer time or warm weather countries.<br />Size is pretty good, it covers more than a regular surgical mask and It's soft but I'll use them in winter and see how they perform then."
3.0,Ring is really cute and stylish.This was bought as a Christmas gift and have had too order two replacements in two week. The first one the stone fell out in two days. The second replacement didn’t even have the stone. The third one: the person it was gifted too is afraid to wear it in case the stone falls out.
3.0,"My son has been using these for about 6 weeks now.  They fit well in the beginning but have lost their shape a bit.  The color was a vibrant blue but even though they are rinsed out after each use, the color has gone from bright blue to a faded and splotchy purple.  They still work however they are not really very nice to look at now."
3.0,"My son loves them, unfortunately they smell. They are emitting a very volatile gasoline type odor."
3.0,too small and unreturnable  very disappointed
3.0,It's not a true 'wrap' top. The waistline is connected and doesn't allow for easy movement while wearing. I returned and ordered one size larger.
3.0,Better than a fat wallet
3.0,Is the watch brand Swatch?<br />He had water in it
3.0,Am I the only one who only recieved one necklace?? The title clearly states &#34;set of two&#34; but I only got one:/ It is pretty though not really vintage and the color was different than I had hoped. You get what you pay for I guess...
3.0,"It's not a bad shirt. I bought it to take on a cruise so it will serve it's purpose. Just remember when purchasing items with a low ticket amount...you get what you pay for. The quality is just so so...if it gets me through the cruise and maybe a couple other wears, then I'll be satisfied."
3.0,"I really wanted one of these for the longest and I was excited to find one! unfortunately it is too long for my ear ( the end sticks out really far). If I can find something the clip the end, maybe a wire cutter, otherwise its pointless for me and I am sad about that."
3.0,"The outfit was cute and looked like the pic however, the shirt collar had to be cut to get around my babies head (normal sized infant head 16&#34;) because it was sewn too little, the shorts were a tad big but that's not why I only have three stars. It took the outfit a very long time to arrive and shipping and handling was almost 6 dollars so I didn't understand that. I had forgotten about the order until it arrived on my doorstep."
3.0,"This shirt would be perfect if it was as long as shown on the model.  It comes down to just below my waist.  I needed a longer shirt to wear with leggings...this shirt will not work with leggings.  I marked the shirt as &#34;somewhat small&#34;, but this is only according to the length of the shirt, the rest of it fits as expected."
3.0,"I sized up according to reviews, it's too big, will be sending back. I usually wear L/XL. So thought i'd be safe. I also got a similar shirt, size L, love it."
3.0,"They arrived much earlier than expected, but one was missing a stone.  They are tiny, so they don't really sparkle very much.  I had to bend it a little to get it flush with my nose, nbd.  I am keeping them, even though I don't really care for them, in case I lose my current nose/tragi jewelry.  The little bag to store them in is nice."
3.0,"I like them just don’t dare sweat with them because they will skip right off. Brought them for a Mexico trip and worse a loose dress, had to take them off after dancing because they kept wanting to slip off. They had me shook ."
3.0,I wear a 34b and couldn't get it on. I didn't like the material either so just returned it.
3.0,Not exactly what I expected.  They are rather small (like everything Asian). They just barely reach around the neck to tie as a scarf and are very snug across the nose.
3.0,"Great quality but, runs very small"
3.0,Its made only for small faces also it's hard to find extra filters that actually fit
3.0,They are much bigger that I thought. I do love the light weight material but they don’t fit my son right.
3.0,"I bought extra big because I thought better too big than too small.  Wrong, should have passed this up."
3.0,When trying on these jockey shorts they did fit a little too snug so was disappointed they didn’t fit to my liking if ordering these order one size larger than what you would normally wear going to send them back for xxl
3.0,"The top is a little less fitted than expected,  snug yes, but otherwise fine,  fabric feels new so that could be the problem.  Otherwise a gorgeous dress I look forward to wearing it out and about, It is a confidence booster"
3.0,"I really like how cute they are, but I had barely worn a pair for a few hours abs it already had a hole in it."
3.0,I wear a size 3 in apple. Got the Xs and they fit perfectly. But I put the first band on today (received them yesterday) and it already has a small hole in the band near the connection to the watch. I bet this one won’t last long. :(
3.0,"It would be nice to have a cross strap to go around you, phone holder is in a funny place, wish strap was adjustable on both ends"
3.0,"These are not z87.1 like the originals, which should have been made clear as thats basically the whole point of the Bountys. I couldn't find proper replacements anywhere though so these work. Lens quality is pretty good and they fit in the frames."
3.0,This fits loose. I wish they had an xs option. The material and feel is amazing. Other than sizing issue I really liked the pants..
3.0,The shoulder straps were way too large. I ended up having to shorten and sew them. It worked out but it’s annoying that it came needing something done to it. They were honestly like 8-10 inches long.
3.0,"I thought this would be a good idea.  I have melasma and needed something with a wide brim.  I'm not a hat or visor type person.  I should have just stuck with a hat.  Seemed more inconvenient and harder to keep on than a hat would be. The quality seemed okay.  If you like visors and need a wide brim, it should be fine, though."
3.0,Fit tight not flexible- nice material get 1 size larger
3.0,"Love the look, and I get lots of compliments but the nose bridge does not sit right because it came crooked. Also the back end is super sharp so you have to be really careful. Aside from the look the comfort is not there at all. My biggest complaint is the nose pads don't sit right and are extremely off and crooked, dont want to move them because they look really fragile. They will most likely break if I try to adjust them ."
3.0,I have really sensitive ears and can only wear stainless/surgical steel or real gold... I still have sensitivity to these earrings. They're very nice though.
3.0,Thin material you can see every bulge.Material hugs every bulge or bump in your rear and thights.
3.0,Gorgeous but the post snapped off when I was trying to put one of them on one day.
3.0,"It's cheap, and you get what you pay for. Doesn't hang very well, but again, it's cheap!"
3.0,"bust 33in/83cm<br />natural waist 26in/66cm<br />Got the white one with a heart cutout. Normally a small, but I got a medium and it fits fine.<br />The top part of the heart was crappy, but I used some clear tape and my flat iron to make it sit straight down and now it looks nice. The heart is not hemmed or anything, looks like it might start to fray with frequent use.<br />A friend suggested a mesh patch could be sewn under it when I was trying to figure out how to fix it, so if you're handy with sewing that's an idea."
3.0,Missing one of the jewels and more have fallen out.
3.0,"Well worth the price. Not finished well..there were bits of metal, skin side, sticking out which made it uncomfortable to wear. I filed them down which helped."
3.0,Flashy!
3.0,I always between and Sm and Med. Im 5'3 136lbs and 34d. I ordered a small in this dress and it was really tight across the front and shoulders. The material is very very thin and it doesn't have any stretch to it. The length was above my knees which i like. I will be returning this item. I wont be reordering a size up because I dont like that the material doesn't stretch. The color was okay but not as vibrant as pictured.
3.0,beautiful but not durable. the edges are already cracking in less than a few months
3.0,The zipper is a bitch to grab. But sad to say the legs are a bit too long! I’m drowning in legs. The wide was of them is okay but they are 4 inches longer than I am tall and I have a long inseam.
3.0,Difficult to get on. Beds over pretty easily.
3.0,Not as many little gold balls in one earring as the other. It is noticeable but for the price it's not bad and yes I will still wear them.
3.0,"The glasses work fine and fit ok, but they have a strong funky chemical smell.  Can't tell if it is from the plastic in the lenses or the nose pieces but sure hope it goes away."
3.0,"This dress is very comfortable but the material is very thin and see through.<br />Maybe the darker colours would be ok. But the Ivory one, I will have to wear something underneath.<br />It is very soft material."
3.0,"These are attractive but kind of bothered my nose -- typically I find those with nosepads less comfortable than those with thick plastic frames (i.e. built-in noserest).<br /><br />But the surprising thing was the lenses degenerating over time, until the only part that wasn't cloudy was around the edges. None of my other glasses have done this. Reading reviews of other glasses in this brand, maybe it's possible I received a counterfeit model. I ordered from ""General Wholesale Warehouse""."
3.0,not high quality material
3.0,"Not very soft, a bit itchy. Not the best fit."
3.0,This is a cute Halloween tee.  The fabric is a little thin but I can layer the shirt with another light weight tee.
3.0,Just got them today and have not had a chance to use them.<br />Should be ok.
3.0,wasn't as wide and flowing as pictured
3.0,"As all Lego sets, expensive.  A big market for all Legos."
3.0,"Lovely pants, but sizing way off.  I'm a six, but couldn't even put these on."
3.0,"I'm 5'6"" and 158 lbs. Normally I wear a size 6-8 pants and an 8 dress because of my bust size (34D). I bought the Milumia  Vintage flowy dress in a Medium and it is loose and flowy and looks great....but THIS dress in a Medium was too snug. I gave it to my daughter who is 5'7"" and 145 lbs and it is flowy and elegant and she looks gorgeous in it. If you normally wear a Medium, get this in a Large and you won't be disappointed."
3.0,I mistakenly thought these compression tops had built-in bras I ordered an extra large because I am a D cup and I found that they were actually looser fitting than what I thought
3.0,I ordered an xs and it was way to big. But it’s really cute
3.0,"Super cute, material is pretty nice. But the sizing listed isn’t right.. I wear a size 18 and it was snug to close. I needed up giving it to a smaller size friend"
3.0,"I ordered these for my daughter to wear during a wedding. She said they were itchy and some of them had stitching that was messed up. After photos we traded them out. If you don’t have to wear them long, they should be fine."
3.0,I wasn't overly impressed with the quality of this wallet.  The color is nice but the wallet is quite bulky.  I've switched to a slimmer style of wallet but this did function as it's meant to.
3.0,It started to fall apart about a month of wear
3.0,I didnt care for the style. Im a guy and the shirt looked feminine to me.
3.0,"Before I ordered this watch, I had already bought a Pagani Design PD-1639 (Submariner homage) almost a year ago, and I absolutely love it. Since I had such a good experience, I did not hesitate to order this slightly more expensive Tudor homage here on Amazon. While I waited for it to arrive, I scoured the internet for reviews, and watched nearly every video on YouTube that related to this piece. Needless to say, I was very excited for it to arrive!<br /><br />When it did finally show up, I was initially blown away with how gorgeous it looked. The black dial and bezel mixed with the bronze/rose gold of the hands and hour markers is stunning, as is the waffle pattern dial. The lume is definitely much better than the PD-1639, and it was applied evenly among the hands and markers. The brushing and polishing on the case was executed perfectly; while many reviewers thought the brushing on the sides of the case was rough, I personally think it looks great. The box crystal is amazing, and looks like it belongs on a watch 5 times the price.<br /><br />I initially did not have any issues with the bracelet: everything looked great, and seemed to be a step up from the PD-1639. However, after a day or so of wearing it, I noticed that a few of the screws in the links were not flush, meaning they needed to be tightened. No problem, I thought: I simply got out my screwdriver and tightened them until they were snug. Except, now there was a problem. With EVERY link that I tightened, the links were now essentially stuck, that is, they did not move freely. If you gripped two links that were stuck and moved them with force, you could make them budge slightly, but I knew this wouldn't work for daily wear.<br /><br />At this point I was a bit worried, so I tried turning the screws just a tiny bit looser than fully tightened. This did negate the problem of the links being stuck, and they now moved freely. However, I was worried that wearing the watch with loose screws (even barely loose) might be a real problem down the road. After two more days of regular wearing, I took off my watch to examine the band: two separate screws were now loose to the point of sticking out of the link by over a millimeter.<br /><br />Since I had no real way to fix this problem, I took off the stock bracelet and put on a straight-end link Strapcode oyster bracelet that I had previously bought. It's a real shame, because I absolutely love the watch itself, but the bracelet was a huge disappointment. I believe that Pagani is simply trying to do too much for the price point: a 5 piece links, screw link bracelet might be asking too much for this price. If they switched to push pins, this problem would be fixed. Yes, push pins do not look as nice as screws, but if the screw construction is inferior, then something needs to be done. Thankfully, my watch has been saved by using a Strapcode bracelet, which looks just as good as the stock option.<br /><br />So would I recommend this watch? Well, if you have a back-up strap option, then yes. If not, you might want to consider one, or at least realize that the bracelet could be an issue. I personally was not willing to roll the dice and keep the original bracelet on, as I feared that over time it would fail, causing my watch to fall to the floor. Hopefully this bracelet was simply an anomaly; this might be the case, since no reviews I watched mentioned this problem. Overall this does seem a bit strange, considering my PD-1639 costs less, has screw links, and works perfectly fine. I suspect that that model was out for much longer though, allowing Pagani Design to work out any kinks or issues.<br /><br />As it is, I still think that the watch looks absolutely stunning. If you are a nato or leather fan, then this bracelet issue is really not a big deal. In the end, I would not discourage anyone from ordering this watch, I just wanted my experience to be noted in case anyone else comes across the same issue."
3.0,the suit seems a bit small on the top and large on the bottom
3.0,I bought the purple and it was flannel. It’s nice so I ordered a different color and it’s NOT flannel so I am<br />Returning it.
3.0,Very small. Reviews said runs small need to size up but actually need to go 2-3 sizes up. Material not as sturdy as picture
3.0,"This has nothing to do with the seller. This is the second time I have bought ghirardelli chocolate recently.  One was a dark chocolate square with a raspberry filling.  These rabbits had a caramel feeling.  The ones not filled are fine.  The ones with filling are all broken the chocolate is wonderful, just very messy."
3.0,Nice material but very long
3.0,"Assumed buying a bra size bathing suit it would fit. Wrong. Which was disappointing. However, I returned it for a refund and got two sizes up, shipped out right away. That one fit. The company and shipping acting quickly which I appreciate. The new ones overall fit is good. Full coverage for a full figured top which is hard to find. Seems very sturdy as well. Nice fabric. Reason for only 3 stars however is the straps. They are very narrow and for the size of TaTa's they are holding up they need to be wider so they don't dig in to the shoulder. It's better than the halter style that goes around the neck as in neck won't be sore but makes marks on the shoulders. This is nothing new and not exclusive to this company. But the straps are removable and it stays up without falling down which is impressive for a top. Can't wait to see how it withstands the pool chemicals this summer. For the price and the ease of Prime Shipping it will be worth it!!"
3.0,The printing on this shirt was awful. I would have returned if we werent attending a Bucks game the following day. When i took it out of the box all of the screen print was stuck itself and it is really thick plasticy feeling image. There is a permanent crease in the print despite multiple washings. Not the nice smooth finish I am used to seeing with NBA Tshirts
3.0,They're ok but they fit more like briefs than hipsters.
3.0,"The fabric is that type that does not like dry skin.  You know the kind I am sure.  The size is way off on the adults. I ordered a size up and the top still didn't fit properly.  Sleeves were loose and baggy but body area was not chubby girl friendly at all.  Keeping the bottoms, but top is worthless to me."
3.0,"These were a great pickup for summer when we were out and about and in need of a quick pair of shades, though they broke very easily.  You get what you pay for..."
3.0,They wore out really quickly after only a few months of light use.
3.0,"I put it right on and couldn't tie it up in the front which is the only reason I bought this. I measured the waist ties and they were not the 40 inches as advertised but 32"" and 33"". A few stitches from the top of the pocket were ripping through the main apron fabric and there was a small random hole as well. I didn't expect much, but I at least wanted what was advertised."
3.0,I bought this because I have some baby weight left but the length is so wrong. I have to tie it in the front.
3.0,Bottoms are seethrough
3.0,"The company promptly sent the wig so no gripes w/them. However, we can't get the wig to look like the photo in the description. It does not stand as tall, rather, it tends to be &#34;flatter&#34;/more parallel to the ground.  It looks just ok when wearing it so you may want to check out other options."
3.0,I picked this due to the extension- it billed as 9 inch with 2 inch extender- however it did not quite reach the 10 1/2 inches I needed
3.0,"Fit about 2 sizes to large- I almost always wear a medium, so that is what I ordered. I would say their medium is more like an XL.<br />Company sent me a small, but still quite large. Comfortable material though."
3.0,The style is cute but the material is so thin that you can see through it a bit. I will be returning it
3.0,"This is a nicely done coffin cape but as others have said it is way too short & does not reach your feet or ankles or come close.  I'm only 5'3 1/2"" & it's not the long cape as shown in the picture.  I'm ok with this as I have a fabulous black, beaded & sequined long dress to wear as The Queen of Halloween, along with a feathered collar & sparkly crown that I also purchased at Amazon & am well-pleased with those items.  Sooooo, my whole Halloween costume this year will be awesome, even if the cape isn't perfect!  Also, FYI...the hood of the cape is pretty 'limp' & doesn't really stand up around your head on its own, unless you have a huge wig or such.  I would still recommend this product because it is unique...the manufacturer just needs to make it long for future purchasers."
3.0,I wife ordered this and was not happy with the actual color. she was hoping it would be more beige but the color when you take it out the box looks more pink.  I'm not the best this color so I'm just taking her word for it and she made me return it.  I should have taken a picture before returning it but I was just trying to get it done.
3.0,LOOKS GREAT BUT I FIND IT HARD TO BREATH THROUGH A LITTLE THICK wish it was a little thiner but it is still better than the paper ones
3.0,I got this for my cousin for a birthday gift.  Love it but the straps start messing up after a short time
3.0,Great gauges looks awesome just they are to big I think they sent me a size bigger but idk cause the package doesn't say what size they are other then that they are great
3.0,"I bought this hat for my husband because he is old school, He love the style and the price, but the piece that hold the hat together in the back  fell off, i had to return it and get him another hat.  I hope this last him thought the summer."
3.0,Love the color. I'm a large but because of reviews I got a XL. Glad I did . Fits good but very loose around tummy/waist area.makes me look bigger than I am but it's still very cozy and cute. Material isn't really stretchy at all but like I said cozy and cute. Can't wait to wear it
3.0,"These are actually loose like a tee. I am 165#, 6ft tall and the medium was a bit looser than I expected. Item was exchanged for Hurley rash tee."
3.0,"The fabric is very thin, like a very thin tee shirt. The top part is fairly see through. The top was snug but the rest of the dress was very baggy and loose. The color was pretty.  It was comfortable but I returned it since I don't need any more hang around the house clothes!"
3.0,"These are rather cheaply made (as others have noted, the back is hollow) and therefore they are expensive. Trouble is, I'm not sure what alternatives are available as there didn't seem to be a lot of choice on Amazon. I ordered these, which are bright gold, and a duller version in the hope that one set might be better than another. I didn't realize that it's the same manufacturer so aside from finish and design it's the same set of buttons."
3.0,Buttons are only decorative. Not for my body type looks like potato sack
3.0,Within a year the leather split cracked and fell off. As well as the the spring wearing out.<br /><br />Great aesthetic and great functionality until the spring wore off which inevitably resulted in me losing my keys in a large park.
3.0,"Very cute overalls, but they were way too small for being a medium. I’m usually between a medium and small and these were very tight that I couldn’t button them."
3.0,"The sizes are exactly what your size is. The picture is not clear on what the dress is. It is ribbed it's like a over sized beater. Not saying it's not cute on it is but it stretches . Will not make you look skinny whatever your body looks like, you will look like in this dress. Thank goodness it's black if you get the other colors make sure your ok with your body type. I do like the dress but don't love it. I did receive this product at a discount or free. That does not affect my review"
3.0,It said in details that it had leather handles but they are not.  I don't like to purchase something when it is not as described.  Other than that it is ok for the money.
3.0,I am afraid to use it because it seems stretched out and worried the cards will fall out. I keep it in a larger wallet.<br />Changed my review because was too harsh. The product is pretty good quality and the pull tab hasn't been a problem.<br /><br />You can see the pull tab mechanism under the leather though which sort of looks ugly
3.0,"This watch is small and pretty. By cons, we see no great numbers, it requires special attention in order to see the time. The bracelet is made of a leather of not very high quality. By cons, it is original: snap and everything. Honestly, I never paid that shows $ 99.00 as indicated in your site. It is not worth the price I paid was $ 19.99. You decide whether it's worth buying."
3.0,"I love the design on the shirt but it runs slightly small for 2XL. If you are a male with broad shoulders and a huge chest you will need a 3XL to be comfortable, especially if you are planning to work out in it."
3.0,"The color is beautiful! I love how it looks on my skin tone. The chest part is a little big but then the tummy part is tight. I wear a 36dd for reference. Also, the back is weird. The panel should have a hook to make it stay up and then have the tie criss cross. I know i missed a hook for the tie but it was just weird. I didn't think it worked well and it should have just been a zipper or buttons or something. The bottom is a perfect length for heels. I am 5'0 and i know it will be a little long but i expected that. Overall, this dress has potential. I'll make it work but just wish the size was fluid throughout and not tight around the hips/tummy and not so big on top."
3.0,"These are a great size, but the stud is a little thick, so you may have to stretch you hole out a little."
3.0,"I wouldn't classify this as a &#34;high impact&#34; bra, especially for big busted women.  It's cute, and does the job for low impact sports, but is definitely not supportive enough for me to take a jog in."
3.0,I went by the chart but it was still short. Great looking belt too bad it did not fit
3.0,"Ok... this dress is nice. Material is nice, lace is better quality than i expected, but the cut is weird. It is more babydoll like than it appears in the pic. Like the lace ends right under your chest, not above the waist. It you are apple shaped, this may enhance the apple-ness of your body. I will say that I loved the quality of the lace. Has a nice stretch and will not rip easily."
3.0,"These come apart easily, but if you’re looking for something that won’t be worn frequently or you don’t mind reinforcing them with some stitching, they suit their purpose at a low price. My son loves these."
3.0,"I ordered the hot pink pair, very cheap looking, many of the sequins were twisted around and reflected a gold color. They're fine for Halloween or a costume party, but they certainly aren't bridesmaid or prom shoes."
3.0,"This fit perfect, I ordered xl , I’m happy"
3.0,Like the concept but the kids size is too small for a size 12 girls shoe
3.0,"it's pretty but doesnt fit very well, i might just give it to my friend who's smaller than me because i dont know if i'll ever wear it. if you have big thighs its a pain getting on, i had to pull it over my head but that was hard too since i have a big chest, I'm 5'8 and 160 pds and if you have a little pudge on your tummy it does make you look a bit big, same if you have a larger butt"
3.0,Nice but very long have to have them themed up
3.0,"The make is cheap, but it'll work."
3.0,had to return item my wife said too tight
3.0,It was a little snug. I’d next time purchase a size larger.
3.0,"Nice to package gifts that didn't come with a proper box.  Would have like it much more had there been a place to insert the chain so it wouldn't tangle. Placing the chain under the pendant doesn't stay well, and tucking it under the bottom pinches the chain and tangles in the box."
3.0,The earrings might work on your ears but thats about it. If you get them to close to each other the backs will magnetize together and the earring comes off.  The septum rings are too big to fit comfortably and the magnets are too weak to hold in place. Try to adjust it even slightly and they will come apart.  The earrings are cute and the packaging is nice but I would skip this one.
3.0,Shorts are a little short but overall a good fit
3.0,The material is very high quality but the fit is something else.  i am 5`6 and 130 lbs. I ordered a medium.. the pants are huge around the waist and even with the drawstring are hard to keep up.  The shirt on the otherhand is so tight around the the waist I can barely get it on.  so I can only describe as to small and to big at the same time.
3.0,Too wide at waist and too tight at chest.
3.0,Purchased a size large for my wife and it runs more like an XL. The fabric is very stretchy.
3.0,Don’t fit well
3.0,"Greetings: these are my favorite hats. I received the item in a timely manner. The brim of the hat is suitability wide to my taste and it fits well. My only complaint is that the brim seems uneven in it's circumference; other than that, it's a good hat for a man with a large head like mine.<br />I'd recommend it to those who have an ample head size."
3.0,very cute and girly
3.0,"The description was accurate however the photo makes the earring look like a lighter color of gold when it's actually much darker and more of a bronze color so the photos were a bit misleading and I returned the plugs. Other than color in the photo being much lighter than what I received, I liked everything else about the earrings"
3.0,Beautiful dress. The fit was a little too large than expected and the elastic waist made the dress pop out at the top unnecessarily.
3.0,"Just OK, very thin but nice enough for the price"
3.0,Not sized well. Also sizing chart totally off
3.0,I trait like the design on the shirt and the fabric was nice. I ordered my usual size which fit well but after washing it shrunk so much! It got very short and tight. I can no longer wear it. Mashed sure you order at least a size up but I would recommend 2 sizes bigger.
3.0,Poor results my gf and I are over
3.0,Cute dress. Fits well. Fabric is cheap - a bit thin and started to fade and get fuzzy after first wash.
3.0,Purchase up a cup size.
3.0,A little cheap looking but serves the purpose.
3.0,"Easy to drink from.  Eyeshield is awkward.  Can't see where I can remove film, so blurry."
3.0,"I'm a big woman with a big head.  This is so big that once you put it on, it covers your face and you can't see.  Great on the beach once you've sat down, but you can't see to get there."
3.0,"This skirt is okay for the price. The material is very soft, but also very thin. I am usually a size 12/14 in women's and ordered the XL. I probably could have ordered a Large, but wanted to make sure the skirt was not too short. At first the fit felt great, wasn't too tight or too loose. After wearing for a few hours, the top band became extremely baggy and loose, to the point where I really thought the skirt would fall down. I think I would rather pay a few more dollars in order to have a skirt band that holds up and provides a little bit of support.<br /><br />Overall, just okay."
3.0,Update: I ordered another color and after trying it on / before washing it it was falling apart. So far the other ones purchased seem ok...but still disappointed since I missed the return window by a couple days.<br /><br />Great support (although I have a smaller chest). I am a 34B and ordered a medium based off other reviews. It’s perfect. Used it for running recently and had zero issues.
3.0,"Cute jacket, a little thin and lightweight but great for one night and the price . Was what I expected from the photo."
3.0,This was a very inexpensive dress and it looks it.  Guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,I was not a a big of a fan whne I saw these in person if you like a lot of holes in your jeans I don’t recommend but they fit right
3.0,"Im 5'2 and 130 lbs, this fits too small."
3.0,Great vest. I love how I can havey badge displayed for work and I can have my marker and gloves in the pockets.<br />The reason I gave it 3 stars is because after one or 2 washes it's started falling a part. Not bad....but a bit.
3.0,nice but very low quality does not endurance there but loooks good but does not worth it so much its a shame
3.0,"My son is a size 6 with 6s usually being a little loose, so I got the size small 4-6, and it definitely leans more towards the size 4. It was much too short on the arms and only came down to his ankles. If you're between sizes, go up a size for sure. It's cute, but the material is thin."
3.0,It does it's job as a wallet. It's nice looking. I didn't notice any smell as others have said. Only drawbacks are as some have said it has a tendency to stay open when it's not in your pocket. Also it's much thicker than I thought it would be. I keep it in my front pocket.
3.0,Nice shirt but pretty thin. You have to wear an under shirt or you look naked and kind of creepy. If you wear an under shirt it looks kind of funny. Not sure I’d recommend but maybe good for a beach shirt or something where it’s ok to be showing some skin.
3.0,Not what I had hoped for. These are not oversized at all. Cute design well made not flimsy but not at all what I expected.
3.0,I really like the fit of the dress and the material of the dress but the skirt is pretty much entirely see through. Going to have to wear shorts or shape wear to not embarrass myself. 🤷🏻‍♀️
3.0,"Overall, I didn't really care for this dress. It doesn't look that bad, overall, but the ruffle on the front just didn't look right on me. I couldn't get it to lay right. The fabric is also rough and scratchy, so my sensitive skin isn't too fond of it. I'd say the sizing is pretty true to size. I normally wear a medium to large. This medium fits, but I think a large would have flowed better on my body shape. It also has adjustable straps, so altering can be done there."
3.0,The hat is fantastic but I can't understand why the seller uses European sizes in the US.
3.0,These socks to have great compression but im finding that the stitching at the ankles is wearing thin after only a few wears. I use them on the treadmill a couple times a week and the outside ankle (outside my sneaker and not in a spot where it rubs) is wearing thing. I have size 11 feet and these will pull all the way up to my knees.
3.0,This blouse run smaller than described in the sale. It is well made and the material looks nice.
3.0,For awkward. Like they’re designed for someone with no butt. I’m 135 5’1” and got Medium. They were tight in the rear
3.0,"I am torn between loving and hating this dress.<br />The fabric seemed to be a good quality, stretchy, soft material. I ordered a large size following their sizing chart (Large: Shoulder:15.4inch, Bust:39.4inch, Length:33.9inch). But the dress is a bit loose everywhere. I could have gotten a Medium size and it will still fit be comfortably due to the stretch on the fabric. The waistline is a bit high on me, I guess it's the style. It gives you an illusion of shorter torso and longer legs.<br />The main thing that bothered and irritated me is the embroidery. The embroidery detailing is nicely done but the inner thread used is quite stiff and rough on the skin. I wanted to keep the dress or order a size down, but I don't think I'll be comfortable. About 5 minutes of trying out the dress, I ended up with minor skin irritation on my arms and legs."
3.0,So light they're hard to wear when they get a little stretched out.
3.0,accessories not attached or loosely attached. belt hanging.
3.0,"i love these! but however.... the pic shows that all 3 rings come with a ball. when i received my package only 2 rings had balls. and the other ring had just one. and the package wasnt open yet so i know the other ball didnt fall out of package. i still love them , but the 3rd ring is useless to me"
3.0,"I liked the band, it was comfortable and fit well. Easy to close. The only problem is that the design wore off within 2 weeks. Would not recommend."
3.0,"Delivery was super fast!  But the earring just will not stay in my ear : (  I feel like my ears are an average size, but the earring is way too big and will not stay in place like it should."
3.0,Feels really soft and comfortable but not helpful if it's WAY too small to wear - and I sized up!
3.0,"Ok glasses. Really can't see as well as the expensive ones into the water, but they didn't cost what the expensive ones cost tho."
3.0,Hand wash and great fitting.
3.0,"I bought these shirts for my husband and he loves the fit and comfort of them, however both shirts had a tiny hole in them that we didn’t notice. Until my husband wore one of the shirts and I noticed a run on the back (kind of like a panty hose run) starting at a tiny hole. I then looked over the second shirt that he hadn’t worn and noticed a hole in it as well. I’m disappointed that I paid $20 for two shirts that won’t last very long. Not sure if I will order more."
3.0,"This bra is made of high quality fabric that has a very nice, supportive stretch.  It was quite tight on me, so order a size up.  It also gave me a uniboob, so if you don't like that this might not be the sports bra for you.  Also, the color is more of a peach color than orange (it's a peachy-orange color)."
3.0,Cheap material not what I wanted
3.0,Too low in back as compared to front so they will not stay flat.
3.0,Cute swimsuit for the tribal era and style. Quality is not the best. Bottoms fit nice where as the top not so much. I am 38DD so IF YOU ARE TOP HEAVY I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO LATE TO RETURN SO I WILL TRY AND MATCH WITH ANOTHER TOP!
3.0,"I didnt like how the shirt fit, fits like the back on both sides, no tags to determine whats the back or the front"
3.0,"I ordered several of these and they all shrank in the wash even though they are not cotton fabric. I noticed that each bra was larger or smaller than the others, even though they were supposedly the same size. There is only a sticker on the bra saying the size so who knows what happens. The foam cup inserts all were different sizes. I ordered an XL and the bra cups ranged from a M to an XXL. They are marked. I ended up not being able to wear these bras after several washes. I hung them up to dry. I wanted to love these."
3.0,"The description indicated &#34;Solid Lead-Free Pewter&#34;.  I expected it to be heavier.  I didn't care for the cord included.  After having been folded up for shipping, the pendant wasn't heavy enough to keep the cord taught, so it looked awkward.  This might have worked itself out over time, but I purchased this to wear to a specific event.  Disappointed."
3.0,A little stiff material for easy in n out of cellphone
3.0,"I purchased the Gold Stainless steel band, and while it is well made and really a nice band, it is extremely heavy. I am 6'3&#34; and 300 lbs and this was way too heavy even for me to wear on my wrist. I would have ended up with one Popeye arm and one regular arm. Like I said really nice but feels like a lead weight on your arm. The actual weight of this monster is mentioned in the description....so BEWARE!!! Returned for refund."
3.0,Order a way bigger size than you really are because I ordered a size up and it’s still extremely small
3.0,I bought these for my teenage boys and they were too big. My wife tried it on and it was too big also.
3.0,Slight scratch on lens. Otherwise OK.
3.0,"I really like these tank tops. Stretchy, good quality. Only giving three stars for the color the picture shows gray and gray/white and the description says blue/gray. The tanks I got are one blue and the other lighter blue stripes with darker blue stripes. I like to know exactly what I'm ordering. Not worth sending back but I already had these colors."
3.0,Cute shirt but sizing is not accurate.  10/12 fit more like an 8/10.
3.0,"Bought this in X-Large I normally wear this size but I would reccomend 2 sizes down for the desired look , it's a big fit"
3.0,Looked ok
3.0,Looks good but it's quite big for a small frame person..my issue is that for the price the stones just started falling off as I took it out of the box.. I mean like paper
3.0,"I wanted to like these, but sadly I found them very difficult to use with my Fossil Gen 6. Putting the band on the watch was fine, however wearing it on my wrist was painful. Not only does it have hard edges that pinched my skin, but I found the adjustment mechanism very difficult to use. I'm giving it 3 stars because it does add some class to the look over the included silicon band, which is I think the primary reason someone would want this, but I think I'd prefer my original band."
3.0,"Love how light wiehgt it is, but it only lasted for three trips."
3.0,Not for wide feet. Walking is awkward.
3.0,"This necklace is beautiful, except that the chain is weak and it already broke.  :("
3.0,"I love Patricia Nash's bags..this one is very stiff and small inside, unlike most her others. So, a little disapointed. I kept it because i love the design and the way it hangs on my shoulder."
3.0,"Nice material, feels soft but runs extremely small and barely stretchy.<br />I wear a 14 and the original size didn’t fit, ordered a size up (16-18) and that didn’t fit either, not even close. Unless I got a mislabeled product, I recommend a very detailed sizing chart please!"
3.0,material is kind of thin & fit loose & way too long. I'm 5'5&#34; & would need to take 2 inches at least off the hem.
3.0,"There was a slight improvement, but my glasses do fog still."
3.0,It's ok...but the strap is short and flimsy. The quality of the purse isn't the best but I guess it will work for storing my phone and lipstick.
3.0,"I really wanted to love these slippers. Nice packaging, each shoe in a bag to not be scuffed and held secure and in shape.<br />Attention to detail is apparent as well as the inside was soft on first impression.  Outer shell seems a little stuff but hopefully they wear in better. Very warm. Fit is ok but not as comfortable initially as my LL Bean slippers that these are replacing. The bottoms are heavy duty and feel like an outdoor shoe bottom.  I have tried to wear these for several days, and the stuff back digs into my ankle and I can not sale at them for more than a few minutes before it is unbearable. I even tried to wear socks with them but it didn’t help. Overall not happy and want a softer slipper heel."
3.0,"The fabric and color are lovely, it fits fine at the waist and hips, but the bust is huge."
3.0,"I am so disappointed as i received a damaged top. It was already torn from sides. However, i have given 3 stars here because i really liked the material (breathable, very good for summers), color (same as shown) and style of this top. I am 171 lb, 5'3'', carry most of my weight in arms and stomach, and mostly wear L in tops. Although i was not able to try this top, i could figure out that even XL was a little small to me. So, i recommend going up two sizes for a good fit."
3.0,"i wish it fit a little more true to size. if you want a baggy fit, go up a size"
3.0,Cheap quality. Looked used.
3.0,It fits smaller than expected.  Order a size up
3.0,It is fine I just wish the back flap was as long as the front.. But it is very confertable.
3.0,"These are nice looking charms and bling to add to your crocs to bedazzled them. I get lots of compliments on mine. However, I’ve noticed that the glue they use to glue the charm to the fasteners is not very good. Many charms have popped off and I’ve had to re-glue them again.  They could up their quality to make them more durable."
3.0,they will not stay on my face the sides is to long
3.0,"So these shoes are supposed to be kid’s size 13’s, which is the size that fits my son. These are NOT size 13’s. They’re actually Youth size 4’s. That’s 4 sizes too large! The label on the tongue claims that these are US 13’s but they clearly are not. See the pictures for comparisons to the correct sizes.<br /><br />In terms of running shoes, these are fairly nice. They have soft cloth uppers, memory foam in-soles and EVA soles. As such, they’re really light. They have faux elastic laces and a velcro strap. They have a nice look to them. The build seems solid. The sole seems pretty secure to the upper so I don’t think it’s likely they’ll give way in use.<br /><br />I especially like the memory foam insoles. Were my son able to wear them, he’d probably find them comfortable.<br /><br />Overall a good shoe. Only problem is, like I said, they’re 4 sizes too big. I’ve got a pair of shoes for my son that probably won’t fit him for a year and a half or more."
3.0,good for protecting your phone. It's made of cheap plastic that is strong enough to work as a case.
3.0,"Material is soft but unfortunately I had to return it. The pockets are “thick” which on my body type just wasn’t flattering. Also, I have larger boobs so with the elastic band it just didn’t look right in my opinion."
3.0,"Like the look, but the pockets don't open very wide. A little difficult to get things in and out. But I guess so many pockets is also a plus to help organize things. It's a give and take."
3.0,"The leggings seem to be a good quality for the price, but they do run on the small side of whatever size you usually buy"
3.0,Good quality<br /><br />Price is too high
3.0,Its a nice color but the stitch is open therefore it isnt a real warm sweater.
3.0,"I bought these gloves because I suffer from a chronic pain syndrome (RSD) which makes me hypersensitive to touch at times. They are absolutely wonderful, I can do everything I need with these on. I also have a very small hand (size 4 ring) and these fit perfectly. Finally! A wonderful combination of soft organic cotton with enough stretch to fit my small hand without slipping off (and enough stretch for larger hands also). I have also started using them with lotion at night occasionally and my hands are smooth as a baby.<br /><br />*****UPDATE***** After wearing these gloves for less than a month, (frequently but not 24/7) and hand washing and air drying them with every wash, Holes have appeared in 2 of the fingers of the right hand glove. UGH! I thought I found a miracle, now I have to keep looking. Downgraded from 5 star to 3 star. I realize gloves like this won't last forever but you should get more than a month out of them! I guess they would be good as an occasional glove liner or as occasional moisture gloves as they are comfy and fit well, but not for regular use. This stinks, what a disappointment! I thought these were my answer, and was going to order a few more pair- but not now..."
3.0,"This was partially my fault as I took the chance-- but this product listed no size. But I really liked the look and price so purchased hoping Large or above. Unfortunately, it's a medium and too small. Again, partially my fault but you should probably communicate the size of your clothing. May be a good idea. Otherwise, this is honestly a really cool top that I would love if proper size provided"
3.0,"A little disappointed in the quality, but my fiance still loved it."
3.0,I like the colors.  The fit runs too small.
3.0,"I was very excited to get this watch.  It has many features including barometer, thermometer, altimeter (based on barometer) and electronic compass along with typical features found in digital watches.  It is solar powered too!<br />My first concern before getting this watch was the size.  I thought it might be too big for my wrist.  It isn't.  It is a big watch, but it looks great.<br />What I don't like about it, is that the watch face is just glass and scratches fairly easily.<br />I bought this watch to use out doors while hiking, camping and climbing mountains; I didn't want to worry about it getting scratched --it's not exactly cheap!  (Yes, mine already has a scratch from my dog.)"
3.0,It’s okay. I don’t hate it. It’s made to fit funny and definitely order a size up.
3.0,"Since our middle school only allows drawstring bags, we've been in the search for the perfect bag. This bag is a good contender and has most of the features we were looking for, but my kid is really rough and I just wasn't sure if this bag would hold up to that. If this bag were for my youngest kid it would have been perfect."
3.0,"Love the colors and the feel of material; however, I've worn two of the six and they both have had splits to come up in the crotch area before my work day was over. Since I wear longer tops, I'm still hoping to get a little wear out of them before I have to throw them away. I'm short so these also are a little long in length."
3.0,It was cute but now was torn off and the zip got spoiled which is I was unhappy about that need to make properly
3.0,"A bit large,  however, the bands adjusted to make it fit much better."
3.0,Pretty wide. Great lenses.
3.0,"The shape is very cute, but these are made out of *very* light weight plastic and feel very cheap."
3.0,It’s pretty but it was broken when I took it out of the package.
3.0,"Took a long time to drive, but product is acceptable"
3.0,These pants are a slick fabric and may be breezy in warm weather. I found them to run big. I’m 5’3” and 130lbs and ordered a M. Lots of fabric around calf and they are slipping down a bit. Too much volume around crouch for me to rate a 5 but they are comfortable. I will keep them for spring and fall jogs - hoping they are cool enough for summer because actual shorts just ride up when I walk or jog.
3.0,I think it’s too thin of material to be a jacket.
3.0,"I really like it, honestly. I like the fabric, I like the design however I have the same one but short sleeved and I bought it medium but it was too big and this one I bought it small and is somewhat tiny."
3.0,They were ok not the best but great for the price.
3.0,Color not as vibrant in person
3.0,too small for me.  i'm very curvy and got the largest size.
3.0,Cute shoes. Beware that the rubber outsoles are slippery on wet surfaces. And unfortunately the plastic edge of the velcro on the ankle straps cut both of my ankles. Had to wear band-aids and then had to trim the velcro edge. Run a tad large.
3.0,It is just a tad to small. I wish it was bigger. I use it for kickboxing and I put my gloves in the bottom where the shoe compartment is. It is stretched to the max!
3.0,"Way smaller than I imagined. I should’ve gotten a ruler out for sure. To me, a “tote” states “large”. This item was not at all. Everything else was good. Material looked durable and nice."
3.0,"I've ordered these shades in the past and this batch was a lesser quality, lighter and generally flimsier than the previous ones. For the price it's hard to complain (hence the 3 stars) but there was definitely a drop in quality."
3.0,"Negative display very difficult to read without using light function. Strap is about 1/4 or 1/2 inch too short for my large wrist. App and Bluetooth pairing took a few minutes to understand, but works fine once understood. As always, it's very rugged and offers high value for price paid.<br /><br />Update: I returned the watch. Display is too feeble to be useful. Too hard to read.<br /><br />Note: I bought mine through the Casio factory website, not Amazon. Some of the third party sellers on Amazon are not Casio-authorized sellers, so the factory warranty would be void. Something to consider."
3.0,It is a great Santa hat with flashing lights but is not made for adults. Great for little kids .
3.0,Very cute. 3T fit my chunky 2 year old. The black leggings faded quite a bit in the first wash.
3.0,Wrong design selected and we get better bifold card holders with much comfort.
3.0,The sticky part of the item that's supposed to attach to the stand isn't strong enough to hold the mount up.  I'll have to find some double back tape.
3.0,"I bought this to go with a halloween costume and its pretty cute for an event type of wear, but not something I'd wear every day. It fits pretty snug so I would order a size up. The fabric is NOT stretchy (which is why I personally recommend a size up) so this isn't a top I'd recommend to my friends with with a D cup or larger, so just keep that in mind when buying! It does have adjustable straps as well which is a nice bonus.  Overall 5/10 for me."
3.0,Doesn't really look like the picture and it runs a little small. The material is costume material just doubled up so it's not very warm. My little sister likes it though.
3.0,This suit is cute but a little too tight fitting in the thigh area and the back doesn't lay nice it bubbles because i do have a shorter torso and the material has no where to go. consider your options before purchase.
3.0,Fits large. I am 12/14 and went by the recommended fit of a Large. I would recommended going one size down. The material is very stretchy.<br />These pants slip fall down when I exercise.
3.0,They are okay to wear as cycle underwear’s. But the view of the pictures was Very misleading on the pictures how the panties would look . Was very disappointed . I hope in the future amazon recognizes the pictures are not  the same style and colors and does something about. I will be going in the stores next time at least inside the store they are NOT deceptive as online is.
3.0,Quite big. Nice material though.
3.0,"The shoes are super comfortable! My only issue is that I put them in the wash for the first time on a gentle cycle, and one of the shoes came completely apart."
3.0,"It's soft and light, easy to sleep in, this is the most the buttons don't stay buttoned. though & that's a problem. It makes it impossible to wear if others' are around. I bought it for an anticipated stint in post-surgery care when I will be seeing family and friends. I would return if I had the time and energy."
3.0,Liked color and idea but shoulders more like a man's t shirt. And shoulder seams stick out.
3.0,Not really gold. More like a faded gold. Looks like the photo so I guess I got what I paid for. Just wish it was GOLD GOLD
3.0,They are cheap and pop off the bar but for the price it's okay
3.0,"Pants are cute, soft and fits well. The drawstrings though are really cheap and shredded at the ends. The only thing that makes the pants look cheap."
3.0,"Love the style, but rubbed against my toe which made wearing them uncomfortable."
3.0,Kind of hard to clip on and they hurt a bit as one end it a bit too sharp.
3.0,"Very spacious. Fabric is sturdy but the zippers on the side fell apart on me after a month of use. To be fair, I had it pretty packed."
3.0,"I like the idea of it, and it works pretty well in practice.  The problem with this product is its weight.  It is way too heavy.  Sound ridiculous, I know, but it added significant weight to my backpack.  I pulled it out of my bag and now keep it in my desk."
3.0,My niece loved it but when she put it on it was way to snug .... Not true to size
3.0,"It is a shame about this hat, it says 1 size fits all, but unless you are a south american pygmy, it aint gonna fit.  Another reviewer wrote that it felt like a tourniquet on thier head, and that is pretty close.<br /><br />I like tighter fitting beanies as I hate the floppy  victorian sleeping cap look that some have, but this was like wear a Jewish yamaka/kippah.  Ok maybe not quite THAT small, but its a good reference.<br /><br />If you have a smaller head the color selection is great and they all look awsome.  So if you can get your melon in this, good for you you'll love it, but if you have a normal size head, not so much, unless you like your brains getting squished out your ears.<br /><br />So 5 stars for color, 1 star for fit.<br /><br />Also to note, the fleece liner is not a total liner, its a headband type (also another thing I was not expecting.)"
3.0,Light and comfortable but the red is a pinkish salmon color.  Returning it.
3.0,The design is super cute and my son wore the shirt but that is gigantic- and he’s in the 97th percentile for head circumference!
3.0,"The good isn't the same as in the photo, BUT, it is very comfortable. I ordered a size large in case it ran small, but I'd suggest sticking to your usual size for this product since it is a looser cut."
3.0,This 3 piece lounge set ran a little small in my opinion. I returned the item.
3.0,This product is Chinese size. I had order two sizes up.
3.0,"I'll start by saying I love this style shoe from Pinup Couture, I have 3 pair now and plan on collecting most colors. These fit fairly true to size, whereas the patent leather heels run about a size small. My only disappointment is the finish scraped very easily. They are comfortable, easy to walk in and just cute as a button."
3.0,They are a bit snug but will wear them. Love the different colors
3.0,"The thing that I don’t like is that the lining stops before the bottom of the coat and makes it look cheap, I kept the coat because I love the high/low look and think I can get it fixed. I just would have rather paid more for a fully lined coat then having to get it altered because the design is very beautiful."
3.0,They are very tiny.  Wish they were larger.
3.0,"Pretty, but WAY small. I'm an 8 and ordered an XL that was still too small."
3.0,I wasn't sure I would like this necklace when I ordered it and I should have listening to myself.  It looks very cheap and flimsy.  The colors are nice but the silver looks very cheap.  I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,Cute but instantly turned finger green so had to put clear finger nail polish to coat the inside.
3.0,"Doesn't look like picture. Top ball is huge and bulty, it's not elegant looking at all."
3.0,"These must be for road shoes, barely got them over my mountain bike shoes, thought I was going to damage them. but once i got them on they worked great."
3.0,"I love this dress! I am 7 months pregnant and I like to buy clothing that I will be able to wear post pregnancy as well. The ONLY thingbi didn't like about this dress is how thin it was. I purchased a small in black. I'm also 4 ft 11 and it was a bit long. (I'm used to that though. Part and parcel to being short) I've worn it to work with black wedges and it was adorable however I did need to pair it with a long duster. I also wore a slip underneath as I felt you could see the colour of my bra through the dress. This will be great at home while recovering after the birth and for little outings here and there. I can wear it with a long cardi, converse shoes, or sandals and it will look great! Happy shopping everyone!"
3.0,I have learned that ordering from China ORDER LAAARGE!  I think I ordered a XXL or and XXXL and I wear a 12/14.  The problem was NO DARTS and it hung oddly with large arm holes.  Corrected by local seamstress BUT I spent more on alterations than I did on the dress...Grrrrrr.
3.0,This is okay to wear but it doesn’t fit like the trendy loose tees (neck line is tight) and it’s also light hPink not rose pink as shown  in the picture . I thought I was getting something to style with a Belt and maybe a Jean or leather jacket but instead i got a workout and sleep tee
3.0,Pretty but little small..
3.0,sleeves bit long tight at chest
3.0,"Comfy and pretty. I had a dble mastectomy with reconstruction and although the plus size fits me around, it does not cover my breasts fully. Might have to wait to wear until healing is complete. I am only a C so bummed that the bigger size didn't fit. Very pretty tho."
3.0,I was sad to see the color fades after one wash on delicate cold.  The black was evidently lighter and I'm not a huge fan of the material blend.  It is nice and airy at least for summer.
3.0,It's cute bottoms way too big. Top had no support but it's cute.  Its not terrible
3.0,I did like it but it broke
3.0,Gave them to the neighbor.
3.0,"Sizing is perfect, but it's not very restrictive. I'm still the same shape while wearing it."
3.0,Just got it after 2 months but because of COVID...... It seem strong durable and can't wait to try it out.
3.0,"Bought this in January for birthday present. Used it first time this past week for vacation. Love the way the 3 stow inside together, minimizing storage space, but....when we arrived  at our destination, the zipper had separated from the fabric that seals off one half of the suitcase. Have no idea how to fix/replace/return because guarantee doesn't have a dealer code or date stamped on it. Hard to believe this happened on first use. Anyone have any suggestions? The product is no longer featured on the Titan web site. I should also note this happened with the Large suitcase; did not have any issues with the Small. Hopefully the vendor can contact me and make it right. I have purchase 3 sets of this luggage already this year, but this is the only problem so far."
3.0,"I am actually satisfied with my purchase. I bought this for an event and did not want to spend too much and this is perfect. However this is a one size fits all and the reason why I am satisfied is because it fits me. I really would not recommend to those bigger than a size M. The material and sewing on the outfits are a little cheap and off but that is what is expected for such a cheap price. I was not too surprised, as long as it fits and looks good that is good with me. It is a little bit see though so if you are okay with that then perfect but if not you might need to find something to wear underneath.<br /><br />If you are looking for a higher quality outfit, I suggest you look somewhere else. This is a basic cheap outfit for those who do not want to spend too much. Great to wear a few times. Received item at a discount"
3.0,Good so far. a little loose . I'd go half a size smaller in US wore em once to go shooting .
3.0,One of the earrings was broken but luckily I had some parts to fix it.
3.0,Not waterproof without additional treatment
3.0,Looks real and feels real but is starting to fade after a couple weeks and not being worn everyday
3.0,"Would've given it 5 stars if it was the 40 1/4&#34; shown in product image size chart for size M. It measures 38&#34;. I am tall and need those extra 2 1/4&#34; in length to come to my knees. It's too bad, I liked the style and the fit was good, just too short so I have to send it back."
3.0,Not worth it for me.  I question if this is sterling silver.  I wanted just simple earrings but they look unfinished and too much like craft earrings.  If I wanted craft earrings I could have gotten a big bag of them for $5.
3.0,Feedback from my wife (who this was for) - Really nice Fitbit accessory - only negative is that would prefer more padding around the shoulders of Fitbit compartment so it sits better on her wrist
3.0,Thin material and not the real NBA Youngboy brand
3.0,Seems to be sixpenny.
3.0,The fabric and coor
3.0,"Very cute necklace, but made my best friend and I both break out. Says pewter, not sure how pure."
3.0,"This is very cheaply made.  It mostly looks like the photo, and if you're only showing off the back, it'll probably do, but I wouldn't buy it again."
3.0,Nice color very nice but I had to file one side because was just a little bit too wide but other than that I love it
3.0,"The earring are unexpectedly heavy.  Otherwise, it's as described and decent quality."
3.0,"Fit:<br />This bra fit as expected.  Ordered the 36F and felt true to size.<br /><br />Fabric/Materials:<br />The fabric does hold up after washing, and the same goes with the hooks on the back.  The material is not soft, and does not soften with washing. The material just seemed very stiff, which helped keep the cup shape. Fabric is why I probably wouldn't buy again since its uncomfortable.  The top &#34;sling&#34; portion of the bra was awkward, it often came very high up above the fold-down cup requiring a very high necked shirt otherwise it would show.<br /><br />Clasp:<br />This bra did have easy, one-handed clasps to use for breastfeeding. These did unclasp on their own occasionally, but not enough to make this a real issue and the easy to unclip outweighed its occasional malfunction.<br /><br />***Thank you for reading my review.

3.0,There was a flaw in the seam of the legging and the mesh.
3.0,"Fits nice, a bit pricey for a mask"
3.0,Kinda blah. Fits like balloon. It’s my lounge at home shirt now.
3.0,This is a nice shirt. it's a little to $$$$$$$ for what it is but nice.
3.0,"Keeps great time, my only problem is the watchband is too stiff."
3.0,"Thinner and smaller than I expected..ordered up, but still slightly small"
3.0,Ok for the price but very flimsy . They look good but be carful with them they are easy to bend .
3.0,I took it on a vacay its comfy for sure but rides up as you walk. I wear it at home now as pjs. Started pilling after few washes
3.0,Beautiful hat. Runs a tad small.
3.0,"These are ok, and very cheap, but after also purchasing the DoubleTake Compact Folding Reading Glasses, these just are &#34;old school&#34; and don't come close.<br /><br />The case is too wide and big to comfortably fit in a pocket, and not as protective as I'd hoped.<br /><br />So if you want to go cheap, get these, but for a few more bucks, the DoubleTake ones are much better."
3.0,"Go up 2 size maybe 3...<br /><br />Super soft, color is cute.."
3.0,"My only real gripe is that the interior pocket is fully open, which allows things to move around more than they should."
3.0,Looks same as the picture provided..Fits well...<br />Figure hugging dress.Material is thin.Lingerie line can be seen.
3.0,it fits and its thin good for summer
3.0,"These are not for everyday use. I bought a heavy duty keychain for my kids backpacks, but these work fine for day trips to crowded places. The air tag can easily pop out from the rubber if your child plays too hard."
3.0,If you’re buying this to use the bracelet for a Kid it’s not your best option. Bracelet keep coming off while my kid is playing outside or doing any physical activities. The other piece included it’s good for dogs collars.
3.0,Fit my lo great but poor quality. A couple pairs are unraveling and the gray pair has holes in it after a couple of wears. She is tiny and doesn't crawl yet...she only army slides with her arms so she is not rough on them. Disappointed with the quality.
3.0,This shirt is supposed to be COTTON as described - but it has NO cotton - it is 95% polyester and 5% lycra.  Very disappointing when I searched for a cotton shirt.
3.0,I got the XL swimsuit I'm 5'4 and weight about 195 and this fit great from the bottom the top was a little too big for my small boobies. It would be great if you could choose the size for the top and bottoms but overall it's a nice swimsuit.
3.0,I love this style but not the small size. I ended up returning these for a larger size.
3.0,"useful for swimming at the pool in winter, not nearly as cute as the photo."
3.0,It's a nice bodysuit unfortunately for me it was way to big I'm 5'4  34D and 125 lb I ordered a small size and it was huge i was so sad because it is a really nice piece of clothing but size is off
3.0,"Good for a teenager.  Not fitting for a mature woman. Material was substantial,  item was well made, just extremely short."
3.0,"This sweater is absolutely not a one size fits all, I would say it's a small/medium, with 3/4 length sleeves.  I usually wear a medium and the sweater fits me well in the torso, but I will be looking for a full length sleeve red sweater now, as the sleeves are really short.  The material is also pretty scratchy.  It's a solid mediocre sweater."
3.0,Even with the ties at the ankles they still are bit long. For reference I am 5'2 and inside of the pant touches my ankle.  The fabric is nice with a linen look.
3.0,Runs small and tight. Very itchy.<br />Color and look we're great but had to return
3.0,My biggest issue with this was that it rolls up almost instantly and if you try to sit down at all.
3.0,I wish they were a little thicker material. Fit well.
3.0,Fits great but the res fabric is thin so you can kind of see the filling inside the lin I got. I only wanted it for a one night color match party. My kid does not care. Okay quality for general wear.
3.0,"I like it and all but the pictures don't do the justice. The cloth is a bit shiny-er than expected.<br />Other than that, just a few loose plastic strands next to the zipper. Was somewhat thin and not greatly effective as protection from the wind."
3.0,"The color was disappointing: it's not a true red as pictured, but a rose-red. Won't do for what I have in mind. But it seems like a nice stretch bracelet for women. Note, NOT for men. I've never met a guy with wrists as small as mine, and it's just the right size for me."
3.0,"I enjoy the sterling silver necklace this pendant came on, however the pendant is not shiny and looks worn. It is hard to believe the charm is actually sterling silver."
3.0,Cool but ran small
3.0,Arrived 2 days early but the wood cracked n warped because it does not properly fit. Manufacturing defect that nobody checked before shipping.
3.0,"It's more of a raincoat and it doesn't breathe at all.  It makes me sweat really bad.  It seems well made and I really liked a lot of features, but only get it for walking.  Cycling or running will make you sweat. So much potential, but just not meant for more intense physical activity."
3.0,"Just have not worn yet.  Pretty, but a little full.  Still like to top, but don't know how I like it or not/"
3.0,Got these for me and my mother i really liked them but after a few days i got a rash from it
3.0,"The downfall of this top is that it does not fit as pictured. The picture lends you to believe that the straps are tighter than they are. On my arms the little straps are so loose it loose really sloppy. I have figured it will be a nice lounge top for around the house. I have also thought about somehow making the straps a little shorter to fit better, maybe by tying them into bows. Other than that the fabric is also on the thin side and a tiny bit see through in places, especially if you didn't wear a black undergarment. It's just an all around oddly made top, that I really wish looked and fit that the one in the photo.<br /><br />Please Note: I received this item at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest opinion.

3.0,"These look cheap, but are a nice color."
3.0,Too small. Not roomy. Otherwise nice color and sweater and will  re gift . Sizing not accurate.
3.0,"I must not have read description well.  They look cheap but they do the trick.  If I’m not going out, they work just fine."
3.0,"cute hat, but not exactly what  I was looking for..  although, I will still wear it!"
3.0,"money holder area is to small , would not buy again or recommend ."
3.0,"Comfortable! Nice graphics, but check carefully for damage."
3.0,"I was excited to get this top, but ended up disappointed, it’s very small and tight, not what I expected. I think a larger size would do better but didn’t like it enough to even try another size. Returned it."
3.0,Not as large as I thought but lovely
3.0,the bottom kept rolling up which made it uncomfortable
3.0,"I liked the mask material and fit was good, unfortunately if you are not accustomed to having your face covered for long periods of time it can be a bit uncomfortable, I ended up wearing this under a mask and cut out the eye and nose area."
3.0,"For a cheap hat, the quality is not bad -- perfect for costumes.  Unfortunately, the hat was much too small to fit on a man's head. I'm a small woman and it fit on my head snugly, but I bought it for my boyfriend's Halloween costume and it didn't fit at all.  We had to return it."
3.0,It was a little small for an XL and I thought the sweatshirt material was too thin.
3.0,This came quickly great buy!
3.0,A little too flimsy . Not what I expected
3.0,"The product is nice and exactly what I was expecting. The only disappointment is the color choices. The description I ordered was a 6 pack navy, gray, white and 3 other colors,  I received red, royal blue, 2 brown and 2 khaki. I know it is random, but getting the colors in the description and not doubled colors would have been nice."
3.0,Not the size advertised
3.0,"I honestly loved the fit soooo much, it fit like a glove but after one wear, it started peeling so I have to return. It did the duties of a one time wear and having pockets was so clutch, but if you are looking to wear more than once you might want to go for something with better quality. Also the wig was actually horrendous but luckily I bought a different one to go with the costume. Could’ve been like $20 given quality and I probably wouldn’t have bothered to return."
3.0,"Fabric and patterns decent. Returned because daughter thought they were too tight in rear area. Bought a size 10. Daughter 7 years old, petite frame and average height."
3.0,"I ordered an XL and the strings are extra long, but the apron itself is super small. Good quality print and silky material, decent quality. I bought it for my boyfriend but he won’t wear it because it’s so small."
3.0,KINDA CHEAP LOOKING
3.0,The quality of the cap is very good....The image of USS Midway shown sailing to the rear was a disappointment to me...I believe it should be moving forward........
3.0,"Cute headband, but way thicker than i thought it would be."
3.0,"Good quality and arrived on time, my criticism is that they would have been better angled a bit out from the head.  The way they are gets uncomfortable after a while."
3.0,Just okay.  There are few options in white so I kept it
3.0,"So I like these shorts because they keep my thighs from rubbing. I was blessed and cursed with a small upper portioned body and a thicker lower half so the medium fits my waist, but definitely is not baggy around my thighs like they show in the picture. I am 5’3” and 130 pounds so hopefully this information helps. If you want a baggy fit, I would size up."
3.0,"Adorable bags, but not as sturdy as other brands I've purchased in the past - the plastic mesh easily stretches which makes me a little hesitant to use them as I'd like to. After a few light uses they're losing their shape. Wouldn't purchase again, but I do love the colors and patterns."
3.0,"Loved the pattern on this purse.  But the shorter handles on the purse have already ripped off.  I really liked it, just wish that for the price it had held up better and longer."
3.0,"Cute dress, but the belt was missing in the package. Without the belt, it looks like a garbage bag."
3.0,"I honestly didn't like the way it fit me. I want to clarify it's not the pants' fault, given that they are a ""men's cut"" and I am a woman. But in the picture, the pants look like they are close to the leg of the model, however, when I put it on me, the legs were HUGE... That's the problem... Given my personal shape, I needed a big waist, but smaller legs cut, and this was just very tight on the waist and huge on the legs... Probably some people with a taller and slender body will have a better time with it. I ended up returning it."
3.0,Material is thin and not very wide.
3.0,"even tho the dress didn't fit, it was a nice quality dress, its a bit darker in person then the picture."
3.0,Not really what I expected. Make me look fat.
3.0,Earrings are very pretty but very big and long.
3.0,Very nicely done. But read the size this is smaller then the picture used to show it.
3.0,They are very cute but at least half of them can't be separated to be able to pin them on my husband's suits.
3.0,"The product is as pictured, except the color. I ordered the powder blue one, I received a sky blue colored one, which is not what I was looking for and not what I thought I ordered. It is cute, but frustrating as heck when you order a specific color (based on description picture) and get a completely different color."
3.0,I love it but it is way too long!
3.0,The medallion itself is great but the chain has broken repeatedly.
3.0,"CONS: Loose, feels like it will stretch over time, rides high, the thigh part is shorter than as advertised so it stops high thigh near the groin rather than mid-thigh.<br />PROS: it's bamboo and feels great. the red color is fantastic.<br /><br />If I could do it again, i'd:<br />1. order a 'Large' cuz the XL is too big<br />2. find a version with longer thighs<br /><br />I'll update once a few washes are under me and tell you if the color leaks, shrink or expandage, and waistband elasticity."
3.0,"Look nice, seems to be good material. Unfortunately way too small."
3.0,A little bigger/longer than I wanted but works
3.0,I normally wear a xl t-shirt so order a xl boy was I wrong fit like a medium go too sizes up if u buying this product.
3.0,Loved this purse. However zipper broke the first time I used
3.0,"They are adorable , but are stiff ! The paint on the toes of shoes are already worn , for just one day of wear ! That is okay , because the price was low and they are casual shoes !"
3.0,"too large, and I do not recommend it for pet owners at all."
3.0,"Maybe I am not as fat as I expected.  This thing fits me like a moo moo.  It hits the top of my thighs and is extremely baggy.  I made the judgement call to get a 2x based off of other posts, but I think a Large would have suit me just fine.  That's how big this top is.  I would love to return it, but the shipping was so ridiculous that I'd end up paying the cost of the shirt twice.<br /><br />BTW--the necklace that came with it is cheap and gimmicky.  It's not something I would ever wear, but if I had a kid, then maybe she'd love it.<br /><br />Other than it not fitting 'me' it's an adorable design and the red is bold and beautiful.  The material is thin, but not too thin that you would need to wear a tank underneath to cover your bra."
3.0,Small elastic sewn at the top of the band is tight and leaves a mark on my skin. I purchased a size up hoping to avoid a tight fit.  Otherwise they are nice.
3.0,"Ordered the band , got it and installed it with out problem<br />It is a single band that does not allow for easy slipping around my hand. When closed the band comes up short.<br />May be nice for a woman’s wrist but men will need a longer band. Length of band is not provided in listing."
3.0,This product is a little smaller than expected. I bought a xl but it fits more like a large .
3.0,"These are very big, so if you have a small face, you might want to go with another frame."
3.0,Super cute idea but not great quality appliqué
3.0,"The blue set was size 5/6, it was supposed to be size 7.  The white set is a 7 and fits great."
3.0,Very thin. Hard to believe price.
3.0,Cute for the money but took 2 months to get here
3.0,"Very poorly cut.  However, have been contacted by the seller to attempt to remedy the situation.  Hopeful it works out!"
3.0,"I am 5 7 and 1/2 ft tall. This barely fell below my hip bone. This is made for small boned or petite women. I ordered a large and an extra large and while they became wider the bigger I went up, the length remained the same, too short."
3.0,As a gift have not heard back
3.0,Average quality. Thin shirt with lettering slowly coming off.
3.0,For a 4 year old they are fine however they are the exact same one's sold at Payless and the quality isn't the best. Next time i'll pay a few extra dollars and get a better quality pair but for now these will do.
3.0,"This is a plain old dark blue sweatshirt, not the cool, relaxed one in the picture. It’s okay because I like the message but very unhappy that I was deceived. Would not purchase this again. Buyer beware!"
3.0,I ordered the largest available bc I am big busted. Too tight. Really cute dress just did not fit.
3.0,"Happy there's not a huge gap under the arms, but it's so tight it's somewhat restrictive in movement."
3.0,Seguro no calcule bien la medida
3.0,My daughter loved this for her workouts with me. We bought it a bit bigger so she wouldn't grow out of it quickly.. However the material isn't very stretchy like spandex workout clothes but more like a satiny material with a subtle stretch. The waist band which fit her loosely also ripped during its first wash on a delicate cycle.
3.0,This flannel was supposed to be oversized and it is not
3.0,I really liked how this product comes with the dumbbells which are very nice touch and are very cute and bright pink however the sweat band itself the material is very stale and it runs small I got a large and it really took me a while to get it on I would recommend to size up.
3.0,A little disappointed that they were not plastic backed.
3.0,"Nice pendant,  but a really really cheap chain. Really bright fake gold color. Not really worth the price, but I like the pendant enough to just swap out for a nice looking chain."
3.0,Cheaply made but really cute
3.0,Bar was really thin not that sterdy
3.0,"I'm skinny, an usually wear an XS, or 00. it's hard to find shorts that fit me tight enough. I was hoping these would but they are still too wide. they aren't tight at all. The waist is nice and fits me great, especially because it was the drawstring, but the shorts themselves are not great. I feel like they make me look skinnier because they loose and makes me self conscious. good material and cute, but I'm hoping they shrink some if a wash them a couple times. I'm a little bummed, was hoping these would work."
3.0,very nice shirt but even with size chart....both the L and XL were too small for my 44 inch chest.
3.0,Order a size up. They are a tight fit for a 48dd but a good bra
3.0,Watch works fine.  Trach band.  I broke the first day I wore it.  I replace the band and I love the watch itself.
3.0,"Great design for the time going on in the world. Wish they had something that soaks up the sweat thats generated while wearing them. Other than that, great invention and they do help you breath better and your not inhaling in your mask."
3.0,I do not like the clasp. It’s different than the Apple Watch band
3.0,The material is okay!
3.0,It came without the key rings but the sounds and flash are cute. Still served the purpose.
3.0,"Ok so if you wear anything over a medium you can't wear this shirt. I wear an XL normally and ordered a 2X ( I'm 5'9&#34; 225 muscular build) Unless you like your shirts to look like they are airbrushed on. On the positive, the material is awesome and it looks great. Just the sizing is way off. It's like child's sizing."
3.0,"The product photos are prettier than the actual ring, which is still reasonably pretty, although the center stone is set unevenly"
3.0,"Great bag, perfect size and very cute. The problem I had was that the snap hook on one side of the cross body strap broke after only a few weeks. And this was with only using the bag every few days and without carrying anything heavy inside."
3.0,I usually wear size small so I ordered a medium but it won't even go up halfway through my thighs...
3.0,"I ordered the pink one, but what I got is just red. Other than that, the build quality is good for the money"
3.0,Backs fall of with the slightest tap. And one stone has already fallen out after a month of use.
3.0,"Feels like polyester, little to no give. Runs a little small. Slightly uncomfortable, since I was planning on using this to lounge."
3.0,"The scarf is on the thin side; which isn't bad, since it often isn't all that cold in October and March.<br />It is nice and long, which is good for when I use it as an emergency face covering.<br />Had to remove the house crest (Slytherin) because it was soo stiff. It is like putting a weight on one end."
3.0,"It didn’t fit, the arms and chest area are way to big but the shoulders are too tight. I kind of feel like a grandma"
3.0,"One of the cool advertised features of this product is that with the jacket fully zipped and hood pulled up it forms a balaclava mask. However, the zipper pull-tab is thick metal that bulges into your nose painfully if you zip up the jacket fully, yet the hood is both useless and ridiculous-looking if you don't. The reason the pull-tab is so thick is because this hoody is &#34;reversible&#34;. I don't know why they bother given that the print and texture are the same, plus you lose the handwarmer pockets and gain... nothing. If the zipper weren't designed to be reversible then it could use a flat pull-tab that doesn't cut into your nose. I have to wonder whether anyone tested this product on an actual person before putting it on the market.<br /><br />It's soft and it's warm, but it's definitely not a $200 sweater. I got it on sale for $100 and I'm still sending it back."
3.0,Love but it falls off at night
3.0,Returning item. Bottoms were a bit large and top ran very small.
3.0,"Fits perfectly, feels even better.  The tassel isn't as as cute as I thought but still a great value and stylish dress."
3.0,"Adorable LITTLE bag. BE AWARE that the size of this bag is maybe, 5 inches height by 4 inches wide, if that. It is super-tiny. Otherwise, decent quality but honestly not worth the $20+ price tag. I would not recommend buying this unless the price dropped to less than $10, with free shipping."
3.0,"I like the look, it is made well for the price, however it is difficult to read the dial"
3.0,"It’s nice & stylish, only downside is it can easily be broken."
3.0,I found these to be very very large but acceptable.
3.0,"""cozy"" only when you are running and overheated.  Leg length - ""joggers for giraffes""."
3.0,"You get what you pay for.  Don't expect glittering jewelry to wear for high events.  These are pretty and fine for casual or everyday events.<br /><br />Some may not be plated completely but again, that's fine for casual wear and the seller is excellent at helping you out!  They sent me a second set after I told them (and showed) that one necklace did not plate at all in one spot.  I found another with incomplete plating that makes it look old.<br /><br />My gold leaf had a spot of green in the center on one side and the big disk was a bit darker near the edge in one area but it made it look antique so I didn't even notice it at first.<br /><br />I'm happy with what I have but I only buy costume jewelry anyway."
3.0,I ordered my normal size and its way to big
3.0,"Very cute headbands! I purchased them for me to wear (adult woman), and they fit fine! My only complaint would be that the flowers do look very plastic(y). I have some headbands that are made with cloth flowers, and I prefer that appearance more. Otherwise, they fit well, have no funky smells, are pretty true to color, and do not break easily!"
3.0,this fits my face though NO nosewire..NOT cotton but lighter to wear..
3.0,"They are beautiful, but are cheaply made. The earring back does not go on very easily or smoothly."
3.0,Very small and tight
3.0,"I think the product quality is great, but disappointed in the mechanism. Just thought there would be some resistance to slow down the breath."
3.0,"It is a super cute shirt, but it runs very small. Arms were very tight."
3.0,"I got this so I could wear it with leggings but its a little bit to long for me. I'm 5'3 and it comes down way pass my knees, I even got a small too. Its fits as expected but longer then expected, its not good for short people lol."
3.0,How does this blouse run? Too small?!! Or Too Big??!
3.0,Very short and wide. I'm 5'11&#34; and can wear this as a shirt only.
3.0,"the skinny ones were too flimsy, and the other group was unnecessarily too hard to get on.  should have listened to some of the other reviews."
3.0,"Ripped after one night of wear. While it's beautiful and very airy, it's cheaply made. Or maybe cheaply sewn? Either way, it ripped and I'm sad. I sewed it back together but because the material is very light silky and thin, my sewing will not hold after another wear. Now I'm too scared to wash it which means I won't be wearing it 👎🏽"
3.0,More of a coral than a true red.  Matte finish and therefore a bit dull.  Yet the stones are lovely and for the price. . .($4) it's a GREAT buy!
3.0,"One problem that showed up after washing was how wrinkled the mask became. I washed 3 masks in a small net laundry bag, and they had to be ironed after they came out of the washing machine, Next time I'll hand wash and may have better luck."
3.0,Everyday socks. Fine material not too thick... fine for flats and boots. Good value
3.0,Look cheap didn't care for the look was a gift
3.0,"Very comfortable and soft, the white pattern is the iron on so I hope it lasts when washed."
3.0,"Extra long thigh highs?  They are quite short, ending about 3-4&#34; above the knee."
3.0,"the pin itself is excellent quality. the problem is the needle part on the back is at the bottom of the logo. meaning, over time, gravity will pull it so the logo is eventually upside down. I have no idea why the needle isn't in the center, like basically all other pins like this."
3.0,"Just a little small in the bodice, but a cute dress."
3.0,Followed the sizing recommendations and it's easily 2-3x too large.
3.0,Fits weird in crotch area and have to continue to pull them up because they slide down. Nice fabric just not flattering
3.0,I LIKED THE WAY IT LOOK AND THE THE WAY THE WATCH FIT ON IT. IT WOULD NOT KEEP THE WATCH RUNNING AT NIGHT.<br />IT WAS RETURNED AND TRACKING SHOWS IT IS IN INDIANA BUT HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERED BACK TO YOU YET
3.0,"This is exactly the same hat I bought locally last year at Fred Meyers (ie. Krogers) for almost half the cost of here on Amazon. I'll keep this hat as my previous was becoming worn out looking, but I had to remove this ugly faux animal print flat bow..."
3.0,"Very poor fit, but cheap glasses"
3.0,It’s very cheaply made but gets the job done. I paid $5 after shipping but later found a much better one in Ross for $6
3.0,The colors are pretty however the material is see through ... I was disappointed in that factor...
3.0,Purchased item to give as gift - quality ok not gift worthy and sizing is terrible - not true to size.  It appears to be youth size not adult.
3.0,Shoes are awesome they wear for 1 day the lights are very bright and works well the remotes does not work n after my sons party the shoes were ruined the paint on the front had completely come off how or why ? Idk
3.0,This is the ONLY shirt I have ever bought that was true to size....usually I have to order up a size because the 10/12 is more like a size smaller....so I went with an XL - way too big..... I'm 5 foot 6 inch 165 pounds..and it swallows me
3.0,I'm a 9 and I ordered a 10 and they were still small.
3.0,I like the wallet but my strap broke after only a couple of uses. I found one on an old purse and I am using that one but it doesn't match very well. Other than that I like it so far.
3.0,"i have worn one of these bracelets for almost 1 year. My back for some? reason felt pretty good, so I gave my bracelet to my daughter. Now for some? reason my back hurts again. It could, I suppose, be the vibershield bracelet . I will try it again but the cost has gone up!"
3.0,Padding is not put in well. Looks generic.
3.0,"Not quite the material I thought it would be and the white was more cream color. The were not snaps, regular buttons. It's ok, but not totally satisfied."
3.0,Nice however the case is so tight with earphones you must remove the batteries each time you put them back in the case to prevent them from turning on while being stored.
3.0,"This hat looks like the picture. I would have liked it more if it were a little bit bigger. I consider my head average. This is one hat that if you wear it, you will not be able to take it off  until you get home because your hair will be a disaster."
3.0,"These scarves are nice and well made, , and I don't regret the purchase BUT they are not blanket scarves. Probably half the width of the blanket scarf I do have. It is disappointing because I bought these to wear as a shawl or blanket in a chilly office. Though I like them, I will really only be able to wear them outdoors."
3.0,Fit is small.....slightly tight in chest area but not uncomfortable.  You have to be petite for arms to fit properly.  So I'd say petite and thin would get a better fit.  Wash and hang dry so it doesn't shrink.
3.0,"The socks are very comfortable.  The cap is great no complaints, but the socks slide down too easy.  They have also began tearing while pulling them on.  Seems just poor quality which is a shame given the brand name."
3.0,"I ordered this in red xl to go with a body suit the color didn't match and it was a little big, but good quality and cute style, so I returned and got a black large instead. This one was so small I couldn't get it over my butt! Idk why the size varied so much I'm sending back again. If it actually fits you I think it'll be really cute!"
3.0,These are fine for now....they suit my purpose......I would recommend them because of the comfortable fit........good buy too.....results are ok.
3.0,"I was hesitant about getting it and for seemingly good reasons. Received it and was actually impressed. The dress material is a thick scuba material. It is in no way thin. As expected, it came floor length, and the stitching was and I dear say it... excellent! It is however too big and way too long for me to wear it readily. I've decided to get it altered because I like it wayy too much to give it away.<br /><br />Bought a small as I'm 5'4 so just be forewarned.<br /> "
3.0,"I ordered two of these in size 8 to replace a thumb ring I had worn for several years. These came in and I noticed they were a little loose. I actually lost one in the sink where as the old ring was snug enough not to come off in the sink. I decided to check the sizing according to my Pepetools Steel Mandrel (the most recommended mandrel for its accuracy). The ring was not actually round but a little oval however it measured 8 1/4. This may not be a problem for you. But if you are like I am, when shopping for jewelry, I am going to wear on my fingers, I want an accurate size so it will fit and not be too loose or too tight."
3.0,Not easy to get on and off once you get them on they are good
3.0,"The hat came with the brim wire broken. It was floppier than I expected, so I returned it. The flower detail was cute."
3.0,"It fits as expected, but the material is quite thin, almost sheer."
3.0,"Not as good as the original Buff, but good for the price."
3.0,"If you are expecting a NVGTN dupe- nope. If you own nvgtn you will be disappointed. If you do not own nvgtn then you may like these. They are fine for workout pants- they feel fairly thin and not sure how long they would hold up. I was hoping for a NVGTN Maui dupe-and this radiant orchard was NOT it. I wear a medium in nvgtn, gymshark, and all other workout pants and a medium was just fine."
3.0,Get what pay for
3.0,"The watch was delivered as described, in new condition. The only problem I have with this watch is that the battery died within 3 months of buying it. Now I have to  replace it."
3.0,Too small otherwise cute product
3.0,It repels water well. Like that you can cinch the hood and waist. I do wish it had more than 3 button snaps. Sometimes I don’t always zip it and just the middle snap kinda awkward. It has somewhat of a lining which is nice. Only used a few times so far.
3.0,I order L and is like a M 😩
3.0,Happy with it. Fits great and love the color for the holidays. Material is somewhat thin but overall good tunic for the price.
3.0,"It is a nice shirt. Long, which I like. The only complaint that I have is that it is tight in the arms/shoulders/bust. It fits perfectly from the bust down. That being said, it is a good shirt for the price. I am going to keep it and try to stretch it out to make it more loose, because I do like the shirt."
3.0,"It shipped almost immediately and i received it way earlier than expected. The fabric is not see through and very soft. I realize I need to allow for slight differences in cut and color but this does not really resemble the dress I ordered. I'm 5'6, 145 and I got a medium. I really didn't expect it to go passed my knees. It's a very comfortable dress, just not as flattering as I though it would be."
3.0,The overlay on the earrings is very pretty in the website picture.  But in person the earrings are too small to show off the design.
3.0,"It's not as long as I'd hope but looks really nice. The color is vibrant and it looks classy. I think for the price this is a good option. I am 5&#34;10, weight 140 lbs and wear a 4-6 in dresses. I got the larger size because of the length. It goes to my ankle but not longer like pictured. I'll keep it because of the color and price point but wouldn't buy it again."
3.0,The sizing is way off. We ordered a 2x and it fit me and I wear a medium in women’s.
3.0,"When I read about this blouse/ shirt it recommended that one should purchase a size smaller than what one usually orders. I did so, & was sorely disappointed. It was too small, even before washing & being 100% cotton, it will shrink one full size in the first washing, so I was very upset & felt I won’t be buying anything from those who base purchases with false advertising. I like my clothes loose, not strangulation tight, so I wear a large. To obtain a large, I’d have to purchase an extra-large, to allow for shrinkage."
3.0,These bracelet is okay but I am not crazy about it and I am not even sure if I will wear it.  I don't care about it.  I bought something in the store $1.00 more but it is beautiful.
3.0,"Does not look like photo shown at all, but still cool pants"
3.0,I think these masks are little bit slim. Of course it was easy to wear. But I don’t know that it really protect.
3.0,Its nice but the strings are very annoying!
3.0,I'm 6ft tall and average build.  Suit is snug and the coat sleeves are a little short for me.
3.0,"It is about as advertised (maybe a bit smaller than 60l), but a strap split as I was testing the loaded pack on for the first time at home.<br /><br />I bought one for my first camping experience. It did the job, but I couldn't find a comfortable configuration. However, I'm 6'6"" so it may fit others a lot better.<br /><br />I feel like this could be a great pack for someone just dipping their toes into backpack camping if you don't get one with the quality control issue I experienced, but even with my experience, the damage wasn't structural and didn't endanger my trip. I could see this pack lasting a couple years of light backpacking with a torn strap or not.<br /><br />Inexpensive way to experience pack camping before spending hundreds of dollars."
3.0,"Very cute, but the sole comes off easy. My daughter plays hard though. She wore these to gym, outside, and everywhere else. Durable for a few months with hard play. If she didn't play rough, they would have lasted longer."
3.0,"The material is nice and very soft, though doesn't seem breathable. The design is brighter than in the picture, but it's super cute. The neckline was a total disappointment, it looks nothing like the picture, as you can see from my picture. The front and back pieces were sewn together so the thin strap over the shoulders doesn't actually look the same. You can definitely cut the strings if you're willing to risk it.<br /><br />I am usually a size 8, so I ordered XL and it fit like a L normally would, so definitely buy a size up. Not sure if you can see from the picture, but the arm holes are really small. I don't have tiny arms, but they should easily fit in a L/XL and the arm holes are right up under my pits."
3.0,"Eh, now that I've had this shirt for some time. It's super faded and I've only washed it four times.<br />It's good for the price and a bed shirt. Does run a size smaller and still kind of fits weird."
3.0,"Not too small, but short. Rolls a lot."
3.0,It's exactly as pictured but just a little too small to actually be useful.
3.0,Pretty but does not fit
3.0,Too small. Returning. Super cute though!
3.0,"The belt is cute and the material feels durable. The actual circumference of the elastic is smaller than expected but it fit my size M/L waist comfortably. The bow is stiff fabric but that just helps it look need and tidy.<br /><br />Despite all of that I can't give this product more than 3 stars because it arrived broken, missing a snap. I was able to fix it with a safety pin until I could sew on a new snap, but I was disappointed to be given a broken product."
3.0,"The zippers don't work very well,other than that I like it.."
3.0,I only bought this for 2 bucks so I can' t complain much. It is like a piece of tin foil wrapped around your neck. Next time I'll probably spend little more for higher quality.
3.0,Dress arrived EXTREMELY wrinkled and even looked worn. The colors are a little different than the pictures on product listing. Fit is as expected. But the amount of ironing/pressing is a lot. It almost looked as if it was wadded up before.
3.0,I was dissapointed because I bought the smallest size and it still was too big for me. The colors are beautiful and the design is lovely though.
3.0,Not bad not good.
3.0,"Ok at first, then because the adhesive doesn't go all the way to the edge they will lift and rub on your shirt, by the end of the day they were sticking to my shirt and pulling off."
3.0,"had to return, came to me damaged"
3.0,"I have very long arms and usually have a hard time finding sleeves that are long enough for me.  The sleeves on this dress are far too long; they went past my fingertips and hung off an additional three inches.  This dress could have been so cute, but the absurdly long sleeves make it look sloppy.  Definitely returning."
3.0,"All information about these knee brace pads were in an Asian language and there is no way for me to determine what exactly is the fabric content. They are soft, but not cashmere soft. Plus, they do not stay up as I walk. A bit disappointed, as I hoped it would help my knees when I walk, but that is out."
3.0,Solo no me gusto que el zíper de la boca llego despegado porque el pegamento me parece no sirve.
3.0,"Too heavy for my purpose. I wanted them to help evaporate sweat, and these were more like arm warmers."
3.0,"The material is surprisingly stiff / cheap. I was hoping it would be more flowy and comfortable. Also, it’s tight. I bought it sort large (2xl) so it would just hang off, and it does not do that. It fits more like a large. It’s prettily designed, however."
3.0,This bag is cute and I like the pockets. My big complaint is the size...way too big for a beach bag. I used it as my plane carry on and it barely fit under the seat in front of me.
3.0,"Great product, my son was very happy that he got a good variety. I did however receive only 39, when I paid for 40. I will not buy from this seller again. I could understand an honest mistake, but after reading the reviews, it seems like it’s a habit for the seller to only send 39. I work hard for my money and I expect to get what I paid for...only seems fair and the right thing to do."
3.0,These pants don’t fit like they do in the pictures unfortunately... I was really looking forward to them but I think you probably have to have the same body shape as the model for them to look good. Great quality though!
3.0,"Glasses look great, but after 1 week of normal use, the screw from one of the arms fell out and the arm broke off.  Due to the flimsiness, I will not be purchasing them again."
3.0,I love them but a medium is quite large<br />Took quite a while to receive them. Dont have time to send bAck.  So will take them in my aelf
3.0,"I love the dress in the advertised photo, with the vibrant colors and lose flowing material at the bottom, its beautiful. However you can tell the dress sent is a replica of the pic advertised and not quite the same. The dress will serve it's purpose but not to thrilled with the difference 😞"
3.0,I bought these for my bro. They are light and feel like made of cheap material.
3.0,Mmm not sure this an Original Adidas piece. Fabric is so rough! Looks and feels weird.
3.0,"The price was very good for what you're getting.  Comfortable to wear and materials.  Looks very nice.<br />The biggest and overriding problem is that it is NOT a larger wearing type watch band.  It;s the same size as the one that came with the smart watch!  The only ""saving"" point, is that I can wear by pinning the very last , center whole.<br />Not a very secure proposition.  Item is okay for regular large to small wrists."
3.0,I really love the feel of these socks. I think the only drawback is I'm a size 8 1/2 shoe and the socks felt too small
3.0,The collar looks a little silly in person but overall cute shirt
3.0,"I returned it... it looks super cheap, I dont think its worth the Price!!"
3.0,Sturdy! Pretty color! Looks dirty (black around edges) just three days after wearing.
3.0,"Made me low-key itchy and a little swollen, like I didn't even realize it at first. Flowers are super tiny, even in a 1/2"" plug, which isn't huge. But they are very cute and true to size."
3.0,Did not fit me well.  Very unshaped
3.0,"A bit big, and the stone was loose when it came, but it looks exactly like the picture."
3.0,Many whole a hand full or more of fabric reeling.  It’s tweed but expected it to stay in tact as the other tweed suits that I have and love.  Color and fit is great but the fabric is reeling like it will come apart soon.  Hope it stops reeling away.  I plan to wear it Monday and hope it doesn’t embarrass me.  I’ve cut so many strands already.  Wish me luck!! Aww shucks one button just fell off now I see no button holes!!!!!!!
3.0,"The dress arrived on time. The color was much darker and more teal than what was shown on the site. I was hoping it would be more blue like on the site, but that was okay. The dress was really large on me everywhere but in the arms, and I am plus-sized. If I’d gotten a size smaller, the arms would probably be too small. It was hard picking a size because I am plus-size in the hips and butt, but Misses sized in the bust, waist and shoulders...makes finding clothes that fit a real hassle. The company made it even harder by only showing cm instead of inches. It took a lot of searching online and calculating to find the right size and if I’d gotten the size closest to my cm, the arms would not have fit. Frustrating, for sure.  Still, I’m used to this problem so I went and wore it for Easter. The only other thing of note is that it was stained upon arrival, by the waist seam on my right side. Whatever has marred the material, it looks like it’s here to stay. I didn’t notice it until I was out the door heading for church. Sigh."
3.0,Priced right for what it is.
3.0,Ordered this hat for our trip. Took forever for seller to ship. When it finally arrived it was rolled up very tightly leaving several deep creases. Some of the smaller creases are starting to go away so hopefully with some time the deeper creases will settle as well. The bow around it is not as well made as the hat just cheap burlap that is shredding where the end was not finished correctly. Also very small. I don't normally have issues with hats fitting and think my head is pretty average but this hat barely fits my head and is actually uncomfortable if pulled on completely. For the price will work for our trip but not impressed.
3.0,"Nice material, it fits a lil longer than the photo. But, it’s very cute!"
3.0,I’m giving this band 3 stars because the color does not match my Galaxy Active 2 rose gold watch at all and it is very difficult to take off. I also can not get it adjusted quite right. It’s either too loose or too tight. I’m going with the too loose for now. It is easy to adjust and install on the watch. I wish it was a better match!
3.0,"The suit is cute, but the back has no lining! As much as I'd love to show off my butt crack to strangers....no, thanks."
3.0,They fit my daughter likes them. However the colors are not the colors I ordered. I received green camo and two other ones. Definitely not this rainbow splat in white and black or the brush strokes. Disappointed. My daughter really wanted this color array. Will be contacting seller.
3.0,It's cute and true to size but I thought it was a set and you can't pick big or little.
3.0,I am considering buying this product but not sure how it's worn. Does it go around the waist before I put on a shirt. Or over the shirt before I put on pants?
3.0,"The pendant is bigger than expected, but it is pretty.  Might be thatvthe demensions we’re nit looked at closely.  Buyer error.  My son ordered it for his GF"
3.0,It will work for a cover up at the beach but other than that I kinda feel like I'm wearing a grandma mumu.
3.0,"Update, 11/15/2018: Now that there is finally a price for the item ($109 as of writing) I will revise my  impressions a little. I think that this is a good bag for the price purely in terms of materials. The leather and waxed canvas feel really good. However, the large, ugly logo still ruins the aesthetic. For a bag so highly focused on style, I just can't see why they chose such a large and boring mass-market design to place so prominently on the beautiful leather flap. It's a real shame. However, if you can ignore the logo or place something over it, this is a decent choice for a carry bag. Not the best buy you will ever make, but priced reasonably for the materials.<br /><br />I had been holding off on reviewing this bag in the hopes that Amazon will refresh their stock, and I can actually get an idea of the real-world cost (I received this at no cost as part of Amazon's Vine program, but I always review products based on value versus cost), but it has never shown as available or shown a price. That's a pity, but I will go ahead and put down my thoughts as they are.<br /><br />The materials are certainly nice. It's a combination of heavy full-grain leather and oil-treated or waxed canvas. Good old-world stuff. However, it's a little harder to get a good idea of how the stitching will hold up over time. These days, especially with goods like this that are assembled in low-cost warehouses overseas, the quality and durability of the stitching are the major opportunities for failure. I will certainly update my review with observations of long-term use.<br /><br />The other major fault is simply the branding. The logo is large and very visible, marring the otherwise classy look of the bag, on the outer flap. If the logo was more understated or at least classier looking it might not be an issue, but it's a very big mass-market design choice that just looks ugly. Given that a large part of the reason you buy a bag like this is for the look, it's regrettable that they didn't rethink this."
3.0,Bought two pair of these shoes not very well made. Petals were broken when I received them and shipped with no box.
3.0,Breaks while wearing it if you move your neck quickly. But looks as described.
3.0,"Sizes were extremely small for the size I ordered. The color was exactly as pictured, material was fine but I am not sure how it would have been after being washed. It left me extremely disappointed"
3.0,GOOD QUALITY BUT WAY TOOOOOOOOO LONG THIS IS FOR TALL PEOPLES
3.0,"I can't figure out how to use the Italian Charm Tool. [[ASIN:B00521KT1W Italian Charm Tool for Italian Charms]]If I could figure out how to use the tool, I'm sure it would be worth having and using."
3.0,It was thicker than what it looked like in the picture...
3.0,"I feel like the sizing was good, and a size larger or smaller wouldn't helped, but the shoulders were huge, yet the arms were tiny. The quality was good, but the zipper was a little hard to zip up and got stuck many times."
3.0,I loved this dress and was excited when it came in! I was sad that it ran small and didn’t fit in a flattering way. I used size guide which was unhelpful as the measurements  are unrealistic.<br /><br />I ended up returning the dress - I would recommend for the size chart to be updated so that shoppers can make an informed decision.
3.0,"Case is good for the price, took forever to get it!"
3.0,It's cute but it's frail and thin. It's also a bit short. Price was good so I'll keep it :)
3.0,This product is a larger and thicker than anticipated. Would recommend that it be reduced slightly in size.
3.0,Pretty thin material for suspenders. Seems like they're more for looks than function.
3.0,I really like these earings it would be a 5 star review if the back pieces would stay on ive lost 4 already... i love the earing but the back pieces wont stay in
3.0,"Was indifferent to this product. Annoyed that one pair had a hole in the behind. Wanted to ship back, but it was going to cost me and figured it wasn't worth the hassle."
3.0,"I really had liked the jeans until the zipper pull tab totally came off one of the sides of the jeans as I grabbed it to zip it up, lucky for me i had a shirt long enough to cover the zipper that day."
3.0,Sleeves were long on this but otherwise cute.
3.0,"Super cute and sexy, kinda tight on the thighs and kinda gives me a wedgie. Sexy to look it but not very comfortable."
3.0,"Pros<br />- I love the look<br />- date counter<br />- I recieve many compliments on this watch<br />- water resistant in the shower<br />- scratch resistant glass<br />Cons<br />- 1 week into wearing it, it stopped ticking for over 4 hours (Luckily it started up again!)<br />- a week ago one of the (pointless) ""chronograph"" buttons fell off. I didn't realize this until after I took a shower while wearing the watch. It got moisture inside and it annoyed me. I air dried it and glued the button back in.<br />- The day after the return period the crown fell off.<br />In Conclusion<br />This is in my opinion a beautiful watch for a fraction of the cost of other brands. Unfortunately the materials are seemingly cheap. I've made some nice memories with this piece over the last 30 days and yes, it was worth $16. I will not be buying a replacement watch from starking.<br /><br />It's what's on the inside that counts"
3.0,"I feel mitigated about it. The material and weight make me feel like I'm wearing a real watch.<br /><br />However the quality could be better. It's seems like a cheap paint, a little scratch and the paint is gone. Also the pieces at each end lack some quality check. One the one I received, one end wouldn't click, no matter what. I've contacted the vendor, they send me a new one. It had the same defect. At least, I've managed, with 2 bands, to make one that works :)<br /><br />Last but not least, the butterfly mechanism is great but a little bit too easy to open. Sometimes, just by twisting my wrist, it would open, be aware of that as well."
3.0,"Loved the overall fit.  However the inseam is only 28 1/2"" and I am 5'9"".  The pants were too short.<br />Had to return.  Wish there was a ""tall"" option."
3.0,Larger gauge than I needed so they hurt to keep in my ear when I sleep. I wanted tis to wear in my cartledge up high.  One broke but that wasn't until two years after purchase. My hairdresser didn't see it and combed it out of my ear.
3.0,"Wasn't flattering on my wife enough to wear outside the house (according to her) despite that being the point of this design. Was cheap enough that we won't bother returning it, but overall just didn't live up to expectations.  Might give it away since the main objections were personal preferences."
3.0,"I loved this purse, but I was a little disappointed in its quality, as the inside material was already ripping in less than a month of my using it. Granted, the material inside was very thin, but it was still a nice purse. I recommend not carrying too many or heavy items inside it. Otherwise, lovely purse!"
3.0,The gown and robe are made of 2 different materials.  They don't match at all.<br />And I'm not to fond of the materials.
3.0,"These are comfortable, but they were a little small.  Then they shrunk about 3 inches in length when I washed/dried them.  Now they look like high waters, but I can still wear them bunched by the knee.  The materials are very nice."
3.0,cool design.But it is too small! if you want this get a larger size then what u wear or it will not fit right!
3.0,"[[ASIN:B01LL4LQRE Milumia Women's Boho Deep V Neck Floral Chiffon Wrap Split Long Dress (Small, Black-4)]]This dress was really light, flowy and comfortable. I really liked it  but it felt a bit too big so i returned it<br />***Update, they now have XS, so im sure its a much better fit!  (10/3/17)"
3.0,Like the style confuse with the side
3.0,Like but fixes every where but chest. Women don’t all where a A and B cups.
3.0,Unfortunately mine was defective but they were beautiful
3.0,"I love the light lavender color of this jacket. A long lavender trench is the perfect way to bring on the spring.<br /><br />Unfortunately the wrinkles of the tencel fabric are unavoidable. Much like linen I have found tencel to have it's own set of wrinkling issues. The jacket came wrinkled in it's plastic bag, I have spent some time trying to steam the wrinkles out but I can only get so much of it smoothed. I would like better if it looked wrinkle free like photo of the model on the Amazon site but I'll still wear it with the wrinkles. I've decided it's just going to have to part of the look.<br /><br />I find the fit to be true to size, I have a medium and it fits well. The coat hangs open or can be belted with the tie belt included. The belt is made of one side tencel and the other side is a faux leather PVC fabric."
3.0,"I never considered buying this watch but amazon has asked for my review of it.<br />This watch has never caused me to be late, turned my wrist green or snagged my wife's silken dress. What can I say? I have never been so pleased with a watch that I have never seen or owned before!  Yay! Russian watch!"
3.0,"Looks really good,Get a bigger size."
3.0,"These were up to my knee when I first purchased them but after a few washes, they are cutting into my leg and a few inches below my knee which is uncomfortable."
3.0,I ordered these in a XXL they aren't true to size. They are more like biker pants to me. I would'nt considered theses yoga pants. They also come  with yoga socks. Socks are wonder for the yoga mat. The headband is amazing for hot yoga. Sweat wasn't dripping like normal. Love the socks and headband but the pants are a no
3.0,Boxy fit. Just meh.
3.0,Its not the right measure its pretty but wrong measure
3.0,"Loved most of them! One refused to unscrew so I could not use it, but the rest were so cute!"
3.0,Way too small in the bottom area.
3.0,"This dress is cute, but it does run a size small."
3.0,Bought several of different ones.  Had to glue some of the jewels back on.
3.0,Cute shirt but the color was nothing like the picture. I ordered the mint green and instead got an aqua blue color
3.0,"Great designs, But few pairs are small."
3.0,"We got this for our child.  It says to connect the USB cable to a computer to upload MP3 songs, but the watch never appears on the computer.  What I ended up doing was using a small (eyeglass) phillips screwdriver to remove the backing, removed the USB card, and inserted it into my computer directly.  Yes, you will probably void your warranty...but at least it works!!"
3.0,I think these are kids sizes. Way too small and smaller after you wash them.
3.0,"I really like it, but it was HUGE! IT hung looking like a potato sack. I returned it, I think I can find a better fit."
3.0,"Not as thick as what imthe wife hoped, loose threads after one wash"
3.0,"This is so cute;  how it fits, the color, the design.  BUT, it needs ironed after washing and wrinkles terribly while wearing and sleeping.  Not worth the money, in my opinion."
3.0,"Forget getting breast into this top, you have to be size A. I Like the pants, but they too run small."
3.0,"Front Pockets are in the wrong place for me. My telephone keeps swinging all over, the pockets should be tied at the bottom to the short and break loose in case of fall."
3.0,"The color is very nice, size smaller than average medium, leather is pretty stiff."
3.0,"This is okay, it just doesn't hold a lot of my purses from Michael Kors for some reason.  I have my other purses on there and it works fine."
3.0,"This is a nice looking set, and my partner appreciates the stretchy material. They're also easy to get off and on, and aren't overly warm or constricting.<br /><br />That having been said, they're priced a bit higher than we'd expect. The material is somewhere between silky and scratchy. The buttons are clearly not meant to be undone (they come undone, it's just work to get them there). They highlight nipple shape (panty outlines, etc.) pretty clearly, so they're not something you'd laze around in amongst company without a bra on. And, while they don't leave you shocking people when you touch them, the feel of this set on the skin is primarily that of static build-up.<br /><br />If you already know the makeup of this set's fabric is something you enjoy, they're easy enough to recommend. But they aren't for everyone."
3.0,"Like the price but when i received it, it only had 2 goggles instead of 4"
3.0,"The scale was really hard to tell in the photos -- this is a gigantic bag.  The color is really, really peach too.  It is cute, but just a really specific bag.  The other bag in the photo is another Matt & Nat purse I bought the same day, which was much smaller than expected, so I took a photo of both next to each other to give a sense of scale.  The other photo shows a standard mac keyboard on the bag for scale.  The lining is not as high-quality as I expected for the price.  I still kept it."
3.0,"Quick, Thanks"
3.0,Keeps riding up which is uncomfortable.
3.0,"I followed the size chart, and given that this is chiffon and non-stretchy, I ordered a size larger than I normally would. It didn't fit over my hips. The quality of the image printed on the dress is mediocre at best (blurry, pixelated, etc). I would have been willing to overlook that if the dress had actually fit according to the size chart. My hips measure about 40&#34; (I'm generally about a Size 100-12) and I ordered a large. It fit me perfectly in the shoulders/bust area, (36 C with an athletic/muscular build, and often have trouble getting things to fit properly on my arms) though, so maybe someone with smaller hips would have success."
3.0,"I dropped this down to 3 stars for 2 major reasons:<br /><br />- The socks I received are the same as what has been mentioned, which is the tops are more of ankle height socks then what the picture would have you believe, which is they should easily clear your ankle on your way to your calves.  I take it seriously when I'm trying to buy an item online and the item isn't as advertised as I rely heavily on that description and the trustworthiness of it, even if it's a minor detail.<br /><br />- The quality is OK, but these socks are much thinner than the rest of the socks I own in my collection.  Might be a deal breaker for some or OK for others, but worth mentioning in terms of padding.<br /><br />Socks do breathe alright and do seem to do some moisture wicking, which are both nice features for a sock.<br /><br />But if I look at the price versus what you receive for value, these socks are still worth it in my mind, even considering the negatives."
3.0,"These are very small earrings and unless you are a very petite woman, only a child would look good wearing them."
3.0,"Comfy and soft material<br />Not high quality, looks a little cheap<br />Good for your next backyard party<br />The size runs big, go a size down"
3.0,"Unfortunately, mine did not come in great condition. As you can see from the photos attached, the top has many sewing issues. Very disappointed!<br /><br />If I purchased this shirt for four or five dollars I would not be surprised, but it is priced at $13.99 and I received what seems like an incomplete item.<br /><br />The fit is great, I absolutely love the style as well. I ordered a small and it fits like a glove. So that I am very happy about.<br /> It is unfortunate that it arrived in poor condition, because I would love to give it five stars based on the fit and style. Great item to add to your wardrobe! But purchase at your own risk and keep these sewing faults in mind."
3.0,"It’s almost wool- like. The sweater fits well, but the material is a bit rough. There’s also a logo on the sleeve that’s just awkward"
3.0,Very small. More like a large clutch than a purse. Lovely color and seemingly well made but I returned it as it was too small for my needs. You can’t fit an iPad in it but could possibly fit an iPad mini in it.
3.0,"Nice pants for spring or fall. Not fleece , not warm. Good for skinny kids as waist narrow."
3.0,"Love the shirt ,however, the sleeves are too small"
3.0,When you first purchase them they do seem like fairly well made chokers. But BE CAREFUL!! Some are VERY fragile and will break if you pull on them too hard. The spikes on some of them may pop off but they screw back on easily.
3.0,It doesn’t attach
3.0,I'd suggest ordering a size or two down. It's super flowy.
3.0,Great fit but straps broke when I first tried it on
3.0,"Tee dress is very cute, very lightweight and you would THINK it'd be a great dress.  However the ruffled neck and trim does NOT lay correctly and the material of the dress that was shipped to me was not a smooth blend, it felt more like a waterproof fabric.<br />Sad because it was cute, and just the right length for me."
3.0,"This is cute on the model but I felt like I looked like a grandma in it. Nothing against grandmas, but I'm only in my early 30's... Otherwise, it came as pictured and was great for the price."
3.0,"After I spent about 15 minutes trying to get it on, I looked in the mirror and took it right back off again. Gave me a great shape, but its uncomfortable as all get out and I all of a  sudden had back fat that had never been an issue.  Maybe I chose the wrong size, but people bigger than I posted review of the same size and didnt seem to have an issue. Didnt work for me, but for $18 bucks it was worth a try."
3.0,"The fabric feels like a bathing suit, but it fits as expected."
3.0,"Love the color, but the fit is weird.  Usually tights/stockings have a single seem in between the legs, but these have this weird insert like a pie piece in the crotch so they have more seems and they are uncomfortable.  These are one size fits most, so maybe on a thinner person the weird seems wouldn't be so uncomfortable."
3.0,The color wss more yellow than cream. I can not wear yellow with my coloring.
3.0,the wallet/wristlet is great for organizing but I don't see any leather
3.0,A nice enough hat but NOT denim blue.  More like powder blue.
3.0,"This should be a 5 star beautiful shirt… but as other reviews state, the shirt is unfinished. Imagine a T-shirt that was cut raggedly with a pair of scissors and that’s what you have at bottom, both sleeves and the neck. Why?????? Very frustrating for the price of this shirt."
3.0,Small tote
3.0,"Nice flowly fabric but it's way too long. I love a good tunic but being only 5'2, this one was past my knees and more of a dress than tunic."
3.0,It is very thin material.
3.0,It serves it's purpose. The only complaint I have to mention is the stand aspect is a pain to pull out it needs a pull tab or something.
3.0,"I like the sunglasses but it is a bit small than expected. It is affordable, good quality."
3.0,design not visible unless closely obseved
3.0,"I really like the design, quality and cost.  The issue was the bracelet was too small and tight for my wrists."
3.0,I had ordered a small black & it fit snug but still looked ok. Ordered then the grey in a medium sizing up so it wasn’t so snug. The medium grey fit almost the same as the small. The ribbed fabric is very thin both sizes. Would recommend a large unless it is black.
3.0,"Should have listened to reviews. I typically wear a medium or 8. This shirt runs very small. I would say if I bought this shirt in the store the medium would fit like an x-small or even small. I will re-order and size up either one size or two sizes up. I rarely take a large in anything much less an extra large however, with this shirt if you normally wear a medium then buy either large or better yet an extra large. Also, the material is polyester and spandex. I would not classify it as a compression shirt as advertised. The material is quite thin. Therefore, if you are wanting a shirt to ""hold you in"" this is not the shirt. I ordered red, black and white and like the colors."
3.0,The image is of a sportsbike with a full face helmet. Received a cruiser with an open face helmet.  It still a nice keyring but not what I ordered.
3.0,"Diferente que en la foto, muy pequeños"
3.0,The wrinkles in the top of the cap are distracting. Even took to professional cleaners and they could not remove the wrinkles. And I bought two of these things. I should have bought more than one cap from the Weavers Workshop at Muckross House when I was in Killarney - no wrinkles on the Muckross cap.
3.0,"These glasses look awesome on just about everyone, got them for the 4th but wearing them all summer! Only thing is that the lens popped out the first few days I had them:/ popped it back in with some glue and good to go, but annoying."
3.0,"I had high expectations for this sweater, unfortunately its too small. I purchased my regular size and the sleeves don't even reach my wrists. It's way too short, it fits more like a crop top. If you want the oversized look, definitely go a few sizes up. Other than that, it's very comfortable and made of thick material."
3.0,This fit was average but the material is garbage. It's super see through and a weird type of stretchy stuff.
3.0,"Longer than expected as it doesn't fit like trunks or briefs, but in fact like the longer boxer briefs, in that is how far down the thigh it goes. Leg openings are also no the tighter side (am 125lbs).<br /><br />Good design though."
3.0,This dress was gorgeous.  The only thing they don't mention in the other reviews is that the dress shreds up your arms from the sequins.  I had to wear a cover up to protect my poor arms from getting scratched to hell.  Over all I loved it just the one thing.  Fits as expected.  I'm 5'4&#34; weigh 155 and have 38DD and got the XL.
3.0,Color not as shown. More burgandy than red
3.0,"Dress was a cute style but fabric faded very quickly, horrible quality fabric."
3.0,"A tad small around the waist, had to wear it more high waisted. It is also transparent fabric, especially in the sunlight, so I wear a slip a bit shorter than where the slit hits on the upper thigh. Super cute though! I like to pair this with a cropped white tee or tank, a denim jacket and my black doc martens 👍🏻"
3.0,"Shirt was great material, loved the design...only giving this 3 stars because it seems that shirt was made for a shorter guy...I’m 6,2 and the size of the shirt was fine but the length was about 2 inches to short...gotta get some tall sizes for us Texas fellas..."
3.0,"I ordered this dress expecting it to be tight fitting, I typically wear between a small and medium, I am 5'5 and 125lb. This dress was baggy in awkward places, and was not as tight as shown on the model."
3.0,"Although it arrived quickly, and fits well, this &#34;jacket&#34; is basically a long sleeved T-shirt with a zipper. It is SUPER thin, and not what I expected material wise, at all. It is super comfy. Not worth the high price."
3.0,"My clutch showed up in poor condition. There were marks all over the side of it that I can't seem to get out. Besides that, it's a great size, shape and color. I wish mine wasn't messed up."
3.0,This product came with no box and no tags just a right shoe and a left shoe with no return label. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift. What if they don't fit?
3.0,The bottoms fit perfectly. The top however is way too small.
3.0,They fit eh
3.0,This purse is okay - not the greatest quality but not the worst. I think they do a real shame to it when it's packaged because it's packaged with no stuffing inside so it comes completely flattened with creases in the pleather. It doesn't look good like that. The crown does make it seem a bit childish.
3.0,"I started using slide belts and loved them.  Their prices increased significantly as they became popular.  This belt works fine with them which is a plus. I did not particularly like the buckle that came with this belt, but I could use an old slide belt buckle I had.  This buckle is designed to look very beat up, which is fine, but does not match the belt at all.  Furthermore the belt would fall apart before it was worn enough to match the buckle, so it will always be a mismatch.  The belt itself seems adequate quality to what I would expect at this price point.  At a price less than $20 this a compelling product, but it is not top tier."
3.0,"I like it, it’s not what I was expecting though. Typically I wear a size medium but I read another comment saying this ran small so I sized up one size to a Large and it was still pretty tight. It’s not too tight to where I can’t wear it but I probably would be more comfortable in it if I sized up two sizes. This isn’t faux leather like advertised, it’s pvc material."
3.0,It's kinda cute but looks a little demonized. not adjustable. only fits on my thumb.
3.0,Sparkly and fun. When they arrived one of the ribbons/ heart decorations had fallen off. My daughter loves the multiple colors.
3.0,I love earrings! Amazon has wonderful earrings for under $10.00. These are ok except I expected them to left and right facing and they both face the same way.
3.0,"Really pretty, fit my iwatch great, but closing clasp loosened over time enough to unhook at times and allow my watch to fall off my wrist. sooo...I put the original band back on. I would not buy this style again out of fear of my watch dropping and breaking."
3.0,"Runs small through the chest area. I’m 5’9, 140 lbs and small fit well other than chest. Medium would have been too big."
3.0,Not as cute in person as in the pic. The green isn't a pretty mint green and the flower pattern is much more orangey and &quot;blobby&quot; (not crisp) than in the pic. Also the buttons are an unattractive &quot;faux diamond&quot; that looks very cheap. Returning it.
3.0,I liked the product but I ordered boy socks and there are about 3 pair of girl socks in the bag.
3.0,ok for the price. :)
3.0,"This is a very cute bracelet. Its lightweight design is easy to wear. Unfortunately there is a crease in it because of the packaging, but I guess you get what you pay for. Hopefully it will uncrease with time and wear."
3.0,"my friend has this dress, and it looked so cute on her that I wanted to try it on me. We're about the same size, except that she's flat chested and I'm a 36-C. I bought one size up to compensate. It looked terrible on me. Didn't hang right, and made me look kind of fat. Very cute on the right figure though"
3.0,"Ran way too small, quality wasn’t great either. Returned immediately"
3.0,It seemed a little smaller than I had anticipated but I liked it enough to keep it washed it by hand hung up to dry and it’s a mass of wrinkles. I then wet it again and tossed in the dryer on the lowest heat dry cycle. It’s still a mass of wrinkles.  So I will need to iron it.  Not what I like to do.
3.0,"Design is really cool but it should specify that this cape is not for cutting hair. It’s intended for color applications. The neck is way too big, all the hairs fall on the client."
3.0,"Nice shirt but the fit is too large.  I ordered a medium.  I’m 40 chest, 31 waist and this shirt looked baggy.  The shirt is soft, but sizing is off.  Returning it."
3.0,"Great quality dress, but I’m 5’9” ordered xl, and it wasn’t long enough."
3.0,"This was to be used on my Pandora charm bracelet, to brace the charms. This was to small and a problem to put on the bracelet."
3.0,I love butterflies and thought this was a very cute key chain.  I was very disappointed when the stone on the bottom right fell out the first week.  This was only after minor handling.  I only had my car key on it and I kept it mostly in my purse.
3.0,"I ordered a Large and I usually am a size 8/10 - 36C, top was good since it was a tie at the neck and back. Bottoms...waist was great but the leg openings are so small! I have a small butt and skinny legs but this thing fit weird. If they give a few inches I can wear it, but recommend going up a size...but top might be big!"
3.0,"These are quite pretty really, and pretty well made. Went through the washer and dryer and came out just fine."
3.0,These shoes were too tight and were uncomfortable.
3.0,Love the colors and weight of this hoodie.  My only complaint is the neck opening is  tight and shoulders seem large.
3.0,"This Selene Nightgowns Grey Womens V Neck Loungewear Short Sleeve Sleepwear is okay, but nothing about it really stands out to me.<br /><br />It is a basic night gown and really so simple in that it is basically like a very long t shirt. I ordered it in a grey size medium. It is appropriately soft, smooth, stretchy, and thick. I haven’t noticed any issues with the stitching.<br /><br />I just don’t think this is something I would personally order again. It is comfortable enough, but not particularly flattering in my opinion, but many people may like the very simplistic design. I'll be sure to update if there are any issues with regular use and washing."
3.0,"Based on the reviews, I ordered both an 8 and a 10. I'm 5'4 and hovering around 135 and a 36B. The 10 was way too big. The top on the 8 fit quite well, but the padding is very lumpy. Not the removable ones, but the part above them. It's not very noticeable if you're just looking at the suit as worn, tho, so it's not a huge deal. The bottoms are very cheap, with zero support, and I would not use them at all, but then you get what you pay for.  It's a cute top, but it really irritates my skin on the back at the bottom of the straps, and I'm not sure if I'm prepared to deal with that. My skin isn't particularly sensitive, the top is just roughly finished.  I'm kind of talking myself into returning this, lol."
3.0,The quality of the earrings is wonderful but they are way larger than I thought they would be. They take up almost my entire palm.
3.0,Like the look but runs small.
3.0,"These are cute, but run very small. At least 2 sizes for me."
3.0,"The bottoms fit great but the top is too small. I have a broader back and shoulders so the wrap doesn't leave me much room to tie it, also it would never be enough to cover all the way to the bottom piece like shown. Even standing still the weight from my chest makes the wrap roll. I like to wear the bottoms with a regular top."
3.0,Theses pants are not white but more of a cream. They are also sheer so need to wear a longer top. Overall I like them just wish they were the white I was expecting.
3.0,"This leo is really pretty, but I had to return it because it was a bit too tight in the armpit area and a little too baggy in the rear for my daughter.  She just turned 13 and I ordered an XS adult, which is what she'd normally wear."
3.0,Pouch for passport too small. When passport is in protective holder it is difficult to zipper. Nice to have extra pouch in the back.
3.0,"It stores everything in a nice way, however, the credit cards are difficult to remove when needed.  I suppose it is good that they fit tightly but there isn't enough space to get your fingers in behind the card to pull it out."
3.0,would like if they were bigger
3.0,These are definitely not made to last. Heel started separating from body of shoe after some wear.
3.0,"Very reflective, but on the small side. Would not wear this on a windy day."
3.0,"nice shoes, but these seem very big for their stated size."
3.0,its ok... the Kate Spade emboss engraving is very small
3.0,It was A LOT bigger than expected. However it is a beautiful bag and well made.. If you like big bags then you'll love this.
3.0,"WARNING: The posts on these earrings are thicker than standard earrings. For earring wearers used to regular-thickness earrings, these will hurt to wear until you're used to them. There's also screw points on the ends that are especially painful to put in and pull out for first-timers. I wish I could wear these more because I really like their look but the soreness it causes me is too distracting"
3.0,"Really tiny stones, the backing is very fragile that the first time I wore them, when I took one off, it broke! I assure you I am careful handling this pair."
3.0,Was not like described.  Was not as it showed and it was too big.
3.0,These are different than my other Dr. Motion socks.  These are thinner but a bit tighter.  Not sure how long they will last.  I liked the thicker ones better.
3.0,Love this .... it does fit very oversized! I’m not a small lady and ordered a medium from reviews I read. Fits my arms fine and even bigger than I thought! I may have been able to do a small. It’s very shear and lightweight. Great for over a tank top or black dress.
3.0,"Debating on keeping this dress...it’s a pretty color (burgundy) and fits well enough, but the back (zipper) seam is crooked and sticks at the waistband, plus half the false-surplice, v-neck does not lay properly. It looks OK, but if I had more time to shop for the event...I would likely return the dress."
3.0,Nice but they are Super tiny (like for an infant or toddler).
3.0,"Earrings looked great when worn, but came unlatched easily if I caught them accidentally with my finger while brushing my hair back. The earlobe pin on one broke after about 4th time wearing it. I loved them, until they broke."
3.0,"These were so tight we could not even get them over my father's foot. I know they are supposed to be tight, but cannot even rate them because of this. I gave them a 3 thinking it's like a 'neither good or bad' rating."
3.0,"A bit cheesy but looks fantastic with two tops that I own. Other issue...there is a sharp metal piece sticking out, skin side, makes wearing this a bit uncomfortable. I tried filing it down which helped a little."
3.0,It's much spanner than I expected. The pendan is maybe a half inch tall
3.0,"Didn't get the long strap, but nice bag overall"
3.0,"The product is exactly what i needed & has already been put into service.  thanks guys, you did good"
3.0,"pretty leather, but the brassy gold makes it look cheap."
3.0,I love the case! I noticed a few small hair like fibers in the liquid though that looked a little weird and it just barely fit my iPhone 6S. Very cute but made for looks only. No protective qualities at all.
3.0,need to be larger
3.0,The quality of this scarf is great. The brown horn looks like poop.
3.0,"Really wish I could have liked them, but unfortunately I had to send them as soon as I opened the package and tried them on.<br /><br />Depending on the bran of shoe, I usually wear a 11 womens, 9-9.5 mens.  I have at times been able to fit into a womens 12 or a mens 8 - all depends on who makes the shoe.  I ordered a pair based on their sizing options which was 11 womens/9 men.  When I tried them on, they were so big, it felt like I was wearing my husbands shoes and he wears a size 13 in mens.<br /><br />Because of the sizing issues, there was no way I could have kept them and made do.  If I would have kept them, Id have fallen down the stairs and broken my neck with how big they were.<br /><br />If you do order, please keep this in mind and order maybe 2 sizes down from what you normally wear and you should be good.<br /><br />Now off to find another pair of house slippers so I can throw my old raggedy ones away."
3.0,I should have paid attention to the dimensions. Zippers are hard to open and close.  It is not extra large!
3.0,"Short and tight in the chest when, according to size measurements, shouldn’t have been"
3.0,"VERY slim fit.  These gloves served their purpose but I didn't love them.  Because they are so slim (see other reviews saying the same thing), they do not pull all the way up to the elbow like the photo displays."
3.0,The outfit was cute--it fit my daughter pretty true to size. I just was disappointed that the flower on the onesie broke off. The elastic on the skirt also got twisted.
3.0,"Arrived on time. Price is good. The picture shows the bottom half material pattern to be predominantly black, and it wasn't. It was more blues and oranges, and the colors were not as intense as shown in the picture. I guess what I mean is the colors were muted. It was blah."
3.0,"This was a beautiful dress but after the first wash, it looked terrible. I will need to purchase a steamer to hopefully make it wearable again."
3.0,"These fit very well, but although they are really big around the waist and it would be good if they had a bit of elastics at the waist. but unfortunately not."
3.0,It see through. I was expect to be a little high up quality but the pink pant you can see through. The white top I expect to be somewhat see through because it white. But the pant didn’t expect that.
3.0,Born always fit a little bigger to me. This particular shoe had glue spots on it and discolored spots in the leather that I was not too happy about.
3.0,3.5/5<br /><br />Style wise-Super super cute; perfect belt for my wedding outfit<br /><br />Quality wise- the Faux leather started to scratch off after a few uses<br /><br />You get what you pay for!
3.0,Beautiful shirt but I should have gone up in sizing. It did not fit as expected. Im also 5’10 and this was short on my waist. It was tight around the neck as well. I gave to a much smaller friend and she thought it was beautiful as well. It would have been great but it was too small....
3.0,"I liked the look so much that when the first pair broke, I bought another (two pair because the first one was sized wrong).  The thong ripped from the sole.  I do think they should last longer than 3 months!  Second pair purchased in January, broke in March."
3.0,"My son has size 11 feet. He put these on and ran around in the snow trying to slip & fall but no luck. Obviously great tread, feels good on his feet, but not waterproof."
3.0,"A bit odd...I thought it would fit like a duster, but it's more like an accessory/vest-type garment.  Doesn't come together in front, so it's not a &#34;cover-up&#34; (like to go out & get the newspaper in...no)  It's going to look good over a dress I have, but it's not what I expected to get.  Maybe it's not too small for what they meant it to be..(?)  But it won't close/cover in front."
3.0,Cute but the side are held together by one price of thread so when I went to slip it on it became a poncho gonna see it together myself n see if I like it.
3.0,"Runs small as some stated so I ordered up. By doing that, the fit was fine, but the fabric was too thin."
3.0,Very pretty but I can’t zip it up there is no stretch to it at all.
3.0,Doesn't look like the picture. Shorts look more like lounge wear. I wouldn't wear them out of the house. Great for working in the yard as they are very comfortable. Just doesn't look like shorts shown.
3.0,Ok belt. Lower quality than anticipated.
3.0,Nice glasses but not good for someone with a smaller face. Sadly had to return these because they fell down my nose!
3.0,"This necklace is very pretty and well made for the super low price, but it won't seem to lay right.  The roses always flip to show the backs :("
3.0,"This watch fits nicely in the &#34;change pocket&#34; of a pair of jeans, is easy to set and wind, and keeps time well. The double covers can cause it to sound a little hollow when the chain rattles against it, but it's a nice weight and sturdy. Opening both covers lets it stand on a desktop or nightstand. The dark blue numerals on the dark face, however, can be very hard to read except from very specific angles. The slender white hands get lost in all the background detail. I like to take my watch out to check it frequently, and with this one I often find myself tilting it this way and that searching for an angle where the light catches the numerals and not the crystal cover. Also, the bow (the part the chain connects to) has a tendency to flip down and get in the way of the covers when I go to close it-- again, discouraging frequent checks. It's a lovely watch in principle, and the motion is well displayed; it's just a shame it's not more practical as a consulting timepiece."
3.0,Sized up and it “fits” but I wouldn’t call it loose.  Also not terribly soft.  Feels synthetic.
3.0,"Cute shirt, too small"
3.0,"Strange design with weird features like zippers at the chest that have no purpose or function, strictly decorative.<br />The big puffy pouches are not pockets, just puffy places on the front of the jacket. Pockets are on the small side.<br />The side zippers open a 3&#34; placket that seems pointless.<br /><br />In spite of the odd design, the hood is nice.<br /><br />Size small fit fine for 5'4&#34; and 125lbs."
3.0,"I am very unhappy with this purchase. That being said, two of the four shirts are perfect and exactly what I expected with the name Active Basic. The other two are NOT! They have a label which says &#34;ambiance&#34; and are much smaller than the other two. The ambiance also have very thin cheap straps and care label states &#34;hand was only&#34;. What the hell? I paid $30.00 and expected to receive the product as seen and described. Instead I have two inferior tops that I most likely will never wear.  Very unhappy! Update! Seller first asked if I would keep all 4 tops with  a credit of 35%. No, that is unacceptable as I cannot even wear 2 of them. I asked why couldn't they send the black and white in brand as the other 2 which are Active Basic (as advertised). Then we get to the heart of the matter, black and white Active Basic sold out so they substituted with the Ambiance which I will again say are cheap and even though same size large, they are much smaller than the Active Basic. Long story short, they did refund the entire amount and said no need to send anything back. So I am happy and would have maybe added another star if they had been forthright from the beginning instead of offering 35% credit to let me keep all 4 when I can't even wear 2 of them."
3.0,"Super cute, but the material shows wear after 2 washes."
3.0,Nice looking jacket; but a little 'sticky' when trying to put on & remove. I had to have my husband peel it off me in order to remove the rain jacket from my body!
3.0,if I could do things over again I would order 2 size up.
3.0,They are EH. Bought the biggest they make. I do have big feet though so this isn’t really a negative review. Wish someone made a better product but I have yet to find it.  Have to fix the tongue almost every time I put them on because the metal ends end up digging into the top of my feet. They need bigger/adjustable sizes.
3.0,This one is impossible to get on!! The ball on the top does not twist off! The part on the bottom is what you twist off making it really hard and painful just to get it to screw on. I could only wear this once because its just too much of a hassle to put on.
3.0,Several gems fell off
3.0,"I LOVE this dress. I was having the hardest time finding a light, bouncy, dress to hang around the house in. Finally found this blue tie-dye and I am THRILLED. Recently gained 10 lbs which makes me 140 :( but the small still fit me without my pooch showing.<br />UPDATE: I ordered the multi-color and red tie-dyes. Both were rayon without any stretch which is definitely not what the seller described so I'm beyond disappointed."
3.0,Nice price&colors<br />To small
3.0,Super cute to wear around waist and turn any shirt into a dress. Material is shiny and a bit fancier than I like but overall super happy with my purchase
3.0,"I like this little wallet but I wish there was some way to test the &#34;blocking&#34; feature.  So far, so good but not sure how long the zipper will last; seems a bit flimsy. Also, change compartment needs to be redesigned. As is, the bottom is not closed to the body of the wallet. Change falls out when that side is unzipped.  Not a huge issue for me since I seldom carry a lot of change but it might be for someone else.  Would be 5 stars if the zipper was better quality and the change compartment secured."
3.0,"too wide, but still nice and shiny"
3.0,Absolutely loved the watch. Looks great. Just as the pic showed. Unfortunately after about one month I was standing in my kitchen and it flew off my wrist. I didnt hit anything and frankly was doing anything when it hit the floor. The band was defective.
3.0,Nose is damaged and the masks lopsided. Keeping it because of time constraints but not thrilled
3.0,"I am extremely excited about the fit of the dress. It is a figure forgiving dress. However, when I opened the package the dress was not &#34;rosy&#34; it was straight NEON PINK! I really like the dress so I'm going to keep it for the summer maybe I'll wear it to cocktails or something. COLOR WAS WAAAAAAYYYYYY OFF!"
3.0,The colors do not looks like picture
3.0,"Overall the dress is cute for a club atmosphere. However there were many things about the dress I didn’t really like. The sleeves did not fan out like in the product photos. I’m also small chested, so the cups didn’t look or fit well on me. The zipper in the back would not stay up all the way. I will say the material is soft and bright white, but was more of a rouched fitting than a smooth material that I thought it would be (or I guess hoped would be) I could see the dress riding up while you walk as well"
3.0,"The picture is a little misleading as the decal is smaller than expected. We have a California King headboard, so I expected it to not look as full as shown. But I was still surprised. The application of the decal is not easy. For the price, I'm overall satisfied with the product. But I would not recommend this to anyone without a more than normal amount of patience. This took me a straight hour to get up on the wall."
3.0,"Pretty but it doesn't stay where it should, which kind of makes it not only useless, but a pain the butt to wear."
3.0,"It's cute, fabric and quality isn't the best but good for the price. When it arrived it had a funky smell, have to wash it"
3.0,"Some of the fots perfect but others little tight on legs. Im 137lb and 5”4’. One of the just broke the very first time I use it. But they are affordable, so its ok for the style. But I dont recommend it to use it at gym or any other activity."
3.0,Great product but I ended up returning it because it was too dark
3.0,"The color is not the same.  It is more of a lighter green, than what is shown in the photo."
3.0,Order big
3.0,"The material was nice and the quality of the sewing was good however, it seems to run small to size. It fits but it clunged to all the wrong places and only looked right with the help of support garments which I really do not want to wear"
3.0,"I love the adjustability of ratchet belts since I stumbled upon the idea on a vacation to Utah.<br /><br />I bought this as it was cheaper than the brand I bought in Utah, but I feel made a mistake. This one feels cheaper and keeps coming loose.  The release button protrudes a little bit too far out so simply by walking it gets pressed and loosens the ratchet.<br /><br />If you want this as a fashion item it is good if you want it to keep your trousers up then I would recommend a mission belt."
3.0,"the silver bezels are lovely, and mostly in great shape. however, almost all of the gold bezels are misshapen, too large (see discrepancy in cancer pic) or missing sections (see highlighted area in the Aries pic). I was somewhat able to work around these issues, but there is a significant amount of resin that leaked under the cancer and Scorpio gold bezels because they're bent. regretably I didn't get a picture of the gold Leo bezel before I tossed it, because it was INCREDIBLY bent up. i probably wouldn't recommend these unless you're okay with paying for all of them but only using the silver and SOME of the gold."
3.0,It was nice looking but band too big and watch itself was too big
3.0,Caused my daughter's ear to turn green.....
3.0,"Its fine if you want to feel like your wearing a Neoprene wet suit! VERY heavy weight. Going back. Too heavy for this California girl. Im 5'9.5 and 178#- ordered 12 T-perfect length-hits at the knee, not above it."
3.0,had to trade the men;s for the womans
3.0,I am not sure. This is for birthday gift. But so far  it is looks ok to me.
3.0,"Loved the necklace and bracelet, but zi did not get the hair bow so that was disappointing"
3.0,"I love this brand and they fit as expected. But the mango flame color was way too neon and bright for me. Another reviewer posted a photo of the color, which looked more like a muted coral. But the color I received was much brighter than hers."
3.0,"So I work at Wendy's and decided to buy this watch so I could hopefully rake in more tips by flashing this timepiece. However, most of my customers didn't even know the brand of watch I was wearing, so I didn't get any tips. I ended up donating it to the Salvation Army because it was useless to me. Now I'm saving up for the Rolex Submariner, and maybe I'll leave Wendy's and work at Chick-Fil-A, cause their customers are more upscale. Overall my experience with this watch was very underwhelming. It was reasonably priced but I had to pay $7.99 for shipping, which was unusual because I noticed that other reviews mentioned they paid $4.99. WHAT THE HELL Patek!!! I'm working minimum wage and you raise the price on me for shipping?!?!?"
3.0,"Love the color. I buy Swarmy's all the time. But, this pair, the zipper opening for the warmer doesnt go all the way to the tips of your fingers, so the tips are still cold. I dont need the back of my hand warmed, I need my fingertips. I returned. I need the kind with the zipper on the side to put the warmer in, so I can scoot it to the tips of my fingers... I think theyre called the Swarmy Toasters...."
3.0,Did not reallly stay sticky.
3.0,"NOT men's size. They seem to be nice enough socks, but they are rather small. Didnt fit the size 10.5 footed don I bought them for - little bro scored some extra socks."
3.0,"Awkwardly long , but I’m 5’2” so."
3.0,I liked it but it is a wee bit tight in the bust area (I have a larger bust so that’s expected) but I bought a bigger size in case but still was tight. The arms are dope tho and aren’t too tight and pretty long which is nice! I’d probably not wear it alone Bc it’s tight but as a throw over I think.
3.0,"First, the design is awesome, but that’s about it. I ordered a large and it barely fit. So, I ordered an XL and it is legitimately a margin bigger. The design on the XL was also smaller than on the L. Not just looks smaller, is smaller. So, the XL was even more disappointing. If you can get this to fit your child, then the shirt is awesome. It’s a risk."
3.0,"I thought this was a cool shirt when I saw it, but feel like the flower design looks like a bra.  It fit a little tighter than expected, but not too bad."
3.0,"Beutiful crossbody soft material, but easy to open"
3.0,"This bracelet is the right size for a toddler. The clasp is pretty. A little child will be delighted at have a real pearl bracelet.<br /><br />But the quality of the pearls is low (which is why the price is low as well). Some pearls have pinholes, pretty much all pearls have a fair amount of blemishes, some inclusions, luster is low to moderate. I personally do not mind grooves and varied shape of pearls, but it's something to mention as well.<br /><br />All in all, it's a trade off between quality and price. It's OK for a young child, so you don't have to feel sorry when you see this bracelet treated less then gently, but of course it's not something I'd ever wear myself (I mean quality wise, naturally, the size is too small for an adult or even an older child).<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.

I am also not associated with the seller in any way.This disclosure is in accordance with the Federal Trade Commissions Guidelines on Testimony and Advertising."
3.0,The size is too small
3.0,I liked this sweatshirt dress but it was huge. I had to return it. I originally ordered a large. That is what size was recommended. The arms were way to long and I could have fit 2 of me inside the waist/chest area of the dress. I ready through the reviews to.
3.0,very pretty but is only about a 6 1/2 &#34; bracelet when doubled.
3.0,"I'm probably not the audience for this style of boot.<br />The picture does not really show what the construction is like (the edges of the leather pieces are flaps rather than sewn down, etc.)<br />There is not much support in the boot.<br />The ""official"" size of the boot was too small.<br />I returned the item."
3.0,not in love with the material
3.0,Shirt is nice but a size small .<br />Return is costing me $6.00. I will not order from this vendor again.
3.0,"I got this as a gift for my best friend Julian. He's a mega Riku fan and relates to the character alot.<br /><br />He wears 5X in almost everything so when I ordered this I was double sure I ordered it in 5X.<br /><br />I guess the sizing is actually different across the country because despite ordering the 5X, it went on him looking like a 3X.<br /><br />Though he liked the jacket and it is good quality, he was sad it didn't fit."
3.0,Waterproof and nice looking but after wearing it few time doesn’t fit as good. It loosen up and slides a little.
3.0,Sorry didn't look good at all. Don't want it
3.0,"The overall fit of these are great, but the hole for the head is so small! You'll really have to squeeze your head in."
3.0,Really cute. But too heavy for my ears.
3.0,Good material and construction but a 5X is about what a L suze would be in a regular store.
3.0,"Beautiful gift that I gave to my friend who was moving to a different state. However, she notified me the other day that it had broken. So, product durability.....not great. It lasted her two months."
3.0,"Warmer than expected but it is a fur magnet. Once attached, nothing will remove the fur except a cycle through the washer. It served me this winter but I'll be replacing it before the next."
3.0,"Loved the look if the earrings but the back will not stay on one of them. We've even tried changing it out, and still the same. Watching my daughters disappointed face when she realized it fell out of her ear and was MIA wasn't fun. Thankfully I found it a few days later, but now they sit in her jewelry box."
3.0,Hard to breath through in the heat. Blocks sun great but not a super breathable fabric. Be prepared to sweat alot. Design printed nicely and held up to being washed a few times. Over all great for riding motorcycles and blocking sun and dust. Not good if u work outside for long hours  and have to wear a mask like me. Also feels a little tight to the face even with adjustable string tightened fully.
3.0,"I had an extremely minimalist wallet that finally fell apart and replaced it with this. I like it, but it is no smaller than a typical wallet in dimensions, although it is very slim compared to a traditional bi-fold wallet. I used to carry my smaller wallet in my front pocket - this feels a little too large to do that most of the time."
3.0,Torso part is very short. Like empire waist short
3.0,"3.5? the timing is slightly off, the metal band has parts where it is unfinished, the watch itself looks nice so I'd still wear it but tiny detail for the price is not satisfying. I do not think it's worth the shipping and exporting"
3.0,"Rec'd wrong size . I ordered a Girls (age 9 years) and rec'd sets small enough for baby or toddler, have to go to bother now of returning it, super cute sets just Very wrong size!"
3.0,Very pretty but can't post a picture because it may as well be clear glass. 👀
3.0,Oddly loose in the armpit area.
3.0,"Sizing was a bit too tight/small. Also, the packaging I received says, “Men’s Boxer 5 Pack,” and I only received a 4 pack."
3.0,The top is naturally curvy and so am I :-) I returned it because of the way it's shaped just did not flatter me.  The fabric felt great!!
3.0,I ordered a size larger and still short.. get what you pay for I guess
3.0,Pretty expensive for the size
3.0,It's cute but gets bent easily so I doubt it's durable.
3.0,"I might have read something wrong, but these are too thick and big to fit in my piercings. I have regular earrings, all of them fit, and these are simply too big to get in. Trying to push them through was quite painful. Very pretty designs though!"
3.0,I ended up giving them to my kid bc they don't fit. Very cute otherwise.
3.0,"Order up a size, bottoms are quite cheeky and there’s very little stretch"
3.0,"The top is beautiful. It arrived sooner than expected. Fit was just right, But I itched badly couldn’t wait to pull it off."
3.0,Like the dress but I ordered the wrong size.
3.0,"I like the size.  The bibs are rather thin, stiff.  The binding has come loose in several places after just a couple washings.  One has to be careful how to put it on, otherwise the velcro tabs scratch one's neck.But they do keep my clothes clean so that is a plus."
3.0,Really pretty summery look. Unfortunately my big butt and thighs refused to make this work. If I ordered another size up the top would be way too big. If they put some stretchier fabric in the shorts part this would work for more body types.
3.0,Umbrella spins in holder. Even bought items to keep it on place. It serves the purpose but I wouldn’t buy it again
3.0,"It's ok. I am 5'6&#34; and 130lbs. I ordered a Large in the pink. It fit me about right. I wish it was a little longer on me, but not to bad for the price."
3.0,I like the socks but ordered small/medium twice but received large/xl instead; twice.
3.0,Very cute and built great but top-heavy and falls over.
3.0,Super cute dress! It fit good but it ripped after the first time wearing it so that’s why I’m giving it 3 stars. I was super bummed it didn’t even make it the whole day.
3.0,About a size and half to small
3.0,"Would have liked a slightly tighter fit, feels like it might slip off, although doesn't yet....how long elastic lasts is yet to be seen."
3.0,"$7,000.00 watch and the best you can do is throw up a low rez, blurry picture?<br /><br />Give this great watch some respect please!"
3.0,Not what expected...but will make it work with accessories.
3.0,"/* UPDATE<br />* I changed the rating from 5 starts to 3.<br />* I bought three of these and they all had the same problem: after a while, the wire fatigues next to the heater and breaks. It needs better strain relief. I'm going to order one more and make my own.<br />*/<br /><br />Heats up quickly! Much, much faster than the bed! (Note to self: get a 120V heating pad)<br /><br />I hooked it up to my Hemera and tested it at 120mm/s and it passed with flying colors. But at that speed, you need more part cooling than the Hemera's 40mm blower fan for bigger overhangs.<br /><br />I bought two of these 50W Maxiwatts, some E3D and Micro-Swiss Volcano nozzles, and a small turbine jet (i.e., uxcell SNOWFAN: https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-SNOWFAN-Authorized-Brushless-Cooling/dp/B07KH5R7CD) and will try to get it going even faster!"
3.0,Cute but runs large
3.0,Nice wrap bracelet but it broke after one time wearing it. It was an easy repair for me but maybe not for everyone.
3.0,Okay but probably wouldn’t buy again.
3.0,It’s not the way it looked in the picture . I don’t like it. It’s not even cotton
3.0,"I really love the design of this shirt, but it runs REEEAAALLLLY small. An XL is like a medium. Just know that before you order. Unless you are tiny, it's not going to have an oversized look like it appears on the model. But the lace is pretty and the design is unique."
3.0,The dance dress is very cute and seems to be made well. The sizing however needs to be listed more accurately. The size on Amazon is a 4 when actually it is a 3-4 according to the tag inside the dress.  I personally think this fits just like a 3T.  We also own the flutter sleeve dancina dress and the leotard fits entirely different. It is definitely wider and longer so we kept the size 4 in that style.
3.0,Not as green - by any stretch of the imagination - as shown. Nice size.
3.0,"Good for the overall cost. I have order these glasses twice because both of my glasses in the first pair broke. I dropped both of the glasses (from waist height) when they broke, so I know it was my fault but it is a bummer they are not more durable than that. But I love them so much that I was okay with purchasing them again. They are lightweight, comfortable, and visibility is great! I am a dental student so I wear these when I assist my classmates and they are PPE approved in our clinic."
3.0,"Sadly, I had to return these. They look gorgeous, but they are r ally big and loose. They slip off my face immediately and will fall off. I don't by any means have an abnormally small head."
3.0,"These are very cute and trendy. Sadly for me, while removing all of the protective tissue and clear tape around the straps, I cut through one of the loops that holds down a strap. Not pleasant at all! Now what?"
3.0,I like them because they arent all pushed up to my mouth.  Feels less restrictive. I ride a bike everyday and with the wild firesin NorCal and COVID I can ride comfotably with the mask on.
3.0,"I love the outfit, but the shoes are too small.  Disappointed about that."
3.0,"Color of these belts changed after 1 wear, especially if you perspire underneath them. They are very pretty."
3.0,the tongue on these sneakers keep creeping up...<br />otherwise she loves them...
3.0,Way too large for me.  I ordered a small and I’m 5 3’ and 120 lbs
3.0,Shirt was about the right fit but the pants were on the small size with no give
3.0,Tried using this on my motorcycle and my glasses fogged up right away. Not enough air flow. Gunna have to do some work with the scissors.
3.0,"The bigger pieces worked pretty well, but when I ran out of those, I had to try to use the smaller pieces.  They were just hopeless -- too small to do a good job."
3.0,"would not buy again simply because it does not fit ME. and by the way, it is not a boatneck/ just regular neck and i have not worn it since the first time. do not know how some of the places stay in business with the competition that is out there and this was not a &#34;deal&#34;."
3.0,"These are super comfy in my shoes for general use or a lot of walking. However, I bought them for running and they were not comfortable for running. My feet were uncomfortable for the second half of my run."
3.0,This is cute and fit well (size M - 5'3 130lbs) but in the blush color it is soooo see through! I have to buy nude colored shorts or something to wear under it. Would give 5 stars if it was not see through.
3.0,Color was not red. It's wine but I still like te
3.0,Very cute. Run way BIG
3.0,"Good watch great buy price wise, the only issue is it fits kinda tight if it came with extra links would have been 5 stars"
3.0,Better than what i thought. Its not tight. Not real loose. Fits just right and I have a big head. Thinking about purchasing another in the future.
3.0,A little cheap looking but still cute.
3.0,Very low cut. Almost didn’t keep it because of the small arm fit. Every time I lift my arms the circulation is cut off. But I love the fabric and pattern I’ll take it to a  seamstress .
3.0,"The fabric is nice. Soft and light, but the zipper is hard to get started. Another inch or so of sleeve would be better too. I'm a size Large by chest size but got an XL for sleeve length. Even with going up a size they could use another inch."
3.0,"The bottom fits great, top is too large"
3.0,the symbol is great but the string used to tie it is a problem. I had to cut them because I couldn't get them untied.
3.0,The two clips I received were not exactly the same and I had to make adjustments that made them similar but not the same. They are cute but flawed.
3.0,The sweater is comfortable but is NOT the color as shown in the photo. The buttons are different as well.<br />I will be keeping it but not thrilled with the purchase
3.0,Shirt definitely 2 sizes smaller than expected
3.0,Good size and color. Pins were loose.
3.0,"The glasses came in a warp on the right side, forcing me to lose the repair"
3.0,"I call this my Flava Flav watch. I'm 6ft 300lbs and this watch is too big for me. This watch is not practical by no means, I can't think of anywhere I could wear this and it not look like a wall clock on my arm. It's more of a novelty, but for some strange reason I still like it. I wear it around the house and my wife get a big kick out of it when I say ""FLAVA FLAV""!"
3.0,I like the color but the collar is huge. It’s hard to cover up bra straps.<br />I think the top itself is nice but it is not something I can wear to work like I had hoped due to the large fitting neck area.
3.0,Looked so pretty in photos but not so great on.  Quite thin material.
3.0,"I only give three stars because I bought them for my husband but they’re too tight around his legs and they ride up, at least according to him. I use them now to sleep in, I love them because they’re so soft and don’t have any issues."
3.0,"Good little size, not to flashy. Didn't expect for it to be that small but it still looks good to wear."
3.0,"It is good for some shopping carts, but those that have a plastic ridge on the side will not let the clips attach, and you then just have a big floppy bag.  Can be pretty heavy when filled...also need to empty it first so the person filling your grocery cart will have a place to put the item once it goes past the scanner in the cash register line"
3.0,The top of the house shoe is too large for my foot compared to the length.
3.0,"LIKE THE LENGTH AND DESIGN, BUT OVERALL THE PENDANT IS VERY SMALL, LIGHT WEIGHT. THE CHAIN DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE STERLING SILVER, GIVING  A FAKE APPEARANCE.  IT ALMOST LOOKS AS IF IT IS TOY JEWELRY FOR A SMALL GIRL, BUT WILL KEEP IT AS A CASUAL PIECE."
3.0,See through and it was too small
3.0,Just not to my liking. Too fitting. Like jeans! Expected a looser relaxed fit.
3.0,The dress itself is pretty.  Only 3 stars is because the sizing is so off.  The 2xl I ordered would probably fit someone wearing a Medium/Large.
3.0,I dislike that I ordered for my granddaughter age six too large for her and too small for me. Was confuse
3.0,"Absolutely adorable! Got this for my daughters 3rd birthday, HOWEVER, I was a little disappointed in the skirt. We had to go find her some shorts to wear under it as the dress is not an actual dress. It’s tulle wrapped around elastic. Had I known this in advance, I would have ordered shorts too, luckily I found some. Can’t wait for her birthday (6/18) so she can wear it!"
3.0,"Too small but SO cute and SO soft. Maybe I will fit into them someday...we all say that, don't we? ""Maybe I'll grow back down into those clothes someday."" But it rarely happens. Anyway, if you can find a good fit with these, they'd be good. Like I said...SO soft."
3.0,"These were supposed to be a size 6. While I realize socks stretch, compared to other socks the same size, these are much smaller. I’m so disappointed because there are practically no seamless socks to choose from."
3.0,The skirt is way too tight .i cannot fit into the skirt but i love the material and also the pattern.
3.0,"I like the look and feel of the watch. However, the section that displays the date started malfunctioning and stopped working within a few days of receiving it."
3.0,"Item broke after two days, the ball on end of dangle chain already came off!!!!☹️  Also chain is to long and thin material.  It gets wrapped around bracelet."
3.0,Was really excited about the dress but when I tried it on I stuck my hand in the left pocket and there was a gigantic hole. Sadly I’m returning it and looking for a different dress.
3.0,The product looks good though was too large for my 3 yr old..so had to return
3.0,So I cut slits in the top and I sleep in it... Clothes I've ordered so far don't be the actual size.
3.0,"Looks so sexy, but it was opaque. Was not able to tell that from description"
3.0,"Great graphic but way too slim. It was plenty long for my teenage son and he does not like anything too baggy; however, it was just much more slim than most adult small shirts that he wears."
3.0,I like the fit and feel but the colors were very faded.
3.0,The hat looks nice but was a little big.
3.0,The material seems scratchy and the neck wasn't finished. They seemed to just stop the knitting and left it there. I had to tie it off so it wouldn't unravel. You kind of expect that from these cheap Chinese online shops.
3.0,Cute earrings but the edges are frayed and not cut properly. There’s a few I won’t be able to wear unfortunately because the design has peeled off so badly at the edges.
3.0,"The tshirt is good quality, but too big. I normally wear a M or L form fitting tshirt. I bought a medium and it is very baggy. 5'6"" 150lb"
3.0,"These indoor/outdoor slippers are warm, cozy and comfortable.  I have walked outdoors in the rain while wearing them and they kept my feet dry and warm. I just wiped the rain away on the tops of these slippers and they looked like new again.<br />The only CON and the reason that I gave 3 stars is that the insole pulls out every time you take them off."
3.0,It was OK the band look cheap
3.0,Clasp on one of them is very loose
3.0,"INC runs a little smaller than some of the other brands I like, but I took that into account when I ordered. It's the typical lightweight cardigan, with 3/4 sleeves and the color is good.  The buttons are rhinestones, so don't let that surprise you- it is in the picture just not emphasized.  What i don't like is the sequins.  On the larger flowers in the print, there are sequins sewn in the flower shape- not obvious, not in the description and completely invisible in the picture except for over the right breast-if you look closely you'll see them.  They made me think 'old lady.'  In fairness, I'm not a fan of sequins - ever- and these even less so, so a little time with a seam ripper fixed that."
3.0,"These are uncomfortable on the bridge of my nose. They fog up like crazy. Ultimately, I was able to use them while traveling, but I won't continue to use them in my day to day."
3.0,"29 pieces instead of 30pcs, and have 3 repeat ,2 repeat the same character, a little disappointed"
3.0,Received on time. Has good thickness to them. However; these have a thick plastic lining in them. Not something I want to wear over my style at night. I'm not sure if they're meant to be reversible but thinking they may be. As one side is soft fabric & the other is a thicker plastic. I will be trying it both ways & will update once I do. They are also not as big as most bonnets I've used before so will not hold a lot if hair or updo.
3.0,The clips broke off shortly after buying them.
3.0,Nice chain but all 3 were same size. One clasp broke but I have 2 backups for not much money.<br />These are on the thicker side which I need because I tend to be hard on chains. Overall I would probably recommend for the price.
3.0,This dress looks super cute even in person but there's no give in the lace. I'm large busted and have larger arms. It didn't fit my arms nor my bust line but any bigger would make the rest way too big
3.0,Nice print but the material is very thin.
3.0,"Looks cute but the zipper broke before I even made it to the water, leaving me with broken spirits and a wild tan line."
3.0,"The sweater is nice and soft and seems well made but my complaint is the sizing.  I'm 34C-29-34.  I went by the sizing chart given by PattyBoutik on the listing page, not the Amazon chart, and so ordered a medium.  It was skin tight, more like an XS rather than a Medium.  I'm going to return it and won't bother trying to purchase a larger size.  The way the sweater is designed, it makes my bust area look huge, very unflattering.  I was a little concerned about that when I ordered it, but I loved the colors.  Well, my fears came true, it looked horrible on me."
3.0,La falda quedo vien pero el chorts muy pequeño
3.0,"Beautiful pattern, ran small"
3.0,Cute though! But runs small. Will have to order again. Returning it!
3.0,"I wear 34B size, ordered a small, it was too big to wear by itself. I put it over another bra and found my solution for it, still a little disappointing but oh well. If you're a bigger size than me it should be perfect :\"
3.0,Well  it is flimsy you can’t  pack  any heavy stuff or you shouldn’t. I’m going to pack light items like  make up & etc.  the flowers are cute on it & it has a zipper that works fine & its transparent so u can see what’s in it without opening it.  This came in different colors so  for the price you can buy more So this is another  options  from the same old make up bags . 😊
3.0,"Very pretty, a little trouble with the clasp, it was too wide I had to squeeze it fingers crossed it would not snap. It did not."
3.0,"When I first put them on, they were crooked, I tried to readjust them but doesn't really help."
3.0,"This came with the boasted orthopedic insole... which had way too much arch support. It was like walking on a stone in the center of your foot.<br />The cheap insoles they replaced, but kept in the box,  were much better.<br />These were too much money to buy and use cheap insoles.<br />Otherwise the overall slipper itself was great."
3.0,Fits more like a swimsuit cover up
3.0,"Was not as expected, but still usable"
3.0,"These are so gorgeous, but whatever they use to treat the wood stinks! It isn’t my lobes, I don’t have this issue with other jewelry. They smell like pee to me, I’m sorry to say. It’s very strange."
3.0,We were disappointed with this item. The shirt immediately shrunk in the wash but the worst feature about this product is the length of the crotch. The pants hardly hit my son's waist. He's normal height and weight for a 3 year old.
3.0,Gorgeous necklace. Came quickly!
3.0,"Works well but after you leave it in your nose for a while it changes color, but its okay because it comes with so many."
3.0,"Beautiful but runs small, and I ordered up."
3.0,It does not specify that it is a NECKLACE CHAIN! !!
3.0,Just not a fan of this extremely stretchy material. The shirt is cute though.
3.0,I love and hate this bra but I think I may have ordered it thinking my breast were bigger..<br /><br />The straps continue to fall down..
3.0,Was a gift for my car enthusiast sons. The quality wasn’t the Best Buy they loved it.
3.0,"From the reviews I was expecting a little better quality, but I have purchased other tassel charms for around the same price that seem to be better quality leather.  There is a descent number of tassels and the hardware seems okay.  I wish the other side of the leather tassels was a better color also.  It's a drab grayish color."
3.0,These say they can be used for a variety of things but septum and cartilage piercings would probably fit best. These are way too big for hoop nose rings as they don’t fit the hole but would look really nice in a cartilage or septum. I have my tragus pierced which I may attempt to use it for.
3.0,The skirt fit perfectly but it was damaged. In the sense that the skirt buttons had already come off when I opened the package.
3.0,No instructions included
3.0,Order size down. I ordered this as a 12 month shirt for my daughter last year for Christmas when she was 12 months. It just now fits her and she’s 20 months.
3.0,"It's ok, not sure about therapeutic value though."
3.0,Liked the lace look.but they were a bit small.
3.0,not comfortable to wear on wrist...........used during golf game.  after a few holes had to remove it because it was uncomfortable to wear.......
3.0,I have a 2 year old that wears 2t-3t and the pants fit like 18months. I was really looking forward to this outfit but it doesn’t fit 😪
3.0,"Really cute, fits small than expected, and see through material."
3.0,"No me agrado la tela, es de muy mala calidad; yo la uso para correr y la tela no es apta. Sin embargo, el modelo es bonito."
3.0,"I bought a large, because I have hips and 36DD’s expecting it to fit. The bottoms are great but, the top is too small. Over all, not sure if it’s the sizing or bc my tit to hip ratio is off."
3.0,The sweater was nice and looked like the picture but the stitching and how it fit was a little wonky
3.0,Arrived with bent posts and no backs
3.0,"The bottoms fit great, so.  The top fit super small also xl.... crazy and I'm not top heavy, I'm curvey size 12, wear a 36C."
3.0,The decorative strap came loose after a week but was easily fixed with superglue and looks like new. Its a decent wallet. Quality in person is not as nice as it appears in the photos posted. The clear id section is textured so it blurs your drivers license a bit which I think is kind of a nice feature. It will fit and IPhone with a slim case easily. But lets not forget its a $12.00 wallet if you are only willing to spend $12.00 cant expect perfection.
3.0,"Cutest socks in the history of the world but not top quality.  Intended as gift, taken aback by uneven stitching in spots, some loose threads; worry about washing them.  Feel is not premium, but price is; sent back per Amazon's excellent return policy."
3.0,6 months later: The zipper popped on the second wear.<br /><br />Love the dress! It's a very deep navy color almost black. Perfect dress for a wedding or casual wear.
3.0,"I like the coverage of this cover up; however, I ordered the small size of the tropical palm trees and the top section of the cover up looked pink online. It’s red-Not pink—I’m contemplating on returning it just for that reason. I was purchasing it for the pink color that I thought it was going to be.<br />I’m a 36 C and wear size 6 in pants. The small was actually plenty big!! I usually wear a M in tops. Hope this helps!"
3.0,"Not real happy with this product, flimsy, bulky. Love the brand and have purchased other sunglasses from this Brand and was completely satisfied."
3.0,Great looking but small for all my stuff
3.0,"Material wrinkles VERY easily. Is not as cute in person, but still a pretty color."
3.0,"Received the shoes and they are exactly as pictured, super cute and look durable. Only problem was my 2 year old’s foot couldn’t fit halfway in the shoe. Not sure if she has wider feet than other toddlers, but the shoes were too narrow at the top half. Haven’t had any problems with buying any other shoes for her so I assumed they might just run narrow?"
3.0,"Ran small, thin, and not very soft"
3.0,"These are much longer than expected. I got extra small, and they are too long for my son's 5-hole shoes in toddler size 9."
3.0,"Having recently lost a bit of weight and feeling good about myself was kind of killed by this dress when the XL fit a little snug. The opening for the head is ridiculously small, and I don't have an oversized noggin. I will wear it, don't get me wrong, but definitely not without a cardigan or blazer over it to avoid obsessing about my belly."
3.0,Need to try and wear it
3.0,I actually regret buying this. Wish I could get refund now smh.
3.0,"The neck need adjustment,  other then that, it's great."
3.0,"Nice, but large"
3.0,"Thin, size 13 normally and could have gone down a size 36D"
3.0,This is very soft and the color is very nice. It was a bit too snug around the forehead and was not comfortable over several hours.
3.0,"It looks really cute but it’s 100% rayon and frayed after the first wash. Full disclosure, I washed it on delicate rather than hand washing as it said.<br />If you are taking this to a beach get a lighter color as salt shows up on the fabric until you wash it. This was probably a rookie move on my part.<br />It has pockets :)"
3.0,I ordered a L as I followed the sizing chart. I tried it on and it was too big. Will be returning it.
3.0,"This was a little large on my child, but I love the top. The bottoms however, will be put into her pajama drawer. They are not fit leggings, even if they were smaller, more like slack material I would say."
3.0,"Its very hard and sturdy (which I love) and much larger than I expected but looks complimenting when I wear it which I also love. My only problem is that I can already tell the material can easily be scratched off or scuffed so I have to be especially careful with it when I put it down on hard surfaces. Other than that I love this bag and would buy it again, it's very spacious inside and accomidating to all my needs and my boyfriend's when he wants to put things in my purse."
3.0,"I like them.  They're very pretty.  But they don't stay where they're supposed to.  The backs slide down and they hang down instead of following the contour of your ear.  I bent the backs so they hug my ear a little harder, but then they poke out at a weird angle in the front.  I'm going to keep playing with them to see if I can get them to work.  They really are beautiful."
3.0,I like the color and design. It was very stiff at first and I thought it would fit better as it loosened up. I found the band would push the watch piece itself up off of my wrist and I wouldn’t feel the vibrations/ it would lock itself from no contact. Just didn’t for well me. Bummer. I went back to my stock band after a week.
3.0,"Cute, colorful  apron design with stain resistant finish. Good length for an adult, but the waist ties are a little short."
3.0,"These are really cute little onesies...I loved the patterns, the little dinosaurs are really cute.  These outfits are made with really nice thick cotton pretty soft.  They seem to be well made with one exception....if you look at the photos, for some reason they decided to put the maker labels/tags on the ""outside"" of the onesie?  Not sure why?  I will cut them off and hopefully be able to without damaging the seams...don't know if this was intended or just a defect that happened?  But it doesn't look very good."
3.0,Although the seem to fit ok after a while  they start to loosen up at the waist (from the  the first day of use). They do the job but have to readjust them during the workout routine a couple of time.  They are not see through.
3.0,I love these tights! They are flattering and squat proof. However this is the second time I’ve ordered from them and they sent me the wrong color. I now have duplicates of colors I had already purchased and still no black. Wish they would fix this. Besides that they are great!
3.0,"Super cute boots - but fit extremely small! Got a size 8.5 which is my normal size and they were way too small, so I returned them and got a 9 and they are still extremely tight."
3.0,had the potential to be great but it showed up ripped and i spent 4 days and 5 different ways trying to get the dress to unwrinkle and was not successful.
3.0,"they are pretty, cone in a little cloth pouch. just bigger than I like"
3.0,"Was short in length, but cute."
3.0,"Hi...These socks are a very nice quality but I have heavy legs, and they are tight......Nice looking and good materials.  UPDATE:  the company read my review and contacted me about a refund.  This is such good customer service!"
3.0,As described just came with a very strong odor..
3.0,Great service but shoes did not fit.
3.0,The color was off and I did not like the pleat on the side.
3.0,"I really LOVE these boots.  The color is as described. Unfortunately, they do this weird &#34;floppy&#34; thing when you take a step.  Like the show sort of puffs out when you take a step.  This one puffed out a lot.  I have another pair that i LOVE though, so give these a chance,  It could have just been the one that i got."
3.0,For a bit narrower a face
3.0,This jacket is amazing if you don’t mind that the pockets were sewed uneven.  This is my 3 jacket - thinking it was just a fluke - I keep returning and getting a new one mailed.  All 3 have had the pockets uneven and one of the sleeves was uneven too.  Seems like it was a sloppy job sewed.
3.0,"This is a really cute dress with pockets. It is very form-fitting. Despite what reviews might say, these are NOT American sizes. The XXL was way too small for me at a size 20. It really is meant for someone who is a size 16. I wish they had larger sizes!"
3.0,This was too small even though the size should have allowed for plenty of room
3.0,"Loved it for the first 2 months.  Then one of the straps came out of the metal holder.  I have had to redo it at least 10 times and just last week, it happened and really made me mad, so I dumped all my stuff on my bed and tossed it in the trash.  Would not recommend for an everyday use."
3.0,These socks are adorable but fit small and are a bit thick for my taste.
3.0,Sure not fun to wear all day lol
3.0,This belt is about an inch longer than other belt's I own of the same size and style which is made worse because it also lacks the same amount of elasticity as the others which makes you tighten it more emphasizing the length.  For the price it's ok.
3.0,My son is a 2T in most brands and this simply didn't fit well. The head was huge and the body was almost to small. The crotch to neck part seemed to be shorter than it needed to be for the sizing. We ordered a large. Definitely won't get any more wear out of this.
3.0,"Was a tad awkward fitting in the front arm area but nice light weight tank, good for layering"
3.0,Real tight on the butt and one of the buttons popes off before I tried it on. Will be able to easily sew it back on. Tight on the butt. Great quality dress very flexible and comfy.
3.0,Comes up too high in the crouch area.
3.0,"The size is fine, it looks the price you pay for it."
3.0,Color is not what I expected. Very heather- more beige than it looks like in the photo. There are multiple photos... I got the color that was in the 3rd photo instead of what was in the 1st. I bought Wine.
3.0,Looks cool but it’s not a real stone. Do the heart needle test and you’ll see it’s acrylic
3.0,Bought this for my baby whose always taking selfies... keeps it with her everywhere she goes but she has yet to actually use it. She said she is waiting for right background...lol
3.0,Decent but not good fitting
3.0,"Very cute masks, used for our daughters 2nd birthday party. However the product is labeled as 7 pieces and only 6 came in the package leaving us one short for our guests 😕"
3.0,Tight are cute and I like the pockets but they aren’t as stretchy as I like. They are good but not exactly what I thought I do love the pockets though
3.0,I like the look of the product but the  workmanship is not very professional.  The inscription is already breaking off piece by piece.
3.0,"It fits, but it doesn't provide the support needed for a sports bra."
3.0,Absolutely love this dress but stains easy and does not wash out
3.0,The material is to thin to compress anything but other than that they aren’t that bad.
3.0,"The earrings are a cute design, but they didn’t sparkle like other colored crystal earrings I’ve purchased in past. Plus they were too large for my daughter’s ears (2-year old), so I returned them. But I did like the screw backing."
3.0,It runs big so order a smaller size.
3.0,smaller than I wanted
3.0,Could’ve fit better. Not the worst shirt I’ve bought from amazon but had to return.
3.0,"Colors are as  depicted , Very vibrant. The fit was a little too large and loose for me. Fit more like a short dress rather than a tunic type top."
3.0,Thought it would look flattering on me but where the floral and strips meet it just doesnt fit right on my stomach area.
3.0,Very thin material and did not stay in place very well
3.0,Bought 3 medium shirts received 3 medium packaged shirts... 1 however was labeled medium and actually an XL...
3.0,"Dress itself is beautiful, but runs small. At least I think it does, the inside has no tags to say what size I have. I ordered a large and am 38D and could not get top to zip close."
3.0,"The jacket is very nice and is perfect for ""winter"" in Arizona, but I'm a little disappointed that the watermelon color is redder than the product image. I would have opted for a different color had I known."
3.0,Beautiful prints but the material is a little too thin for my liking.
3.0,"Very spacious, with a lot of pockets/compartments.  Feels a little cheap, but it is very cute."
3.0,"The bag is amazing for the price. I’m using it as a laptop briefcase while I’m traveling. However, it was listed as a “Prime” product but waited a long time before it was delivered"
3.0,"This is freaking huge. Way bigger than I thought it would be. Setup is confusing and next to impossible unless you keep the instructions handy, lose em and yer screwed. Build quality seems nice no complaints there."
3.0,"Fits great, but cheap material. After a few times of wearing it the top is coming apart"
3.0,shorts aren't loose fitting and aren't as long as the picture
3.0,I bought several of these shirts for traveling overseas for the quick drying properties.  They deliver as described.  The only issue I have is the snag easily.
3.0,This was super cute and easy to install and remove from the watch. Unfortunately it didn’t last very long before it broke.
3.0,Very nice blouse but runs smaller than sizes suggests.
3.0,"The suspender clip broke off right when my husband was getting ready to put it on for our wedding, luckily we had sewing supplies onsite to fit it."
3.0,"I am always on the lookout for a nice dress and new style to try.  Let's see how this one worked out..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS DRESS LIKE?<br />This dress is a nice soft knit that drapes well.  It is a bit thin, so you will need to have a slip under it or it is very see-through.  There is a baggy style to it and a tuck at the dropped waist.  The sleeves are cap sleeves.  I did not see where this is a wrap.  Mine is sewn shut.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS LOOK?<br />This dress is made more for a straight up and down figure.  Think of the 1920s type figure.  It is not quite as flattering on an hourglass figure which is more of what I have.  It also might not work on some with a heavy bottom pear shaped figure either.<br /><br />It can be dressed up and accessorized with belts, scarves, etc, so it can work.  As it is, it just isn't too good on my hourglass figure or the pear shaped figure that I had try it on.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you have the type of straight figure which looks good in 1920s styles, this might be a good dress for you.  It does need a slip as the fabric is thin and shows everything through it- including lumps, bumps, panty lines, etc.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />I give this one THREE STARS.  It just is not that flattering of a style on myself or two others that I had try it on."
3.0,"I'm 5'10&#34; and 155lb. I ordered a medium. I don't have unusually long arms or waist. the arms were short by about 3/4&#34; and the waist could be longer too. I really don't mind because I wear it over a lighter layer, but Smartwool and Ibex didn't have this issue. The material is great and construction is fine. Don't expect to stay warm when the wind blows without an outer shell. I love Merino wool. No issues with washing, shrinking, odor, ect."
3.0,A little tight around the armpits
3.0,Somewhat smaller than expected.
3.0,Aesthetically pleasing. But not more than an hour into wearing it the first time im having wires poke into my arms. Very disappointed with this. Other than that its a perfect fit.
3.0,The product has great fabric and the colors are so vibrant. The only problem for me are the sleeves they are too short.My blazer has no blouse appearing at  the sleeves. Sleeve length is a short coming that needs correcting.
3.0,The design is exactly as pictured however a bit narrow. Definitely not for someone with curves. The seem on the sides goes straight from top to bottom giving no room around the butt or thighs. I usually wear a medium in something like this.. I ordered the medium and it was so tight around my butt I couldn't wear it.
3.0,"Lenses are not as good as the originals.  My original lenses lasted almost 8 years and this is my second pair of replacements in 2 years, but they are replacement lenses which lack the quality of the original Arnette lens.  They scratch very easily so dont use your shirt to clean them.  Warm water and a very small amount of liquid dish soap(non antibacterial) will make them squeeky clean.  If you are a fisherman such as myself, and you wear these you will notice that the water will look like a blue light is shining on the surface.  Sort of unusual for the polarized lens.  But all in all they are a good lens."
3.0,It's nice made but if you have dark color frame that you probably want to stay away from this pinkish clip on sunglasses.
3.0,Even a medium was too small and I wear a size 4 jacket!
3.0,I like the band but the clasp is loose nd sometimes comes undone
3.0,"The gold is bright but does darken. They are still ""gold""  enough to match."
3.0,"Nice looking but fits tightly where it pivots on the back of your ears and doesn't rest correctly on your nose. Always bending them to try and reform the shape of to make them wider. My hat size is 7.25, I don't have a wide head..."
3.0,"I only received the rainbow earrings, not the bluish ones."
3.0,"la cadena es muy pequeña y fina, los aretes son demasiados pequeños.<br />no los recomiendo"
3.0,"I really want to give this jacket more stars, but the true point of a jacket is to keep you warm. The design is beautiful. I'm keeping it for that reason alone. I bought a size up and it fits great, so size up if you want it. Just know the material will not keep you warm... you're just buying an amazing design."
3.0,"Onesie and socks are pretty good material. Only issue I have is that the picture shows polka dots on the warmers and the headband but mine came with hearts in it. Minor detail, but would have preferred polka dots."
3.0,Cheap and flimsy but they work.
3.0,Love these except the grey pair had a hole in them<br />Upon arrival.  Suuuuuuper comfy and warm.  I could wear them every day forever.
3.0,Bigger than you think. I estimate about an inch in diameter. Thought the earrings would be smaller - but they still work.
3.0,The style is nice. But too many zippers.
3.0,"When putting my new band on my fitbit, the lever immediately broke off, making it VERY difficult to get the band on.  This product looks great, but is suboptimal quality."
3.0,"Got this for a friend. Some of them ended up breaking, but they are very cute. They come very small too."
3.0,"Anticipating the tighter fit, I usually order ""L"" but upsized to ""XL"" (still a bit snug for my tastes). I like the price and color selections; the fabric is lightweight, appears to be durable and fairly well assembled. I'm 6' tall, so the sleeves are long enough but could use another inch or so for the thumb holes to work out on my freakishly long arms. I will keep this one and order another in XXL... hoping for the addition of a sienna brown. :-)"
3.0,Wish fabric was a better quality
3.0,"I absolutely love Wanda/Scarlet Witch, my favorite character in the entire MCU but this crown is lowkey mid. Unless you have a tiny head then it’ll fit but if you have a normal sized one you’ll probably just be keeping this in the box lol. Absolutely beautiful brown, the necklace is very cheap and honestly so is the crown. This should only be like $55 at most, definitely not the price of $80-90"
3.0,"The kimono has extra strings hanging everywhere. The crochet part is pulled. The backing from the embroidery is halfway on, peeling off, and scratchy. I am 5'8 150 lbs, I wish it was a little longer. Other than that, the embroidery looks fine. It will do the job  I'm just afraid strings will continue to pull as I wear and wash it."
3.0,I'd like it more if it was one size smaller
3.0,The shirt says bel hir not bel air so I’ll definitely be returning it if you look at the picture that’s a H not a A 🤷🏾‍♀️
3.0,"Cute, well-priced summer dress. Unfortunately it runs very small."
3.0,"I didn’t realize it was going to be really long but that’s my fault I guess , my boyfriend loves it"
3.0,"I purchased a large, but it fit like a small. Instead of sending it back, I just gave it to someone as a gift."
3.0,I purchased these for my son to wear on the boat or as water shoes and I was able to purchase them in exchange for an honest and unbiased review from amazon review trader. I ordered a size 13 and they were a lot bigger than expected but possibly something he could wear next summer.
3.0,"This watch band looks good on my silver Moto 360. However, I had a difficult time adjusting the size and attaching it to the watch. Also, the clasp is too loose and comes undone at times. This may be because I did something to the clasp when I was trying to adjust it."
3.0,"Looks good, but doesn’t last. They started falling out two weeks later"
3.0,"These are very good quality for the price, just some of the ties are shorter than others....kind of odd."
3.0,"They are fine for tank tops, but they are not compression, at all."
3.0,I ♥️ the smaller size. Large size give off a tacky vide and fastener doesn't connect as well as smaller version.
3.0,"This dress is alright. The top is pretty snug, and then the skirt material is pretty stiff and starchy, almost like the cloth dinner napkin at a nice restaurant. I thought it was so-so overall. I wouldn’t order it in any other colors."
3.0,Scratchy material that irritated my aunt's skin when she worked.  She also had to take in the dress at the waist despite the length being perfect for the job. The dress is durable  but she now has to wear a slip to prevent irritation when she perspires.
3.0,It was tight across the shoulders and bust. If your over a c cup order up a size. The colors are beautiful but had to return it
3.0,They're cute but kinda cheap looking and feeling. But as long as you where at night no one but you will notice.
3.0,"A ,title thinner than I liked. Decent value"
3.0,"Its obviously not silver. Didn't expect it for the price. Nobetheless, its pretty and big. I thought it would be smaller."
3.0,I'm usually a L....I ordered an XL... still somewhat small...but it fits...
3.0,"Too small around my back and upper arms I am a plus size, normally a 2x fits me i bought a size even larger and it's more like an xl, very thin material"
3.0,I think I will have to sew the toe ends to make them shorter for my average female foot.  Love the design.
3.0,They are made entirely too large and require a hat to hold them on your face. They are very thin and breathable. But the pattern is stretched to far in my opinion. The skull doesn't fit your face it wraps around the back of your head.
3.0,I was a little tight but I work for my birthday
3.0,Nothing too special. The 'knitting' seems rather loose and mine were delivered with a hole in one foot. They are also rather thick so I only have one pair of boots I can wear them with.
3.0,Very constrictive on the wrist
3.0,"Cute dress, but way too big."
3.0,"I've only tried this shirt on, but haven't actually worn it around yet because it's bigger than what I expected.  I am considering taking it into the store to see if I can swap it out for a smaller size!  Otherwise it looks and feels great.  Just be careful with sizing when ordering online!"
3.0,"Would be fine if you pay no attention to their recommendation of ordering a size smaller. It fit,  but I prefer a little room."
3.0,it is really cute but it just turns your finger quick.
3.0,"The material on these pants is super nice.  I really struggled however with the overall pattern of the pants.  I have a flat stomach and a larger back side.  The front came up an inch above where the back of the pants hit my waist.  They were also a half size too small.  I wear a tight 10, and usually a tight medium, normal fit large.  These were a large, and ridiculously tight.  But in the waist they kept sliding down.  When I was riding my bike I kept having to pull them up.<br /><br />The other that bothered me was when I wore them to the gym, my phone kept falling out of the deep leg pockets.  They need a zipper.  But the placement made it to where I had to pull my phone out for so many exercises anyway, because they hit my leg at the spot of the pocket.<br /><br />Overall I would find a better pair of pants.  The material was super nice, and not see through, but overall I won't wear them again."
3.0,"It was honestly a very comfortable and pretty ring, but after only 2 days of wearing it, the silver finish faded and turned my finger green. Now, half of my ring is copper and the rest is silver with copper colored scratches."
3.0,Love the shape and they fit well on my small face. Not the most comfortable to wear for lengthy periods of time.
3.0,"Huge! I’m 5’1” 125lbs, bust 34DD. I bought a small.  Not tight or fitted anywhere. It is very big and very baggy and I had room to add a padded push up bra. It’s cute. Not bad quality for the price but it’s just so big I can’t wear it. Sad because I have a free people maxi slip that looks adorable under it so would have been a great way to get the Free People layered boho look at a bargain...sigh wish there was an x-small option.<br /><br />Neil is my husband in case you are wondering. little more info: I have an hour glass curvy figure, small waist and flat tummy larger bust, hips and rear end. I thought maybe it would fit me well despite some reviews of it being too big thinking other buyers were thin and petite like the models (who by the way most cetaintly have the dress pinned back to acheive the look in the pictures) This is not huge on me because I am a waif like the models, It's huge everywhere and fits closer to a size large. Also the sheer portion is much darker in color than the pictures show and 2 of the elastic fastening hoops were broken."
3.0,They help you see into the water better than most other sunglasses
3.0,I like the material but it's fit a bit big and short for my legs maybe a smaller size would work better
3.0,"Blouses are ok. I bought them for work. Nothing special. It gives me something to wear but for the price, it’s way too pricey."
3.0,"Misleading name of the toy. It's just one piece of toy and slime. I'm giving 3 star because I'm disappointed as I expected 2 toys and slime.  For the price I paid, the toy has low value"
3.0,"They were fine, maybe just not my style. It just looked and had the fabric of being loose leggings."
3.0,its just ok
3.0,"Based on the picture, I expected these to be trunk-length boxer briefs. However, after I opened the package and removed a pair, they looked huge. I held them up to myself in a mirror and they came nearly to my knees and the fly was the whole length."
3.0,Mine always pull up when I’m wearing them which is annoying and they don’t really compress anything...
3.0,"i really like them and wanted a brown pair in them size 9-10 but i wore them a couple of days and the foot bed is starting to pull loose from the edge and the bottom part of the foot bed, has already faded and looks like they have been worn for a year or so, not holding up good at all and like i said i only have worn them for a few days now, so guess i wont be getting the brown pair, afraid they wouldnt hold up either"
3.0,"Bigger and lower cut than expected. I will still wear it, but only around the house"
3.0,The sarong is much more see through than advertised. It’s completely sheer with no coverage.
3.0,"Overall this bra fit well and was comfortable, but the outer edges of the bra cups were set further out than most other bras and as a result, dug into the front of my shoulder area/armpit when I did anything where my arms moved forward."
3.0,Shirt was much too big
3.0,"Nice looking. Good basic key ring...especially if you drive a Versa. Not great. The metal is cheap, and the bottom corners are sharp enough, they could cause injury. Had there been a more expensive version, I would have gladly paid. Using this now for spare keys. Bought a Tumi for my daily use."
3.0,Comfortable but very thin. Also the waistband in one of them came apart.
3.0,I read a lot of reviews & opted to go up a size and order a size 8. My engagement ring is a 7 1/4 so I thought I'd have lots of room.  The rings get tighter the closer to ur knuckle which makes sense but didn't occur to me.  I had to play w/the order of the rings on my finger....I like the design they have but that didn't fit well.  I'm still on the fence about whether to keep them.
3.0,I like the softness in the material but I found the band tight. I wear a 42 D and ordered an X-large. Since I wore the bra for a day I did not return it. I purchased a different color in 1X and it fits fine.
3.0,When they say tiny they mean TINY! They pull through my piercing hole and can be a choking hazard!!!! 💥💀💣👎👹😱💩
3.0,"This pouch was beautiful and authentic MK. Deep red, not burdandy, marroon, or bright red - fun but classy. Unfortunately, it wasn't big enough for my needs. Cards and cash envelopes fit fine, but getting my S9+ in its OtterBox case in and out was a Herculean task. Doable but a pain, and no room for anything else including my small set of keys. This made it essentially useless to me, so sadly returned. Have another one in a slightly bigger that fits everything easily, and has an exterior pocket that fits my phone. Make this lovely red in a bigger size, MK, and I would buy in a heartbeat!"
3.0,"Great price, but runs pretty small in the arm area."
3.0,"I bought this for a beach vacation and planned to wear it to go dancing. The dress fit fine, except for in the chest area. I do have a larger chest, but it showed so much to the point that I had to change outfits because I was too self-conscious about how low cut it was. My bralette covered more than the dress did! The material did not look super high quality, but for the price I did not expect that much. Also it fit weirdly right below the bust and there was a strange extra bit of fabric there as well"
3.0,"I like it very much , however I though it will be much thicker."
3.0,"The actual pearl is nice a little small than I expected however the problem was when I place it in my wrist it broke, sending the pearls all over my floor."
3.0,Such an awful smell! Fits pretty tight but is easily starched out. I hated it when I first put it in but now that I am wearing it I habe become more fond of it.
3.0,"I thought my wife would like these, especially since pink is her favorite color. But unfortunately, she didn't. Didn't hate them, but they are not her favorite. Yes, they fit okay, but not the most comfortable to wear, and she doesn't love how they look. But someone else might like them better."
3.0,I give this glasses because they are really small. Lens from top to bottom. The good thing is that they are very darl.
3.0,These leggings are so soft and comfortable. I wish there was a choice of at least two sizes. These are a little too big (usually wear size 7)
3.0,"I am not happy with all of the bonded ""leather"" lately on Tignanello bags; it DOES NOT hold up near as long as real leather."
3.0,"It’s pretty! When I removed 2 links it fit better but it’s a little snug, if I put one back in then it’s to big"
3.0,Beautiful and well made but runs small
3.0,"It is a cute dress, but the sizes run small ( buy at least one size up, may be two: the waistline on the M size dress is just under 80 cm circumference). Workmanship is better than expected - seams are well made and it's fully lined."
3.0,"The pink lenses are too light for sunny days. ..and I don't normally like dark lenses. But, I really can't find a need for them. Only use the dark ones. Great glasses just don't work well on the reflective water. Will be ordering more dark ones. They are perfect!"
3.0,Kit fit my penis in it
3.0,They will work when you quickly need readers for occasional use. But the construction quality isn’t great. They are bargain readers.
3.0,Cute shirt but the unicorn design seems cheap like an iron on. I expect it will crack over time.
3.0,This skirt didn't come as outwardly pleated as the picture shows.  It kind of lays flatter and lifeless.  The waist is very tight and I ordered up; typically I wear a medium (8/10) and I ordered a Large.  Wasn't very impressed.
3.0,I've had these for a couple months now. The picture with most of them is when I first got them. After a few months they will start leaving the green stain on your fingers and the silver color will start to fade depending on how often you use them. I wear particular ones everyday. They weren't expensive so I can't complain too much. I still enjoy them and get compliments on them.
3.0,Too small to fit over my chest I am a 40ddd
3.0,"We consulted the size chart which suggested we might need to size up to a small, but stayed with XS. The XS was too big. Sizing was just weird. It’s fine otherwise, nothing fancy, but a decent cheaply made jumpsuit."
3.0,"I like this suit, the bottoms got really well it's the top that is too small. I wear a C cup and this top doesn't quite cut it. Its ok if I just lay out but not great if I actually go in the water. I have to constantly make sure a boob didn't pop out."
3.0,"Keeps the sun off my skin, but it is so hot to wear.  I think it will be more of a go to in the colder weather."
3.0,These will work for what I need them.for but yes they are cheaply made.
3.0,Cute product. A little different than most sweatshirts I usually buy/see. The sleeves are a different slick material with a cute stitching while the hood has stuffing in it. It's a cute product... Crazy small! I wear a L from most stores. I purchased an XXL from reading other reviews and couldn't get it over my shoulders.
3.0,The pics look amazing but the product it self doesn't look as polished as in the pics. Some aesthetics are different.
3.0,It is very pretty and unique.  BUT IT IS BLUE NOT GREEN.
3.0,"Returned the medium as I needed a larger size!  But loved the color, design and look !!"
3.0,This leotard is cute. Fit is a bit large for the size. I don't particularly like the cotton feel of the material simply because I prefer the spandex kind better. Overall it was ok for it's price. My little ballerina loved it.
3.0,"The fit of these glasses are great-- they have a sheen to them, which I am assuming is the anti-blue.... The glasses came with a little picture to &#34;test&#34; it out, but there is no difference in the picture.<br />I'm not sure if I feel less eye strain with these."
3.0,"While this is an excellent fit and stylish Gi, I would not recommend it for anyone who is new to BJJ.. most schools have their custom patch kits that represent where you got your training and upon getting this Gi I realized it was so decorated up that I literally had no room to have my schools patches sewn in anywhere.. my instructor was irritated when I brought it in and basically told me I would need another Gi. This was my own honest mistake and no fault of Hayabusa but in the future I will know not get a Gi that has so many patches on it"
3.0,"I got these for my son in hopes that he would stop twirling his hair. They do seem to work for that purpose, but I did have to purchase chains to put them on. The colors are vibrant and they do not have an animal or chemical scent to them."
3.0,The arms are too short and are too tight around my shoulders and arm pits. Good room around my abdomen. Everywhere else the fit is not that good. I’m not a muscular guy.
3.0,These are cute and fashionable underwear but even with the up in size recommendation the products are a little snug yet.
3.0,I’m 5’10” & 170ibs with a large bust so I ordered an XL and the top fit fine but the bottoms are way to small. It’s a very thin material so its kinda see through.
3.0,Dont really care for this bag kinda hard and old ladyish looking
3.0,I got the biggest size hopefully that it would fit but it was still rather tight. It’ll do though. Top is also very sheer and see through. Tbh it’s to be expected from buying from one of these brands
3.0,Cute cute dress but no stretch at the bust. I am busty so that can be an issue but wow! No stretch at all. Gave the dress to charity shelter although I really really wanted this dress to work (waited too long to try to return).
3.0,"This blouse is a bit sheer but very cute. However, I wish I would have bought a size larger than what was recommended as it is too small to wear."
3.0,"Loved the colors and the size, however the tension was too tight in top section making the earring tops bow.  Also, one of the earring was missing a fringe. :/"
3.0,"I actually returned these pants.<br />Bought them during Amazon prime day, so they were definitely less expensive than another day.<br />Fit wasn’t right. And they were see thru around the butt area. So not the best quality.<br />Sorry"
3.0,The band itself is fine.  There are two problems.  The tool provided to remove links broke the first time I tried to use it.  I had to take the band to the jewelry store to have links removed.  Other similar bands have adjustments in the clasp for smaller adjustments than the removal of a full link which this band does not.
3.0,Nice but when you wear them you'll never be able to tell what kind of socks they are little bit high price for this
3.0,"I thought these leggings would be cute but they give me a massive cameltoe. Not cute. They also have a weird waist length, they arent so high waisted but they arent low waisted. I prefer my leggings to be highwaisted so I didnt like that. They also feel really compressed on my legs but they arent too small."
3.0,"These are ok, but I've had more comfortable yoga pants before. I think they could use a bit more stretch in the material."
3.0,"I was very disappointed that the Ad is a bit deceptive .  First of all, you do ""NOT"" know what pattern they are shipping & the one they do ship, isn't displayed at all.  So I am now stuck with Two bracelet's that match Noting I owned as was the intended plan.  Also because I picked from Two different color options, Neon & Pastel : They both aren't the same width.  I wanted the double wide but only One is a true 2inch width, the other a double measuring only 1-1/2 width.  I have invested $18 on Two bracelets now do  not serve the purpose for the intended color scheme.  Their colors apparently do not corollate to their stock.  Very Disappointed, other than helping the cause they represent."
3.0,"This high impact sports bra provides good support and is adjustable, however, it is a bear to fasten properly.<br /><br />The small fabric tabs that fit over the top and bottom of the zipper are in the way, when trying to connect and fasten -- especially along the bottom, where the fabric jams into the zipper itself, making it difficult to push and keep out of the way, when attempting to fasten the two ends.<br /><br />Also the zipper pull is attached to the left side of the zipper, instead of to the right side, which is very unusual, and that adds to the struggle.  I suppose it's good if you're left-handed, but it is not the standard, especially in women's wear."
3.0,"I only received 14 out of 15 rings and it was for a mother's day project, I was making with my class."
3.0,"i have purchased 3 jeans, after the first wash you will see a lot of lose threading. 1 star for stitching"
3.0,"Fit's very weird and the length of the shoulder ties is much shorter than expected so the dress cannot be fit the way the picture shows, definitely size up and will probably need to be tailored unless you're the model."
3.0,"This Crndzsis Womens Wool Pashmina Shawl Wrap has fleece-like texture and feels more like synthetic, than wool. I would really like it to be thinner and more cashmere-like, but it is what it is. Because of the thickness I won't be able to use it as a scarf (it'll be too bulky), or hide it in my purse when go out (just in case if it'd be colder, than I expected). It does keep me warm and does not attract hair and other particles in the air or around me.<br />Out of the package the  Shawl has a terrible smell and had to be washed prior wearing."
3.0,Too large pant length and you need to fold little bit. But fits as expected.
3.0,"The earrings were beautiful; however, they were too heavy for me"
3.0,Ordered two pairs. One broke right out of the package. Waiting for the other one to break.
3.0,Beautiful dress cheap material and it runs small.
3.0,Small for size they say they are. Material feels funny
3.0,material is itchy and the gold threading is ugly.
3.0,They work okay. Don’t really think they are worth the money.
3.0,"Ok...if I had to choose between sports bras and “real bras” I would choose sports bras every time. On top of being an overweight woman, my breasts are...they leave a lot to be desired and need an assload of support. Also, most bras put too much pressure on my shoulders so I’ve been struggling to find “the bra.” I decided to order these and overall, they are great. I have two huge gripes about them. 1- the arm holes are too small for the size of the bra. The shoulder part of the hole is great but the part that sits at your armpit SUCKS. Keep in mind, I purchased an XL and the bra fits great everywhere else. 2-if you aren’t as dry as grandmas’ corns on a winter day, you will need an army to get these on.<br /><br />Make an XXL and I will name my second born child after your company."
3.0,I wasnt expecting the material to be see through.  Cant leave  negative but it just wasn't what I needed.
3.0,not a good fit hippy ladies  its tight at the bottom
3.0,Beautiful material but too small. I'm a size 10 and I wish there were size options. It only comes in medium and a large would have been perfect!
3.0,"This is bulky, harsh shiny gold, costume jewelry. Bought for Halloween, still use on occasion for an Halloween decoration; I dangle it outside of a vase, or I've put it on a Halloween wreath one year.<br /><br />Quality is awful - it's going to flake probably with regular use, it's going to probably turn you green.... I wouldn't be surprised if it had broken the first time I wore it. However, with gentle wear I've had it a couple of years now. It's not the most comfortable to wear, kind of digs in, but it looks very cool. : )<br /><br />I wore it as Morticia Addams, and as Cleopatra. I'll don it if I hand out Halloween candy.<br /><br />I didn't spend over $10 on it, and it's definitely worth less than $2. But hey, it's Halloween : )"
3.0,It's pretty but not big enough for my laptop because of zipper.
3.0,"I bought these for my daughter (7yrs old) to use while painting and they are the right size for her hand but poor quality and very thin. The gloves are all stuck in the box together and you have to peel them apart to get a pair of gloves out. We have ripped several gloves just trying to pull them out of the box. They are extremely hard to get on her hands, almost as if they are too tight around the wrist part and a little too big at the fingers. It takes about a minute to get both pairs on her."
3.0,But for a 14 carrot gold chain with with pendant.. I worry that the clasp is not sturdy ennough on either end and.
3.0,I found a white spot on the shirt
3.0,Over time they will fade.
3.0,"Was planning on giving this product a 5 star review, till the bale broke. 😕 very pretty, and for $20 it shouldn't break after 4 days of wearing it. And I lost it."
3.0,The lenses are hard to get clean.  They like to smear easily but getting stuff off is tougher than OEM lenses.
3.0,"I gave it a 3 because of the color! The necklace is really pretty, but not RED..  Its more of a burnt orange color."
3.0,"Super cute and looked the same as pictured. The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because the first time I tried putting them on my daughter and used the tongue at the back of the shoe to pull up to get her foot in, it snapped off and broke."
3.0,I am a size 7 in rings and these were really small. Cute overall.
3.0,"It looked nice, but too big. Couldn't figure out their sizes."
3.0,"Order up one size, these PJ pants run one size small."
3.0,they are nice but kind of odd looking.
3.0,Comfy nightgown but the quality maybe lacking.
3.0,"FIt is somewhat small, but it's cute."
3.0,"The shirt took longer than I expected to receive and it runs very small. It is a pretty shirt, I wish that it fit better."
3.0,"I am tall and thin I ordered the Xl And it fits great. Must be ironed, but cute top."
3.0,"Sizing for the shoe is in correct,  because I purchased a size larger than normal."
3.0,"When I took them out of the box the lense was popped out, snapped back in, but makes me think they’re going to be flimsy. Otherwise they’re nice."
3.0,Fabric poor quality.
3.0,So I’m really disappointed with this shirt. It looks very cheap and runs small. This shirt might be good for a costume but that’s all it’s good for.
3.0,Doesn't really provide any significant relief for carpal tunnel pain
3.0,Order a 2x and it still didn’t fit and I wear a xlg
3.0,Chain was very short
3.0,Sleeve was dirty and I had no choice except to dry clean it because it was needed for a conference
3.0,If you want to wear this you have to have a tiny wrist. It really pretty but small.
3.0,Masks are super thin. Ripped and had holes after only wearing a few times. I hand washed and laid to dry. Wayyyyy too stretchy to stay up.  I wouldn't purchase again.
3.0,I like the style of the bands and they way they feel on my wrist. My only issue is that the description says that it's a 3 piece set and when I got my package I only received the white and pink which sucks because I really wanted the lime green ones.
3.0,"They're very pretty, but there is a crack in the top layer of the one earring. I'm guessing it's resin, but it makes the skull look like it has a black mark over it, and I can feel the crack in it. It came in a thinner padded envelope so I don't know if it happened in transit or what. My daughter likes them, so I didn't return them, and they really are pretty, albeit cracked. It's not enough to annoy an 8 year old. Just her mom..."
3.0,Nice fit but too thin n see thru for me
3.0,"Love the suit, but the bottoms are way way too small."
3.0,"I am 5'7"" and was surprised that these "" Capri"" length leggings were actually normal full length pants. As a taller girl I usually deal with the opposite - things are short, not this time.<br /><br />These are soft but they're not as thick as my other High Days leggings so they didn't have the tummy and booty control I'm used to. These also have a different style pocket. They're very high up on the leg, almost hip height and not as deep as other High Days styles I have. I would not feel comfortable putting my 6"" phone in these pockets because it's not deep enough and too wide at the top.<br /><br />I will say they are very soft and I actually didn't mind that they ended up being full length leggings, but because of the weird pocket and not enough support/tummy control I will be returning these."
3.0,"I'm 6ft4, 235lbs athletic. I wear an XL tee shirt.<br />I ordered the XL, it's a very comfortable sheet top, but not a compression material. Even if I'd ordered the L (size smaller) its just not a compression fit.<br />They are nice tops though,  but that's my 2 cents."
3.0,So it looks cute on but the lace is not gold at all.. the chains are but not the lace... it's more like a green or something but I will make it work with my outfit....
3.0,It arrived with broken top button.
3.0,"I did not like them because I thought that they would be larger. I wanted them to wear as earrings. I should have thought more about the word ""Studs""."
3.0,Fit was great. But it was more white than black.
3.0,A litlle bit large but a good fabric
3.0,"i gave it 3 stars because the earring are gorgeous but not 10-11 mm.... i do recommend these earrings as long as u are aware they are not the size advertised.... i have to think a bit and see if im going to keep them,..."
3.0,The legs came crooked and didn't sit right on the table... so it most definitely didn't sit right on my face.
3.0,I purchase the 6.5mm saying it would be a great chain but the thickness left much to be desired it look like I'm wearing a paper mache chain around my neck and don't look as great as the diamond cut chains. I'm really disappointed. No thickness was listed but based on the price I shouldn't expected more than that. The 4.5mm version thickness complements the width so I will purchase a 22 inch 4.5mm to go with my 20 inch 4.5mm. So now I have two tacky looking 6.5mm that I can't really use for functions on anything and can't get rid of. Since I'm pleased with the 4.5mm and displeased with the 6.5mm and since I can't create separate reviews for both versions. I will give it 3 stars.
3.0,Surprised it is polyester and not cotton or cotton blend knit as it is called a sweatshirt.
3.0,It arrived with part of the dole not completely stitched together. Stylish but kinda cheaply made. Maybe be able to wear it for two summers. I guess not bad for the price.
3.0,I wish it were wider :(
3.0,"I like the look of these sunglasses and the fact that they are very lightweight. They do block out the sun quite nicely as the lenses are very dark and they arrived in a very nice little case. Those are the good points. On the bad side, these are so flimsy! I am afraid to pull on them to open them enough to get them on my face. They are that delicate feeling. They feel a bit cheap. Granted they really don't cost all that much but they feel like they should cost a bit less.<br />So, I like them but I worry they won't last very long. I'll update here if they do break soon."
3.0,"No doubt, ZhiBo Vintage No Face Man Customized T-Shirts for Men looks awesome. But, the fit is somewhat disappointing. I'm 190 lbs., 5'11"", and have an average build, and the large that I purchased fits a bit too small in shirt length and sleeve length. Most annoying, the neck on this thing is HUGE. I like a t-shirt to cover my collar bones and this shirt exposes about half of each collar bone. And if you order from ZhiBo Trade Co., know that the product will ship from China. I placed my order Dec. 7 and didn't receive my shirt until Jan. 9."
3.0,It's very pretty. Just didn't quite meet my expectations for the money. I just returned it.
3.0,good product buy i find a better dress in my country
3.0,Nice product but buyers should be advised to buy several sizes larger than normal as it shrinks with normal washing
3.0,"These overalls are a very cute, surprisingly flattering design. The adjustable buttons/straps are lovely.<br /><br />The main problem however is that the linen is very thin. As in, the sun shines the right direction and everyone is getting a peak at those Wednesday undies.<br /><br />I am a size 14/16 and order an XXL for a loose fit. The fit is as expected, there's plenty of room and they work well with a cute summer wedge. If you're short, these will be very very long.<br /><br />Gave them 3 stars because the construction is okay, but the fabric is too thin for an every day look. These are very cute as a swimsuit cover though!"
3.0,The size was way to big for my daughter. I picked 18m and I got 18-36m.  That’s such a huge size difference.
3.0,Overall the leggings are really good quality and the print is clear but they are really baggy. I ended up having to put extra elastic on the waist band because they kept falling. I’m typically a small and these fit me as if they were a medium.
3.0,"I usually wear my original apple watch and on the third to tightest notch, but these bands is made for bigger wrists. There is no notch tight enough to match up with where I hook the Apple Watch band when I’m using it. Would need at least 2, maybe three additional notches added to these bands to be in the right spot for me."
3.0,I was disappointed that the robe doesn’t have pockets.
3.0,"I really liked the shirt… until I noticed a hole in the arm pit area. Kind of disappointed in the quality. I’m gonna have to sew it, but luckily it’s small."
3.0,"This fits fairly well and the quality is decent. The band is a little bit tight, but I expect that it will stretch over time. The tips of the two underwires painfully dig into my sternum and have left mark on my skin, but considering its so hard to find in expensive bras in this size, I'm willing to deal with that."
3.0,"I like this product, except the adhesive is not strong enough. The slighted brush takes the crystal off. I had to use body adhesive to keep it on."
3.0,"The sleeves on this top were shorter in me than the model. They look more like a 3/4 sleeve.  The top is flowy and does not look as tailored as the model.  The shirt still was nice and I will continue wearing, but it is not as pictured."
3.0,"I like the size, but wish the post was centered in the back so the earring didn't hang below the ear"
3.0,"you get what you pay for. cheap material. cheap chain, and doesnt have pockets. other than that, theyre still a good pair of pants"
3.0,These are not good running socks. They have seams which cause blisters and the are kinda big for a size 7 .
3.0,pockets  too small
3.0,FITS SMALL
3.0,I order small but look like a Medium
3.0,"Super cute, quality material. Size chart is misleading. Going to have to return. Not a good choice for girls with big bootys."
3.0,"I got a good deal on this purse and I am pleased with the color. The opening is fairly small for a purse that can hold so much. I usually like bigger bags even though it can sometimes mean more time spent rummaging for items if you have a lot in your bag, but this bag really doesn't give you enough space to really open the bag and see what you're digging for. Its more like reach in and feel around and hope for the best, but this could just be a personal preferrance. Also, I have had it for a couple months now and it still has this funky smell that it came with even though I wiped it down with some eucalyptus and lemon oil to try to neutralize ."
3.0,"Bought for husband, who didn't like the contrast. The web part was wider than expected."
3.0,these are adorable and they are a little small than my ear which are at 00G
3.0,"I got the green shorts set - Waistband is scrunch elastic so thats a bit uncomfortable but I got used to it. The material is soft and you can wear it without a bra without showing through, and the fabric keeps you cool even under blankets.....but IT WILL STAIN YOUR SHEETS. I never noticed because i own dark sheets but my they left a green stain on my friend’s WHITE sheets. Super...."
3.0,"This MoFiz polo shirt is really pretty good. The material is well made and soft cotton with an stretchy, spandex blend so it'll hug you without preventing free range of motion. The collar was good and soft without any rigidity. And all that would be good...except.<br /><br />I got size XL because I'm not a slim and trim young guy any more. The cut is not a ""classic cut"" but rather a ""slim"" cut and if you have a few extra pounds, this will unfortunately not be for you!<br /><br />So, nice shirt, nice materials...as long as you are slim!"
3.0,"I use this daily for keys to doors. It's attractive, light weight and the magnetic clasp works very well.  But, I've only had it a month and there are thin metal-like strands coming loose and scratching my neck, making it too uncomfortable to wear if I do not have a collar on my shirt that prevents it from touching my skin."
3.0,too small had to modify
3.0,These run very small. The material was okay but the line that’s supposed to be under your bum only hit above the back of my knee.
3.0,El material no Gusta
3.0,Fits too tight. Too small as compared to other Muisol dresses. I have plenty!
3.0,Cute but bigger than expected
3.0,It's kind of a weird material and gets stretched out really easily. It looks ok if you like a baggier look. I got a medium and it almost covers my butt so it would be cute with leggings or tucked into jeans like in the pic.
3.0,"Ok, I'm a guy (6ft) who wanted to rock this thing so I ordered the XL size hoping it would fit like a Mens medium. Nope, it's way too small. I'll actually tear it open if i put it on all the way. Otherwise the thing is well made, super soft and looks great."
3.0,Tight in the arms so its uncomfortable to wear but it looks great lol
3.0,"Super cute swimsuit, but fit is weird. I am about 5'3&#34;, 120 lbs, 32D (although I'm probably more a 30DD), 25&#34; waist, 35&#34; hips, and ordered a size small. The bottoms fit *slightly* loose, but its okay, and as other reviewers have said it is quite cheeky. I would probably be keeping the bikini if the bottoms were the only issue. For me, the main problem I had was with the top. The cups are quite small and do not fit my breasts. They are also awkwardly far apart (although I suppose this is the way its supposed to look?) and so my breast tissue is being squished beneath the underwire. Also, the top/band is too wide for my rib cage so there is wrinkling in the black part that does not look good. Additionally, the straps are much too long for me, even when I pull it as tight as I can. Overall, I am rather disappointed because aside from the fit, the suit is really pretty. I think that perhaps if someone was taller than I was, and had a wider body and smaller breasts (or doesn't mind their boobs being crushed by the underwire? I noticed that in the model picture the breasts are not contained within the cups either) it would fit much better.<br />I will be returning these. On a side note, the delivery was fast, and I received exactly the product pictured in the 3rd photo."
3.0,This is really beautiful but it runs small
3.0,These are tiny...
3.0,"Paper thin , not what I expected. Elastic waist wide leg . Think they are good for a hot day yet not clingy . Worth $ 9.99 not more"
3.0,"Earrings were broken when they arrived, but I simply glued the &#34;flags&#34; back into the earrings with super glue.  They are cute earrings, but very small, you have to really look to see what they are..."
3.0,Was a great hydration pack at first then after the first try the bladder where you screw the drinking tube started to leak. I didnt tighten it super tight and i didnt keep it loose or anything. For some reason it just started to leak. I put a different bladder in it now and its fine.
3.0,Cute! Runs small. I cut the lining out and that helped...
3.0,The sizing seemed a little off.  Shirts were short and ran small.  The pants ran small also but the were a ‘tad’ long.
3.0,T is nice quality but XL fits nice on my chest but I'm not fat and the is too much fabric in the waist not cut for someone in shape. Will be returning.☹
3.0,"Just ok.... cute design but the material is a lil on the thick side, it doesn’t breath well while riding. I Have purchased other fox jerseys which have been great so this 1 surprised me as to how the material was a lil different."
3.0,This is ok but needs an extender chain in the waist area if you're not a size 12. But unlike other designs this is far more forgiving for different body sizes and shapes. Still obviously designed for the extremely petite though. The mannequins in the picture must be the size of a 9-year-old.
3.0,On the bigger side. Also really long almost to be a short dress.
3.0,"Liked them, but already have a run in the front after 2 wears."
3.0,"Very pretty, but too large and heavy for me. Thought the would be just like the gold ones but silver is much latger"
3.0,"I loved the look of this top. It was very flattering on me and fit great, however, the sequins scratched underneath my arms so bad just when trying it on that I knew I could never wear it for a whole evening."
3.0,"This yellow is much brighter than I expected. I have this dress in other colors but they fit small. I got this one in a 2x to accommodate my boobies, and the fit is to big. Arrrrgh🤷🏽‍♀️"
3.0,"I used this to try to clean an older pair of NMDs; it might have been the material of the shoes, but crep was not sufficient to clean all the grime off of my shoes and make them white again. I would use this product for more regular cleaning, but not if you are hoping to make old shoes look good as new. Will use this as a regular cleaner for new shoes that I buy in future."
3.0,The empire waistline and lack of shape in this dress makes you look a lot heavier than you are. Also the pockets make your hips look huge. BUT.... super comfy and will be wearing it again.
3.0,"After one wash, Pom poms falling off and neckline fraying. Intended for photos and will not wear again."
3.0,I ordered large/ xlg and waist is way to big I should’ve ordered m/lg
3.0,Fits my son fine... I ordered a size up because he’s between sizes.  Material is very thin.  Soft on the outside.  It already tore in the crotch after wearing twice.
3.0,"Amazon Aware's T-shirt is a nice comfortable fabric, with a twine rather than plastic cord for the insert card.  Unfortunately it's only 28"" long even before washing, which is about 1-3"" shorter than other normal length t-shirts, and a full 6"" shorter than longs.  This is going to create problems for a lot of people unless you want to show midriff, along with not being able to tuck this into pants without it coming out.  As such, it's 3 stars."
3.0,The pictures don’t show the lines that go down the chest Area. It’s cute but not what i thought it would be.
3.0,"The material is nice, but the stitching has not held up as well as less expensive brands."
3.0,They look great But they fall  Apart while my girlfriend was wearing them
3.0,Ordered a size up and it was still too snug.
3.0,Good for very light rain. It is water resistant not waterproof.
3.0,"This shirt is super soft and comfortable, however it sheds horribly! Even after several washes, it leaves black fuzz everywhere I go."
3.0,"This has a great, soft material. Perfect for a dressing gown.  I agree with other reviewers that there needs to be internal ties to hold it closed. It is so silky that it slips right open.  If you're handy with a needle and thread you can create one pretty quick, but obviously it would be preferrable not to have to jury-rig your purchases. Great material, not a thoughtful design."
3.0,Kind of flimsy but it will hold two hats.
3.0,Great shades and I purchased the set of 3 a total of 4 times.  My only issue is that they are not durable. The arms of the shades break very easy and this is every single time. I just wish they were made of a more durable material
3.0,Too long I am 5’4 150lbs and I ordered a large. It was too big. I had to take it to the semtrist.
3.0,shirt is adorable but the pants looks cheap
3.0,It’s beautiful but it want stay set so it keeps falling out of my ear it would b perfect if it would stay shut
3.0,It is pretty and nice fabric.  Like the other reviews I found it cut very small and much shorter than it looked like in the pictures. The gown should have been loose and it was skin tight. Robe was equally small.
3.0,The material is good but runs small.
3.0,"This shirt does not have a fabric tag to identify the material. It is thin, stretchy, and feels like a synthetic fiber of low quality. There are no facings or interfacings. The picture of this shirt is better than real life. It is a beautiful shirt, except it will not give you the appearance as the picture implies.<br />This shirt needs the support of facing around the neckline. I can only recommend this as a very casual shirt that you might wear a few times."
3.0,Not really comfortable to wear but it looked stunning.
3.0,Cute but cloudy stones
3.0,The hat is a smooth polyester blend not knit
3.0,good for occasional use. Looks good with wings being the holder of the stud.
3.0,"This was a beautiful, love the color, however, it came crushed and I couldn't restore its shape."
3.0,"They are ok. Kind of thin and too loose in the waist. They seem to stretch out a bit as I wear them. I generally just use them to sleep in because they are soft and fairly comfortable, but I don’t use them outside of the house."
3.0,"Size is bigger than expected, kinda loose. But it does keep warm."
3.0,For a small gitl its fit perfet. But a healthier female it doesnt.
3.0,"Liked the color, the fit."
3.0,A little tight on the waist line kind of thin material some of the superhero faces are in a inappropriate area LOL which makes for some funny comments from my wife
3.0,"So soft and warm, but runs a little small. I wish I would have went up one size. If I were to buy again, that's what I would do. FYI...that's what you should do."
3.0,"These really do run small. I thought I'd heeded the warnings and ordered several sizes up, but they're still constricting around the waist. The thing is, I think if I'd ordered ANOTHER size up they'd be too baggy in the legs. Overall I think that these pants just don't work with the shape of my body. Might be better for folks who are very thin and not so curvy."
3.0,"Used for a 12 year old's stage performance, I chastised my wife for spending soo much."
3.0,Did not fit the way I thought it would. Looked different on tan it looked in the picture
3.0,If you have any type of tummy these are not flattering
3.0,"I was disappointed in the quality, but like so many have said on Amazon reviews- ""You get what you pay for."" These furry wrist cuffs are of average quality, more suitable for a young person who might lose them or get them dirty (although I have no idea if these can be laundered). I'll return them and pay out  a little more for two nicer pairs rather than make do with these four that I'd be reluctant to wear."
3.0,"Very cheap and thin material but my teenager liked it enough to keep. May only last a season, but good enough for the price."
3.0,Dont buy if you have the smallest watch. It ways it will fit but it doesn’t.
3.0,These pants are ok thought they would have more compression
3.0,I'll have to order another band this one is so short I can't even poke another hole
3.0,It runs smaller than what it says.
3.0,Does not look like the picture. Was to small...
3.0,Cute but not comfortable. The sequins sit in an awkward position. I'll figure it out.
3.0,"My girlfriend reports some coldness in her hands in a moderately cold (15 degrees) temp while shoveling the drive, I don't recommend these for very cold use"
3.0,"I was thinking &#34;this probably won't suit me but I'll try it out&#34;...if that's you too, maybe keep looking.  The bottom half is quite big and the extra layer of skirt is a bit odd."
3.0,Not enough glue at the top to keep them from rolling down.
3.0,Ok too big and long
3.0,The leather is beautifully made and nice and thick. The contrasting stitching just looks great and the black edges are sharp. However the big stainless buckle that came with it is ridiculously wide and sticks out. I actually changed that with another buckle from another watch band which is much smaller and works much better. I put this on a Galaxy Gear S2 Classic and it just looks fantastic. I do wish it had a quick release lever on the back of each band like most of the new Smartwatch bands. I had to buy a spring bar tool for watch bands to get these things on and off. And that also means you can't change bands quickly so you're probably just going to leave one band on the whole time which is too bad.
3.0,"I generally wear 2x and the XL fits great very generously sized. Flowy, lightweight and perfect to pair with leggings. The only con gets super wrinkled very quickly."
3.0,Trying something new.
3.0,"It looks nice in. the picture but the material doesn't feel nice, it is a little scratchy , not really comfortable. Dress is also a little short for a long dress for a 5'5 tall woman. I wish it were a tad bit longer. I wouldn't buy again."
3.0,Relatively Big hips big legs still too big.... go at least a size smaller than the measurements
3.0,Perfect for the little one.
3.0,Band is too tight and leaves a mark on forehead. I bought this to sleep in but it's uncomfortably tight.
3.0,"Way too big for my boy, it’s only for man not for toddlers. I am going to return."
3.0,Do not buy this for more than 20 dollars.....
3.0,Very small. Just the size I wanted. The quality is iffy. I don't know how long it will hold up. The good thing is I don't take it off very often.
3.0,The dress fit well. But the material is way too thin. I probably could wear it to the beach or poolside party. But anywhere else.... Nah
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:5efdd345c3d54196f03420008b02f4b4]] Pretty colors and patterns.<br />I was hoping I could use these for a full wrap headband style but they just are not big enough.<br />You could tie them around a ponytail. You could wrap them around your messy bun, but that’s about it due to the size.<br />Could potentially work for a kids head, but definitely not an adults head.<br />At a six dollar price point, you get that in quality."
3.0,"This won't last forever (quality is low) but while it does, it is great for dancing. I buy these instead of bras for dancing."
3.0,"While we like these masks for their comfort and lightweight feel, after just a month the wire from the nose lip is poking through on 2 of the 3 masks.  We sewed one and tried to glue the other, but now both are very uncomfortable at the repair point."
3.0,"I've purchased a few of these shirts, and found that this cut did not fall as nicely as the others. While I'll still wear it as loungewear, it wouldn't be my first pick to wear as a swimsuit cover up since it is much shorter than the other shirts Oryer makes."
3.0,A lot smaller than anticipated. I ended up giving this to a granddaughter.
3.0,A little too bunchy in the bust but I am going to keep it for casual wear.
3.0,Product did not fit the Samsung Gear Sport watch. It was too small. Would not stay on the watch. Returned.
3.0,The top was not made for any type of chest past c cup.
3.0,"I was expecting a much nicer tote. It is not very attractive so I don't know how it can be considered a designer bag.The nylon is kind of cheap and reminds me of dollar store knock off bag. It does not stand up on its own. It is much bigger than I thought for a crossover. The only thing going for it is that is looks waterproof, but I have not used it so I don't know yet. I am considering sending it back since there is a 100% guarantee.<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G3IVWKY/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0"
3.0,So I was really excited for this dress but I guess I should've read the description more closely to see the material is that spandex type that doesn't sit on your body nicely at all. I followed the chart and it was too loose on my bust and waist. Not a bad dress. Just not what I wanted.
3.0,The ear loops stretch too much and mask becomes too loose. Won’t buy masks without adjustable loops again.
3.0,Smaller than I would have hoped. They feel very cheap.
3.0,It wasn't cloth so it was different but it still work and still comfy just not what I was looking for exactly and it wasn't in the description
3.0,"The picture is very deceiving as the material is very thin and an odd gold shade. I tried it on because I thought it might be better on...nope. The fabric has little give; the cut of the top is not flattering and while I expected a skimpy skirt, this one is pretty much non existent- no matter what I tired I could not cover front and back. Definitely returning."
3.0,Ordered as a formal mothers dress for a wedding. Cute but I think it makes a better prom dress or bridesmaid dress. It also wrinkles very easily.
3.0,Too small...I have a big head and the frames are too small. returned.
3.0,"I am 5'6 and weigh about 205 lb. My body is apple shaped.  I ordered a 3xl tall based on the size cart.  The pants were super long until I washed them.  Now they are the perfect length.  They fit perfectly in the thighs and butt, however, the waist is super loose and the pants fall down.  If I had ordered a smaller size, they would have looked painted on.  Also, be aware that these are boot cut with a flare at the bottom.  The description does not mention it and I thought I was purchasing straight leg based on the picture."
3.0,I bought this coat 2 sizes larger because I read it ran small. But I still can't button it. You have to have the chest of a boy. Nice coat otherwise.
3.0,Way too big but what angers me most is quality of product. Buttons falling off left and right. Really?  Poor quality.
3.0,Didn't work as well as I thought it would. It did a great job of getting dirt off but wouldn't take stains away.
3.0,"I think i would have really liked these but they were too big. I generally wear a med or large in yoga pants because my thighs & butt are disproportionately bigger than the rest of my body. The quarantine 15 kicked in, so i have a bit of a tummy now, too. Even with all that, these were super big on me."
3.0,For me these were too thick and heavy and hard to breathe through you'll definitely want to use a 3D bracket underneath to keep it off of your mouth
3.0,"Shoe fit per sizing chart and my loved wearing them. However, the imitation leather started peeling off the toes within 2 days of wearing. My son has worn these for about 4 months and there are holes beginning to form in the toes. All in all,I am pleased with the shoe functionality, but am disappointed with the durability."
3.0,"The neck isn’t as wide as they make it seem in the pictures and the shirt fabric is quite thin, you can see through it a bit.<br />If you want this oversized then size up."
3.0,Cute but too loose. They will fall off my head if I shake my head.  Also not good for actually protecting your eyes from the sunlight.  Just for fashion...
3.0,it worn out pretty keep
3.0,"They fit comfortably but are a little big in the legs.  Overall, I think they are fine."
3.0,"A little flimsy,  but it is ok for the price...Love the color.."
3.0,I was disappointed when the shirt wasn’t as faded or distressed as the photo made it out to be. I will say it doesn’t shrink after washing or drying and is very comfortable. Still cute though. I normally do a XL for extra room in shirts but I could’ve sized down with this one too.
3.0,"Super cute but way too big. I bought the 6-12 month size, my daughter is 7 months, but there is probably an extra inch of extra room."
3.0,Smaller than expected. Thin material. The white is pretty see through. Smaller at waist
3.0,"Not as I expected, it's very thin material.."
3.0,really cute. not for workouts. size up if you have a butt.
3.0,"Bought this umbrella especially for the jelly handle.  Makes holding the umbrella much easier when it's windy and cold and your hands become stiff.  This is my 2nd one from them ... my first one rusted after 2 times of use, but I think it was a defective one.  I contacted shedrain, and they replaced it with my current one, and so far after 6 months, no rust.  The umbrella coverage is a little small, but fits easily in a purse without take up much space."
3.0,"The fit is great, cute dress, but the blue is not at all what is pictured. What I received was teal, not blue."
3.0,"I had a similar pair that cost the same that dod not feel as cheap as these, but they are decent.  Worth the price, but don't expect much more for your money. If you just need a cheap pair of sunglasses,  I recommend these any day."
3.0,Nice suit just ran to small
3.0,Mine was tighter than I liked. Strings were hanging like someone just finished sowing it and threw it in a bag. Design was a little off compared to the picture. 5’5 and 140 lbs. bought a medium. Was tight. Similar sized people should buy a large if you want the baggy look like in the photo.
3.0,It was very see-thru.
3.0,Fit as expected but the back of the pants (the butt area) is starting to flake (?) and I've only worn them a few times to the gym.
3.0,Not great for holding a ton of credit cards etc.  Plus cash - very small pockets.  Beautiful design.
3.0,"This is a 'body-con' outfit.<br />Do not order if you have anything to hide.<br />Seriously, I'm thinking one day I will loose enough weight to wear it under a dressy duster jacket?<br />I live on an island, so returns are hard.<br />In the meantime, it goes into my 'waiting' bin😁"
3.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and 180 lbs with a 40DD chest. The dress fit just right, but no room for shrinking, etc. The wastline is just under my breasts, so it is borderline somewhat small. I will put a sweater over it to mask the waistline. It is very comfy, which is a plus, but it is very long and I will need to hem and/or cut it to be able to wear."
3.0,nice colour but very large.
3.0,keeps slipping out and falling off.
3.0,Great looks and fit but starting to peel too soon.
3.0,The top part of Sandles wire off in two wears. Very Cheaply made
3.0,The description stated there would be a sweatband in the caps but not one cap has a sweatband and the caps are too big on my small head.
3.0,Nice band but the tool that came with it broke. Once I replaced the tool it was easy to fit the band to the correct size.
3.0,It’s a gorgeous band and cover. The only down fall is that the cover falls off ALOT! I lose it a work at least once a week.
3.0,For the price it is ok but I di not like it.  It is a little too small and I expected something else.
3.0,"Fits great but very thin, see through."
3.0,"The material seems cheap and flimsy. Not sure if its a short dress or long blouse. Bought for work, it does not work."
3.0,"Nice classic coat, However, I purshased a Large, after reading reviews. My size is med. Large in any style is too big, not in this coat. It would be considered a small in The USA. I have to order an XL. NO WAY.... I'M a PETITE person...Everything that comes out of CHINA IS SMALL. DON'T ORDER ANYTHING THAT IS MADE IN CHINA, it's a waste of my time to have to return it!!"
3.0,The tutu part of the swimsuit was torn n was already sticking out.. but otherwise a nice swimsuit..
3.0,It broke after two days and I ended up having to buy another one<br />I really wouldn’t recommend this for a small child who would constantly play with it it’s not very durable
3.0,Not what I expected. Purchased for my 16 year old sister and it was too small for her. Quality was decent for the price I paid.
3.0,Not worth the wait but cute.
3.0,"It looks really cute. Just the material it is made out of is cheap and the glass material too. I always get this copper metal smell each time I wear them. The design is nice but it feels like it will bend or break anytime. You get what you pay for, so it's ok for it's price."
3.0,Loved the look on the model but you have to be careful if you're working with a lot of junk in the trunk. Despite it being stretchy the pockets bulge out. Maybe a bigger size would have helped but the crotch was already so saggy I didn't want to go any bigger.
3.0,"Cute dress but too tight across the chest.  It’s straight cut with no give.  The ladies do not fit well up top, maybe perfect for longer leaner gal."
3.0,"They do keep your glasses from falling/sliding off your face. However, the rubber kept getting caught in my hair or pulled on my hair. Now that mask wearing is mandatory,  these silicone anti-slip pieces are super difficult and uncomfortable to wear. Best worn by an individual with very short hair."
3.0,"The dress is quite pretty and I received several compliments.  However, it runs very small.  I normally wear a 14, but the 2XL was still a bit tight.  It is rather low cut if you have a larger chest, you may want to consider a lace insert for modesty.  It is also a very sheer material. You will certainly need a slip or a shell under the dress.<br /><br />Again, though, it is a beautiful print and design!"
3.0,"Alot smaller than I thought it would be. It works as a nice car umbrella as it fits in a small place but not as big as to cover more than one person realistically as some others have stated. It does the job though as an umbrella, kept the rain off and no drips come through."
3.0,Not stretchy like most nitrile gloves.
3.0,"Love the size of padding, but it's not very thick"
3.0,"Bought as gift, the strap looks nice and seems to be made well."
3.0,"Great material, but the shoulder straps are too narrow to wear in the gyms"
3.0,"Fit is fine and the color is perfect, but they are very cheaply made and one of the seams ripped when I was putting them on.  That wasn’t because they are too tight. It’s because they are cheaply made."
3.0,great summer wear
3.0,I ordered 2 pair one showed up right away the other took 3 weeks.<br />The wood is smooth the design is excellent<br />But it gets 3 stars because the sizing is way off<br /><br />I have a 0g which is 8mm<br />But what was tagged as a 8mm was a 10mm<br /><br />And my friends pair was supposed to be a 14mm<br />But they were so tiny and way off on size<br /><br />Making sure the gauge size is 100% accurate is very important.
3.0,Not a bad looking watch and lasted awhile. The band broke on me the other day out of nowhere. I was making a gesture when it fell off my wrist and upon inspection a link in the band had split.
3.0,Too Small pockets
3.0,"This is not a good idea for tall<br />Gals... unless the high cut, low scoop thing (that was not really meant to be high cut and low scoop) is your thing."
3.0,Not as comfortable as expected
3.0,I bought an XL and it fits like an L.  I'll probably try an XXL and see if it fits like an XL.
3.0,"I ordered the large, it was too small and I am usually a medium in most dresses. The material was itchy and I didn't end up wearing this dress. It's just sitting in my closet."
3.0,"the first day i wore this shirt it had a funny smell, like chemicals from the screen print, i went climbing that day and most of beethovens forehead got rubbed off from my rope, i guess this shirt was not made for vigorous outdoor activities"
3.0,"Fits bigger than expected. I have a large chest and small everywhere else, this is still too big. material is nice tho."
3.0,"had to send it back, one side would not stay attached to watch. if both sides worked, it would have been great."
3.0,My first pair of Levi's jeans that wore holes in them through normal use. I hadn't purchased new jeans in a few years when I saw these. I like the style and color but was surprised to see two holes. This hasn't happened to me before without some obvious cause i.e. caught on a fence or a fall onto asphalt.
3.0,Beautiful material but too small
3.0,Fits loose would not use for much else then beach/pool cover up.
3.0,"The watch is great, but I ordered a women's watch and received a man's watch which is way to big for my mom .  Tried to return it but found out they don't have smaller ones for women."
3.0,The dress was not made for size o - 6 months it was way to small . i must say it is a very pretty dress.
3.0,Used for a trip
3.0,"This purses design is so cute. Which is why I bought it. However, its a bit smaller than I wanted, its too tall and not wide enough. So it falls over because the fabric isn't stiff enough. The whole reason I use doctors bags is so they are sturdy and don't fall over. The clasp was kinda hard to open and close at first too. But its a good enough purse so I'll continue to use it."
3.0,Definitely not Patagonia!  Good value for price.
3.0,Great but the battery life could be long and sound a little louder
3.0,"I loved the style on the picture but when I got it, it looks like I'm wearing a robe or maybe I have to be skinny in order for it to have that same look on the picture..lol. So I returned it. The material though feels really nice and silky not those cheap thin satin material."
3.0,Made for a baby
3.0,"It's warm and comfortable. Problems include the zipper pull is on the left side, which feels odd, and the cuff seam doesn't fully close."
3.0,I was thinking this would be like a sweatpant material but it is more like a t-shirt. Not great for our cold climate but we will see how my boyfriend likes it after Christmas and update then!
3.0,"Personally, I did not care for the fabric of this dress. I like the design, but the fabric is very cheap looking... reminds me of something from a very cheap store that you see in shopping centers, if you can guess what I mean.;-)"
3.0,"This came as described, but the cut wasn't what I was expecting. It's not the seller's fault it wasn't flattering on me.  I have a very rectangle shape and this has almost no structure around the waist."
3.0,"This is a fairly standard flex bracelet for watches, in a size that's generally for women's watches. I got it to use with a Xiaomi Mi Band 6, and a frame/bezel for the Mi Band 6 that came with another metal bracelet.<br /><br />What sets the bracelet apart from other flex bands, and not in a good way, is how hard it was to adjust. It was finicky removing links, and I ended up having to bend the metal in places you normally don't have to.<br /><br />In addition, the printed lettering does the looks of the bracelet no favour. For my part, I always intended to brush the metal anyway. For anyone else who wants to keep it glossy, but to remove the print, some acetone will do the trick.<br /><br />Lastly, like most cheap flex bracelets, this one has a tendency to grab some arm hairs.<br /><br />Value-wise, I'd say it's on the ok side, if you like the looks. Just be aware that it feels cheap and may be hard to adjust the length of."
3.0,"Very cute, but very thick. I wanted this for my graduation ceremony but I couldn’t wear it. It was too hard to breathe out of"
3.0,"The design is certainly out of this world, but I'm not sure on what planet it makes sense to make a band that is meant to last a few weeks for a device that is meant to last a few years. The edges started wearing off to white after a few days. The feeling is rubbery, too, if that bugs you. Otherwise fits fitbit 1 fine. I wish there were replacement bands that were more expensive but would last."
3.0,"They look great. Though when I was putting them on for the first time, one of the belt loops popped off and is now useless. Might be able to fix it. It fit fine, just feels a bit off in the crotch. Still wearable though."
3.0,As exp
3.0,This is not a breastfeeding sports bra. Doesn’t have the clips that bf bras have. It’s just the regular removable bra strap with the hook. Not convenient and hard to remove. I’m a 36C currently breastfeeding. It fit just ok. I prefer full coverage. That’s just my personal preference for sports bras. I’ll wear around the house but not for outdoor workouts or gym. Cute colors and design. But this is NOT your breastfeeding sports bra. If you’re not breastfeeding then it’s a decent sports bra for the price
3.0,"It was ordered in November and didn't arrive till January. It has a really funny odor and I haven't been able to wash it out. It's cute, but not worth it."
3.0,Good gift for a child
3.0,I really liked this at first but the clasp fell off after about 6 wears.
3.0,"This is a cute shirt, but the thread on my sleeves is coming loose after one wash.  I usually wear a large shirt and ordered a large and it's very loose and long enough to cover my butt. I would have ordered a medium, but I can deal with the looser look."
3.0,"Loved the pattern and color of this dress but didn't really love the fit. The dress wasn't as flowy as I was expecting. Wasn't terrible but I didn't love it. Also, I think the pockets took away from the intended look of the dress and added additional bulk in the hip area which wasn't too complimentary. Purchased for a wedding but most likely sending it back."
3.0,The US sizing of a 8-10 was closer to a 14 in my opinion. Other than that it appears to be a good suit that's really cute
3.0,Cute but are covered in little swastikas:(
3.0,"Cute, but the quality could be better."
3.0,Product excellent because of UA brand.  Company packaged the product horribly.  Also this item was purchased from Marshalls and marked up tremendously.  Very disappointed.
3.0,"This dress is gorgeous! It fits nicely at the hip and perfect at the bust but the waist is really really tight! Luckily I have a seamstress who let out a little, but we’ll still need to fix it.<br /><br />I ordered a size XL- 5’5, 204 lbs, 38B if this helps anyone."
3.0,"Nice, but its very light weight, chain broke right after the 30 days!"
3.0,Just ok. Exactly what you would expect for getting a pair of earrings for nothing more than the price of over inflated shipping cost. One earring shines beautifully while the other is rather dull. I do love the setting in sterling silver as they do not irritate my ears. I also love the screw back option that is quite a plus ! I am not sorry I purchased them.
3.0,You have to fold the money too many times.<br />The money inside makes it hard to deposit another bill.
3.0,runs a bit small but not terribly smaller than my regular size. . package came from China. material is thin. nowhere near the quality I was shown. stretchy but just not not enough to make up the difference between sizes.
3.0,"This shirt is not as wonderful as I had hoped. I wear about a size 2-4 top - sometimes small, sometimes medium. For reference - I 'm 5'2"" - 123lbs, 32DD/34D bra. I got this in a small, and glad I did!<br /><br />The fit is a bit odd - it's baggy in the body area, hangs loose off the shoulders (just as shown), the sleeves are too short to be full length and too long to be 3/4. Maybe I just have long arms, but it's nothing like the model. I end up pushing them up to make it look okay. The length of the shirt itself I actually like. The cuffs on the sleeves is much thicker than shown on the model.<br /><br />The material is soft and washes up fine. it's more lightweight and would be okay in cool weather, but not cold weather. I do like the maroon color."
3.0,I received the pearl cages and one doesn't close right. How do I return the one pearl cage for a new one?
3.0,Great for Yoga
