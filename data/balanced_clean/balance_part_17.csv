5.0,Comfy cute and definitely goes along with the Nile Queen costume! Must add to complete the look.
5.0,"Bottoms fit great, everything is really adjustable! The bows on the top are pretty fragile, one popped off when I took it out of the bag but I can easily sew it back. Also, the cups on the bra are half cups so they won’t fully cover your boob. I wear a D cup so maybe it was that though. Other than that it fits well and was even a bit big in the strap that goes around your chest. My top is 32 inches so it was probably 33 or 34 inches around."
5.0,Love this jacket. Keeps me so warm and looks great too!
5.0,Perfect! Fast shipping!
5.0,These are so cute! I have larger calves and these fit great. Love them!
5.0,"This dress is perfect for just about any occasion. The vintage style is timeless. The bow adds class and the peplum can hide your trouble spots. The fabric is a midweight stretch knit. The zipper is very thin and hard to grip. You may want to unzip the dress enough to pull over your head. The fit is true to size. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. The medium fit me perfectly.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
5.0,Love the fabric love the print design. My daughter enjoys wearing them.
5.0,This fits great and keeps my face shielded from the sun!!
5.0,"These glasses came with extra surprises. Included with the glasses are a case, cleaning cloth and key chain. The glasses are great looking. Definitely would recommend."
5.0,"This is a very nice ring, true to the image. Very pleased!!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:268f3c59c99b90c7489b4a3328c83056]] My son is 15 and based on reviews we ordered up some sizes just to be safe. He’s about 5’11, tall and slender but we got him an “xxl” in case it ran small. He is so happy with his costume. It came with all the accessories and the cape is actually really good quality especially for a costume. It doesn’t look cheaply made or like some of the cheesy costumes you get from party city or spirit Halloween. And it’s better priced compared to those stores too. Worth the purchase and came very fast."
5.0,"So happy with my purchase! Since others recommended ordering a size up. That's exactly what I did!<br /><br />My dad usually wears a size medium in men's for t shirts. So I ordered a size large for him. The shoulders were just right and it fit him perfectly like his regular other medium t shirts.<br /><br />The fabric was soft and stretchy so we were happy about that. The design in the front was printed and looked like it was good quality, there were no signs of it ripping off or peeling. It looked pretty safe. I feel like it looked great on my dad and he likes it a lot too. Sadly when we got this, July 4th passed and we couldn't make it in time for him to wear it during that day. However, he could wear it anyday and next July 4th as well!<br /><br />(For sizing reference, my dad usually wears a t shirt size medium, he's around 5'9-5'10 tall and around 146lbs. )<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product free for evaluation in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

5.0,Bought for my 5 year old who loves Minecraft. True to size. Has piled some but not like other cheap pjs I’ve bought in the past.
5.0,Haven't worn it yet but this is a very pretty shirt. When I wear it I will follow up with a picture. The colors of the flowers allow many color options. I love the bottom back being a little longer than the front. Peplum tops look great on any body. Love the print and quality seems good too.
5.0,"Perfect match to my Italian Leather sofa and ottoman.  Covered the scuffs, scratches and worn areas wonderfully.  Looks like new."
5.0,The band fits perfectly and feels of great quality. This should be what the original band was. This feels much better on the wrist also.
5.0,"I bought this for my mother to watch the Alabama championship game in.  It worked out perfectly - we live in California, a LONG way from her home state of Alabama!!"
5.0,I bought this for a friend and it was really nice look exactly like the photo extremely happy
5.0,My husband received these for Christmas. He loved them. Just as shown in the picture. Great gift for new dads or long time dads.
5.0,"This dress is very cute. IT fits well and even wore it to my best friends wedding. She let me pick out anything I wanted to wear since i was matron of honor and this dress was perfect and so elegant looking. Wish it was not hand washed though, but think it will be fine to wash in delicate cycle."
5.0,"Can't say enough from ordering, receiving, quality and value!"
5.0,They are made of fleece material. Very well made.
5.0,Great watchband. Very pretty & can adjust to your size
5.0,"Perfect for my glasses.  Plenty of room, could easily fit 6 pair"
5.0,I like them a lot. You can read the writing and they fit and it seems like good material. God Bless
5.0,"Made very well! Heavy! Not cheap!!<br />Holds a few grams of ashes, which is plenty. Comes with great tiny tools for ease in preparation. Love! Super for remembering anyone who might love the beach or turtles. Nice Packaging. Would recommend."
5.0,Great quality hoodie. I do think it runs a bit large.
5.0,Perfect fit.  Was a little hesitant when ordering.  They wash and wear well.
5.0,"It holds the necessities, such as gum, compact powder, chap stick, money, and phone. Actually has more room than I thought it would. I was surprised at the quality of this purse because the price was so cheap; it doesn't feel like my MK, but still high quality!"
5.0,Very soft and gentle cotton. Sweet piece. Lovely sleeves. Would recommend to everyone.
5.0,This fit very comfortably. It can be dressed up or down. I wore it for a birthday party. The material is comfortable and sturdy. It has a little stretch to it. It was a little longer than it looks in the picture and I was okay with that. The belt that came with it tied very well to but I chose to use a belt that I purchased from Amazon as well. I was comfortable all night long and I am going to purchase a couple of the other colors.
5.0,Good sandal but a little smaller than expected
5.0,Serve their purpose. Good value.
5.0,so adorable and sparkley
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous! I have a wide rib cage which makes the top few buttons pull apart a little, but I just pinned it and it’s perfect. The top of the dress is a little thicker because they have two layers of the patterned fabric and you can see a shadow of a sunflower on part of the top of mine, but it doesn’t look weird enough to not wear. Seriously love it though. Skirt is also lined with a thicker fabric making it not see through."
5.0,My granddaughters couldn’t be happier with their shirts ... they are having Avenger adventures
5.0,"Love this dress. It's so inexpensively priced that I was a little wary but it fits great and is so cute. It's a comfy stretchy cottony soft t-shirt type material. For reference, I'm 120 lbs 5' 7, size 4 and ordered the small. It fits perfectly and right above the knee on me.  I ordered the dark green and it's a rich dark green color. These dresses are so worth it!!! And hey did I mention they have POCKETS!!! Best of all!!! All of these dresses are fabulous. I did return the blue, purple and fushia just because I didn't need that many but I still loved them all. They are all gorgeous and so comfy and casual OR dress them up. These dresses are amazing and you can't beat the price!  The patterned ones are gorgeous and the solid black is so dressy. They are totally worth it."
5.0,very fun.
5.0,"It does what it claims it will do, just like everything else you have to be patient for it’s results."
5.0,"love them, I'm 5 ft 5in about 210 lbs, an xl fit perfect and I got the olive with pocket."
5.0,"I would definitely recommend this product, fits as described and the material is beautiful."
5.0,I have not given it to my wife yet
5.0,"I would like to apologized on my review earlier on. I have received my dress on time actually the mail man drop it off at the rental office, so I was able to go pick it up. The dress is amazing and fit perfectly. I’m 152 pound I order Medium. Picture is coming soon"
5.0,Exactamente lo que esperaba
5.0,Great material. Looks better on and is flattering. I have a long back so the adjustable straps were a must.
5.0,Light weight and comfortable. True to size
5.0,"Very vibrant red, it stretches and the material is slightly thick. A bit heavy but overall a great dress."
5.0,"I've been wearing hook and loop style bands on other watches for 20 years, mostly on a child's sport watch. I was so happy to see these bands for my Garmin Venu SQ. They are easy to get on the watch and stay comfortably fastened. My only complaint is that my wrist is so small, the band is just a tiny bit big. Can I cut the end without having it come apart?"
5.0,I like the light weight material and the fit.  I am waiting on the other colors in my size to be available.
5.0,Awesome quality. Love it.
5.0,"This necklace is just as it appears in the picture, and I received it much earlier than the projected time of arrival."
5.0,Cute shoes but run a little small
5.0,"I have very, very thick hair and this beanie is the first that has ever been able to fit comfortably over my head w/all of my hair tucked underneath. Plus, the two toned burgundy color is beautiful!"
5.0,No complaints- friend loved them
5.0,Have a 4 year old and sized him for a 5 he’s tall and slim. Suit fits perfectly. No alterations needed. Great quality as well and machine washable. Well done 👍🏼

5.0,wear this everyday to remind that I am here to do good in God world.
5.0,Got to have this in your rotation of socks and underwear during football season Go Minnesota Gophers
5.0,"Evridwear Men Winter Knit Warm Gloves with 3M Thinsulate Thermal Insulated Lining (Army Green)<br /><br />Since it's still in the 90s here, we can't put these gloves to a real temp test for a while (could be a few weeks or a few months thanks to our crazy Texas weather). But so far we like them a lot. My husband is 6 foot and slender and he has plenty of room in these gloves while I'm 5'7"" and of medium build and even though the gloves are roomy for me, the loose insulation inside of them means that they feel like a good fit and I'll be glad to wear these this winter. We will use them as is when we are hiking in cold weather but will cover them with big work gloves when we are taking care of our horses during some of our freezing and below weather since we don't want to wear them out with rough ranch work."
5.0,very warm and fit right to size
5.0,I love how it looks I love how it keeps the sun off my LOs head and eyes... But she will not keep it on for the life of me. The second it gets on its off in a second. And when I pull the thing tight I get scared she will get hurt trying to take it off... But yeah it's a great hat
5.0,My son is slim and other masks didn't stay up. These work great.
5.0,"These are unusual looking earrings, unlike anything I usually buy, but I really like them.  They hang nicely from my ears and are very comfortable to wear."
5.0,Very nice. Hasn't tarnished tho I have had it for a while.
5.0,I love this handbag. It's heavier than most but it's also nicely compartmentalized. Easy to use and I've received compliments from women several times now. I like that the center compartment zips for extra security but the strong magnets in the two side compartments work very well. Rich green and brown colors are elegant.
5.0,"I just received these sunglasses and I couldn’t be more pleased.  The fit is perfect.  I have an average sized head and I can’t believe how nice these fit.  I am a runner and I like my sunglasses to be secure and not slipping down as I run.  I have enough sunglasses experience to know I won’t have to worry about that with these.  My last pair of sunglasses were the Oakley Valves which are also excellent sunglasses.  They too have an excellent fit, however, after a little less than a year the rubber started to separate and they would fog up pretty bad if I dropped into a cold section of a canyon (I run a lot of trails). More importantly I paid twice as much for the Oakley’s and they didn’t come with an extremely nice case.  I am very impressed with the bargain of Tifosi sunglasses.  I admit I haven’t had much of a chance to see if these wear easily or if the cut outs will prevent fogging but I will update this review if I am not pleased.  I am just super please with the look, fit and lens quality for the price."
5.0,I wish it was a little taller
5.0,We’re great helped my leg cramping easy to put on
5.0,It is lightweight and easy to throw over a tank top. I don’t like to show my arms and this is perfect for those hit summer days.
5.0,"Gift for my husband. He said they were a bit snug in the leg, but comfy on the feet. Cute design"
5.0,Love the look and feel comfortable couldn't be more happier got two more.
5.0,"Love this band. It’s so easy to put on, just a slip over the wrist. Fits perfect. The amount of stretch is just right, as well."
5.0,Very cute. Very shiny. I questioned whether it was sterling or costume jewelry but saw the 925 stamp. I haven't yet given it to the recipient but I'm sure she'll love it.
5.0,These are super cute earrings! Large and good quality.

5.0,good size case. Compartment just hold goggles in place. well made.

5.0,Great kids shoes!
5.0,I love these tops.
5.0,Nice earrings and value for the price. Don't look cheap. Nice quality.
5.0,These sandals are excellent.  I have tried many many sandals and have been disappointed.  I put my orthotics in these and they are very comfortable and are very well built.  I will buy more of Drew.
5.0,Love the color and style.  Nice summer dress
5.0,Super awesome just run small
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVEEEE this top!!!<br />The fabric is so soft and stretchy. It's not too tight and it makes my girls look great!<br />I definitely recommend if you have a bigger bust because if you don't fill it out you might have some unwanted wardrobe malfunctions or a slippage.<br />I'm a 38C and the Large for great!<br />Definitely recommend!
5.0,"Very cute, it looks like an expensive piece of jewelry, love it."
5.0,"I love these card holders. They keep your Driver's License, medical cards and credit cards in a compact case for easy handling."
5.0,My bf really liked them and they fit him perfect. They are tight in the right places and he said they were very comfortable. They look really good on sizes were accurate
5.0,"Good hat, good fit."
5.0,Great support. I would suggest sizing down if you are on the cusp of the measurements between sizes. I did this and the socks fit perfect if I went for the large they would’ve been too big.
5.0,gorgeous shirt. Back of the shirt is plain white and the print is fully on the front. Bought for my nephew's bday and I already know he's going to go bonkers when he sees this.
5.0,"The product looks good, fits nicely and makes a decent jogging pants. Reasonably priced as well. No complaint really."
5.0,"Just received this watch and for $12 I love it! I would change my review if my opinion changes, but I have not been disappointed by Casio watches. Love the retro look!<br /><br />Update: the backlight is not the best."
5.0,"Needed a terrycloth robe that was not expensive like the spa type. Just something to throw on from the outdoor shower to the house, while blotting some of the water. Liked it so much I bought another in a different color."
5.0,"This is really cute, the pattern is a bit off on the back but nothing noticeable. I'm a U.S medium 5'8 150 lbs and the medium fit great since it does stretch so get your usual size. I wear it a lot over bikinis or just for casual strolls."
5.0,Very cute!!!❤
5.0,"Much higher quality than I expected for the price.  And indeed, in my view, high quality, comparisons not necessary."
5.0,Awesome product !
5.0,"it's a Belt but it looks great, not much more to say, feels good I change the buckle but other then that a good belt"
5.0,It was a gift for my mother
5.0,"I LOVE this top! The straps are ADJUSTABLE which really helps with the fit.  I'm 210 lbs, 44 C, 5'3&#34; and the handkerchief cut longest point hits at my knee and the shorter part hits about 6&#34; up. I highly recommend this top."
5.0,I’ve always wanted a bag like this because carrying my purse sometimes isn’t very convenient. It gets in the way and I constantly have to keep an eye on it when I’m out. This little bag is perfect! I used for my field trip and I use it when going to work.
5.0,These headband/face covering6 are just as described and perfect for breathability and style! Thanks again!
5.0,"I've been wanting a pair of combat-style boots for a long time, and I finally got around to purchasing these. I LOVE them.  They are super comfortable and look great with a variety of looks.  I have no complaints!  I plan on buying the brown pair as well! :-)"
5.0,It fit nice . It is also a good quality dress .
5.0,"Super cute, I wore them in my wedding day in Mexico"
5.0,The Nyan cat/poptart cat shirt was a major hit with my wife. A little small-ish but not bad. A sweet shirt for the internet geeks out there!
5.0,Love these. Super comfy and pretty flattering
5.0,"This dress was very flattering on.  The length is great - I'm 5'4"" and it hits right at the knee.  The fabric is not the best quality, but for the price, it is what I expected for a fun, casual,  summer dress."
5.0,Fantastic wetsuit for surfing. Love the design. Good shoulder flex for paddling. Great fit.
5.0,"These are the nicest silicone watch bands I've purchased. There are other bands that cost more, but these are superior. I will be purchasing more of these."
5.0,"Gorgeous, better than I expected!"
5.0,LOVE mine!!!! Great purchase & great product!!
5.0,It is a great coat.  I can where it three different ways.  I will buy another for next year.
5.0,"Got this for my teenager that's 6'2"" and 250lbs. This fits excellently with room to spare. It's also quite slimming even on bigger guys and doesn't add any ""bulk"" even though it's quite warm. It's also a very soft material and not a knit that'll leave you itching."
5.0,Love these beads. Really like 10mm size.
5.0,bought these for vacation so I didn't have to worry about losing my Ray bans. But these glasses became my new favorite. I wear them more then my Ray Bans. They do not feel cheap at all. This is my second purchase from this brand and they never disappoint.
5.0,"I purchased this to replace the stainless steel top vent on my Vision Classic B. The OEM stainless vent has some well documented issues and frankly I just never really liked it. This new vent came with both the spring prongs and the (2) screws in each side. The Classic B does not have the holes for the screws but the friction from the spring prongs easily holds the vent in place on top of the kamado chimney.<br /><br />BTW I also, own a PitBoss K24 and the vent on it is virtually identical to the one purchased here on Amazon from seller: MY MUM'S JOURNEY. I really like the vent on my PitBoss so, I'm sure it will function well on the Vision as well. AFAIK both PitBoss and Vision source their kamados from Auplex in China."
5.0,Fantastic product and great customer service.
5.0,I love it......the dress camouflages all the bad areas! They need more like this
5.0,"Fit larger bust nicer but hips were too large and too high (but I have longer torso and shorter legs). I am 5’5” 122 lbs 35-28-38 with 34D, and size medium fit on top but too big on bottom. Wine color was nice. Knit fabric would have been comfortable. Not highest quality dress, but great for the money."
5.0,The gloves work as promised. They fit well and feel durable. I would buy another pair.
5.0,Dressed up as Jessica rabbit for Halloween and this dress was perfect for that costume. I am about 5’1 and it was the perfect length for me. The slit was a little higher than I’m used to but wasn’t revealing. I tried it on when i got it without a bra and it was still as flattering with a bra. It is very very soft but is pretty tight so you can even see no show underwear in it. I think if you have a larger tummy there is not much room for forgiveness but that is the style i wanted so if you are okay with that then this is a great dress for you. I will definitely wear this dress again! Loved it!
5.0,Nothing to dislike.  Husband loved it. I will purchase more
5.0,It’s flowy and fits awesome! I’m 5’5 195 and bought XL - I love it!
5.0,The shipping was incredibly fast and they fit perfectly and are a comfortable. I will buy them again when they finally wear out but no signs yet and I wear them daily.
5.0,They fit as they should and I get lots of compliments on them
5.0,"These watchband fit my I watch five with no problem. They’re easy to get on, comfortable, and fit well. They are a good value for the price. I like that you have several color choices."
5.0,We bought this for a birthday present for our nephew. This picture does NOT do this watch justice. When we received it in the mail we were shocked at how pretty the watch actually is. I'm glad we made this purchase and cannot wait for our nephew to open it. My husband actually said &#34;I want it&#34; when I showed it to him! ha!
5.0,"Bought these for my husband because he wears “house shoes” he wears these a lot, says they’re comfortable, good quality sole"
5.0,she loves the shoes and are made of good quality materials
5.0,"Nice quality, and fit as expected. :-)"
5.0,"This dress is amazing quality! Very soft and stylish, I wore it with heels to a wedding and got so many compliments. I normally were a size 26 in pants 32DD and a small fit me perfect showing off my cleavage. I want to buy it in other colors!!"
5.0,Overall this product is good and looks the same.
5.0,Compliments at work. They are cute and help keep legs energized on a long shift.

5.0,Flip ups are perfect. Great price and fast shipment
5.0,The weather is suddenly wam in Utah and I remembered having a robe a few years ago that I loved to wear because it was easy to put on and take off and wear around the house.  This robe is a perfect copy.  I may get another in another color.  It is so comfortable.  Thankyou.
5.0,My step daughter is slim an the belts fitted great
5.0,As expected! Love it! Arrived on time.
5.0,"I love these! They're two toned, I ordered the grey color. I was pleasantly surprised to find that half was white and half was gray!! I basically got two sets in one!! Definitely am going to buy more!"
5.0,Big hit with the 3 year old- more breathable than others meaning less stinky feet at the end of the day.
5.0,Girlfriend loves them.
5.0,They came nicely packaged.  Good quality
5.0,I barely noticed I was wearing them. They were so incredibly comfortable.
5.0,"Love the feel and looks of this shirt.  Looks professional.  Materials shows off muscle curvature without appearing to show off.  Worn untucked, it doesn't reveal my CCW.  Collar didn't roll up after a couple washings either.  Still sharp and crisp, like permanent press.  Very satisfied with this shirt.  I wish they made it in olive drab!"
5.0,Great belts for low cut jeans that won't stay up when you bend over. Comfortable elastic that looks like it will wear well. Easy to buckle. Flat buckle. Adjustable waist. Pack of three different colors. Good purchase.
5.0,Amazing! I use a portable charger and it heats up the pants!!
5.0,Worked great for me in NY snow and stayed in pretty good condition after 1 year of use

5.0,Fantastic - and delivered fast!
5.0,"It was a very nice, thin shirt. Unfortunately mine arrived with a defect and had to be returned. I wasn't able to purchase a replacement with a discount so I had to let it go.<br />Color was as expected and the material was really soft and comfy."
5.0,"Great purchase! Love, Love, Love the watch band! It arrived so fast!"
5.0,Stretchy comfortable looks exactly like the pic
5.0,I loved it so much I bought two of them
5.0,My 8 year old daughter absolutely loves it! It seems to be of good quality at a good price. Would recommend this product.
5.0,The colour and design is just as described though somewhat larger than it looks online.<br />I recommend to you if you love big bags cos it roomy
5.0,"These look exactly like they do in the photo, so there's absolutely no surprises. The silver-colored frames are thin and lightweight so they don't weigh my face down. They aren't too tight against the sides of my head, either. The blue mirrored lenses are really pretty and didn't arrive with any scratches. I like that these come with a little drawstring soft case, too!"
5.0,These bows are the perfect size for my 4 year old. She loves them and loves the variety of colors.
5.0,"Cute belt. Can't really tell if it's leather or not, but I like it."
5.0,COMPLIMENTS GALORE...
5.0,"these were perfection to the fit and the material so comfortable and looked much more expensive then the pictures, I got a great buy and planning to purchase more"
5.0,"This is a wonderful, pretty dress for a party or a shopping mall spree! The material is high quality, and very soft on the skin. The lacy upper is a superior grade, unlike most lace dress/tops I've come across. The size is a perfect fit. I'm 5'5&#34;, 140 lb, and Medium was great for me.<br />I would highly recommend this dress, worth every cent!"
5.0,Great product. Comes<br />With both a standard and micro SD cards. Witch makes it so versatile. The micro card fits in my Garmin rhino GPS and the standard card fits in my computer. Also bonus feature is you get a free membership so you can also use your phone or tablets. Five stars all the way!!
5.0,Without a doubt the absolute best cold weather glove I have ever bought. Incredibly soft and snug fit . My hands stay warmer in these better than I imagined. I can say with confidence that these gloves will last several seasons as they appear superbly constructed. Definatly a great buy..<br />G. D.

5.0,Built very well and makes removing spring bars easy!
5.0,"Either you can use these reverable scarfs on your head to tie up your hair or around you neck. They are 2 inches wide and 36 inches long. There are different prints on both sides, so really you're getting 8 patterns to wear. I washed them on delicate cycle and hung them to dry. They hold their shape and you don't need to iron them."
5.0,"I bought this for myself, And it’s definitely cute but it fits a little awkward on me. It’s more for men I’d say, or a unisex sizing. I have to pull it tight and it will stay on but it comes down too low and covers my eyes! Just not a good fit for me but I gave it to my husband and it fit him perfect so at least it’s getting used!!"
5.0,"These are the best leggings I've ever had. They are soft, yet hold all my jiggle tight. 😁"
5.0,Got them a week ahead of estimated time; they're absolutely lovely!! fleece inside to keep you warm.. and the cut finger length is perfect.  I love these!!! :-D
5.0,"I love this kind of clothes and, them being elastic, makes them fit as a glove. The dress is very elegant and chic. I bought the wine/burgundy. Everyone likes it."
5.0,Great purse! Love it!
5.0,Perfect for using my favorite hat in the rain.
5.0,I bought these earrings for my coworker for christmas. I only bought her something because she bought me something. I hate Christmas at work. Anyway she wore the earrings to work so I guess she likes them.
5.0,It was a gift and he loved it. Great sturdy Tshirt and it came when quoted.
5.0,The pants are soft and comfortable. I’m using them for Halloween and to relax in
5.0,I love this swimsuit! I'm a new mom and don't feel comfortable showing my belly and this swimsuit makes me look sexy!
5.0,I LIKED A LOT
5.0,"These are great, solidly constructed kid's shoes. My son typically complains about the fit of shoes the first few times he wears them, but these went on easily and were immediately soft and comfortable enough for him to wear them without complaint.<br /><br />The material is definitely lighter and breathable, making them a great choice for spring or summer. (They wouldn't work well during Seattle's rainy winters, that's for sure!)<br /><br />Most especially, I appreciate the gender neutral style. The colors are grey with a light aqua trim, and would go as well with a cute pair of shorts and a ruffled shirt as they would with a pair of jeans and a polo shirt... kids of all gender identities can feel comfortable in them."
5.0,Looks great with my rose gold Iwatch.
5.0,I loved the quality of this sash
5.0,good quality. The clasp works well and doesnt seem like it will wear out after alot of use. colors are exact in pic.
5.0,Super cute and soft shirt!
5.0,"it seems well made, super easy to install and fits nicely... I used their chart and it's a comfortable fit. without being too tight.. I love it!!"
5.0,This is a very comfortable dress that is a great length and great for work
5.0,Great to wear to the gym. Fit great don't shrink on the wash. Colors don't bleed
5.0,So cute! Good buy
5.0,"very pretty and hangs good on the chain, would recommend to all, and the price is great!"
5.0,Do yourself a favor and just buy the big lot of glasses! I spent a week on vacation and I had so much fun choosing what color glasses to wear each day. It was also nice to not have to worry if I broke or lost a pair I still had SEVERAL to choose from.<br /><br />I liked how light weight they are and they did great in the sun! I love these glasses! 😎
5.0,I purchased as a gift and they loved it! Very beautiful would buy again.
5.0,I have been buying all my dresses off amazon and every day I get lots of compliments on my wardrobe
5.0,Great shades!
5.0,"This necklace is very beautiful and I love it, the size is perfect."
5.0,"I measured the panel at almost exactly 12&#34; x 8&#34;. It's a good size to hold a variety of things, and it did exactly what I wanted: Organize a mess of objects so I can switch bags in one step.<br /><br />The elastic straps are non-slip textured, which makes it easy to get things in and out because the straps don't have to be extremely tight to hold up against vigorous shaking. My only request would be to replace the too-thin pocket on the back with hook-and-loop strips or ladder webbing, so I can attach the panel to other things."
5.0,I like these fingerless gloves very much and am very happy with them.  The only thing I wasn't happy with is that the tags didn't show the fabric contents in English.
5.0,Very Nice! I bought for my niece and she loves it
5.0,Easy on and off
5.0,Love these! Just the perfect amount of compression! My legs feel fantastic at the end of my shift!
5.0,"It's so much cuter than the display picture; it's shinier, perfect size, and definitely a statement piece. Would recommend for sure"
5.0,These fit well and are just what I wanted.
5.0,These blue light glasses are unique. They are lightweight but feel sturdy. Definitely enjoying exploring new blue light glasses since I realized how much they help alleviate headaches from being on a computer all day. The glasses come in a box in a plastic bag plus have a storage sleeve which is perfect for making sure they don’t get scratched!
5.0,Love the looks and fell of hat.  Fast delivery.
5.0,"These are wonderful.  They have lots of possible configurations, they're comfortable and help save the skin.  A great product"
5.0,"Love these! Gave 2 pairs to family, kept the rest! Good quality, didn't bother my ears.<br /> Love the backs that came with them."
5.0,Stylish and sturdy. I love the design and that it is thus far good metal.
5.0,Its comfortable and cute
5.0,:) Perfect!!!!!
5.0,"High quality!! My husband loved it, thank you!!"
5.0,"I have wider feet- and surprisingly, these fit better than expected! Super cute. Good dupe for Torys."
5.0,GOOD PRODUCT!!
5.0,"I adore these boots and I'm so happy I found them at half price! These make a fantastic little self treat for the wardrobe. They work really well with punk/grunge looks, too. Well made and I expect them to last at least a couple years. The inside is lined with velvet, there's a tongue running the full length of the boot, and the strings can be used to adjust their width (great news for those of us with large calves!)."
5.0,"The quick release pins are not long enough to stay in the watch. The band material feels fine, but the quick release pins are not good. Also, the lever to release one of the pins is sunk down into the fabric of the watch and almost impossible to maneuver. I tried to capture this in the photos.<br /><br />EDIT: Fintie has fantastic customer service! After the first band didn't work, they sent me an email explaining the issue with the band and promptly sent me another while also giving me a partial refund. The second band came within days and works GREAT! A HUGE thumbs up to their customer service. I would definitely recommend buying from them again! And yes, I will also be buying from them again!"
5.0,Love the classic look of this cost..Sherlock Holmesy..Fitted perfect on me..Wearing it today outside for the first time to my appointment..I'm gonna rock this coat with class..A+++++++ Thank you
5.0,"I have had several of the Miss Elaine brand robes.  Fit is true, quality good and they wash well. Definitely will purchase again."
5.0,Great set for the price!
5.0,Great earring especially if you need nice looking pearls to travel with.  Would reorder
5.0,"Love love love these bows!! My daughter started wearing them around 2mths (she was born with a full head of hair) The size is perfect- not too small but not to big. They don't require a lot of hair because the clip is strong. Once it's on, it stays in my daughters hair all day.<br /><br />I highly recommend these bows. I even recently purchased 3 more cases for some of my friends. Love gifting these bows!!"
5.0,"Great running socks for sweaty feet. However, they run large. I run in a 12 narrow and ordered a large. They are almost too big. Tried shrinking them in the dryer but they hold their shape - which is normally a good thing. I can still use them but may order a medium for my next pair."
5.0,"I bought these as stocking stuffers for my children.  They are not sturdy or the best quality, but they are cute and will definitely get some wear from my two teens.  They look easy to put on, and I hope they stay in place once on."
5.0,Great underwear!
5.0,Sticker earrings stay on very long. My daughter loves them.
5.0,just great
5.0,Had to take apart and shorten straps for females.  Do not recommend for females
5.0,They run a lil bit bigger BUT totally worth it!
5.0,This mask fits well and looks cool
5.0,Very cute. Does not look nearly as cheap as they were!
5.0,Love the high rise and that they stay in place during my hot yoga practice!
5.0,I like the way it fit and the color
5.0,"I love this dress! It has been a fun addition to my summertime wardrobe. I appreciate that it has short sleeves on it so that I do not feel the need to wear a cardigan over it on the warmer days. The dress is true to size, is very comfortable, and has vibrant coloring in the skirt. My only critique would be that with the way the fabric was cut for the dress I received, red and orange sections are featured significantly more in the skirt than the blues and greens that are shown in the seller's picture. I don't believe this to be a bad thing, but it is good to be aware of the fact that your dress may vary quite a bit in regard to color from the seller's photo. Overall, I really love and recommend this dress!"
5.0,Item is perfect and well protected as to not get scratched.  It even came in a nice giftable box.
5.0,Like everything
5.0,"This ring is very pretty, but a little bigger than I expected for the size I ordered. The quality is appropriate to the price. I was overall quite pleased."
5.0,Extremely comfortable and soft. You get the best bang for your buck.
5.0,"Loved this retro look. Very flattering for plus size, as long as you've got the boobage to even out the look (IMHO)."
5.0,Love the design and sturdy wear
5.0,I love this dress so much!! I'm regularly a 16-18 or XL so just to be safe I ordered up a size because I like a like room in things and this is perfect!!  I'm also very tall and was pleased with the length of this dress. It is absolutely gorgeous. My favorite part is the pockets!  It goes great with leggings and boots - I need to order a couple more in different colors and my winter wardrobe will be complete!
5.0,Great light weight jacket. Love the material
5.0,Really beautiful. I love Scott respect don't know how to arrange them and using the skin helps so much
5.0,I absolutely love this nightshirt.  Super comfortable and lightweight.
5.0,Daroolion loves it
5.0,My scarf came with a hole in it so that was not good impression but company sent me a new one right away and I love the design of scarf and material.
5.0,Nice product. Wrong size
5.0,"Nice pair of sunglasses!  Very comfortable and fits my face nicely.  Clear vision, not muddy or foggy type.  Blocks the sun just enough to function while driving.  Also comes in a real nice solid storage container, not flimsy.  Definitely a keeper."
5.0,"I bought this dress for my daughter, and she loved it right off the bat because of the seriously soft material.  The cut is cute and fashionable too, but let's face it.  Our favorites are the clothes that are the most comfortable.  This one's a keeper!"
5.0,Good quality fabric - nice mask.
5.0,My daughter ordered this and loved it!
5.0,So pretty and new style
5.0,Very pretty- it's almost delicate looking with it has good weight to it. I love it and I got it fast.
5.0,Just what I was looking for. No more running in and out of every Walgreens and CVS looking for these.
5.0,They are perfect . I like them . Thank
5.0,Love the feel of the fabric
5.0,Received many complements. Great hat for the stage.
5.0,It's nice.  Much prettier than I expected.  Lightweight and fun to wear with a black v-neck and jeans.
5.0,"Great Product, it has a lot of pockets and the material looks strong, is great for the price paid!"
5.0,"Soft and good , nice and comfortable"
5.0,Just as described and matched the colors in picture exactly.
5.0,"The color bleeds off on the white cuffs when it’s new and washed. However, it’s only slightly noticeable and does not ruin the ability to wear the shirt. I would rate the fabric at 3 1/2 stars out of 5. I’d still recommend this shirt for the price."
5.0,Super cute shirt and very soft!! It's my new favorite for the season. 🕸🎃
5.0,"These were a gift for my Granddaughter who was so thrilled to get pj's with feet in them and zebra striped as well.  I haven't gotten a complaint from them so assume they are exactly what she wanted, we don't live in the same state."
5.0,Very well made and looks very nice.  I am in love with bangle watches.
5.0,Great product for the price! Just as expected :) Glad I have gave this a shot. I love the look & the 3 piece compartment.
5.0,It's a beautiful watch. Loved how it complemented my dress. It was perfect. The band was long enough for my wrist and it wasn't snug so it was comfortable. I have a size 6 1/2 inch wrist and it fit just right.
5.0,"Sunglasses arrived earlier than expected. I ordered them for my fiancee. She simply love them, she says her eyes are more relaxed wearing them."
5.0,Great quality I will totally recommend
5.0,I love these so well made!
5.0,"I often have bad luck with online clothing purchases. I was skeptical buying this dress, but I am glad that I did. The fit is good. It's a little stretchy. I love that it is not too thin. I see lots of uses for this little dress. I will probably pair it with a shrug. You can dress it up or tone it down for a casual look. I would recommend this cute dress to anyone."
5.0,Love it’s comfortable ❤️🤩
5.0,"Purchased this hat for myself, LOVE it, get compliments on it when people recognize what the symbol is from. The quality is great, definitely not a cheaply made hat!  I have a big head with lots of thick hair to top it off, and this bucket hat actually fits me kind of big.  I'm not complaining because even an average mens sized baseball hat looks awkward on me because it's always a tad snug.  I almost want to order another because I have already worn this a lot and will wear a lot more because of the fact it's reverseable, black on one side and white on the other, it will go with any t-shirt I have.  If you're a fan of Star Wars and the dark or need a gift for someone I would highly recommend this hat!"
5.0,Love them. Did what I bought them for.
5.0,"High quality hoodie with vibrant colors, quality zipper, breatheable materials.  My favorite hoodie already."
5.0,Absolutely love it just what I was looking for
5.0,Exactly what I expected. Fits great
5.0,They shade
5.0,True to size. Great quality and arrived on time.
5.0,"I average a size 8. Bought both large and medium (different colors). Medium was a bit short to wear at work, but still a fun flirty dress for a date night. Large was a bit baggy, but goes with the flirty feel of the dress and was long enough to wear to work."
5.0,"Hello,  yes the jersey fits well, and individual happens to enjoy basketball,  and the color, and team choice"
5.0,"I ordered three pairs, navy, black, and new black.  I noticed that the ""new black"" were distinctly heavier, and they are 30% linen/70 % cotton, whereas the navy and black are all cotton.  Since the ""new"" colors are more expensive, I would guess that they are also 30% linen.  I like both, and I like the ""quirky"" fit mentioned by another reviewer, since I am long waisted and appreciate the somewhat lower crotch, and high waist, very comfortable.  The linen blend seems to have a nicer drape and body to the fabric, but won't be as cool.  They seem to run just a tad small.  I am 5'3, 145 with full hips, the L are quite snug but wearable, the XL too baggy, but fine.  The length for us shorter gals is a perfect slack length.  I put the XL all cotton in the dryer, they may have shrunk a bit, but not much.  For comfortable casual pants, they are fairly flattering for full hips/thighs."
5.0,Love my Clark’s!
5.0,Love these sandals for my 1.5 yr old. She can put them in herself thanks to the double velcro straps. The only minor setback are the insole of the shoes come out constantly. But a little crazy glue will fix that.
5.0,"Got these four my fiance (birthday gift). She absolutely loves them (the look, feel, filter the sun and the clarity)"
5.0,"Actually is what it looks like, thankfully because I live getting what I see. Love the little bag it came with."
5.0,I love the way it looks and it appears to be multiple layers.  I use it as a face mask and I love the drawstring pull that allows you to get the perfect grip on your face.  I love mine and recommend this product.
5.0,"This is such a versatile skort.  It can be worn with a fancier blouse, or downgraded to be worn with a t-shirt.  It is breathable, light weight and the creme color is neutral enough to go with a lot.  I wear these traveling because they go with so many scenarios.  Great fit, comfortable and affordable."
5.0,Must be air dried  It will shrink if put in dryer machine  even in low setting
5.0,This necklace was perfect for my Halloween costume.
5.0,"This is an awesome purse! It's not only cute but it's made well and lasts. I've used it for almost 3 years and it never lost a rhinestone, ripped, or broke. It still looks brand new!"
5.0,Looks even better in person! Don’t let the price fool you. Gorgeous and not overstated.
5.0,I bought this for my wife and she liked it! It fit correctly and the dress material is good! Better than I expected
5.0,I have gotten many complements on these leggings more than any of my others
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress. I'm a true size 16 at 5'4&#34; tall and 207lbs. The XL fits perfectly. The length is past my knee ,I'd prefer it a bit shorter but that's not a big deal I plan to wear it with heals. The material is a type of rayon and very light but not cheap. I live in the south I can wear it into fall with a sweater on top. I can't say enough about this dress.  I highly recommend it."
5.0,These earrings are very pretty.  I just love them!
5.0,Perfect for what I was looking for
5.0,If you love ballet you'll love these dangles/charms! They are a very pretty silver tone and pretty sturdy as well!
5.0,"I love these shoes. They are even cooler looking in person. They look like velvet, but are much easier to clean. The inside has a really cool design too! They are surprisingly comfortable too."
5.0,Just what I wanted :) it's well made and cute! I like the multicolor aspect to be able to go with all my swimwear
5.0,So cute I wear it a lot.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:87534c1a8a380f47aa1856d9c226b77e]] Looks beautiful on, the only thing was I don’t think it’s long enough. I’m only 5”5 it was about 2” too short."
5.0,I love this tank because the straps are thin but the shirt starts higher than most tanks of this type so half of the front of my bra doesn’t show. It’s perfect worn alone or with another shirt over in colder weather. VERY soft right out of the bag- that’s very important as my skin is really sensitive.
5.0,"I am size 12.5 US, I ordered size 46 as they were the size I wear specified by the chart however, had to send them back and get 2 sizes larger.  Ended up purchasing the 48's and they fit perfect!"
5.0,I’m 4’11” and 125 (curvy). This dress fit so amazing in a size medium. It’s super comfortable also! Couldn’t be more pleased. Purchased this dress for a wedding and I couldn’t be more excited to wear it. Amazing price plus free 2 day shipping....it’s a home run from start to finish.
5.0,Best waist belt I have had
5.0,"Lightweight, soft and comfortable material. This top is great. Exactly as described. Tailored well."
5.0,"Soooo glad I purchased this bag before it became unavailable. It's a great bag. Simple in design (a plus for me), great leather, and great interior room and compartments.  Sturdy and not too heavy on the shoulder.  Don't hesitate-- buy it."
5.0,My daughter loved this!
5.0,Get lots of compliments on this sandal.
5.0,Bought this for my daughter. Great shirt!
5.0,I wasn’t expecting much for this for the price point and reviews were all over the place in terms of sizing. I ordered an extra large and it really fits like a glove. The material is a stretchy leggings material. The length is good if you wanna wear this to work. For a point of reference I am 5’8” tall. This may not work great for someone who is shorter. But if you were taller and like to wear heels this would look absolutely amazing. I now plan to buy this in multiple colors and different sleeve lengths. I could easily wear this to a baby shower or other nicer events with the appropriate footwear and accessories.
5.0,Grandaughter 4 years old loves them.
5.0,Very strong and sturdy!
5.0,Loved the fit !!!
5.0,"Perfect! The material is so soft, but thin so it’s perfect for Mississippi’s fall. It’s long, which I love! Cozy and the long sleeves make me feel comfy! I’m a size 26:28 and ordered a 5x. I want it in every color!"
5.0,"I'm using this as my dress watch, and so far I am completely satisfied.  I purchased what I wanted and received exactly that."
5.0,"Perfect fit , grate material and they gave pockets !! So yes will be buying sand telling all my friends and family!!"
5.0,"This is my favorite night time gown.  I have washed it several times and still very soft,  colors are vibrant and didn't shrink"
5.0,Looks amazing and its comfy
5.0,Absolutely Beautiful Dress. Breathtaking!
5.0,Perfection!! This is a beautiful suit and fits like it should. I want to buy other colors because finding a one piece bathing suit in Texas is like pulling teeth!! LOL I swim a whole bunch so after a while the chlorine and wear/tear just ruins a good suit. It arrived before the estimated date if arrival. I was super excited and went for a swim the sane day. Perfect. Just absolutely perfect!!
5.0,What an adorable product! They are comfortable and great in the sand. I love the style and colors . They go with any fun beach outfit
5.0,I really love this hat! Its lightweight and I never once felt my head getting sweaty. And I love the fact that I can fold it up and stick it in my pocket if I need to. I highly recommend this cap if you want a great hat with UV protection!
5.0,OMG these are soooo sparkly. My 9 year old is in heaven with these. She loves turtles.
5.0,I love this bag. Very cute and well made.
5.0,I am a lover of any type of jewelry or accessory that is everything tortoise shell. These earrings are quite a beautiful set. I love how lightweight these acetate earrings are on my ears. I don't feel a stretching when I wear them at all. I used to have my ears stretched and them being super lightweight is a necessity for me! These earrings go with just about any outfit and I have gotten so many compliments after wearing them for just one day!
5.0,I husband loved the arch support. He made a point to tell me they are the best sandles. Better then the Havaianas I have bought him in the past( based on the amount of arch support).
5.0,Work well doing HS Baseball
5.0,GAve it as a Christmas gift and the person really loves it.
5.0,Amazing good quality and love it
5.0,Very cute for the summer. Someone asked me if it was a Ted Baker! lol. Nice cheap summer dress
5.0,"Nice soft fabric, easy to put on, good fit."
5.0,"I shop jewelry online all the time.  You have to look closely at the size, silver and stone.  These earrings were exactly what I wanted!"
5.0,I bought the stickers for my daughter's third birthday party they're adorable and everyone loved them
5.0,Purchased for my son he likes them 😁
5.0,"Fits well, love the hook don't have the mask straps on ears."
5.0,"This is very well made piece for the size. I am ordering another piece as of this review in another form. If the quality of the newer piece is relative to the quality of this one, I am certain I will not be disappointed. I only wish this seller had more offerings as their pieces are very nice and high quality."
5.0,"Love this outfit, fit true to size."
5.0,"love this tank. i probably paid way too much money but its light, not too tight and really cute. I wear it when i'm at studio, lounging around etc. it is a bit too low to wear with a normal bra, but with a sports bra its fine"
5.0,my feet swell a lot do to an accident and i love the fact they are so light weight and fit so well. thanks
5.0,These are so comfortable
5.0,It was a gift for my son. He is really happy

5.0,"True to size. Fast shipping. Shipped in two days. Ordered a small in pink.  I'm 6'1 small waist, big butt, big thighs, long legs 190 pounds and it hugs my hips just right. I like my dresses tight but Medium would be more comfortable. I will order a medium in a different color. Love the way this dress lools on my curvy body. This is definitely great for women with curves wether you are skinny, average, or plus size. I'm tall but curvy so it looks great on me. Definitely will buy more in every color!!!"
5.0,Happy with the quality. I was concerned that the thingies that clip them to my glasses would be annoying but I don't<br />notice them at all.
5.0,Nice heavy leather belt. Great with jeans
5.0,Just love this shirt.  Glad I took a chance and bought several colors.  Very soft and washes up nice.
5.0,They fit and feel GREAT!!!!! WILL ORDER MORE🤗🤗🤗
5.0,Super cute and comfortable tank!  Washes very well!!! I’d definitely buy this again!
5.0,Material was exceptional! Very thick and vibrant.  I didn’t keep suit because the front V didn’t have any way to adjust and I felt the twins were out a bit too much for my liking.  I’m 5’6” and 150. 36C and a medium fit but I felt the length was short so I went with Large and it felt nicely.
5.0,The tshirt is great! I already washed it and dried in dryer and no shrinkage.
5.0,Love these boots. Just need it to get cold enough to wear them. Can I order snow on Amazon ;)
5.0,It's great!  It fits incredibly small though.
5.0,Easy peasy to install...hope it lasts<br /> No tie attached for when bella is down...<br />I will look for another brand next time. The tie down is important
5.0,Soft and warm and they work with my phone.
5.0,Perfect for jeans
5.0,"I'm SO IN LOVE with this skirt! Me being on the short side (Five feet) and very petite I didn't think a size four would fit but it does! The skirt drags on the floor but that's what I wanted. I love the pleats, pockets, and the color POPS! FIVE STARS all around!"
5.0,Nice fit.  Comfortable.  Better than expected.<br />Would buy again.
5.0,Very cute- love this!
5.0,wonderful dress - fits perfectly for size 12 and it is much prettier on than the picture shows - a big hit
5.0,I’m happy that the pants actually fit!  I often order short or Petite sizes and they are still too long.  I also like the color which is true to the picture.
5.0,great cabochons beautifully made and perfect size for necklaces.
5.0,"I was very happy with this dress for a warm, fall day/evening/night wedding on the Atlantic coast in Kennebunkport."

5.0,Simply beautiful ! Great Amazon's seller<br /><br />Thanks
5.0,"When I open ""amazon"" or any other site with jewelry products, I look for jewelries, created by Ian & Valeri Co. They produce beautiful things with the guaranteed high quality. As a rule, their products distinguish themselves with unusual design. But they create the classic jewelries also. Materials and stones, every detail is treated, polished very carefully.<br />I have a few things in my collection from Ian & Valeri Co. I love all of them.<br />I have to mention a great service of this company: shipping and delivery without any delay; a prompt solution of my order problem.<br />Thanks for your skills and talent"

5.0,"Perfect for natural hair, just wish they had more colors."
5.0,"The glasses are attractive, I appreciate that there are 2 colors so that I know where they belong in my home. The tint is yellow as promised."
5.0,"very nice, good size. I will buy more colors &#34;)"
5.0,"These work great as little phone clutches for everyday use! After about a year of constant use, started to wear down & strap broke, but great for the price!"
5.0,"I love this bodysuit!! The material is nice and thick, so it’s not see through. It can go with so many things! I’m usually a medium, but went with a large and it fits perfectly! I am 5’11 for reference. I would maybe stick to your true size if you don’t need extra length."
5.0,No one can believe what I paid for this bag. It looks like a $400 bag. It's soft and roomy and the shoulder strap is comfortable.
5.0,Arrived quickly. Looks great!
5.0,I got this as a gift for a family member and they loved it.
5.0,I got this as a gift for my son.He has been wearing it constantly.
5.0,"My almost-4 year old son is really into Mario right now! So when I saw these I had to get them! They fit him perfectly...and he wears a size 8-8.5 in shoes! It was hard finding a Mario pair of house shoes in his size...and these ended up fitting perfectly! I only said “No Arch Support” because, well, they’re house shoes...they don’t offer any arch support lol!<br />P.S. mine were red/black/white...they don’t look like the stock photo!"
5.0,Super soft and cute
5.0,"These have seriously been my favorite pair of jeans this season. They are SO comfortable. Just the right amount of stretch and they don't get baggy with too much wear. I was also worried that washing them may make them way too distressed, but it hasn't. Would highly recommend these!"
5.0,Loved how this dress fit. Will definitely buy another style.
5.0,I ordered 4 of these caps and I absolutely love the softness of the fabric and how they fit!! Great quality!!
5.0,They are too small for men
5.0,"So pretty and shiny but fragile. One of the little metallic decorative pieces fell off as I zipped it up. However, it does come with extra pieces if you need to replace them. This is a well made dress. Runs small so order a size larger. For reference, my daughter is 4'11&quot; 96 lb."
5.0,"It is beautiful and fits very well, I ended up purchasing another in black :)"
5.0,"It is a crisp Autumn in the mountains this year. My husband just relocated to the Snoqualmie area of Washington State from LA and is gearing up for winter distance running. He can't believe how wonderful these socks are - even more comfortable than cotton, and perfect for managing the warmth of his toes on long 90 - 120 minute runs even when it's raining. He gives them two thumbs and two toes up!"
5.0,Excellent! Comparable to Carters...I actually think these have thicker material. Nice and soft when washed. The 9 month size fits my little guy perfect. He's over 16lbs and about 25+ inches long.
5.0,"While a little large, these spats looked great. The strap helped hold them to the bottom of the shoe.  Lots of compliments on the look."
5.0,Goodgood
5.0,Great value. My 5 year old loves them and they stay on all day.Will buy them again.
5.0,Delivered as promised.

5.0,Very nice .
5.0,Great fit as advertised
5.0,Fit perfect and loved it!
5.0,I got this product to protect my nose ring from getting constantly rubbed by my masks. This product does a good job of protecting my face and fits well.
5.0,"great sweatshirt. warm, but breathable fleece on the inside. very comfy."
5.0,These glasses are amazing. I have a small head and sore bought glasses always fall off my face but these fit like a gem. They look very high end! I bought them because I wanted a cheap pair to take on vacation but I haven't taken them off. I would buy these again and again.
5.0,I got this watch for my friend's son as a b'day present. He's learning how to tell time and feels important wearing a watch. It's comfortable and seems to be working well.  He likes the green color.
5.0,"bought this set for the small things during travel. set is very light and takes up a minimum of space, while you can hide a lot of small things. I really like the purchase! all flawlessly I'm happy!"
5.0,These are amazing really warm. Great for the winter. And so adorable on. Also they have grips on the bottom so when they takeoff their shoes they won’t fall.
5.0,"A few days ago, at christmas, i got a gift certificate for the Bay, and then today, i went and i thought i was gonna have one beer with my friend andrea, but it turned into two or three, and i went to the bay and i bought this watch and some pyjamas, and i think this watch is the best except it's too big and now i have to go back to the bay and get it resized but the nice man said that would be free and i'll be down around there tomorrow anyways so what the hell."
5.0,I bought this dress for a quinceañera formal but not too formal. Price is perfect for the product.  I didn't want to expend too much on a formal dress and this dress makes it work for me. It looks like a classic black dress.
5.0,Kids liked them
5.0,This is such a beautiful scarf. It feels nice and I always think I look great when I wear it.
5.0,Beautiful sunglasses
5.0,Have received a lot of great compliments about this lapel pin! My bestie even sent a picture of it to his girlfriend. Lol!
5.0,"Sturdy and good quality, esp for the bargain price. Kids loved them"
5.0,Solid strap.  Color is absolutely fantastic with my Seagull Mosaic - earthy yet still a bit contrasty.  Snaps are strong and the headstock tie is dependable.  Great purchase!
5.0,I love it👍
5.0,"This looks great on my wrist. It's indeed made of leather and the colors are vibrant. Took 2-3 weeks to arrive from china, but for such a good price (about $3 including shipping) I can't complain."
5.0,"Very nice coat, seems to be well made, perfect weight, looks beautiful on!  Gives a tailored look when belted, but plenty of room for a sweater underneath."
5.0,"This is an awesome dress you’ll want in every color!! The material is thin but not sheet at all. Modest bust coverage and length. (I’m 5’9) this is a great option for a work, church, or casual dress!"
5.0,"They are okay. I expected better quality but I don't regret buying them for my daughter, she is 2 months so they fit her slightly big but they look so adorable!"
5.0,This pendant was well appreciated by my daughter
5.0,Was a gift and they loved it.
5.0,Good fit nice hat!!! Get complements on it a lot .
5.0,"My friend is leaving for the navy on two weeks,  she loved it."
5.0,"To say that I love these tunnels would be an understatement. I bought them because my daughter was only a few months old, and her head stability was still weak, so she’d slam her head into my ears all the time when I was holding her. My normal hard plugs would kill my ears, and hurt her, so when I found these I was excited to give them a try!<br />I can literally wear these for weeks, and when I take them out, they don’t even have an ordor!  For me that is huge because I hate the smell that my normal plugs would accumulate even after one day.  I normally would take them out daily because I can’t sleep when them in, but I honestly forget that I have these tunnels in. They are super flexible and comfortable!  I would highly recommend them to anyone! I love the colors, and have fun switching them out to match my mood!<br />Great buy!"
5.0,Gourgoues
5.0,Loved it keep my backpack organized
5.0,"This is the second cable bracelet I’ve bought from this seller & I love it! The price is great compared to other more expensive ones on Amazon. The product is exactly as pictured. Just bought another as a gift for a friend. The only thing I noticed is that it is a little bigger. If you have really small wrists, I’m not sure it would fit you - might be a tad too big. But 10/10 would buy again from this seller!"
5.0,I bought this ring with a bit of hesitation.  I seriously wondered about the quality compared to the price. I did not need to worry. It spins just as great as when I bought it (about 2 months so far). I sleep with it on. I wear it in the shower. There has been no skin discoloration as one usually finds with inexpensive jewelry.  The darkness of the moons has lightened a bit but not too much. Great purchase for the price.
5.0,Very quality and classy!
5.0,Like walking on a cloud!
5.0,Very nice.  As described.<br />#14463#
5.0,Very low cut...will need to get a camisole
5.0,"These are great-fitting and have been awesome for travel, long walks or runs, and anytime compression is needed to prevent or eliminate edema/ swelling!"
5.0,"I wish I didn’t like these pants so much, because now I want them in every color. Great fit. I am a solid size 4, so I bought small. They’re a bit long, but I prefer that to too short. The waist has a tie, mostly for looks I think because they have elastic, which is fairly loose, not too tight. They’re comfortable, cozy & soft, just like all the BF products. The color I purchased is Beach Rock, which is a soft brown, very neutral. Very nicely made, good quality and they are the genuine article."
5.0,My husband loves this sweatshirt.
5.0,"Love it! I have worn it a couple times and get lots of compliments(sometimes too many when I'm in a hurry) I love how subtle it is but when people actually see the pattern, it's a showstopper! Also it's super comfy, I wear shorts under it though cause it is short. Would love to see it as a shorts jumper. I would rock that too!"
5.0,"Wash them when you get them & be ready to fall in love when they get out the dryer. So soft, so durable. I never want to take them off. I love sweatpants & never knew these are the kind I need in my life. So upset I didn’t trust my gut & buy more than 1."
5.0,These are a solid purchase lots of options and the material seems to be quality I haven't had any discolor or break.
5.0,Loved it! Really great print and I buy shirts oversized and it’s definitely what I was looking for
5.0,"Better than I thought, picture does not do justice."
5.0,😀😀😀😀😀😀
5.0,"Got it for a baby shower, was very cute and felt so comfortable, I was breastfeeding at that time so was very easy for me and tha baby"
5.0,Best sunblock for my forehead when I take the convertible out for a ride.
5.0,"Fits great! Holds her foot really nicely! I like the Velcro strap, it adds a little more security and stability. She wore them camping straight out of the box with no issues. I don't know if they give blisters without socks or not, since she has been wearing a light sock with them."
5.0,Really nice purse it's been my every day purse for a couple of months now and is holding up great.
5.0,We went on a road trip to Colorado and surprisingly the ears and nose stand on perfectly especially with some snow on the nose.  Definitely will purchase again if they start to fail which hopefully takes a few years
5.0,It was as my granddaughter expected. Very well made and looks great on her.  She loves it!
5.0,This is exactly as it show and is an adorable backpack.
5.0,"I have been in search of the perfect bra that fits all my needs for years now. For the past 5 years or so (out of comfort) I have resorted to only wearing sports bras. The things I must have in any bra are: the ability to adjust the straps, the ability to adjust around the rib cage. I have a very large and wide rib cage so if a bra fits me in the cup or the straps it isn’t big enough around my rib cage and vice versa. Also, I have an auto immune disease which causes flareups and my skin will be very sensitive to any types of material and it can be painful so I am always looking for soft fabric. I have tried on hundreds of different types of bras and brands both in store and from online ordering over the years and was unsuccessful in finding any that I could stand to wear. This is the very first bra that not only checked off all boxes of what I was looking for, but is super comfortable and supportive. I am ordering 10 more just like it!!!"
5.0,Great case for my Oakleys.  I barely need a case since I use a visor clip.  This is great for traveling at a third of the price of the Oakley case.
5.0,I love the material.  It arrived on time.  Just the right length for 5’11” person.
5.0,"I've longed for the perfect Irish wool sweater for years; today it arrived! Soft (not a bit itchy), thick, the legendary Irish cable knit craftsmanship and a new twist with the waterfall style.<br />this package left Ireland & arrived in America in two days!!  Surely a feat my Irish ancestors dreamed of!<br />Ah, but then upon arrival in New York, much like immigration back then, it languished there for a week.<br />But don't hesitate for the NY delay-very well worth the wait."
5.0,"For great, super comfy"
5.0,Ear protection fits in perfectly good to keep them stored I. Tool box and not get ruined
5.0,Really elegant
5.0,Nice and lightweight. Very cute outfit. True to size!

5.0,Great easy dress wash and wear! Got a medium and for reference I’m 5’8” 133lb and loved the fit.
5.0,Great for winter!
5.0,"I just LOVE my Locket that holds my 14.5 yr old Lab's picture as well as a lock of her hair.  Everyone comments on how beautiful it is!  I did need to get a longer chain, I would just ask that the choices go to a 32"" length.  Would purchase again or get for a gift!"
5.0,This is a great oversized shirt.
5.0,These brackets make wearing a mask so comfortable! The ear loop sides ensure it doesn't move or fall out and the black color blends into the masks I like to wear.
5.0,"I've only had this case for a couple of weeks, but it seems durable. It was purchased as a replacement for the original case, which I had lost. My glasses fit pretty easily in the case. I leave the cleaning cloth in the case to fill up some of the volume since there's space between my eyeglasses and the top of the case."
5.0,This was a gift for my niece's daughter's fourteenth birthday.  She was delighted with it.
5.0,"I bought the 2X, from china will run small, I am an XL 5'8. I bought it in red, omg looked fantastic and I received so many compliments on it i'm on here to buy another one..super cute!!!"
5.0,late in returning
5.0,"The best keychain i have ever owned.  Rock solid, and fits all the keys i need it to.  I bought 2 so i had a spare."
5.0,"This dress fits me so well, and has the most beautiful gleam to it. It also came with a darling headband. I 100% reccomend this amazon shop for your dresses."
5.0,Exactly what my 10yo was looking for. Comfortable and cute.
5.0,"Very fun and good deal. I purchased these for a week long vacation along the south Florida coast and shared them with a full house of family. Everyone got a choice of color and had no worries using and abusing them all week. In the boat, pool, house, out to dinner and etc...."
5.0,Love it fits a bit big but I knew it would cause I’m too small for any of the sizes covers everything and looks fashionable
5.0,I love this purse it's got nice  handle long strap and cute  yorkey with studs
5.0,"I love these gloves!  I have ordered over a dozen pairs of gloves in the past 3 years trying to find a pair that could keep my fingers warm on sub freezing hour long morning walks in the woods with my dog.  I have tried battery operated,  lithium rechargeable,  Northface brand gloves and mittens and many other brands promising warmth.  None delivered until I tried 0zone -30 brand. These gloves are the best I have used yet.  Comfortable fit, a little bulky just like all other ""padded"" gloves but these actually keep my fingers warm better than my $100 lithium battery powered gloves.  I am not sure what the difference is but I do notice that if I take my hand out of the glove for a few minutes that when I put it back in the glove still feels warm on the inside. The outer soft cover of the glove remains cooler during wear and these two experiences indicate to me that the glove is holding in its heat much better than all of my other gloves.  I have not had them out in wet weather yet so I cannot comment on the waterproofing qualities but as hand warmers they have won me over. Again, very comfortable fit and the wrist sleeve is a nice touch.  While it doesn't matter to me as I generally wear them in the woods, the one time I had them out at work I had several positive comments on their looks.  The only caution that I have is that like many gloves I feel that they run a bit small.  I usually wear large and I purchased XL just to be on the safe side and they are comfortably snug.  I  am planning to order a 2XL pair soon.  They were out when I checked last... I guess the word is out!"
5.0,Very nice evening dress
5.0,Still holding up
5.0,fab
5.0,Nice fit!.
5.0,I have not used the glasses yet but the quality seemed OK.  I'm sure they will be just fine.
5.0,My wife absolutely loves it !!<br />She gets compliments all the time.
5.0,Fun shirt. Generous fit. Soft cozy material. Image clear and bright.
5.0,Perfect for my daughter's outdoor wedding.  They fit my shoes perfectly and you could hardly see them.
5.0,Great in the heat and hot winds
5.0,"Purchased for my 14 year old daughter.  It is so lovely.  very nice dress.  She is 5'7"" 110 and the small is a great fit.  A little deeper v neck than she is comfortable with at this age, but a bralette or tank looks so cute layered with this dress."
5.0,"Love the dress, very comfortable, soft material"
5.0,My little boy just love it 😃
5.0,solution to the carpal tunnel problem and improves arthritis.
5.0,"I really like this pink headband! This headband is a very pretty pink, which just happens to be my favorite color. It is very wide so i can use it for multiple hair styles. This headband fits my head snug without being too tight around my head. The material it breathable so it does not cause me to sweat like some other heavier headbands. This headband is very simple but has the potential to be dressed up with the right creative imagination. I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I rely on reviews when considering a purchase so i hope that i am able to help others out."
5.0,"I have been looking for this skirt. Found one somewhere else, was very simliar and it was 5x the cost,  and I almost ordered it but decided to look on Amazon. I took a chance on this and am so glad I did. I plan to wear this a lot during the Holiday season. This is a great addition to most wardrobes, can be very dressed up or simply more casual for entertaining at home.  My only complaint... the zipper was broke.Not a big concern since 1. I can put it on without the use of the zipper because of the elastic back and 2. a zipper is easy and inexpensive to repair or replace. Can't say enough about how happy I am that I found this and am thrilled with the quality."
5.0,"Love it, small and compact and has a middle slot for money that I didn't know about but what a wonderful surprise it was!"
5.0,My mom loved it. Purchased for her for memory of her sister!! Very dainty and classy!
5.0,"These are better than I expected them to be. Material is so soft and silky and fit is on point. I am 5’8 155 lbs and medium fits great. They are not too baggy like some joggers. To me they look more like leggings but they just feel less tight. Don’t expect them to keep you warm in cold winter weather. Other than that, great buy and I will be ordering more colors!"
5.0,Exactly what I expected && I love the dress!!
5.0,They were prefect for my daughters for 8th grade graduation.
5.0,"Pretty, not worn yet,<br /> but Iam looking forward to the right occasion to where them."

5.0,Loves the way it fits on my body
5.0,I love these bands. So many different colors for one low price!!

5.0,too cute.
5.0,These are beautiful and exactly what I wanted for my daughter.
5.0,Fits really well and is good quality.<br />I’m 5 3 and 138lbs. The romper is really flattering

5.0,Absolutely love it! I prefer a large tote to carry everything and this is perfect!

5.0,Fits my cards perfectly.
5.0,Beautiful and sturdy
5.0,Absolutely beautiful dress fits perfect good quality and very beautiful. I really love it and I got the matching one for my daughter too!

5.0,The best purchase of the year! Five stars and plus!
5.0,Looks just like the picture fits true to size
5.0,Fits great vibrant colors
5.0,"These are long enough to be noticed. The three tier disks are lightweight, so you are able to wear them easily without your ears being tugged. These will look great with my new dress."
5.0,Love the style and print domething new in my cardigan kimono style..the only thing ni can say is that its a bit shorter the back lenght for me.maybe 3inch more but i love it
5.0,I bought this Rose set for my grand baby and she loves this set.
5.0,"This outfit was absolutely adorable and made my daughter and myself happy, along with my Sassy two year old granddaughter!!"
5.0,Love it. Using for GYM. Very convenient pocket for the phone. Looks sexy and very comfortable
5.0,"There are a lot of different wallets, not many master the minimalism aspect while still functioning fully. This wallet provides a money clip and hs a shocking amount of pockets for cards, has nice spots for ids and making cards accessible, couldn’t recommend more!"
5.0,"I love how it feels, but it didn't come with a string for the corset in the front. The skirt is longer then expected."
5.0,I just love this backpack! It is the perfect size for me.
5.0,"I have a pear body, my hips and bum around is 41in and my chest size is 36B. I also have a very long torso. The front does stretch really low because of that but besides that it’s one of the best swimsuits I’ve ever had! This swimsuit is built for smaller chest folks."
5.0,Really capable of holding size 12 men's shoes.  Zippers seem good at first use.
5.0,Absolutely stunning earrings. The price was worth it. Gorgeous colors that compliment your style.
5.0,"I really like this shirt. I bought it because it is different from what everyone in Philly is wearing. However I bought a medium and you guessed it, it fits tight. I was able to get my arms min the shirt but i was unable to bend my arms. I hope the seller will let me exchange it for a bigger size. I would recommend this top, just make sure you get a size up from what you would normally wear."
5.0,Very comfortable. I received a lot of compliments
5.0,Good name product.
5.0,I like the wraparound shape and the bifocal component is in a very good position without interfering with your normal field of view. These are very comfortable and handy for cycling and other outdoor activities where you may need a closeup view. Helps keep the bugs [mosquitoes] our of your eyes!  These are a bargain for the price...highly recommended.
5.0,Beautiful like in the photo!
5.0,perfect engagement gift
5.0,very very cute! Fits great makes me look fit & skinny! I wear these for golfing.
5.0,"I know the Evil Eye is a theme you often find in the middle East especially Turkey, but I collect eye-icon jewelry because I'm interested in the old Celtic tradition of ""second sight,"" which this reminds me of.<br /><br />For the price I think this is a steal.  It's really shiny and pretty and looks more expensive than it is.  I have some similar jewelry with inlaid simulated gemstones and I'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between this and one that cost two or three times more.<br /><br />Honestly this is MUCH prettier than the photograph on the website, so I was really pleased when I opened it.  It comes in a nice presentation box and even has a cleaning cloth included.  It doesn't slide around on the chain even though it looks like it might, which is really neither here nor there I think unless you're the type of person who likes to fidget  with your jewelry.<br /><br />It shortens to 16"" but probably won't go much longer than 18"".  I love this and probably will buy something else from this company soon."
5.0,"Hoodie fits like a glove, comfortable and warm!"
5.0,"I have been meaning to make the transition from plastic to reusable bags for a while now, finally sat down to purchase and the reviews are what made my decision on these bags. I can say I made the right choice! Not only are they simple but they are so well made and you get to pick whatever color you want! Excellent bags, hold a lot, great handles, fold down flat...Highly Recommend!!!!!!!"
5.0,Looks great and is very warm
5.0,"Recently, I received these. I have tried many holders but these are, by far, the best! They hold my glasses securely and still remain comfortable.  I give theses 10 out of 10."
5.0,Keeps my glasses close. Does it's job.
5.0,I am usually reluctant to purchase sweaters online without seeing and feeling them in person.  I read the reviews on this turtle neck and decided to take a chance on it. I am NOT disappointed at all!  It is really cute and so comfortable.  I love my turtlenecks and this is now a new favorite!
5.0,"I have worn my last Speidel Twist-O-Flex watch band for over 30 years. The gold plating on it was finally wearing through.  It is a very comfortable band and easy to put-on and take-off.  More importantly, when you snag the band on something its flexibility makes it much less likely to tear the pins out of the watch body which often destroys a watch with plastic connection points.  I hope the black plating on this new band is as durable as the gold plating on the last one.  Note:  if you are somewhat handy, it is possible to remove segments from the band to change the length, though no instructions for this were included.  This is done by folding out the tabs at the edges of adjacent lengths and then pulling out the connector pieces. Then it can be reassembled and the tabs folded back."
5.0,Giveaway for my daughter’s communion.
5.0,I love this boots.

5.0,My daughter loves it. And I order one size up.
5.0,"Jewelry looks amazing and shiny, Its also sturdy. Haven't had a problem yet with tarnishing or loose tops. Gotten a few compliments on one of the dangly ones."
5.0,I love it - if you are looking for small but nice this is it.  Just a nice accent on the nose.  I previously had the curly and L shaped nose rings and lik e this one much better - no chance of this one hanging out of your nostril!
5.0,I loved this top
5.0,"Great for the  $,Thanks"
5.0,These are amazing. Just the right amount of compression. I only wish they had more colors/patterns.
5.0,Love this jacket. The fit accentuated my waist and I love the fur lined hood.
5.0,This goggle is beautiful! Fits perfect! The color is bright pink. Can't wait to take it to the tracks!
5.0,"Love it, got it for my girlfriend as a valentines day gift so not too sure how it'll fit yet on her or after going through the dryer but as of now it looks about her size (i ordered a small). It looks great too! Arrived extremely fast the shipping info said a few weeks it was here in two days, awesome! Only complaint really is the collar wasn't properly folded during shipping so its pretty wrinkled but nothing some ironing won't fix. Over all i'm really satisfied with both the product and the seller as of now but will update on customer service if the fit is not correct."
5.0,"My wife loves this sweater! It's great for people who are taller and have longer arms. The thick cuffs add a nice detail. The snaps are durable and add that something special to the sweater. The material is more heavy weight, not your typical, light-weight cardigan. Easy to dress up or down - wear with jeans and a t-shirt or add some color to a plain black dress."
5.0,"I love this sweater becauseit fits nicely, and it dresses me up when im in jeans or simple dress"
5.0,"Love these! I couldn't believe they are cooler than bare arms, but it is true."
5.0,Cute socks and a great stocking stuffer.
5.0,Adorable...will fit when she is about four months I am guessing.
5.0,Bought toys for tots.
5.0,"I just received it, and I love it😍"
5.0,Great fitting sandal. My children love them. They are durable as well.
5.0,These were great for my vacation.  They cover your face and ears while letting you wear a scrunchie or a ponytail. It also folds and packs well while springing up to original shape as soon as you take it out of of your bag or suitcase.
5.0,"Doing the lords work.<br /><br />Left Hawthorn Athletic in XXS, right Balance Athletica king cheetah print in XS.<br />Overall I like hawthorn more and will be returning balance. The no front seam and deep V butt contour for the authentic balance leggings is nice but the fabric is more stiff and not brushed. The fabric on the hawthorn leggings is sooo soft and is like butter. It’s the closest thing I’ve ever seen to a Lululemon align nulu fabric with their signature naked buttery feeling. The hawthorn leggings are more yellowy which I don’t really mind.<br /><br />Original review<br />Ordered a size XXS and fits perfectly! I usually buy lulu size 2 in stores although I think a size 0 would fit better. These fit better than colorfulkoala pattern leggings because the high waist hits at the most perfect spot (colorfulkoala hits a bit too high for petite ladies IMO) and there is no fabric bunching at the bottom because these are 7/8 length versus full length. The fabric is AMAZING, very similar to colorfulkoala brushed fabric. Not a 100% lulu dupe in terms of fabric but is still extremely soft and dense and worthy of costing 3x as much."
5.0,The dress is super cute fits nicely but it's made of a very snug heavier polyester.  I got hot 🥵 quickly
5.0,A little bit large but really well made and printed. Super happy to have this and will order more from this company!
5.0,It’s waterproof enough for me. I wore this in upstate NY in the low 50s over a turtleneck and its a great light jacket too
5.0,Love love love these pants. So comfy and look nicer than leggings
5.0,Very flattering on me and super comfy and such a nice color
5.0,good product and great quality
5.0,"My Surgery is next week and I was concerned about what I would be able to wear afterwards. Then I saw these and ordered 2. Black and the Gray. They arrived and I tried it on and feels very comfortable. The snaps go all the way from under the arm to the bottom so the sides open completely except for over the shoulder itself. This will make it much easier to put on, though I imagine I will still need help in working the snaps. Like others have said I would be gentle with the snaps on the soft fabric. Since I haven't used them yet I can't say they will hold up but perhaps when I am able to type again I will update this.<br /><br />Update: Three and a half weeks since the surgery and i still use these daily. Well actually mainly at night to sleep in as I can wear button down shirts in the daytime.<br />The black shirt has held up really well. still soft and comfortable. I have had no problems with the snaps on either shirt. The gray shirt starting pilling after one gentle machine wash. Not so with the black. Just glad I got two.<br />I do recommend these to anyone undergoing shoulder surgery. Just make sure you have someone to help with the snaps the first few days. and if possible hand wash or gentle cycle only."
5.0,Beautiful love the way it fits
5.0,"The dress is very pretty. I ordered a medium, I’m 160lbs. I will be ordering more for sure."
5.0,"I love this dress, it's really just so pretty.  Looks as pictured and is even nicer than I expected.  Flowy, light, pretty, elegant.....what more could a girl ask for in a dress!  I an 8/10 and so ordered it in medium.  It's a little snug around the waistband but only a little - I think a large would have been too big elsewhere."
5.0,"Am is d's 7.  Great quality, perfect fit.  Real nice.  I was surprised.  Thank you for the product and quality.  Judy"
5.0,Needed something to wear under a shirt worked perfect. Will order more.
5.0,fabulous!
5.0,"I read the reviews and it stated to order a size bigger, so I did just that. Im usually a small/medium, I have been wanting a jacket exactly like this so I wanted to make sure it fit perfectly, I ended up ordering a large and let me tell you, it fits perfect, guess I would've done fine with medium, but the loose fit and the drawstring waist would compliment any shape. It is not a heavy duty jacket. So the large worked great for layers. Looked exactly as pictured, I think I found my new fave jacket :)"
5.0,"Absolutely love these socks, they are comfy and soft."
5.0,Great quality - like addition of the orange shiny rubber dipped handle gives it a modern twist!
5.0,"Super cute, good material quality!"
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
5.0,Such a good price for such a cute dress. Fits really well and is comfortable. Can't wait to wear it on my Mexico vacay!!!
5.0,It was a gift. My friend loved it! It isn't bulky. It doesn't have to be for just the cold. It is stylish and can be worn with an ensemble.
5.0,"They are 'squat proof', the black ones are not see through at all.  these are a bit 'smoother' than ones I have bought in the past - maybe more spandex? - but I don't mind.  LOVE the pocket on both sides."
5.0,"I love these glasses because i dont have to care if they break or get scratched. They last as long as they do, and im happy. They even look great.<br /><br />I bought 5 pairs last time. Gonna buy 10 more soon."
5.0,This one is thin and it’s lightweight and breathable. Not bad material at all. Bought one before and this time I bought 2 more. I am an outdoor worker and this helps alot not cheaply made either and it is a great size for adults
5.0,Works like it's supposed to.
5.0,It’s cute and okay quality
5.0,This is my second pair of shoes I absolutely love them. I have them in gray. True to size .  I receive a lot of compliments when I wear them. When I do wear them I usually wear a mule sock with them . Great seller Zoo Shoo !
5.0,He's a bigger guy and like bigger jewelry.  He wears it all the time. Never tarnish or fade.
5.0,Very pleased with watch. Comfortable and keeps great time!
5.0,It is very cute fit well my daughter looks really cute in it had alot of very good complements
5.0,"Loved how it fit & looked. Was very comfortable and received lots of compliments. Only disappointment was, the glitter kept coming off on everything and everybody!"
5.0,I love this bathing suit. Received a lot of compliments and it was under $11!!!  True to size!
5.0,Daughter loves it. Seems well made. Pockets are great feature!
5.0,I absolutely love these bras! Fit as expected and so comfortable that I don’t notice that I am wearing one! Will be buying more in the future that’s for sure!
5.0,Love these sunglasses! I Will definitely be ordering more!
5.0,The overall quality of the product is amazing. Time will tell how well it’ll hold up but I’m guessing it’ll be w/ me till the end.
5.0,Love it.  Great product.  Does the job well
5.0,My sister ordered this so she can put on her work vest. She love it!
5.0,I got the hat set for my granddaughter she love's it so do I
5.0,"These jackets are very pretty.  I returned them because they were shorter than I expected.  The description reads in mm, but that means nothing to me.  I didn't realize they would be too short for what I was looking for."
5.0,"So, I was trying to figure out the sizes as they work with USA Equivalents.  Now, I chose the 3XL or US Large.  I expected that it would be on the tight side and have a more Asian fit, but it seems H2H did their homework and the sizes are similar to standard US sizes (a little roomier).  I Am 6'1&#34; with an athletic build and the size is a little loose and not an athletic fit.  It does fit well though.  I can only imagine after washing, it will have a closer to true large than what it is now.  Colours are rich, it's very soft, made well.  I don't think you can go wrong for the price.  I'm going to try one of the shirts next time and see how those fit."
5.0,Very nice!  Warm but not hot.
5.0,l Love it! Have recieved many compliments!
5.0,A great product.
5.0,"We have these in every car and even have a set to hang produce in our kitchen. They roll down to nothing, wash easily, and they’re sturdy. (They also scream “I care about the earth,” if you’re into that sort of thing. ;)"
5.0,Love it<br />I used it for work
5.0,"These shorts were a bit looser before I tumble dried them but it is okay. After drying these they are just a bit more snug, nothing that some stretch after next wash won't fix.<br /><br />I usually order pants and shorts M, but I have to say if I ordered these in L I might like them just a bit more. They are pretty snug when sitting down in them.<br /><br />As far as material, it is mainly cotton (65%) so they do feel very nice."
5.0,Just what we wanted!!!! Great cap.
5.0,beautiful scarf and quick shipping.
5.0,Perfect for the parent who doesn’t have time to deal with the elf! My daughter loved her gnome.
5.0,"The shirt is manufactured by the same clothiers for Stacy Adams garments. It's got a nice fit. Very lightweight, great rich color. Goes well with some tan or deep coffee brown slacks and OF COURSE one of my 30 pairs of Stacy Adams shoes... YESSS!!!"
5.0,They only came up barely past my knee but I still love them. Very comfortable.
5.0,Had to have One Nation Charm Bangle and I enjoy wearing it with other Alex & Ani
5.0,My daughter's only birthday request when asked was a pair of kitty cat earrings.  I figured I could find something on amazon and I was right :)  I'm glad I went with these ones.  She loves them and they haven't bothered her sensitive ears yet either.
5.0,"Love this shoe. Great fit, comfortable.  Will buy again."
5.0,This shirt is so cute and good quality!
5.0,Extremely comfortable fits perfectly and it has pockets yes!
5.0,I bought this key case for my husband's birthday. He loves it. No sharp objects in his pockets. It's long enough for the car keys and large enough for the remote.
5.0,"Exactly as shown, beautiful bracelet. I purchased this one as a gift for my husband. Can't wait to give it to him for his birthday in March!!"
5.0,My 9 year old loved it.
5.0,"Very cute product, arrived sooner than expected, great fit, and wonderful service."
5.0,"As described, some of the only ultralights I could find that actually have the double zipper system to compress. If you don’t want to compress (it wrinkles clothes a bit) you can leave second zipper undone and it is just a regular ultralight packing cube. Great deal."
5.0,Awesome for the price.
5.0,The fabric and th fit of the dress was comfortable.
5.0,These are my absolute favorite shoes for the summer. I purchased these for a recent trip to Europe and I walked miles in them each day. Never once did they hurt or cut up my feet. My feet are slightly wider and these fit them perfectly. I highly recommend!
5.0,Bello.
5.0,Fit's true to size. Very comfortable. Not too baggy in sleeves like a mens jersey would be.
5.0,"I bought these for my father and he loves them. They are perfect. They are lighter then the ones he used to have so thats a plus, and they're really warm."
5.0,"Love the earrings,  nice variety"
5.0,The silicone bra worked and fit perfect. good quality and stayed on even it was hot weather.<br />I highly recommend this bra
5.0,I love this dress!  It is subtle yet surprising.  The lace overlay is soft and gives the dress movement.  I typically wear a 4-6 Petite and the small fit perfectly.  BE Careful when steaming the dress as a hot iron will burn a hole in the lace:-(  The illusion neckline is lovely and the scalloped hem adds wonderful detail.
5.0,Amazing clarity and sun filtering
5.0,they are very soft and warm and they fit perfectly. need to get another set of them.
5.0,They all look great.
5.0,Exactly like the picture and this dress really hugs your body.
5.0,"Too small, recomend a size larger.."

5.0,so cute. Used these for my KEYS OF A HAPPY MARRIAGE tags.
5.0,These are super adorable. Very comfy and the price was on point.
5.0,Converted Chihuahua charm into a necklace. Bracelet too big for my wrist

5.0,Like socks
5.0,"This is the softness, most comfortable T-shirt I’ve ever owned!"
5.0,"Gave it as a gift, they were delighted."
5.0,So cute!!!!
5.0,Amazing colors and qualty.
5.0,Love the mask very light . Great for wking out as well.
5.0,"I love these capri leggings. These are so comfy. I read that they were a little big so I went with my usual size but I kind of wish I had gone a size up. They feel just a tad tight. Oh well, I plan on working towards losing about 10 lbs and that should fix the issue."
5.0,Looks like a real jewelry type chain. No links to get caught in sweaters. Really enjoying it.
5.0,"I love these slippers! They are perfect for hardwood floors, and are so fluffy and comfy with or without socks, and the memory foam provides support on hard floors. They fit a little big, so my strap always falls off my ankle, but I can still walk in them and it doesn’t bother me too much. Would definitely buy again!"
5.0,"Just what I wanted for 2nd & 3rd  ear piercings. Great size, likes them so much got 2 pairs. They wear well & sit flush to the ar."
5.0,love the way this hat fits my big head
5.0,They run small. I'm 5'11 and 200lbs and the extra large was snug but not unwearable. I bought a 2nd pair of 2xlarge which fit perfit. Very satisfied with the quality and padding.
5.0,Was very surprised this scarf is huge!  Was a perfect gift for my son.
5.0,Get so many compliments on it
5.0,Just collars and they are just what I wanted and fit great

5.0,Gift and he loves it....!
5.0,"Pretty soft, fits perfect, a pretty good qualitie and so confortable.<br />It looks amazing with everything."
5.0,See my review for Oval Scarf Ring. Their convertibility from pin to scarf ring is nice. Pin is beautiful and nice quality.
5.0,Got it as a gift for my mom she loved it. so nice and light great for pool parties and get togethers in the summer heat. Kinda confusing to put it on with the strings at first but we figured it out:)
5.0,Bought this item as a present for my daughter. She is a huge fan of The Mortal Instruments books and movie. It's a solid well made large ring on a chain. Looks very similar to what you see in the movie.
5.0,Darn tough socks are my favorite. Can’t go wrong with any of their products.
5.0,These are really nice pants. Material is comfortable and looks good.  One size was just a little snug so I went up a size and those were swimming on me. 3 inch difference in waist for one size. Unfortunately I had to return both.
5.0,Arrived on time. Perfect for the occasion!
5.0,Very nice quality & got them a lot sooner than estimated!
5.0,Looked amazing.. got a lot of compliments
5.0,Love it! It's exactly as pictured and pretty decent quality. Very satisfied!
5.0,"I wear hats everyday... typically wear New Era but I needed a lite white hat to run a marathon, this hat was incredibly comfortable.. i don't typically like white hats for casual use so I'll probably look for this hat in other colors for casual use."
5.0,"So cute!  It does fit like the photo, form fitting.  The fabric is a nice light to medium weight.  Looks cute with jeans."
5.0,Very nice. Good detail. It is small. It is pretty and is a nice piece of jewelry.
5.0,"Was as pretty as the photo, thank you."
5.0,Worked very well and didn’t fog up
5.0,"This thing paid for itself in compliments on the first day of wearing. Beautiful stitching, incredible craftsmanship and the highest quality fibers.<br />Pairs well with a pint of stout now lads."
5.0,It's a cute dress and fits well.
5.0,"Wintertime temps...on my Ankles,Legs, and over my Knees"
5.0,very comfortable!
5.0,"It fits great, snd my legs feels awesome"
5.0,"I bought 3 for my grandbabies - a 5 week old, a 17 month old and a 19 month old. They are adorable!"
5.0,Excellent quality. Wish there were more colors.
5.0,"Comfy, cute and warm. I wear it all the time now!"
5.0,I got a large but it fits like a very small medium. The shipping was very slow. I like the shirt but these sizes are way off.
5.0,Exactly what I wanted and matches my Rose Gold necklace.
5.0,love it very nice
5.0,Great outfit!
5.0,I like them they were not too tight but the chain is too short that was my only grievance
5.0,Really nice & well made
5.0,"It's easy to wash, looks like a normal shirt and is comfortable to wear. It's a bit on the roomier side. The shirt collects lint easier than other shirts, but otherwise, it's exactly what I needed after a surgery left me with limited arm mobility."
5.0,ibid
5.0,Great price. These usually retail for $15+ each.
5.0,"Nice lightweight, water proof Apron<br />Happy with purchase"
5.0,I ordered a large and it fits perfect!! Love the color!!
5.0,These socks are my new favorites! They are thick enough to cushion and yet they breath too. My feet don't sweat. They seem like they will last a good long time. I will absolutely get them again.
5.0,It is a present
5.0,"I got this for my 3 year old granddaughter. 2 pieces are easier for potty breaks, and I like the extra coverage."
5.0,"Because of my hypothyroidism I gained a lot of weight so I stopped wearing dresses. This the first time that I feel confident wearing one, I loved it and I just got my second one! Will buy more for sure 🥰"
5.0,Gorgeous. Very figure flattering.
5.0,For my grandchild for Christmas.  I'll ask my daughter about your comfort and width questions.  Don't think arch support is needed for a 2.3/4 year toddler.  Adorable and looked like a very nice quality.
5.0,"I used this bracelet for the healing powers that moonstones possess.  I like it because it's easy to put on and take off, it's sturdy, and it's pretty."
5.0,Very interesting and unique earrings! Eclectic asymmetrical design! These are fun and light and well made. They're great!
5.0,Easy to dispense and use. Very small jug but it covers a lot of material.
5.0,"This is absolutely adorable on every level of babies. Little Tucker is going to be a ham in it. I'd say it's slightly small but for the most part it's true to size. I got the seven months size and it's like a six month so close. I'd say it's about right for American sizes. The material is not very thick and is perfect for the mild winter states. The monkey on the front is cute, the ears on the hood make this so adorable, but the monkey on the bum makes this topple over the cuteness radar!!!! I love babies they are just so beautiful and this outfit is just adorbs!!!!! This will make any little baby happy to wear on a chilly day. I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest unbiased review, this is my own opinion of the actual use of this product."
5.0,"Love them, they actually stay on your feet"
5.0,Really nice Grandsons loved them!<br />Debbie
5.0,"Great fit. Exactaly what I wanted, will be purchasing more."
5.0,The glasses are a great quality and exceeded my expectations especially cost!!!
5.0,Awesome band!!
5.0,"This is a good ring! I've worn mine daily for a couple months now and it's solid. Hasn't lost its shape or its color. My finger hasn't changed color, either."
5.0,I like these more than I thought I would.
5.0,I really like this dress. I am 5' and about 120# and I ordered a small. The fit is a little snug around my hips (due to being short) but I love the dress. I ordered the hot pink and it is true to the color shown on the website. I recommend this dress for date night 😊
5.0,I love this hat the fit is perfect I have a black coat and a gray coat and the hat looks nice with both coats.
5.0,Great sweater. Exactly as pictured. I would size up for a looser fit.
5.0,"I didn't trust the sizing information and ordered size 12. I wear 8-10 and these are plenty big. I think I can make them work, but don't make the same mistake I did. These are a good qualitiy product, every bit as good as higher priced garments.  Received in a very timely manner."
5.0,I like these better than captive hoops for my septum
5.0,"First and foremost i shipped positively fast! First impression is wow what a sturdy well built sling for under 15 bucks! The sling consists of a metal plate which has a space for the carabiner and one for a hand strap! All while retaining the 1/4 screw mount for a tripod! The strap is pretty sturdy and had this awesome pad for max comfort with a zipper pocket for extra memory cards or batteries or anything really. The strap also has a sturdy plastic adjustable clamps with teeth for grip. This is great for quick adjustments to strap length. Speaking of strap length I am a big boy(250+) and the length of the strap was comfortably long! No gripes here. Now on to the concern. The carabiner, though it may look great with a polished gun metal finish it is no a cheaper quality metal. It has not yet snapped on me yet but coupled with the previous reviews and looking at it, it's clearly and noticeably a cheaper metal so my solution was to go to my local outdoors store and buy a more reliable metal rock climbing carabiner.<br />With all that said I am impressed with what I got for what I payed! Don't mind other reviews they're all bitter and clearly not creative enough to solve the problem before hand.<br />Whelp, cheers and good luck fellow buyers and photographers!"
5.0,"I teach kindergarten so I am constantly on the move. If I want to dress up without killing my feet, I can wear these because they are so comfortable. The pump is the perfect height!"
5.0,Thin material. Great dress. Thanks. I love it.
5.0,I really do like this item. I would say it more for display and not actual wear. But that is fine. I love it.<br />It has good quality.
5.0,"They were perfect! Ordered for my daughter's group of dancers/singers.  They are 8 years old and different sizes and this tutu worked for everyone.  They loved that it was reversible, too!  It worked out great as party of their holiday show and they plan to use again for upcoming talent show.<br />Pleased with quality and would order again.  Good price.  Have noticed a little fraying on bottom edge after a few wears, but not too bad.  It is certainly serving its purpose!<br />Girls happy...moms happy!!!"
5.0,They fit well and feel nice to wear. Classy.
5.0,Nice fit. Soft material and very comfy. Top is kind of snug but I have huge breasts (f cup) so that is expected
5.0,"It stopped the leak, works well"
5.0,"Bought this for my daughter to go with a long sleeved black shirt dress with pockets. It went fabulous! Accented very well, made the otherwise plain dress a hit! She's 17years old and loved it."
5.0,These socks are so soft.  I bought them to sleep in.  They are not tight.  You almost forget you have them on.
5.0,Replacing Uggs that I used for 5 years. These are MUCH better quality.  It’s not even close. I have EEE width and the multiple size adjustments are awesome.  Best ever!
5.0,"Purchased this for my husband because he is a child at heart. He has been bugging me for a set of pajamas there were one piece. I wanted to make sure I was purchasing that wasn't cheap in quality. This is a great set. It could easily be used as a costume for Halloween. The feet part is detachable, there is a zipper. Great purchase. I would recommend this to anyone."
5.0,"Really light and comfortable to wear. Used it after getting a surgery to the face to stop sweat from getting on my face when I walk, and they really reduced the sweat rolling down my face and keep my hair out of the way. Also realy like the color selection for they match anything I wear which is an added bonus."
5.0,Works great on my Samsung Gear S2 (non-classic). The silver tabs on the inside have lost their shine but it does not affect the performance at all. Great Buy.
5.0,This robe was discribed accurately.  Fit perfect as discribed.  Perfect for my 87 yr old mother exactly what she wanted
5.0,I lost the one I got with my sunglasses and ordered this one. Exactly the same quality.
5.0,This tie is the most amazing tie to ever tie
5.0,"Beautiful dress.!! I read some of the reviews and took their advice and ordered a bigger size. Normally my daughter wears a 12 juniors,  I ordered a size 16 and it fit perfect."
5.0,I absolutely love this dress. It is so comfortable. I would recommend it to anyone. Fits in exactly the size I ordered.
5.0,Given as a gift. They seem to like.
5.0,I does what it is supposed to do. See it better with this.
5.0,Awesome shoe
5.0,"My daughter LOVES the Falcons, Julio, and this jersey!"
5.0,"Very chill dress. Roomy & Comfy. Lots of static, but only tried on once.  Like it!"
5.0,"Love the Renata holder.  BUT, I placed order for both hearing aids and the key ring holder at the same time.  They arrived 2 weeks apart and I was charged $5.99 item.  I am not happy about that!!!!"
5.0,Very cute and good quality. Good value for some socks that are a bit different. I am a size 6 (36 European) and these fit fine. I wouldn't be confident they'd work on much bigger feet though.
5.0,Beautiful and nicely made. I expected cheap material.
5.0,"This is a great band.  It is very comfortable and doesn't pull hair.  The brushed finish is very nice but a bit too shiny to match the titanium GPW Military watch I bought it for so I blasted it with 120 mesh aluminum oxide.  Now it's a perfect match and a stunning combo.  The clasp is very secure and perfect for those of us with an active lifestyle.<br /><br />This band has a 3 position adjustment and fits my wrist fine without cutting but I decided to cut one row of links to make it a bit tighter.  I have cut links out of other shark mesh bands with a dremel and it was not a problem.  I noticed a couple low ratings because some folks aren't handy with a rotary tool and cutoff wheel.  Rating the band poorly based on their lack of skill with a dremel is not appropriate imo and is unfair to the quality of the band.  I didn't get any consideration/compensation for this review but the whiners who blamed the band because they are inept with a dremel got my dander up so I went the extra mile with pics and text.<br /><br />My method is to tape the band to a piece of cardboard with only the links (actually a wire coil) you want to cut exposed.  Wear safety glasses and cut one side of the links with the rotary tool and a cutoff wheel, then use needle nose pliers to gently twist out the remaining pieces.  Finally you may have to squeeze the last row a bit with the pliers if it is stretched from removing the cut pieces..  Simple and easy.  You can take it a jeweler to have it done if you aren't the handy sort.<br /><br />I could not be happier with this watch band, it is of equal quality to those I paid over a hundred bucks for.  Great product!"
5.0,I wore this to my brother's wedding.  I paired it with a cute little jacket. It was perfect. I loved that this dress' pleating works perfect for women with a tummy. My husband and I both love the feel of the fabric.
5.0,Se desgasta la pintura muy rapido
5.0,"They are cut in such a way that they catch the light nicely.  When cleaning them, they come up very nice!  The color is not as deeply hued as the picture but still very good quality.  I find the sparkle that comes from the cut creates a prism of colors when you turn your head.  Of course, not every color like a diamond but it's an interesting look.<br />Unfortunately, I dropped the earring backs down the drain and had to replace them with a cheap pair.  I personally don't think they're small stones.  They are approximately 1 karat as stated in the description.  However, the posts are a tad on the short side but do have a notch on the end where the backings are supposed to be stopped from sliding off.  So, if you have a thicker earlobe you may not like these.  I do find them to be worth the price.  I just really wish I hadn't dropped the backs.  The replacements I purchased are definitely not as good as the silver ones provided and I'm just hoping keep the earrings on.  If you keep them clean, they really do look nice :D"
5.0,"Nice watch, love the sparkle and the wrap around style."
5.0,Liked this dress. Fits just right.
5.0,My husband loved it! And the craftsmanship on it is really good quality!
5.0,Love the size of tjus bag. The quality us oergection!
5.0,A great reproduction of Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman mask which came after the original one having a full rubber face included.
5.0,Wife loves it and wears it well!  I did good!
5.0,Love them! Exactly as described
5.0,"If you have a normal standard structure, as God intended, this hat will be your favorite."
5.0,"Great fit, didn’t turn my daughters finger green! She’s a happy girl"
5.0,"These are excellent goggles, especially for the price! I have tried a few brands from Amazon and even Roka's and I seem to have problems with all of them (usually leaking). I have a smaller head and these are larger goggles but they fit and seal well. I am very impressed by the clarity underwater. These are sharper than my most recent goggles which were Roka R2s. These are also much more comfortable."
5.0,"Not as heavy as I thought it would be, it is surprisingly comfortable and very cool! A somewhat subtle way to show appreciation for the show at work or out and about without wearing a communicator pinned to my shirt, ha ha.  If you have any metal allergies however, I would caution against it, the description just says metal, and although I have a nickle allergy I gambled and bought it anyway and my ear lobe did become quite swollen, (the earring might not be nickel, it might be another metal that my skin does not agree with), but the post can be removed and I just glued on a sterling post and it's perfect now. So if you have sensitive skin or metal allergies I would recommend going with a slightly fancier reproduction, I've seen sterling silver ones for sale, otherwise this is the best on the market!"
5.0,Pretty much liked this one..!!
5.0,"Love the colors on this dress and it glides down your body and is very forgiving for those of us getting a little ""fluffy"" as I call it.  The material has a nice weight to it and is not see thru.  I had to wait for this dress and could not be happier.  Now if I can just get on that cruise ship and show it off!  You will love it too!"
5.0,These earrings are just what I wanted them to be. I were them most of the time.
5.0,Very nice.  It has a horizontal texture that is really pretty and is a bit longer in the body.
5.0,"This is my favorite color this season! I fell in love with the lace overlay. Fits great! I ordered a XL due to the reviews I read. Glad it sized up. Would have been too tight around the mid section. I’m 5’9”, 180lbs. The length is perfect too. Not too short."
5.0,"I love this band.  It is quite comfortable and the doesn't seem to stretch or shift during the day.  The gold color looks good with my gold iWatch.  At first it seemed a little too bright to match, but after wearing it for a couple of weeks the shine has faded and now it matches quite well.  I am very pleased with this band and recommend it highly.  As others have mentioned, the clasp and connecters are silver, but that doesn't bother me as I generally wear a mix of metals anyway."
5.0,Absolutely love these blue light glasses. Such a reasonable price for 2 pairs of glasses. Definitely helps with seeing the computer screen and phone. Hoping to relieve every day headaches.
5.0,"I travel for work and am constantly in front of clients (meetings, presentations, schmoozing, etc.). I am forever tucking in my shirt, due to the inevitable creep up that occurs getting in and out of cars, raising my arms, or just getting up and sitting down. Some guys always look put together. I know that real life can not always mimic the perfection of the guys wearing suits in GQ, but I don't want to look like a slob, either. I ordered the advanced shirt stays with a little bit of skepticism. Still skeptical when the small box arrived and I examined the stays. They look as they do in the product photo. There is an informational insert (minimal), but &#34;a picture is worth a thousand words&#34;, as they say. Very simple; your foot goes through the loop end (over your sock), and the stay aligns to the outside of your leg and thigh and you attach the reinforced clamps to your shirttail. The stays are completely adjustable in terms of length, to assure a good fit. Once your trousers are on, there is nothing visible except the black band of the stay between your cuff and shoe. I suppose it could be worn beneath your sock, or, if you prefer, they have a style of stays that clamp to the top of your sock and dispense with the loop altogether.<br /><br />Bottom line, they work and are comfortable and you look a heck of a lot more together. I received the stays for free in order to review them. I am providing my unbiased opinion."
5.0,"I bought this for my wife for our 5 year anniversary (which is today, June 19). I'll find out soon just how food a gift this is!"
5.0,"Perfect! And for those who criticized the set because the Fez and the bow tie are slightly different shades of red (the bow tie is more of a wine/maroon) - those people obvious don't watch Dr. Who. This is a set based on Dr. Who, and in the series when the Doctor (Matt Smith) is sporting a fez and bow tie, they are slightly different shades. This set is true to the description and the series. So, if you are looking for a set reflecting the show (for Cosplay/Halloween), then this is a great choice! The only legitimate concern is that the Fez is not full-size as in the show. BUT, it is CLEARLY a smaller version in the picture."
5.0,"I LOVE THIS PURSE, IT IS JUST WHAT I WANTED"
5.0,All on schedule good product
5.0,"The fit was perfect, and the quality is good."
5.0,Received as expected.
5.0,Very soft and comfortable. I wish they had pockets but pockets are rare in women's clothing.  I will order more of these  in different colors and would recommend them to my friends.
5.0,"Comfy cute shoes.  I am a 7, sometimes 7.5 US sizing and ordered a 38.  They are comfy and slightly snug on the toes. (no socks)  Not so much I won't wear them, but for my next pair I will try a 39. The material is sturdy but soft enough that it does not rub my heels, something I was concerned about given the style.  The colors are as bright as the picture.  Also, there is a way to make the ankle strap smaller as there are two holes. I am very happy I gave these a try and will buy more patterns."
5.0,"I liked the dress.  It's part polyester, so it does stretch a bit, if needed.  The color will match the theme of my granddaughters upcoming bridal shower in July, which is yellow.  Beautiful summer color."
5.0,I travel a lot for 2 and 3 day business trips.  This bag is very well made.  Six stars!
5.0,This pin is just wonderful!
5.0,"Good fit, nice and warm. My flip flops and I love them."
5.0,Great boots! They arrived on time in the condition i expected them to be in. I would advised my fellow officers to try these boots. I also like how you can hide the boot laces into the tongue of the boot.
5.0,I purchased this for my nieces baby
5.0,They look as real as faux gauges could look.
5.0,Got this for his birthday and he loves it!
5.0,Just got this item today. Nice! I'm already wearing them!. Unbelievable great deal! These earrings are really large and exactly what I was hoping for!

5.0,My girlfriend loved them
5.0,I loved this product. It provided a little warmth without being too heavy.
5.0,"Very stylish, comfortable top. Dressier than a T-shirt but just as comfortable."
5.0,"Me gusta lo bien acabado que está el producto y fue más allá por lo bueno del material dorado, que no se deteriora y lo uso para hacer deporte con sudor, me baño con el y perfecto.<br />Gracias"
5.0,"Very comfortable. I ordered up a size thinking that I needed too but it was more loose then expected. Still looks great. I did order another one but in my size, which is a medium. SUPER COMFORTABLE AND SOFT! Worth the price."
5.0,Están. Bellos
5.0,"I was surprised by the packaging. Thought that I had invested a lot more for this product. Outside on a sunny day, I have  clear undarkened view, almost as if I weren't wearing the sunglasses. They came with a quality grade protective pouch and a cleaning rag."
5.0,"Great, durable socks. I've used them for over a month of moderate running and haven't seen any decline in quality. They really don't slip! You also can't feel the non-stick gel while wearing them, either. Best of all, they're comfortable. I'll be ordering another set just to make sure I have them for a while."
5.0,Love it.  Really pretty.
5.0,Nice color in them
5.0,"Excellent padding.  A little big, but still an wear them comfortably.  I want another pair, but I'll get a size smaller this time."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:5b84bd59ec47de3bfd3bd691ce3e6e84]] Very beautiful silk scarf, the color is very good, the fabric feels smooth, it is very comfortable to wear, and it is very warm. I can usually use it with clothes and go to a party. I like it very much and want to buy another color."
5.0,"Super cute, love it!"
5.0,"I bought this bag as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She hasn't seen it yet, but I think the quality is good."
5.0,"I love this dress, great quality, not see through"
5.0,Perfect for sleeping or just lounging around the house
5.0,Pretty print. Almost a compression garment. Take a tuck in the elastic under the bust to get more support. Keep foam support in place with a few stitches. Received many compliments wearing this on the Riviera Maya.
5.0,"Fits Series 3 Apple watch great! Very comfortable and pretty! Was concerned it would be too loose on wrist, but it fits perfectly!"
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for! Fast shipping.
5.0,Loved the sun glasses.  With my gray hair they look good because of the colored frames.  They fit good over my regular glasses.
5.0,"The touch feature works very well. However, to drive with them is difficult as they are very slick on the steering wheel. They are not good driving gloves."
5.0,LOVE these gorgeous mother-of-pearl earrings!  They are elegant and have just enough shimmer for day or night.  Lavishly Hip is an excellent vendor~ I received this order as quickly as amazon delivery.  Kendra Scott makes high quality jewelry at reasonable price~ very stylish with casual or dressy outfits.  Love Kendra Scott jewelry~ I plan to purchase more of her beautiful creations soon!
5.0,It's so cute. I draws a lot of compliments and I love it. Thanks for the fast shipping!
5.0,Love this shirt. Fits me good and I am 5'8 120lbs. I could see it being to tight on a big busted person.
5.0,Perfect for my winter work months
5.0,"Absolutely love the hat. Made well, very colorful, my son absolutely loves it!!"
5.0,Perfect Christmas present
5.0,My husband is very difficult to shop for. I took a chance and purchased these slipper. My husband is having side effects from his cancer medicine that cause his feet to hurt so bad that he has a hard time walking. I surprised him with these slippers and he LOVES them! He says it feels like walking on a cloud ⛅️ He actually wears them to work. I will definitely purchase more of these slippers. They are well made and do look like outdoor shoes. Thank you for a well made product.
5.0,Lovely purple Cat eye shaped readers.<br />Very cute on!
5.0,Really  fits nicely
5.0,Very cute little kid dress. Light weight but not see through
5.0,These are the best silks and worth the money!
5.0,"OMG I love this keychain! It’s beautiful, sturdy and the box it came in is awesome too."
5.0,"This is an excellent product for watch owners! Be warned however that the thin rod tip bends very easily so please use extreme care. If it does bend, simply gently bend it back to its original state or as close to it as you can. It's a great product and I don't have to go to a jeweler to get my bands replaced. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with at least one watch."
5.0,"This was my 4th top of this kind and I only had one delivery mishap, which happened to be with this pink one. It fits and wears well, hides my areas that I'm self conscious about (extra large chest [36F], armpit/back fat), and is beautifully chic! With prime I exchanged the damaged item for a new one without any problems!<br /><br />A must have in many colors!!!!"
5.0,Bought this as a funny gift but the fit turned out to be perfect!
5.0,Fabric is shiny but it is silky and relatively thick. Ruching is much better on this pair and very high waist which I like!
5.0,"These tops are beautiful and flattering, and the fabric is soft and stretchy, yet breathable. I haven't had them very long, but they seem high-quality and well made. A great value for the price."
5.0,"This was for a gift, everyone was impressed"
5.0,I got this for my niece. She loves this top and looks adorable in it!
5.0,"I can't wait for an opportunity to wear these booties.  They fit perfectly, are very comfortably and have a classic design that will serve me well for years!"
5.0,Muy buen material.
5.0,Literally the most amazing smelling hand soap I've ever used. Worth every penny.
5.0,Such a good looking sock!  So glad to find something like this in Xlarge.
5.0,Bought for son while he was in Florida....He took them home with him he liked them so much
5.0,was smaller than thought
5.0,"This product is just what the Doctor ordered. I needed to protect my eyes from soap & water when bathing, after my cataract eye surgery. These goggles kept my eyes dry while showering. This isn't what these goggles were made for, but work great, anyway! I'm 75 years old & don't swim anymore."
5.0,"These are great bands for my Fitbit!<br /><br />These bands allow me to easily change things up depending on my mood and they are durable. I've had these for a couple of months and they are holding up great. One of my biggest pet peeves is a wet wristband after washing my hands. These let me really slip it up my arm out of the way without the hassle of taking my watch off. When the band does get wet I'm able to dry it off easily and quickly, usually just by squeezing it with paper towels. They also don't snag on things like my favorite metal band did."
5.0,I absolutely love the swimming suit it's beautiful
5.0,So awesome!  I'm loving them comfortable and an amazing look!
5.0,I will add photos in the spring when i can fully don this suit of armor! I recommend ancient hub! They were very responsive to my questions and always answered quickly! Sometimes before i could get back to my computer!
5.0,Perfect fit. Goes right behind the head so I won’t mess my hair up. Keeps my ears nice and warm
5.0,Feels fantastic.  Fits great.
5.0,I bought the small for my 11 year old. It fits her with room to grow.
5.0,So pretty and light weight.  Love it.
5.0,My husband loves them and they fit him perfect.
5.0,Beautiful and you can't go wrong with the price. Would recommend.
5.0,Les encanto Como regalo
5.0,"I never write reviews but I was so impressed by these that I felt I had to share.  These are the first leg warmers I've ever tried and I love them.  They fit perfectly, they stay in place without leaving deep impressions around my leg and ankle, they don't itch, they're soft and most importantly they are very warm and comfortable.  They are definitely worth the price."
5.0,Great hat.  Would buy again.
5.0,"Very soft, excellent fit, a light weight hat.  LOVED IT"
5.0,love it. just what i was looking for
5.0,"Live the color, fabric. Better than expected,"
5.0,Great Deal!
5.0,Great items and arrived safe and sound / well priced
5.0,Very nice silky scarf.  Good for summer wear.
5.0,No complaints. But they did accidentally send me one extra sock which is a little confusing. So I have ten pairs and a single sock just in case I lose one? Yeah they’re socks. Fit perfectly and were exactly as expected.
5.0,It's a little snug but my daughter loves it. Order up a size maybe
5.0,"This hoodie is very well-made, and nicer looking than in the picture.  My husband that it is warm, but light.  He can use it under a heavy coat in the coldest weather and will be perfect for  spring and fall -- and even a cool summer night in the Berkshires.  The price was veery reasonable."
5.0,"I love this sweater! Even though the smallest size is medium it fit like a glove and I am small. I am 125 and 5’1. I love this color it is exactly as pictured, a beautiful mustard color for the fall! You can dress it down like I did with uggs or you can pair it with some knee length boots to make it look dressier! I love how the sweater is super soft and doesn’t make you itchy and the quality feels nice and thick so it won’t go to pieces after being washed. You might have to iron it after you take it out of the box and once you do. Throw that baby on and go on your way. You won’t regret the buy. Check out my pics"
5.0,Already had a pair purchased from Costco and knew that I liked them so these were perfect thank you for having them.
5.0,Fits great!  Shipped fast
5.0,"I wasn't sure I was going to like this when I opened the package, but once I tried it on I was so happy I ordered it. I recently lost 30lbs and have absolutely nothing for Summer that fits. This shirt is perfect.<br /><br />It's feels high quality and durable without feeling heavy. The design makes it airy but without showing skin (I was shocked). The fit is nice but seems to be more fitted and maybe runs a tad small. I am a size 14 (38"" bust) and the XL fits me perfectly (I was an XL/16 prior to the recent weight loss and would typically order a Large at the size I am now).<br /><br />I did notice this listing has two styles of shirts; while they seem to be similar in design and cut some are just solid color fabric and a few have the textured/holey material. Just to clarify, this review is for the green shirt with the textured/holey/airy design. From what I can tell, this style seems to be a bit shorter and more fitted while the others seem to run a bit bigger and be made with a heavier fabric that may not be suitable for Summer.<br /><br />This shirt has washed and dried well without any shrinkage. I highly recommend the style of shirt I ordered (can't speak for the others) and am likely going to purchase another in black."
5.0,This is the one. Looks perfect .
5.0,I am a female I wear a women size 9 1/2 I purchase the men size 8 because the size 7 5 they didn't have. I suffer from plantar Fasciitis. These shoes are a wide at the toe part which  is great. I wear feetures socks that support plantar Fasciitis and a feet band for it also. So the shoes fit perfectly  with all those . My feet feels good wearing these shoes
5.0,Beautiful pattern. Fits just right.
5.0,I wear these all the time! Will definitely be ordering more
5.0,"True too size, washes up nicely, comfortable."
5.0,Loved the color. Material nice/ good quality. Fit perfectly.
5.0,Love everything about it.  Not too hot or too light weight.  Thinking about getting additional colors.
5.0,This dress is super cute! My daughter absolutely loved it! We did struggle with the crown but I think that had just as much to do with her very thin hair. Otherwise perfect!
5.0,"I purchased this for my Granddaughter's Christmas gift.  She is a girly girl and loves ballet, she will love this."
5.0,Loved the dress. It is very long but otherwise perfect. Good quality and good price. Received lots of compliments!
5.0,"Fits my watch perfectly, I love that it's quick release so I can change based on my mood. The color reminds me of a stick of gum and I love it! Please make 20mm bands in the same color so I can have one on my other watch."
5.0,"12 year old son LOVES this sweatshirt. I got him a Large. I wash it inside out with cold water and air dry. The fabric is on the thin side. It's not made of that fleece, or typical cotton, sweatshirt material. We live in the dessert, so it works for us. May want to rethink this if you want something warm."
5.0,It appears as pictured. I love this dress so much. The print is gorgeous!
5.0,I bought these in navy for my 7 year old son.<br />They look great with any pants especially his true religion jeans.<br />They have a padded footbed.<br />They don't slip off like most moccassins due to the elastic back.<br />I recommend these shoes.
5.0,"A bit rough, but they soak up sweat. What more do you want? The price is right too."
5.0,Cool contrast of the colors light weight<br />Easy to screw in
5.0,Charged it right up!
5.0,So stinking cute!!! Nice quality!
5.0,"Great color, great heel hight, comfortable, love the trim on top of the shoes. Shoes are a little wider than most shoes because I usually order a wide, but these shoes are perfect for the width of my foot. If you “do not” wear a wide in your shoes, please know, they may be a little wide for you. Price was great too & color-selection numerous, so I’ve ordered 5-6 pairs in all different colors."
5.0,"Beautiful dress, good quality, great price, and most important, true to size which is not always the case when purchasing clothes online. The size chart was very accurate. To give you an idea, I am 5'1 with 40D bust and purchased the XL. I only returned the dress because I didn't like the way it looked on me, but I would definitely recommend this dress."
5.0,Very comfortable and good quality.
5.0,"Unusual and hard to find necklace.  I bought this for my daughter who was in a high school production of Sweeney Todd.  She loves it.  It is not an expensive piece of jewelry, but a fun trinket."

5.0,Gift for boss. Product as described.  Nice price.
5.0,The sweater was nice and my daughter loved it
5.0,"Greatly little dress, comfortable, some stretch, professional."
5.0,"I wanted a passport holder with slots for credit cards, etc that was also RFID blocking and this fit the bill. The passport fits inside just right and the whole thing is thin enough to carry in your front pocket which is what I prefer. The construction seems good but I can't yet comment on how well it will hold up. The price is right for it as well. I would recommend this for those who don't want to spend a fortune and still want a good product."
5.0,These have been a great summer pants!!! Really love them. Fit great!! Love them!!
5.0,"Great, good quality and good fit."
5.0,This is a very beautiful piece of jewelry.

5.0,This shirt is so cute and will look good with a longer top and boots.
5.0,Ordered as a Halloween costume. It was just what a little girl dreams of. Fit the bill perfectly.
5.0,It’s awesome!
5.0,Everything is just as expected.  The gray color is as they showed.  The fit is correct.  The material is perfect fighter what I needed.  I didn't want it to be too heavy and yet not see through thin.  I needed it at the gym locker room after my shower and it suits my needs.
5.0,FAST FAST FAST SUPERFAST SERVICE! WELL WORTH THE PRICE. THANK YOU. this little toy saved Christmas! it kept everyone busy from ages 3 to 72 and it helped the Family Bond during Christmas Present unwrapping. well worth the price.
5.0,"Really cute earrings! Love how they fit, and I can dress up or down with them! Great buy, and would be a great gift too!"
5.0,Love love love this yoga top. It came wrapped in pink polka dots! The top is very well made and the fabric is so soft. Wonderful customer service..... It does run a bit small as the fit is to be tight. I ordered one size up and it is the perfect fit for me! I will be ordering more of these tops!
5.0,warm and fit
5.0,"No rubbing or painful places on my feet after all day wear. I love these. They're so springy and supportive, I bought 2 pair. They fit true to size, and seem to be good quality. Really comfortable walking sandals."
5.0,Soft. Color was just as pictured. Even had extra material I could either pull up over my stomach or fold.
5.0,"These goggles are super cute and high quality for the price. I purchased these for my niece who recently started taking swim lessons and she loves them. She's worn them to a few lessons now and has been able to wear them the entire duration of the lesson which is a win! We constantly had to keep readjusting the pair she had prior to these. The silicone the goggles are made out of is super soft and the lenses are crystal clear and don't fog up. The goggles also come in a durable hard plastic case and are perfect for storing them in her swim bag when they aren't being used. Overall I'm extremely happy with this purchase. I did receive a discount on this product in exchange for my honest opinion, but I was in no way required to leave a positive review if I wasn't satisfied. I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for an inexpensive pair of kids goggles for the summer."
5.0,One of my favorite dresses
5.0,Great watch strap!<br />Nice stitching and great attention to details. Buckle on a bit heavy side but I really love it. Lovely finish on metal parts!<br />A great vintage Bond strap to pair with a timepiece of your choice.
5.0,I finally found a diamond in the rough  It’s hard to find head wraps as good as these are very hard find<br />I’ve bought three wraps so far and I love them big and beautiful wonderful stretch the colors are beautiful. I use oil’s in my hair even the bright reddish orange wrap. It’s never been ruined by the oils  I love these sellers pet product and I plan to buy many more in the coming future all the colors.
5.0,If you want to be unique then these shoes are a great option!<br />[[ASIN:B010DV4LAK Puma Roma Graphic Geometric Steel Gray-Steel Gray (11.5 D(M) US)]]
5.0,"I used it for travel, simple quick grocery trips & casual wear. Very comfy to carry; however w/ family members having problems in life, both were taken from me (both the khaki & red) unfortunately. Such is LIFE & I wish I could re-buy again, but cannot find any being sold. 🙁"
5.0,Grandson loves these socks he is happy they stay up
5.0,They're Lightweight and stylish. i dig em.
5.0,My power ranger loving 4 year old thinks these shoes are awesome.  The design is great and the shoes are well made.  These are his play shoes so he really gets them dirty.  I just toss them into the washing machine and they come out great!  Any shoes that can stand up to both my son and the washing machine are 5 stars in my book!
5.0,Have wanted one for some time.  Keep on the sunny side of life.
5.0,Beautiful purse. Just the right size. Nice construction. Looks great with any casual outfit. Straps are long enough to carry on the shoulder.
5.0,"The hubby calls these my ""movie star glasses""! I just love them. They're big, but not TOO big. But the lenses are large enough that I don't have to pull my sun hat down over my forehead to block the sun going over the top of my glasses! LOVE that about them. The lenses appear well made, with no distortion, and I like that the top of the lens is darker than the bottom, makes it easier to read while wearing them! VERY happy with these."
5.0,So comfortable!!!
5.0,"Fit and comfortable, they are not to tight and don't fall down!"
5.0,looks great on my girls fenix 6s rose gold/gray watch. i also got her a mesh steel one same color but we both agree this looks nicer.
5.0,I used it for a custom funko pop project.<br />It was a nice bright silver but I painted it.<br />It was the perfect size and really nice quality.<br />I’m pretty sure it would be great for it’s intended purpose as well.
5.0,I like it fitted nice
5.0,"Holds the bills firmly, sturdily made"
5.0,"These have turned into my everyday earring. They are small, cute and have a little bit of shine. The first few times I put these on I did have to manipulate them a little to make sure the backing locked into the slot perfectly. This small hassle doesn't decrease the value for me!"
5.0,I DON'T WORRY ANYMORE WHEN I TAKE IT OFF IN THE CAR THAT  I CAN'T FIND IT<br /><br />IT'S ALWAYS THERE
5.0,Not too short  not too long
5.0,Sun Shield Sunglasses are excellent!
5.0,They are great quality and super dramatic. LOVE THEM!!!
5.0,It was for my sister and she loved it
5.0,This is the second set of these socks that I've ordered. Wore the first set so much that I wore holes in them and needed/wanted a second set!
5.0,"I recently purchased these sunglasses and I must say, I hadn't heard of them before but the price was decent and they looked pretty nice. I was not disappointed. They came in a nice box with a carrying bag, tool and clothe to clean them with and inside was a card for a free pair. I am in the process of trying that out so I can't say how that works out but I can say that what I paid for was well worth it and surpassed my expectations. I would recommend others to buy these glasses."
5.0,Absolutely in love with this dress!
5.0,"I really love the look and feel of these pants. Upon opening them plan on being skeptical that these may be see-through but once they are on they have complete coverage. Also, when bought these I thought they were going to be more full-length pants but they are just slightly above the ankle. Still very comfortable and cute once on."
5.0,I ordered  the snowskite gown they did an amazing job of getting all the measurements just right. I  feel  like  a  princess in  it thank  you so much  for the beautiful  dress. I ordered  the mint green one I Will truly  stand out at the army dining out.<br />Thank you Jenny for all your hard work.
5.0,Just Like The Picture
5.0,"Steering Wheel cover is comfortable when driving, its strong and the fit was perfect !"
5.0,"The watch strap came in an elegant package. The leather appears premium quality - soft leather, color is perfect and the linen thread is nicely stitched to the band. And most importantly, it fits me well.<br /><br />Besides, the vendor provides excellent customer service. I ordered the band in wrong size and attempted to exchange it. Julie from Archer responded promptly to my request and let me know that she would send over a free replacement band and I may keep the original one for my own use.<br /><br />Will definitely buy from the vendor again."
5.0,I love this product. It's so very colorful. It reminds me of Lisa Franks stuff. I've love LF since I was in 8th grade.❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
5.0,Brought this bag for my mom she loves it.<br />Small but packs a lot.
5.0,I got this so my 5 year old would feel confident I'm school wearing his mask all day. It is bea5 someone did steal it though.
5.0,"I thought that I was ordering one pair of sunglasses. I was shocked to find that I had three pairs, in as many colors,  polarized, mirrored, with microfiber bags and cloths, even a little stainless tiny screwdriver. It was like Christmas!"
5.0,I bought these for a friend and she absolutely loves them. She states that she gets compliments on them all the time.
5.0,Great for a personal gift to a loved one
5.0,Great fit!  Comfortable to wear and easy to put on and take off due to the rear clasp.
5.0,"Very pretty earrings, speedy service."
5.0,I ordered these to stuff plastic easter eggs with for school! It was perfect.
5.0,"Sio very pleased with my purchase of these in black that  I plan to buy them in several colors. (It's true that when I read ""yoga pants""  in the description,  hesitated, doubting  there could be any way these would look dressy enough to wear to work, but they absolutely are dress pants, the material is  of quality, nothing cheap- looking or shiny  here, it's a deep matte-finished black; and most important for dress pants, they aren't skin-tight the way I associate with yoga pants; and best of all they're beautifully fitted, with crisp, even creases sewn down the fronts of the legs. So yes these definitely  are appropriate to wear at the office or for an interview. They are unbelievably comfortable, too. Most dress pants are so tight-waisted, stiff and unyielding, but these are the exact  opposite, they these feel incredible! In my experience, everything about these pants is terrific, I'm not sure what happened with  reviewers complaining about them  being outrageously large,  mine are spot-on. but I'm size 6 in pants usually (when I'm not a size four), so size six is what  I ordered and exactly what I received."
5.0,"They were Quite Thick, but gave a Good Shape & were Very Comfortable."
5.0,Love this Fleece. Keep me warm at hockey rink.
5.0,"Pretty, light weight and perfectly sized"
5.0,"Very nice glove, beautiful deep red color. I would say they probably run a little in small side."
5.0,Christmas present for my husband. He is very picky about shoes/slippers. He absolutely love them. Super comfy. I was worried about them fitting but I used the size guide and it worked perfect.
5.0,"Bought this dress for a tropical vacation and I'm in love.  It's crazy comfortable, fits perfect and has pockets.  Who doesn't love a dress with pockets?!?!??!"
5.0,"Living in the tropics, we do have to wear formal clothing, and its not all grass skirts, linen shirts and short pants. So for the most part of a sunny day when we do have to wear formal and casual shoes, we still need to manage our sweaty feet. This socks is great, perfect thinness with enough stretch, and breathability (I made that up) for this climate"
5.0,"Beautiful, kept me warm all night. Exactly as described. Highly recommended."
5.0,Beautiful dress snd good quality
5.0,"I had a big, thick wallet. Sometimes, it's very inconvenient to carry it. I bought this simple, small one so that I can even put it in my jeans pocket. This wallet looks great, I like the black color. It has two layers to put cash and some for the cards. And it even has a transparent one for ID card or photos."
5.0,Cut the apple bracket off and slid the pin through dmfor my Samsung gear frontier and it works now on my Samsung watch
5.0,"Awesome scarf, pretty large and vintage looking which is what I was after."
5.0,"It's much better in person than the pics show. It's got the spun holographic like metal face like an old Trans Am dash. The band has canvas edging that's really nice compliment to the leather. But I suspect it will need cleaning that wears it out or fades it, so I hope I can get a replacement band for Barton prices- Citizen I'm looking at you!<br /><br />I don't like sec d hands that sweep smooth. This one has 5 step per second. That's nice if you want . 2 sec increments. However I rather have more dials per decimal like my Pro Master SST.<br /><br />I got this because the red face and perforated leather with red stitches matches my new 2020 Abarth 124 with it's red room gauge and black and red leather interior that also has red stitching. And the minute centeric numbers more closely match the speedometer.<br /><br />I wish they made my Pro Master SST with red center gauge, silver slide rule (this model is black with silver case, I want the reverse to match the car black dash with silver ring around th gauges) and with this strap.<br /><br />The SST remains my favorite if my 4 citizens tho I wish it had atomic radio sync. But I like the looks of this new cheaper model more.<br /><br />I looked everywhere to find other sellers with better prices, only to discover there was only one watch available, not even eBay had any red ones. So I bought the last one and luckily it was on sale or I would have passed. I only buy Citizen watches here because they are priced fairly in my opinion for a factory production watch. The SST I got at Macy's and it wasn't worth that full retail price.<br /><br />So back to this model. I love it. It's getting a lot of use cause I'm driving my new toy all over the place lol. Watch fit in at Cars and Coffee.<br /><br />Lum could be much better. That's important to me at night when glasses are off.<br /><br />My GF works at a jewelry shop and knows her brands and can have lengthy convos about watches. She likes that I like Citizen because so many watches are over priced and don't hold up well. She thinks guys that buy Citizen watches are smart shoppers. Citizen's are great and don't break the bank. We both wish Citizen would make a square Tag Monaco type of watch but with cool gadgets, low maintenance, and high precision of Citizen... Would be a nice and different piece to wear and keep with the brand I like."
5.0,"I bought these for my son and he loved them. Reminded him of the 90's basketball shorts that were long and comfortable. He is about 6ft 1, and they went below his knee. Great shorts for the money."
5.0,"Very cute, thank you."
5.0,They were great. Exactly as advertised
5.0,Cute pearl cat ring!  I also bought the matching earrings.
5.0,"I absolutely love this bodysuit! I usually wear a Large in tops but wasn't sure about the sizing so I ordered a Medium & Large. I kept the Medium because it's very stretchy & soft. The medium runs a little big, I still have room, but I like that so it's not digging into anything. I LOVE the back, definitely can't wear a bra with this. I recommend getting it!"
5.0,Bought these for my daughter. She loves them!
5.0,Very nice. I use them all the time
5.0,I love these! I’m a dental assistant so I love these. Easy to fit over mask and also the design is cute and goes with all 5 color of scrubs we wear through the week!
5.0,"Bought these because they are the same style of Oakley's I have.  Over the past 3 years the Oakley's have acquired a few scratches and thought it was time to replace them but I did not want to spend another $300 for a part of sunglasses.  Compared to the Oakley's these feel cheap but make no mistake, they are a very nice pair of sunglasses.  Because of the cheap feel, I have since decided to buy a replacement lens for my Oakley's but will definitely keep these in my vehicle to wear during those active times to insure that the new Oakley's lens take less risk of getting scratched up.<br /><br />These glasses fit firmly on the head and do a great job of blocking out the sunlight.  They are easily adjustable to find the perfect fit. 5 stars all the way on these although they will not be my everyday eyewear."
5.0,Excellent Quality. Just what I needed and saved me from buying another wallet.
5.0,They are very beautiful.  I will have to get used to the difference in other clipons i have. The sharp point is a little painful.
5.0,I read all the reviews before buying and that helped so much! I got the perfect size and I could not be more thrilled
5.0,Really love this belt it added so much to my 50's style dresses makes my waist smaller. Gorgeous belt it's like satin. So cute.
5.0,"Very nice bracelet, great look and nice product. Will order again."
5.0,I ordered a 5-6 size for my 6 year old daughter and it fits good.<br />She loved it !!! And it was good quality
5.0,This is my favorite piece of jewelry and I wear it everyday!
5.0,Beautiful blouse!  Nice quality and very pretty.
5.0,"really nice product, is like they describe, but a little bigger for my body, (Luciano's Wife)"
5.0,I love the fit thought the material would be different but I love the way the material is
5.0,These are awesome! Great fit and much higher quality than I had expected.
5.0,"Love this.  Beautiful, especially for the price"
5.0,Le ordene esta playera a mi esposo se la ordene Large y le quedo perfecta
5.0,My granddaughter loved it. It matched her costume.
5.0,"My 8 year old had been begging for a pair of ""stove top"" boots.  He loves these!"
5.0,"These are a great value! Yes, the lenses have a protective film which needs to be removed (on the &#34;inside&#34; facing side). These fit perfectly to my face with no adjustment. Also very light, which is nice."
5.0,"Great belt, very pretty! I used it for the ren fair and it worked well."
5.0,"Makes my butt look gooood! I'm 5'9"" the 190 range. I bought an XXL because according to their size chart, that's what I needed. I probably could've sized down to an XL. They're not lose 3 and baggy, but they're not tight either.  They're super comfortable. They are textured, you can't feel it from the inside, but they are when you run your hands over your legs."
5.0,Good quality cap....I also have a 13-star flag no flying in my front yard..........get yourself one.
5.0,Beautiful kippah; excellent worksmanship. Shipped quickly. Thanks.
5.0,"My princess was looking beautiful. Got many compliments, dress is very good quality and amazing look overall. The design is nice sparkly on the top and color is nice and bright."
5.0,Love these! Super cute
5.0,I like the full shoulder coverage and longer length.  I wear these under most sweatshirts and tops because I do not like low necklines.  (I do not like showing off my 76 year old wrinkled neck either). Very happy with purchase.
5.0,"This is really nice quality, i ordered this as Christmas presents for my church women group. Every one loved it."
5.0,"I love the flat battery vs. a rounded battery.  Also the width of the socks at the calf is better than others I've tried.  The battery lasts a long time - long enough for a 4+ mile walk and still stays warm long after I get home.  Highly recommend these socks, no regrets!"
5.0,Our Postmaster is going to love this
5.0,Great colors and quality
5.0,Great support and I love the hook and eye closure. Makes it easy to remove after it gets sweaty.
5.0,Very warm and made well!!
5.0,Love that it fits the rest of my LFC wardrobe! 10/10!!!
5.0,"This is my second purchase of an RFID blocking case and likely my last.  I'm so pleased that I found this leathr case, with a zipper.  Holds my cards with ease."
5.0,I love the design and get compliments on them and people ask me where I bought them.
5.0,"I wasn't optimistic when I ordered these because of the low price, but I was desperate & needed these with short notice to make earrings for a group. I was wrong! They are great quality. Bigger than expected. They made the cutest earrings for a group of 10 of us at a marina party! We got so many compliments! Great find! You won't be disappointed!"
5.0,"Very flattering and comfortable. I'm short (5'1) and curvy and the fabric flows nicely. I do need to wear my wedges with it. Best of all, it doesn't really wrinkle. I always hang it to dry."
5.0,"Very pretty,  get alot of compliments"
5.0,Fits great! I have big arms so wanted something that was a little nicer but covered my arms without being too warm.
5.0,Cute small and does not sit flat on nostril.
5.0,The Perky Collar works great and my clients love them!
5.0,It doesn’t have a ball on top but I’m ok with that because the hat is beautiful regardless! The wool is seriously awesome quality and the inside is lined with a comfy fleece like material. The colors are rich and lovely. It’s a quality hat that will last a long time and I love that it was made in Tibet. I just hope they’re making most of the profit and not someone else.
5.0,This band is the best of all watch bands I have. The quality finish and rich color combination makes this band model a cool one.
5.0,Perfect fit for my six year old son.  He wore it for a USA themed day for homecoming. Great accessory for kids!
5.0,Very useful for light touch-ups.
5.0,"Excellent watch, love how light it is, it feels like you are not wearing anything on your wrist."
5.0,I needed some winter slippers that I could easily slip my feet into.  These fit the bill and were a great price.  I've spent much more in the past for slippers that weren't as comfortable as these.  They are advertised as machine washable in a gently cycle and air dried.  I've worn them daily for at least 6 hours a day since I bought them and they show no sign of wear.  I hope to make the entire season without having to wash them.  These work for me.
5.0,it fits size wise great just gotta get rid of my bloated belly lol but I absolutly love it its gorgeous and so soft
5.0,Better than Speedo
5.0,"I am bald. I wear this to bed at night in the winter and it doesn't fall off as much as others. I also wear it around the house in the  winter and it looks pretty good. And I can wear it in public without embarrassment, too. Washes and does not shrink. I have bought 3 of these for different places I stay in the winter."
5.0,Good Quality - Nice design - Requirements met
5.0,Way nicer than expected. The initial as well as the chain are beautiful! The chain catches the light and sparkles. I'm very satisfied. And the price was right!
5.0,I bought the black size large and it's perfect. I was looking for this particular sweatshirt on the north face website but it was out of stock in the size I wanted. Waiting for the grey to come back in stock in my size and I will order that one also!
5.0,I like how this hat looks.  Fits good as well.
5.0,"I wear 38g. I haven't bought sports bras in years. These are what I wanted; light support, no binding."
5.0,Bought this for my son who plays t-ball . It matches his team colors and he loves it . The rope is very durable and the clasp is very strong so it doesn’t come off easily . Very satisfied customer .
5.0,"Bought it for my nephew for Christmas, he loved it, he’s 19"
5.0,"I'm 5'6"",135#, wear a ladies 8 in most things. Size M fit perfectly. There is a little variance in size. (I tried it in burgundy and was going to need to run in the top of a little). Overall beautiful!"
5.0,super comfy and true to size
5.0,"Love the colors,  the way they fit my curves and the material is great."
5.0,I ordered this for a gift. My daughter in law loves tem. Very happy with them !!
5.0,They were even better than I expected!
5.0,No slumping
5.0,I searched long and hard for a replacement of my much loved Skagen watch which retailed $100 over 10 years ago and is no longer available.  Side by side they are almost identical.  I am so very thrilled I found this as I don't think I would be happy with any other options out there in the market.
5.0,This was perfect. Thank you.
5.0,"I thought the bracelet was gorgeous, and is really good quality. I bought it for my best friend's birthday gift. I can't wait to give it to her, as I know she's going to love it."
5.0,"What a pleasant surprise this purchase was! The leather is soft as butter, the fit is perfect and they feel like a second skin. I can use my devices while keeping my hands toasty and warm. The style is classic and goes with anything and the color is rich. Highly recommend, you won’t be disappointed."
5.0,"Cute for playing dress up, but order a size or two larger. Barely fit my granddaughter and I had ordered one size bigger"
5.0,"It came cloth wrapped in it's own box, the leather is very nice quality for the price.  It was a gift for my husband which he really liked."
5.0,Fit Watch perfectly and with silver watch case it looks awesome.  Band is very lightweight and comfortable.
5.0,"Love it. Wish the horn didn't almost lay flat, but I can fix that. It's cute, comfy and great. I put my phone in the pocket and sometimes my water bottle."
5.0,Love the fabric.  Fits perfectly
5.0,Super cute and great for many occasions
5.0,"Leggings Depot is a great source. Good quality, great price. I have bought solids and prints, and I am pleased with them all."
5.0,Wow I can’t wait to order these in all colors ! Super flattering and most comfortable bra i’v ever purchased!
5.0,"Super comfy and fit great. Great material. They roll down at the top of you have literally any extra fat. Me and two of my coworkers all bought the same pairs for matching work outfits. Two of us have mommy tummy’s and the third is flat as a board. Ours roll down constantly through the day just breathing and walking around lol,  but our friends only rolls down after she’s been sitting or bending over.  The elastic band inside is just a bit on the thin side so it rolls easily."
5.0,Fits my daughter perfect! No adjustment needed..
5.0,"Caramel Cantina Shelf bra Cami are just perfect for my needs.  I have pretty bras that I use with them in order to help with compression of my healing ribs.  I like to layer up right now but when spring, summer, and fall come, I will be showing these off comfortably.  Thank you and this not my first purchase of this brand.  I will be a customer again and recommend you to all!"
5.0,"The bags are amazing! Light weight, easy too  clean and great colors!"
5.0,"I paid about $30, and think I got a good deal. I like everything about this watch. It is a nice color without being too bright/gaudy. It has the right amount of heft. The band is very, very sturdy. I have 20+ watches, and this is always in rotation.  I wish they had other colors. I'd love a charcoal gray one in the same style."
5.0,"Great small wallet, for the guy or gal that doesnt carry a lot. I found the outside wallet to be a bit loose/big for carrying important cards, at least for my liking, so i use it for bus tickets that kind of thing which it is perfect for. Leather feels great, so if you like the traditional style wallet in a smaller package this wallet is definitely for you! I hope that it stands the test of time!"
5.0,"Just received it, I bought for my son’s birthday because his wallet got stolen in a big city where he is going to college next year. It looks very good quality, I am sure my son will love it."
5.0,"Adorable hat, fits my 9 year old great. Probably be a tad small for a large adult head. Very plush, super fun."
5.0,199 all the way
5.0,Very dainty and pretty!!!
5.0,Great work or casually pants love the stretch !
5.0,Love the color and the length
5.0,"THhis dress is so beautiful, I’m ordering again in another color.. it fits so comfortable and free"
5.0,"I love it, so cute and comfy. Only complaint is the bow tie is really long and heavy so it makes the dress stretch out a bit if you wear it a long time (like 2 days haha). The material is thick and not shear at all."
5.0,This is my Son`s favorite Prayer and its perfect. Thank you.
5.0,"Fabric feels heavy and rough when you first open the package, but toss them in the wash with some softener, then tumble dry, and they'll take on the texture of a substantial cotton-linen blend. Very cute detailing, and the drop waist is slimming -- you get the comfort of an elastic waist without the puffiness. Especially great with a tunic top. Several friends asked me if these were a new Eileen Fisher style, and were surprised when I told them where I got them and how much I paid."
5.0,It works and the colors are great.
5.0,So beautiful and comfy at the same time. True to size. Fits comfortably.
5.0,"I bought this for a 12 year old who promptly put it on over her clothes and wore it for hours on Christmas morning.  She is tall and thin for her age (5'3&#34;), and it fit her well."
5.0,Worked perfectly for me. Well worth it for the price.
5.0,I love the pop of color with this necklace!
5.0,Great lounge set. Soft and light weight
5.0,"I love this and every time I wear it, I get complements on how cute it is."
5.0,"I received the light khaki and it is such a great neutral color. Can be worn with so many different outfits, colors and patterns. The pattern of the scarf is subtle and not distracting. I’m not sure how I feel about the CUCCI lettering to mimic the GUCCI but it is not too obvious which is nice. Other than than, size, color and texture are spot on. Really nice."
5.0,Good quality fabric and craftsmanship. I’m altering it for cosplay. Sizing is as expected.
5.0,It's beautiful. .I love it.
5.0,"My daughter loves this! But she did say like many others, the ears to point up a little too high on her and into her glasses area, but she still wears it often."
5.0,"This is a great product, excellent quality. It was just a little bigger than what I was looking for."
5.0,"Love it, fast shipping. Item as described"
5.0,This purse is beautiful. The material is so nice and the storage set up is perfect. I'm absolutely in love with it
5.0,My mother is always losing her earrings! The usual bullet clutch back came out (especially with a curious toddler around).  These actually do work great.  Plus she has base metal allergies.  She wears earrings again with these!
5.0,Love these earrings.  I've gotten so many compliments. The price was great.
5.0,Purchased as a gift dor a 5 yr old who just loved it....very good quality very pretty colors
5.0,Runs a size or 2 big but great look.
5.0,I like the color and texture.!
5.0,Awesome holds the sweat like a champ
5.0,"Loved this product! However I ordered it on December 14th 2019, as a Christmas present and it came after January 1st 2020. When I checked out shipping said it would be here by the 20th. I was not reimbursed for shipping charges, I was not given a call to apologize."
5.0,"Ordered a bunch for my kids, nephews and nieces (pink and black). They all loved them and heard no complaints! Very durable and very cool looking. Best goggles for the money! 👍"
5.0,Beautiful champagne color. Have used this set in multiple newborn baby girl photo shoots.
5.0,The film was a little hard to remove but otherwise perfect!
5.0,This is beautiful and well worth every cent! Nicer than expected!
5.0,"Best shoes for work that I have ever had on my feet, also not clunky, very lightweight and true to my size!"
5.0,My daughter loves her headband. It is made very well and stayed in place an entire softball game.
5.0,Good quality watch with style and has nice metal strap. Looks definitely like an expensive watch for a reasonable price. I would recommend it.
5.0,my third hat - Great
5.0,My girlfriend loves them :)
5.0,"Love it,great quality!"
5.0,Used it for a masquerade ball. Was comfortable enough that I wore it for 8 hours with no problems
5.0,Son loves them!
5.0,I like this so very much I ordered a second one after I received the first one! I get lots of compliments on it!
5.0,"Cute as pictured. Also nicely packaged. Overall, I am very pleased with the order."
5.0,I love this bathing suit!!!! It hides all my imperfection & I'm ready for the summer
5.0,Adorable little tutu ! Fits perfectly!
5.0,Exceptional quality for the price. Incredible soft leather. Looks and feels better than expected. Five stars!
5.0,My Granddaughter loved costume.
5.0,I love this sweater and received many compliments on it when worn. It washes up nicely and the color goes with everything!
5.0,"There are some very harsh reviews here from people who have discovered these are cheap glasses, something I think you can gather from the price before ordering. I think the style is strong enough to make up for some of the weaknesses.<br /><br />The frames for these are plastic around the lenses with gold-colored metal temples (arms) and bridge. The silicone nose pads are also colored gold.<br /><br />They're flexible, which isn't necessarily the same as flimsy. It remains to be seen how well the plastic parts will hold up.<br /><br />They're large and do seem better suited to large heads than small fit-wise, but the hinges are stiff enough that you can fit them even on small heads and they'll stay. They're light, so they don't slip around if I shake my medium-size male head vigorously.<br /><br />The &#34;black&#34; color I got is actually dark blue, which I like better. Don't know if others who order thie black will get that, though. The lenses are highly reflective bluish from the outside. Looking out through these the color is more brown. There's more red in the brown than I'd prefer, but it's a pretty standard color for sunglasses.<br /><br />They come in a black thin paper box in containing a thin black faux-leather snap closure case with the glasses inside. The paper box got a little dinged up in transit. The case is hard on one side to protect the lenses and lined with velveteen. It has a distinct chemical odor that I expect will go away over time.<br /><br />There's a card included with a photo to demonstrate that the glasses are indeed polarized. As another reviewer points out, there's nothing to indicate the UV protection beyond the Amazon description.<br /><br />Olieye is a new brand from China, the trademark was applied for in August this year.<br /><br />Four stars, plus one to make up a little for what I think are unduly harsh reviews for the price."
5.0,A sweet necklace for a preteen
5.0,I received a lot of complements on it.
5.0,I love the bag .I was so excited to get it
5.0,Purchased for our granddaughter she loves anything to do with Frozen
5.0,The girlfriend loves this
5.0,SUPER FUN! REALLY COZY
5.0,"Finally home after almost a year homeless, so celebrated the victory with this product."
5.0,These are strong and sturdy.  They should hold a lot of items.  I will be getting some more of these in the near future.
5.0,I received many complements on the dress.  It has pockets!
5.0,"I was reading from some reviewers that it's too lite, too cheap, etc. I bought 2 for $14!  What do you expect?  And I love them!  They are light and airy and really really comfortable.  I bought 2 more and went up a size though in case they shrink when I wash them.  They don't hug your mid-section either so it makes them super cool.  I will wear them in the gym, running outside, etc. If you're expecting a substantial t-shirt, this isn't it. But it is lightweight (like it says), and feels like you barely have a shirt on."
5.0,I love it as always this brand has great strong fabrics. The patter is very flattering. Many compliments.
5.0,I love these pants. They fit like a glove. They look great on and feel good too. I would go by the sizing chart and read reviews. I am 5’6” and weight 120 lbs. I wear a size Medium.
5.0,Excellent gift - just as I expected

5.0,"These boots are amazing! I also have them in red, and they've held up great for with being worn almost daily for four months. I plan to buy them in Black and Tan as well.

5.0,"I love my new bag!  It is so comfortable to carry.  I keep buying purses that look great but are too heavy.  The package came weighing next to nothing and the material is sturdy. The bag is huge, however the way it cinches on the sides makes it not to appear too large.  I love the dark tan color.  Very happy with my purchase!"
5.0,Just what we were looking for.
5.0,Was given as a gift she liked it
5.0,very very nice for the price!

5.0,loved it and I had to order more for my friends.
5.0,These are the perfect size and easy to put in.
5.0,I like how it fits snugly.  And I wear it whenever it's cold or even just a bit chilly because it keeps you warm but also it breathes with the air wicking so you don't get too hot.
5.0,It is much smaller than the pix shows.  But it's well made and easy to use.  I really like it and will probably purchase more from the same manufacturer.
5.0,"Great cross and necklace I wear while working , cordage is nice as well and adjustable to fit over your head . If it got lost while working I am not out a lot of money .<br />I think it was a great value for the money . I did buy two of them , one I wear and one I put in my work van on mirror ."

5.0,This dress was very pretty on. It was super soft and and flattering. Received many compliments.
5.0,"Self-care day today, I took a luxurious shower and then changed into this super comfy shirt as a treat, and I'm so pleased with this. I wanted the light grey color with stripes on the sleeves but the soft fabric and feel are better than I hoped. The shirt is long and goes past my hips which I LOVE for a comfy lounging shirt. I would love to wear it out with a pair of skinny jeans or something."
5.0,Beautiful and special..
5.0,"Fantastic.  I (like everyone) hate wearing a mask, but these made the experience much better. They were large enough to cover all needed areas, and light enough to not be spectacularly bothersome."
5.0,Bought for my friend who happens to be from West Virginia and a fan. He loved the cap!
5.0,Perfect length for for 6’1”!
5.0,"I needed help with my putting alignment because my putts were so off line so I decided to invest in the putting mirror.  It has helped me tremendously so far with getting my shoulders lined up and my eyes over the ball.  I never knew how far my eyes were off the line causing my putts either to go left or right.  In the short practicing with the mirror, my putts are back online and more confident to make longer putts.  The horseshoe tools that come with it has improved my short putt making ability.  I would definitely recommend this putting aid and make you a better putter."
5.0,"I am small enough that I can layer the 28"" over something and still have comfortable room to bend my legs"

5.0,"Great price, fast D! Nice piece"
5.0,"I purchased for my best friend who is being baptized during the Easter Vigil. Because she will be recieving all her sacraments, I thought it only fitting for her to recieve rosary beads that resemble my rosary from my first Holy Communion (20 years ago!). I can't wait to give them to her."

5.0,"Love this bag - it's beautiful, well-made and unique. Very happy with this purchase!!"
5.0,"I have thin fingers, and even after adjusting the ring as much as I could, it was still a bit loose. But, that doesn't detract from the value of the product to me. I wear it on a cord around my neck for cosplays, and the loose fit actually makes it really easy to fidget with"

5.0,"Beautiful, but authenticity of photo can be challenging with loss of our 4 legged family member"
5.0,"This is super cute and I get lots of compliments on it.  People can't believe I shop on Amazon for my clothing!!.. This was a little snug but not a deal breaker, if you don't want snug, order a size up.  Great color!"
5.0,"Quick service, product was exactly as described. Works great!"
5.0,"It's great and affordable.  Seems seamless,  definitely help keep the arm warm.  I'm 5-7&#34; and it fits nicely.  Use it on my workout as I had some muscle soreness this has help keep my arm warm and cools, feels nice during my workout."
5.0,"Fit was a bit large. I ordered small I am 5ft 2 in 120lb  bust 34in.<br />Rather have it a little bit too big then skin tight. Wear a bralett underneath or sports bra.<br />Would order, price is appropriate."
5.0,Just love these shirts lengthis great and very comfortable
5.0,Good value for the cost. Visibility could be better from a slightly bigger eyehole or better mesh.
5.0,Cute little bag
5.0,This is a great set to use in gift bags for kids or as an incentive for good behavior as the set can be broken up.  The pencils reflect the smell that it is labelled with.  Good product.  My son uses the plastic tube that it comes in as the storage case.  I think this also keeps the tip in shape when traveling.  No more broken pencils.<br /><br />It's also nice to have all the main characters from the movie represented on each pencil.
5.0,"Reliving my youth. I'm a huge Haro BMX fan from the 80s. Fits nice, good quality for the price too."
5.0,It fits and looks just like the picture. It doesn't drag on the ground and it's not see through.
5.0,"Very sturdy. The stiching seems backward which is a bit awkward. Other than that, it works really well."
5.0,Great product. Fits great!
5.0,"This set is really cute and toasty warm. I'm usually reticent to buy crocheted items because I crochet myself and usually prefer to do it myself. But the hat and mittens in this are lined in super soft felt-like material, and I'm glad I purchased! Super cute, well-made, and nice and warm."
5.0,My daughter loves this.
5.0,this really stays put! be sure to put the stockings on immediately after applying and press them into the glue for a few seconds to ensure its bonded. I even put some glue onto the inside of the stocking. Once it has dried do not mess around with the stocking because the glue will become detached since it has dried and wont stay on anymore. The glue also washes off completely so no need to worry about left over residue on your leg or stockings
5.0,Easy to wear and long enough to feel comfortable in all situations.
5.0,I ordered this for a simple top to swim in while mermaiding. I’m a 40C bra (although I haven’t worn an actual bra for the past 5 years). I like that it fits comfortably and feels like swim suit material so it won’t get too water logged! I’m buying a bunch more for when I need replacements! I can also see using this to craft a fancy mermaid top!
5.0,"I needed black socks and I bought these.  They are really just plain black socks, but they are very soft and well made."
5.0,"I LOVE these glasses! My one year old went as Lucille Ball for Halloween. She is tiny for a one year old and these fit her perfectly! She kept them on the entire time, and even months later, she puts them  on  and is a very happy girl! They are great quality and made of a thick plastic that will not easily break. Well worth the money"

5.0,High quality and comfortable. It would be better to make the ear loops a little bit longer.
5.0,Reslly impressed on how strong they are! Definitely recommend and they look exactly like the pictures & shipping was fast! Make sure to look at what package you decide to go with since every coñor has different sizes
5.0,Son loves them. They fit well and are sturdy.
5.0,Good quality cotton socks. The tie-dye is beautiful. I've already bought a 2nd set. These aren't winter socks so I'm making myself hold off buying a 3rd set until spring.
5.0,"I work hard in it, and also wear it for fun. Kick ass boot."
5.0,I liked that it fit good and that the seller offered all colors. It’s strange though because I logged in today and the other color options were gone but I was able to order them yesterday
5.0,This is my second purchase of this sweatshirt. Love the soft not too heavy feel. The pink is very close to picture. Love it.  (Very summery color) it’s a little big but I like it that way. A large would have been fine also.
5.0,The adjustable ear loops and nose piece really help with less fogging of my glasses.
5.0,The sizing was a little difficult to figure out but the Q&A had the information I needed. Just what my son needed.
5.0,I love the pillowy comfort of this shoe. Fits nice and even has some support.
5.0,Nice fit! Bought for my daughter's 11th birthday and she loves it!
5.0,Love this set. Received lots of compliments
5.0,This shirt came exactly as expected. It’s super soft and the length hits a few inches below my waist which is exactly what I like. I ordered my standard unisex size and the fit is perfect! Price can’t be beat. Would order more from this seller.
5.0,"So glad this skirt came in plus sizes. The 8+ was perfect for our daughter who is about 65lbs and 46"" tall. She has an adorable belly that sticks out a bit and the plus size provides plenty of room that she doesn't complain about it being too tight."
5.0,It fits TTS. Fabric is thick and well made. Happy with my purchase.
5.0,Great quality and fit my daughter and her AG doll perfect!
5.0,I got this excellent and unespicable product on time and the price is so nice the product also awsome i love it.

5.0,Very good quality and appearance.  Purchased on a deal as a gift and recipient loved it.
5.0,Hi quality material.
5.0,Husband liked alot
5.0,Nice pair of glasses. Very affordable and looks good with my matching outfit and shoes.
5.0,They're good glasses. For the price I can't complain. I've been using them for a couple of weeks and have had no issues with them. They block the sun well and look just like they do in the picture. Even though they don't cost a lot they don't look or feel cheap. Good product
5.0,This is a beautiful skirt.  I like the pattern and the material is soft.  It's nice to find a good length skirt and I especially love that it has pockets!
5.0,The item is beautiful the stones are very small and light in color much more then the photo shows but still looks nice.
5.0,"I've had this since July 2019.  It is costume jewelry, but it is beautiful.  I get compliments every time I wear it!"
5.0,"Decent belt.  Looks nice, feels soft, holes are in the right places - the size, if you follow their guide - is spot on!"
5.0,Great product for the price. Stays in place well and looks pretty
5.0,This bracelet is too gorgeous for words. Thanks for the fast delivery!
5.0,Fits as expected. Good quality nice and thick. Ordered the yellow hoodie color is as expected and vibrant! Plan on ordering in other colors. Hood even fits nice which tends to be hard to find.
5.0,"I never buy a one piece because I like to tan but this suit fits sooo well I had to keep it. It is great any day you want to look wonderful, but I also found on those bloated I don't wanna wear a bikini days, this is also a great option. The back and front panel give plenty of coverage without ruining your tanning areas. I is also very slimming how it v's in in the front paneling. The back straps are adjustable so the length isn't one size fits all, as is the back strap.  I wear a 34B and have 40in hips. 5'5&#34; and 140lbs and the Large was a perfect fit."
5.0,"Very comfortable sleeves and a good weight.  I have thin skin on my forearms and i use these when piking up brush, and limbs and while using the hedge trimmers or chain saw.  Will buy again."
5.0,Very lovely would buy again for future gift ☁️
5.0,"Used as water shoes at the lake house. So lots of walking Up and down back and forth to and from the water, Very rocky and lots of dirt. The shoes are super cute and would probably last a lot longer with using around a swimming pool but the shoes are still holding up for now on the rocky walk. Bought just to match her mermaid themed bathing suit and bday party. My daughter never said they weren’t comfortable Or complained about them so I’m assuming they are."
5.0,"I'm 5'4"" 245lbs and bought an XXL in the green floral. The dress is beautiful and flattering to the figure. The colors are vibrant and the material is stretchy and very comfortable. On me, this dress falls above the knee. I generally like my pencil dresses to fall below the knee especially when there is a slit in the back like the one. I still love the dress and will wear it with leggings to make up for the length."
5.0,I bought this for our 2 daughters and put our chains on it as a remembrance of me and their Dad.  They really loved it.  I am going to have a jeweler put a little chain on on their anchor.  The pendant is top quality and can't say enough about the pendants!  The seller was fantastic in the questions I had.  Arlene from Virginia
5.0,This was exactly what I expected to receive. It fit as expected. The material is pretty light. Its perfect for what I wanted it for.
5.0,Very fun toy. Has cool cell phone like features including selfies.
5.0,Super soft it's one of my daughter's favorite dresses.
5.0,Cozy yet light.<br />Love it instead of a heavy robe.<br />Pockets hold my tissues and phone.<br />Great post op recovery gift.
5.0,Love Carole Hochman garments!  Bought this for my sister who is recovering from breast cancer surgery.  The set was beautiful & fit perfectly.
5.0,"These shorts fit perfectly, and they are more than comfy. I ordered them in black, and I am ordering the blue as well because I wear them so often. You can dress up a bit, or use them for athletic wear."
5.0,She loved it. Only problem was it took any two months to arrive and not on Christmas.
5.0,"Just what I wanted, fst delivery!"
5.0,"I like an over the shoulder purse. It's hard to find just the right one that's not bulky or too small. It holds its shape very well! Nice and slim looking when I go shopping and doesn't get in the way. I'm picky, lol...I love it!"
5.0,"Pretty good so far. This box was one of the wedding day gifts I gave to my husband. His ring never fit securely in the box the jeweler provided. I really liked the light feature in this box and could only hope his ring would fit. Well, it has been almost 3.5 weeks and he hasn't had any issues with this ring box. His ring fits securely on the velvet groove and he enjoys the convenience of being able to use it in the dark because of the light feature."
5.0,"Perfect fit, will order more. Thanks :)"
5.0,I love how beautiful the colors were and my favorite part is Mickey and Minnie sitting in a boat looking at Cinderella’s Castle.
5.0,"My boyfriend does BJJ and Krav Maga, and these were on his Christmas list, but from another site. Being me, I shopped around and found a better price here (which, funny enough, is direct from the manufacturer instead of through that 3rd party site). I was iffy on being the first to purchase/review the item, but decides to try it anyways. Thankfully they shipped promptly and were packaged nicely! (If I remember correctly, these shipped from the seller, not from an Amazon warehouse.)<br /><br />-The sizes are very accurate. Purchased them in a 42&#34; and they fit a 42&#34; waist to a T.<br />-Nice quality material, good stitching. The waistband is very secure.<br />-Flexible and stretchy, doesn't restrict movement when rolling.<br />-Great sublimated printing, the colors are vivid and won't peel off like vinyl graphics. (Sublimation is when the dye is applied directly to the fabric, unlike screen printing or vinyl which both apply the paint/vinyl on top of the fabric.) So no worries about peeling, cracking, or splitting.<br />-Has held up well thus far, but it's only January and he has other shorts and gis that he uses as well, so I'll update if they seem to wear prematurely."
5.0,They are perfect for my Minions costume that I am putting together. Thanks!
5.0,"I got this for my horse crazy 8 year old for Christmas.  I was impressed by how pretty it is, I thought the detail was very nice.  It certainly didn't disappoint.  I can't wait till she gets to open it."

5.0,"A little big, but that is how I like it!!"
5.0,Bought as a gift s son as we knew we were moving to Texas.

5.0,I got the in a ok time before estimated date... There were just how the picture showed them and love the different colors there awesome. For the price you can't go wrong at all ... Now I can change color when ever i want to and is was worth buying this product
5.0,"Love these, lightweight, great fit and good value."

5.0,"Very cute, yet inexpensive!"
5.0,"WORKS PERFECTLY FOR ME, MAYBE A LITTLE TIGHT ON MY HEAD BUT DOES THE JOB."
5.0,"This is an excellent quality watch. I need a watch like this during my work,it works so great. The band is beautiful and comfortable too. I like it."
5.0,Was a perfect mothersday gift
5.0,It’s really great. Soft on the inside and subtly sexy on the outside. The lace shoulder straps are a bit itchy but I expect that to go away with time and washing.
5.0,"I love it, perfect shirt and size."
5.0,I love this dress.  It fits perfectly and is great for work.  Very comfortable fabric and made well.
5.0,So in love with these! Will definitely be buying more!
5.0,Nice but just a little big
5.0,Super cute. Lenses aren't as dark as I was hoping. Def have that stiff &#34;cheap&#34; feeling but I don't know what people expect for sunnies under $7. Worth buying again if anything happened to them.
5.0,Would like to see different colors but I love them soft
5.0,"So far like everything about the bag! I'm using it for my diabetic supplies! Working perfect for that, so this is not a bag just for nurses, it is for anyone needing a bag for Medical need's in general. Would Highly Recommend this bag!!<br />BJ"

5.0,love love love. The colors are bright and cheery.  Will update post once they have been warn and washed many times.
5.0,Wife loves these
5.0,The old-style medical alert bracelet has information engraved into metal.  This is where the MyID shines - for many our medical information: conditions and medications change and you need an App to change it as needed.  This is a gem for those with complicated medical histories and issues.  Plus the QR code is acceptable for most hospitals to read.
5.0,Great for kid’s party!!!
5.0,"Fits as expected, comfortable and the material is great."
5.0,A BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE  AN ORIGINAL PIECE
5.0,"Very Nice, and very curious"
5.0,"omg my kids love this thing. super cool. I am so happy with it. sound does get a little annoying after they have played it for 20min straight. I did buy a 48oz beer chug mug some time ago, so that helps"
5.0,Its Great. Fit as expected. Good quality shirt. Looks stand out.
5.0,"I love these shirts!  They are cute and fit well.  I have several and love them all.  The material is lightweight, but not flimsy or see through at all."
5.0,"This product is stylish and great for urban use or outdoor use, especially backpacking or camping.  In the city it’s cool and understated. For backpacking or even athletic activities this is a great belt for two reasons: it is extremely lightweight and it doesn’t retain water.  Leather is good but it can be heavy, and can be damaged by water including sweat. This belt is dry almost instantly. Additionally, after a big meal it’s easier to let this belt out a bit and not have to commit to a full notch the way one must with belts that have holes. It seems like my waist is always between holes! That’s a non issue with this belt. It’s durable too; I’ve had the belt it for months and it still works great.  it’s inexpensive. And finally, classy packaging!"
5.0,I am an EMT for a private ambulance company and we run a lot of calls. These pins not only look amazing but stand up to a lot use. They stay in place and the backings last a lot longer than other pins I have purchased. Great buy.
5.0,My daughter loves everything Minnie
5.0,I love this. It’s small and pretty. It’s exactly what I wanted.
5.0,"Comfortable,  fit well, perfect design! Really like it, I recommend you to buy it especially in those difficult days."
5.0,I was excited to received them quickly and love the quality of the the fabric. Feel like a woven material and stitched well. I like the way the waist has a draw string that tightens to fit. I am short so the pants almost comes to my ankles.
5.0,I ordered these for my son who is a boy scout and spends a lot of time outdoors.  These fit him perfectly and blocks out the sun.  Great quality product.
5.0,Cute little gown - washes up nice too!
5.0,"Purchased for my granddaughter. She loved them. I mean they have glitter, what else can I say."
5.0,"I really like this thing.  Gotta watch for the boobs falling out, though.  Lol stay upright with this bra."
5.0,It rains a lot at the evening recently in New York. I'm glad I bought this umbrella and always have it in my bag. It's big enough for 2 people. And it's not very heavy so that you can just easily keep it in the bag in case of the big rain.
5.0,These arrived on time and surpassed my expectations.  They are beautiful and loved by the three people that received them as gifts.
5.0,I sized up fits very nice..  looks good.
5.0,It fits at first until I washed and dried it.  It shrank a size smaller. I should of bought one size larger than I normally wear.
5.0,This little pendant looks a great deal more expensive than its cost! Well worth the relatively high cost of shipping to get it.
5.0,People that do not believe. But it is your choice.
5.0,Great purchase for the price. Now I can color code my workout outfits!
5.0,"I ordered the cocoa to compliment a DB Ocean color handbag.  This color is such a beautiful contrast, pretty much the color of the leather straps on my handbag so the blue just pops more.  My checkbook fits perfectly, this is not as large as an actual checkbook wallet but I do prefer the smaller version.  Less clutter and only the bare essentials for card slots needed.  Takes up less room in my handbag.  The leather is soft and the quality is spectacular."
5.0,"Very fun shirt, bright graphics."
5.0,I relied heavily on reviews when I was looking to give this type of watch as a gift. This is a quality looking time piece at a very affordable price. It is used only on special occasions but has not shown any signs of wear or had any issues with accurate time keeping. I would recommend this as a gift or a special addition to any wardrobe.
5.0,We like the fact that this is a warm coat and we got it for a reduced price.
5.0,"Fits well, love it!"
5.0,Large size at a great price.
5.0,"Very nice bag for such a low price, excited to use it on our next flight- it's the exact size needed for the largest carry on bag on Sun Country"
5.0,Helped control rash/ rub from shin guards.  A must have!
5.0,Fit great and super comfy!  My husband is not as impressed as I am 🙄
5.0,Perfect size for my front pocket. I love the price and the qualitu
5.0,Its exactly what I was looking for..thankyou so much
5.0,This skirt is pretty thin but likely the black isn’t too see-through. I bought the light blue and I had to return because you could see straight through it
5.0,"Got this for my 22 year old son who loves it and says &#34;The material feels very nice and sturdy, feels like this shirt will last longer than I will. This shirt looks nice and fits as expected. It's quite comfortable and has a good thickness, and I don't usually like really thick shirts but it makes it quite comfortable.&#34;"
5.0,Very cute!!  Fits great. The material is thin.
5.0,I love the design and the hat. came just as I expected and the brim is even textured a little bit which gives it an exotic feel.
5.0,Omg this dress is perfect. And no bra needed ladies. Seriously. So cute. Quality and pattern is beautiful.
5.0,fit is comfortable..super shiny..gets you noticed!!
5.0,"I love this soft and comfortable shirt! I normally wear a size large and the medium was loose, but not baggy."
5.0,"Certainly Unique. I received this item as a gift from my wife and I love it. Its lightweight and looks really good. I have fairly hairy arms and it does not pull on the hair on my hands! Great mechanics in the watch well made.<br />Even the box that it comes in is really cool and made a great centerpiece on my bar! Comes with a cup and a sturdy bottle opener.<br />Value is decent, 399 for the watch and the box plus all the accessories is a bit steep but I believe hand made items are trending so I wouldn't be surprised if it gets even more expensive."
5.0,"This is a beautiful, eye catching pendant necklace.  The diamonds are a nice size and prong set.  The double heart design is sleek.  The back and the chain of the necklace are stamped 925 for sterling silver.  The chain is pretty and delicate - that being said I am notorious for breaking such chains so I may change out for a thicker one.  The only complaint I have is that there is not a tag to close the spring clasp into which makes it difficult to put on.  The necklace came  in an equally nice box that is great for presentation.  It isn't marked on the box that the stones are diamonds which may be nice especially if gifting to someone who is unfamiliar with the blue diamond variety.  In all it is a beautiful necklace of superb quality and excellent value."
5.0,"got the 3mm for my continuously disappearing septum piercing, sooooooooo happy with them !!"
5.0,GORGEOUS BELT. I used this for my wedding!!!
5.0,"Great Quality, really like them!"
5.0,Thank you so much!
5.0,I really love this so much that I bought two different colors
5.0,The material is soft and sleek.  I have yet to wear it but I can tell it will flow nicely.  I do need to hem it first or I can just knot it on the bottom for a little effect.  I received it within two days of ordering.  I really like the dress and can’t wait to wear it on Memorial Day.
5.0,Great as a shirt and as a dress
5.0,"I wear this style of glove almost daily in winter for farm work, I have tried many brands dollar tree, Walmart, etc. And I believe these are the best, they are softer and thicker than others while still being thin enough to leave me with enough dexterity for my work."
5.0,"fit the wife perfect,easy to read,durable? we'll see."
5.0,Love it. I have a red in the same style .
5.0,"affordable, looks good, works for professional life and causal occasions. it's very good daily carry handbag"
5.0,The fit was perfect! ❤️
5.0,They are light weight and very pretty.
5.0,I love these for use at the gym under my work out clothes.  I even bought more.
5.0,Best fitting bathing suit I have ever had. It was super supportive and I didn't feel like my large chest was going to fall out. I tried other similar suits but they were not as supportive and comfortable.  This was the best purchase ever!
5.0,The way these huggies look and feel.
5.0,"Fit like a dream! But I wish it had come with pants instead of that dorky skirt. The dork quotient is high enough to begin with but then toss a saucy skirt into the mix... well, you catch my drift."
5.0,Love these! Would buy again!
5.0,Beautiful Charm!  Goes very nicely with my new car.
5.0,"So I have only had my watch for about four hours but my initial thought is wow this things nice, it’s amazing I only paid $43. So after spending some time with it I have noticed a few things first the watch band is fairly decent  seeing most come with garbage bands, although this one could be a little longer. Replacing the band looks like it could be difficult finding a band to fit properly just because of the way the watch is designed it’s a tight fit. So yeah so far this watch is great but I’m going to post updates about every three months. When I hit the 3 month mark and if I’m still impressed I’m going to buy the other two colors to complete the set. Just realized it has a 25mm watch band so I don’t like that they should have done a 24mm band. 25mm band definitely limits the selection"
5.0,"I like this bracelet, nor had it turn colors"
5.0,Very nice addition to my collection of beads. In combinations look great on a necklace
5.0,I just love this apron. I am a chef and I collect all kinds of aprons. It is a nice cool lightweight material also very well made.
5.0,"Awesome. Great value. My daughter loves it,"
5.0,This charm is a beautiful addition to my pandora bracelet. I love its simple elegance.
5.0,"All our family love Smartwool sox!  That includes hikers, snowboarders, runners and ordinary users."
5.0,They came in really fast! Looks just like the picture and they fit great!
5.0,Beautiful watch nice quality
5.0,It great.
5.0,"They fit nicely, have clear vision through the lenses (mirrored lenses, but vision through them is clear,) and spring temples.  Very nice!"
5.0,Finally a scarf that will fit around my dogs massive neck area. The cloth is of good strong cotton and the colors are dyed well.  I know my dog will be pleased not to have to squeeze his head thru the old bandanas that were the size of doughnut holes. Sandi
5.0,One of my favs!
5.0,comfortable and stayed on my head.
5.0,The material of this shirt is absolutely better quality than expected. Not like the ussual t shirt material. This shirt is probably my new favorite
5.0,Very nice well made she loves them
5.0,Beautiful and fast shipping love it
5.0,This key chain was the perfect size and lightweight. I love how it is not weighing down my key ring.
5.0,"No complaints about his hat. Warm for fall or winter. Would just add a water repellent to it to keep safe. It runs a little big, but all in all 5 stars."
5.0,I really love this dress! It's very flattering and comfortable. The material is very stretchy almost swimsuit material. I am usually a size 16 and ordered the  XL and it fits great- I do have a bigger chest so it does fit snuggly in that region but since the clothes have a good stretch it still is comfortable
5.0,Very comfortable. i get lots of compliments. it is a bit long but i knotted it on the side and it looks good
5.0,Love them even more than I thought I would! I'm about 125 pounds and 5'4 I ordered a med.
5.0,"This bracelet was just what I was looking for. Its simple and elegant, it can be worn dressed up or casual."
5.0,Well made necklace at very reasonable price! I am extremely happy with this purchase. It goes with any pendant.

5.0,LOVE
5.0,Great quality for a low price. It has alot of compartments. The color is the same as the picture. It looks durable and well made.
5.0,"Honestly, these are great! Even better than the ones I bought for way more at Hottopic."
5.0,Cute. Flowy.
5.0,Love this one !
5.0,"I wear this bracelet daily. It matches a marcasite watch I have perfectly.  Also, this bracelet is very comfortable."
5.0,SO IN LOVE EVERYONE THINKS I SPENT OVER $100 ON IT GREAT QUALITY HAVEN'T TARNISHED STILL LOOKS LIKE IN JUST TOOK IT OUT THE BOX
5.0,"Only bad thing is now that we have purchased these, Spirit is changing the size you are allowed this year..."
5.0,Great waffle shirt. I expected it to be low cut and not work appropriate but it’s a perfect cut!
5.0,"These are awesome flip flops. I ended up giving them to my sister as a gift, and she loves them! Would definitely recommend."
5.0,Purchased for my grandson ~ he LOVES them!!
5.0,"This was an early Christmas present, and I must say it is way more stunning in person than the pictures show! The blue part is three dimensional and chromatic. It looks like it's a much more expensive ring than it actually is."
5.0,"I bought another of these after I bough this one<br />Love it, well made, good fit."
5.0,Cute holiday earrings. Decent quality.
5.0,Very nice. Would buy again in another color. Thick polyester.

5.0,These socks are super soft and comfortable.
5.0,Exactly what I ordered. Great product.
5.0,"The watch right out of the box was running and the presentation box is great. The watch keeps good time and can be wound by motion or by winding the crown. Overall I'm pleased with the purchase, and for the price it's a great deal."
5.0,These are very pretty and well made
5.0,"love it love it love it. I am seven months pregnant, ordered a small and it fits great! I am 5'3&#34; and about 150 lb now and the dress comes about 5 inches past my knees.<br />I am going to point out that I am thrilled with this because it is soo comfortable and fits great but it is not great quality. I have it now for three weeks and I see a small hole under the arm that I will fix but for that price this is amazing!"
5.0,Perfect gift for my 10 year old cousin. He is a gamer & would rather have been playing his game system instead of being at Christmas dinner! Lol! :)
5.0,"So warm and cozy. The coat fits, but I have long arms and I wish the sleeves were a little longer."
5.0,I love this outfit ! 😍 Gorgeous
5.0,"I LOVE this suit. Fits well in every area. Very flattering.<br />I am 5'4, 175 lbs and it conceals everything well and makes my boobs look good :)"
5.0,My husband likes them. Fit well and look nice. Wears of course for reading only.  Light weight.
5.0,I bought these for my wedding (something blue). They look expensive and beautiful. I can't wait to wear it on my big day.<br /><br />Update: I got many complements on my earrings. Adding a photo to the post. Love!
5.0,"I was looking for a solid brown bowtie! Dont underestimate the color brown, it goes good with a lot of light colored shirts. The bow tie is just as expected."
5.0,My daughter (who is a bit of a fashionista) loves this dress! She likes the fact she can wear this off or on the shoulder and both options look great. The fit is good and she is very happy with it.
5.0,Very pretty just as in pic and good quality .
5.0,My daughter was tinkerbell for Halloween. This dress was even better than my wife and I expected from the pictures.  Highly recommend it.
5.0,Very good replica
5.0,These were so fun for the leopard themed party.
5.0,"Item fits as expected and quality as expected, thanks."
5.0,Pretty. Fits like the picture
5.0,The design wasnt exactly what I expectd but when you order from companies like this you should know your taking a chance with being disappointed. Thats why we can return items. My son loves it. He absolutely loves it. I purchased it in April for his birthday and he wears it atleast 3-5 times a week over his school uniform. My brother (32) and younger cousins all have been asking for one. Im upset their unavailable. The quality was what I expected coming from where it came. Im greatful he loves it.
5.0,"Just as described and beautiful, love my new bracelet."
5.0,It is very beautiful.
5.0,More than what I expected. Absolutely beautiful. I love it and get alot of compliments!!! Thank you so much.
5.0,This is my wife's second set she loved them so much. Only it broke her heart when her white one took on the color of the mangos she prepared for a bridal shower.
5.0,"I love this Butterfly Bangle Bracelet from Menton Ezil. It comes in a blue hinge-top box that is good for gift giving. The bracelet is a beautiful rose gold with a mother-of-pearl inlaid butterfly design on one end &amp; a rhinestone with a dangling rhinestone on the other end.  It is very easy to put on with a spring loaded hinge so it can fit most wrist sizes. It is very lightweight &amp; comfortable to wear.<br />This bracelet looks nice whether are dressing up or just wearing jeans &amp; a casual top. It is a pretty accessory for women of all ages.<br />As a product review blogger, I often receive products free or at a deep discount in exchange for my honest review. The opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my personal use of the product."
5.0,"Really love it. Very comfortable, im going to buy in all colors."
5.0,Great fabric. Much cuter than the picture. Very comfortable.
5.0,Love. Ordered in multiple colors
5.0,Comfortable and thick fabric so I don't feel my underwear are exposed but thin enough to feel comfy! Get complimented constantly. Wish the waist line went higher so I didn't get the mommy muffin top but so is life. Great pants!
5.0,"These are exactly what I wanted. I will note that if your chest size is larger than 36 it might be a bit too tight, but for me it's perfect. Thin soft material, not padded at all but that's what I wanted. Thanks!"
5.0,Dress is as pictured; speedy delivery!
5.0,Wore it to a concert! Lots of compliments! Very comfortable.
5.0,"I'm have a large bust so its hard to find cute bras, just got it today and I love it!!!!"
5.0,"Great product for running, kayaking.....whatever!"
5.0,Easy to slip into and out of while you wear a post-op sling. Very soft a comfortable fabric.
5.0,Well made and flattering on my daughter. Wash and wear fabric.
5.0,"Muy bonito reloj y buena inversión, a mi hijo de 7años le encantó!"
5.0,"Yep, live this every day..."
5.0,Very nice pair of earrings.
5.0,I absolutely love it. It is exactly as pictured and have worn it days in a row. And a great price!
5.0,I bought this for my daughters bracelet..she loved it
5.0,Great for the price. My daughter chooses this leotard every week for dance class. The sparkles do come off a bit on the skirt but not enough to be concerning. Also did take a while to arrive. Worth the wait and money.
5.0,These ties were good quality for the price and the colors look great! They arrived on time and were wrapped nicely.
5.0,Great pin. Vivid colors. Just a fun piece.
5.0,Awesome boots!
5.0,"Es muy bueno, secado rapido cuando se lava y es muy comodo"
5.0,"Cute dress. I ordered on Friday night for a theme based BD party & it arrived on Sunday before the party! Quality fabric, couldn't beat the price. My hubby even noticed it!"
5.0,Now I can be comfortable in my bra!
5.0,This is comfortable while still holding the girls in place.
5.0,"You know, I got 4 of the &#34;Capri with Button Detail&#34; AND I think I like this even better. With the cuff it looks a bit sharper and streamlined. Just a lovely, well-fitting Capri pant. Had to return for another color in this style too. I love the no zipper, no snap, no button pull-on style. And my office is casual and supports this look."
5.0,Beautiful blouse but fit a little tight in sleeve.
5.0,"Nice material, washes up very nicely.  Fit is according to size I ordered."
5.0,The fit is right on and high quality!
5.0,"Would recommend to anyone.  Beautiful necklace, got several compliments on it."
5.0,I much prefer this band to the rubber ones. It is easily adjustable and looks great!
5.0,Love the slide ratchet buckle.  Just have to trim to size.  Excellent belt.
5.0,Great slim wallet. Love the design.
5.0,These boots feel like they were custom-made for my feet.  Normally a size 8 is a little roomy. But these were perfect fit. This means they’re a little on the small side but I’m very happy as they conform to my feet !  Super soft leather
5.0,"Perfect fit, nice color. Good quality product."
5.0,Love these sandals. I get so many compliments.
5.0,"Love’em. They look super cute on my one year old boy, they are fluffy and comfy. Highly recommend."
5.0,Absolutely LOVE my socks!!!! Soft and kept my legs from swelling after a 12 hour shift!!!!
5.0,"Love them, they are so cute, soft and way more comfortable than most!"
5.0,"Excellent for wearing with costumes, like all masks it does get warm quickly but I like that this one was just large enough that I can wear my glasses under it. Now to see how badly they will steam up."
5.0,"I loved this hat and figured I would get it for my son since we were planning a trip during winter to Indiana. Well it was a tad bit too small for him, but again my son has a bigger head than normal. So what is too small for him may perfectly fit a child with a normal sized head."
5.0,"These are perfect for our needs.  No digging around in pockets for your mask, no dropping your mask, they're adjustable, and keeps it handy and convienent, and the selection of colors is an added bonus.  Two thumbs!!"
5.0,Love it and everyone knows exactly what it is
5.0,"When I first received these, I thought they would be a little small . But they fit just right and will be perfect for the cold weather coming. I would recommend these for those living in cold winter westher. I love them."
5.0,I ordered the size 13 for my 8 year old son. Great fit. He loves the design.
5.0,I got these for my Cub Scout as part of there badge to help get into the spirit of big hunter of bugs.  They even fixed the adults which was cool for the boys to see Dad in.  They had fun and that what matters.  Thank you!
5.0,These glasses were so cute and very well made but I did not pay attention that they were for a small face would be perfect for a teenager called and spoke with rep and he was very nice and said not a problem to send them back just wish they would come in a adult sizee
5.0,Perfect fit and very comfortable
5.0,Nice wallet Good quality
5.0,These pants were just what I wanted! They got perfectly and they look really nice and flowy. Would definitely recommend!
5.0,I like that it is comfortable to wear. Not bulky but effective in floating your glasses.
5.0,Its really dope. Cover and save the entire front of  my baby shirt❤
5.0,"I'm 120-125 (depends how many burritos I've eaten) 32inch chest, 26-27 inch waist and this fits perfectly and snug. It has a lot of stretch so I think it could fit a small to medium no problem as long as it's long enough. If you have a long torso, I'm not sure you'll love it as much. It's great for layering under sweaters, jackets, etc. It has a moderately high scoop neck which I think is extremely flattering."
5.0,"These jeans are very cute on & retain their shape. They wash well.  I would normally wear at least a 7 in other jeans but I wanted these skinny jeans to fit tight. With the fabric content, a 5 is perfect.  I like that they're big enough in the waist but not huge everywhere else since I struggle with weight gain in my waist/ab area. 5'4, 148 lbs. Definitely a go to brand of jeans.  Haven't tried the boot cut that are a different fabric content....if anyone has any fit info, I'd love feedback."
5.0,This unique dress can be worn in multiple ways and is just so cute on! I LOVE it!
5.0,Very cute and soft! I would like to get these in every color!
5.0,"Protect your eyes from blue light and look cute doing it. Great quality and fit, 10/10!!"
5.0,Very comfortable shorts.  Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,My wife wants me to buy this in every color it comes in. She loves it.
5.0,"Excellent quality, double stranded with multiple beads on with equal distances. It looks very goldish and very shiny. It is 14K gold so it is light. I got this as a gift and i am very happy that i did since it looks amazing around the ankle."
5.0,"We bought these (9 of them) for 9 very differently sized women. We bought them for a bachelorette party so we could all match on one of the days out. They were a hit! I was coordinating it so I had my fingers crossed that these would fit/work, and they did very nicely. The bride is a short, tiny gal she ordered a small, I'm about 5'5&#34;, 150 & ordered a medium. I look normally proportioned but always worried about my mamma tummy, but the medium fit fine. One of the girls is a mom of 4 and ordered the XXL. We had it shipped to Tx prime and it took 4 days instead of the normal 2 days. Like I said, all different ladies, some no trouble zones, some all trouble zones, this shirt was a hit. The material was very forgiving, the cut is flowy where it needs to be but more fitted and super feminine too. The material is kinda rough, but that's because it's not cotton clingy which I'm more used to. We walked the streets of Palm Springs and even did a bicycle pub tour in these and nobody had sweat stains (thank God!- We were trying to look cute). Everyone wore it with their favorite cute jeans. Some had flats, I wore flat boots, and couple girls wore them with canvas tennis. Everyone looked nice. You could wear heels and dress this up. The 3/4 sleeve is very cute and was fitted but not too tight. The rose pink is as bright pink as it looks in the ad. It was exactly what we'd hoped it would be, and it made us all happy customers."
5.0,"So so so cute!!!!<br />I have really sensitive ears and can only wear silver or gold earrings. If i wear any other material my ears hurt within a few minutes. I’ve worn these all days and they don’t hurt!<br />And they’re so stylish! :) I wore this pair today, and I plan on wearing a different one every day for variety. What a great price!"
5.0,"It's a faux wrap, so I was initially disappointed.  The fabric is quality, with a bit of spandex.  It fits beautifully and is very flattering, which isn't something you hear a size 14 woman say very often."
5.0,Very beautiful and not over the top - my 15-yo daughter loves it!
5.0,Fits perfect.  My three year old is small for her age but it fit her perfectly with a little room for growth.
5.0,"Second one I bought this year, it's a great wallet, had already the army color now crazy horse , leather , magnets great, cardslots tight, very good quality for this price"
5.0,Use this for giving my 4 yr old home haircuts
5.0,"I Bought it for my 2 year old daughter and she love it.  Even though they don't have a size 5, I got size 6.5, knowing she will grow into."
5.0,"This hat seems to be a good value, the quality seems pretty good (we will see how it holds up over time) and the price was not too ridiculously high. I bought it as a gift for my husband, he often finds it difficult to find hats that are not too small, but this one fit (not a lot of room left over though). It also looked just like pictured on the web page."
5.0,Love them fit perfect
5.0,I got this dress to wear to a wedding and it was so comfortable. I wish it came in additional colors because I would buy one of each.
5.0,The product is exactly as described. It worked perfectly with my sleeveless dress I wore for a 50s pin up themed party. Kept me warm!
5.0,this is a good idea.
5.0,"I got this for my nephew who wanted a black hoodie.  Of several choices, I went with the Russell name, and I was not disappointed.  Good quality, heavy weight, and good fit."
5.0,The material is nice and not thin like may the dresses like this.
5.0,Hermosas
5.0,"Great quality, no sharp edges to dig in your neck. Very comfortable for all day wear. Heart lock is not heavy either. Definitely will be buying more."
5.0,"Despite these socks being advertised for men and boys, find them to be excellent tennis socks for my size 11 female feet.  I'm always searching for socks that I can wear while playing a hard singles tennis match and these did nicely.  They didn't bunch up or slip back down my heels inside my shoes, and they padded my feet just right.  There's really nothing negative I can find to say about them.  I washed them in the regular laundry load and they came out of the dryer fine with no noticeable shrinking and felt just as good as new."
5.0,Love them. The set is very dainty and feminine. I would love a similar one in silver.
5.0,"Was a gift fir my daughter-in-law, who loves anything pineapple.  She loves it!!"
5.0,I sent my wife overeseas for my son's wedding. She kept her plastic inside the case. There may not have been a problem with someone scanning her plastic but she wanted it just in case. The case has ample room for all her plastic and was easy to find in her suitcase due to the chrome case. The price was great and we would buy again if there was a need.
5.0,My daughter received this t-shirt along with a Mulan doll. Loves them both.
5.0,warm and fits many different styles
5.0,I needed a comfortable hoodie to work in my yard for collecting fall leaves......then later for colder temps to wear under a heavier winter jacket for added warmth.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I love it and ordered a second one almost immediately.<br /><br />Be aware there’s a lot of fuzz or lint on the inside so a wash  might be advisable before wearing.  Also on the third wash I noticed a bit of pilling but that was fine with me since I’m wearing it for chores mainly.<br /><br />I recommend the hoodie without hesitation.
5.0,I sized up 2 sizes as per the reviews and it fits great! I didn't even need to unzip it. The dress top is stretchy and comfortable. I love it! I can't wait to wear it in the fall! The top is a tshirt material so you will need an undershirt as it's see through.
5.0,Love these! Great size and nicely made! Used them for party gifts!
5.0,This earring was a gift. My husband put it on immediately. He quite likes it.
5.0,Very exceeded the beautiful hopes i had.  Gorgeous on!
5.0,"Buena calidad ,muy cómodo ,tela delgada y fresca, queda muy grande"
5.0,Like fitting
5.0,Loved the lining and zip pockets. Practical and looks great.
5.0,"This is a very cute dress and the material is thick and high quality. The fit is a little strange on me - I'm 5'5&#34; and weigh 140 pounds, and it's almost too snug on the arms/bust area and it's an extremely loose and flowy dress under the bust. I am usually a fitted-dress kinda gal, so it's not what I'd usually choose, but I actually think it's really cute. And it's very comfortable!"
5.0,"Bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. Can’t live without it. It’s not typical hoodie material, more like a track jacket. Light weight and perfect for what she wanted."
5.0,I love this bracelet. I got one for myself a while back and my Sister in law loved it so much I got her one for Mothers day. As mom's we all need this little reminder on us in secret. The bracelet is also very sturdy and doesnt bend easily which is also another mom necessity.
5.0,"I love the look, feel, & fit! I am 5.5, 165 lbs and got a medium in red. It fits perfectly, but want to warn you that it hangs longer than it appears in the pic. I was still pleased."
5.0,"I have these in a different color and bigger size but thankfully needed to drop a size! I love the look, and the nice little stretch. My favorite part is my guys (husband and son) gave them 5 stars!"
5.0,"Bought this because gym pants have  dumb pockets, so this is a great thing for your cell phone and keys"
5.0,I love this beanie hat as it is very flattering to the face.  Looks simple but has the permanent folds on top of the head that help to make sure you have the flattering look intended.  The flower on the side is great flare.  The lining is soft and fluffy making this a warm and comfy hat as well.  The elasticized ribbed band keeps the hat comfortably in place.
5.0,"Love the feel and light weight. I bought an XL. It was a little tighter across the chest than I normally would like but, overall love this dress!"
5.0,Sweet tank. No one really recognizes where it is from unless you got a hardcore Deadpool fan. Still fits well and is a cool conversation starter.
5.0,Fit was perfect and amazing. I loved it. It's pretty true to size if you like a comfortable fit but if you want wiggle room I would size up
5.0,Love this! Just make sure to hang dry!
5.0,"At the start of the pandemic our routines were upended and I set my wedding ring down somewhere different than usual.  I’ve been searching for it ever since.<br />This allows me to fend off the ladies and let them know I may be forgetful, but I’m still taken.  Sorry, ladies."
5.0,I bought it for my Granddaughter she loves JoJo
5.0,"Cap is good material, not great, but good.  The ""Let's Go Brandon"" is more of a iron on.  Is is not embroidered.  Still over all a five star for the money"
5.0,Baby clothes arrived on time and goods are as advertised and good pricing
5.0,"Better than I expected. No slips, and I walked a lot."

5.0,Extremely strong and very pretty. This is my second order of them. First order was in silver color. Would order again without hesitation.
5.0,"Lanzom® Women Recovery Belly wrap arrived in the mail in only four days.  Unfortunately, I have daily middle and lower back pain, so I immediately opened it.  The product was very easy to put on.  With very little adjustment, only three velcro straps, my back was well supported and I could easily adjust the level of support by either adjusting one of of the three velcro straps.  I comfortably wore my Lanzom® Women Recovery Belly wrap all the next day and had zero back pain that night.  It has now been three days and I'm going to order another.  I have tried all kinds of support wraps, braces and special undergarments, and thus product, by far is my absolute favorite!!  The price is unbelievable, as well.  I look slimmer, my posture is better, my clothes fit better.  I highly recommend!!"
5.0,Soft fabric! Skirt arrived as pictured...although the slit is a little too high for me.  Very sexy!
5.0,Bought these as gifts for my daughter to give to friends as a thank you gift. They were perfect for teens.
5.0,"love ot! I wear it everyday.  Never take it off. I swim and shower in it,."

5.0,My parents were very happy to receive these from my kids
5.0,My 6 year old granddaughter loves this dress.
5.0,Color is accurate to picture. Very comfy dress and so pretty. The slip underneath was shorter than expected but not terrible. Came very wrinkled but I quick ironing fixed it
5.0,Awesome Quality. It's worth what you pay.
5.0,"I put them on, I touched my legs.... Purchased another pair."
5.0,My husband loves this watch!! Got it for him as a surprise gift.
5.0,My sister purchased this hat for Halloween. It's a bit snug on her but looked super cute. Great quality.
5.0,I LOVE this! Perfect for our type of weather to be fashionable!
5.0,"Nice to have the different gauges and extra coils to change them after while, they discolored after a few weeks, but  overall a great product"
5.0,Perfecta y muy buen material es la única faja q he comprado que me hace el cuerpo que deseo
5.0,"I got this as a gift for my boyfriend, only to find out (before giving it, thankfully) that he ""Couldn't see what all the Bob Ross fuss was about and, frankly, finds it weird."" Ok, killjoy, I kept the set for myself, and I'm absolutely enamored with them. Three people already stopped me, pandemic be damned, just to ask where I got the pins.<br /><br />They look even nicer in person than they do in the photo and that happy little tree catches the light really nicely. I read that some folks found the quality lacking from pins they'd gotten in the past from this seller. Since I've never bought pins from this seller before, I thankfully didn't have any basis for comparison and I am overall very pleased with them. Boyfriend is going to regret his carelessly callous comments when he sees these babies shining on my lapel.<br /><br />They DID lose one star, only because i felt the backing (The little thing that holds the pin in place) feels like it may come loose easily. If I'm wrong, I'll come back and give back the star.<br /><br />EDIT: I returned to this pin set its rightful 5th star. Not only have the pins stayed firmly in place, they don't even rotate much from the pleasing angle at which I originally pinned them. Five stars, guys<br /><br />They're freaking adorable. I don't even know how to paint. My happy little trees look like green blobs."
5.0,"Great quality. Looking forward to wearing it every Christmas season for many years to come. Sleeves are a bit long, but every other measurement seems accurate. I'm 6' 200lbs and XL fits perfectly, with sleeves cuffed. I don't like them bunched up, they are about 2&#34; too long for my taste."
5.0,Great ring. Great color. Fits well. My boyfriend really likes it and wears it pretty much everyday.
5.0,Great boot!! very comfortable
5.0,Got this jersey for my wife. She loves it. Thanks.
5.0,"If you want a little button that plays the hype horn, then you are in luck with this baby."
5.0,"The lanyards are a convenient way to keep the masks conveniently close, the filters give me a sense of additional protection, and the prints that arrived matched the photos.  These are exactly as described."
5.0,Got the 3 to 6 month size and it fits more of the 6th month size. Super soft and cute though!
5.0,Love these.  Bought for my sister.  Light weight.  Very nice.
5.0,Well made. Great colors. Good fit.<br />Perfect for Halloween!
5.0,These bags look nice and seem like they will hold up very well.  Easily passed through security at college stadium.
5.0,"Halloween is fast approaching and I don't want to paint my face all crazy. Therefore! I was looking for some cool mask that can be taken on and off. Saw this from a suggestion and got it. Holy wow, it's great, just like the movie! It has 3 modes that can either be solid light or blink. It's comfortable and stap can be adjusted. Definitely rave/lazy Halloween costume approved!!"
5.0,This is a really nice quality tie.  My husband loves it.  The German Sheps are barely visible from afar (just look like a dot pattern) until you get closer and then you can tell what they are.  People always comment on it when he wears it.  He gets so many compliments on this really cool tie.
5.0,Perfect!  Exactly what I wanted!
5.0,Great price and very comfortable  for this nurses legs all day!!
5.0,Grand daughter  loved them. Nicely made holding up well
5.0,"Fits well, quality fabric, seems well made.  Only thing left to determine is how long it lasts."
5.0,I have a small wrist and had to remove all of the removable links... it was easy to do. All tools were provided in the kit which was a plus.  The weight of band when holding it seems heavy but once on it is very comfortable. Quality is great.

5.0,"My favorite joggers I have found. I am a nurse and wear these as scrub pants. Very durable, very stretchy. Not see-through at all. A must buy if you are on the market for quality joggers. Runs true to size and did not shrink in wash."
5.0,The shirt fits as expected.
5.0,This helmet looks good and fits perfectly. I use this for when I go ATV riding.

5.0,"I now have several of the scarves from the seller &#34;niceeshop(TM)&#34; and I love them all. The fabric is a nice quality, not flimsy or scratch. The color dyes are vibrant and rich. They are long enough and wide enough to wear several ways. I'm a scarf junkie and wear them year round, so I have quite a collection. I will no doubt purchase more from this shop!"
5.0,I bought these for my son to wear to a 80's party.  They were a great hit!!!! They arrived on time & good quality.
5.0,Looks expensive.... great price!

5.0,I wore these shoes all night! They are absolutely adorable. I felt amazing wearing them!
5.0,I usually buy an XL...it fit a bit large on me. The weight of the material is nice and not clingy. Great for a date night or casual look.
5.0,It’s a great kit to start off with if you are interested in gauging.
5.0,Ordered this for a coworker he loved it better than the hat he got with the costume.
5.0,Very pretty! Looks real! Worth buying!
5.0,"I can't say enough good things about these sunglasses! I am very picky about sunglasses and wanted some that looked retro, but not old fashioned; flashy, but not in a showing off sort of way; sparkly, but not blinding. I need them to sit far enough from my face so that my eyelashes don't hit them, but I don't like extra nose pieces that can get caught in my hair when they sit on top of my head. They also needed to actually block some of the sunlight as per their original purpose. These sunglasses fit the bill. I ordered the black and the brown set. I wear contacts, so my eyes are sensitive to sunlight. These have given me no problems driving or at the lake or beach. The subtle sparkles on the sides give these sunglasses just the right amount of sparkle. The frames have a sort of beveled edge thing going on around the lenses, which I love. This gives some added eye appeal and makes them even more sparkling. The black ones are classic and timeless, while I think the light brown ones look more current and chic. (In addition, I really like the way they look with my hair color!) I am actually contemplating buying another set in case I lose these and they aren't available in the future."
5.0,"A little short in the torso area, but it does make you warm on these ridiculous cold nights."
5.0,Was looking for something special to commerate the wonderful 19 years I had with my cat Buster.  After much searching I found this necklace and it is absolutely the most perfect thing I could have ever found.  It truly expresses my love for my special little angel.
5.0,Love it! Very nice and cute!
5.0,Everything I asked to be engraved was right it looks good. It could have been a little heavier. I bought it for my daughter and son-in-law. They lost a baby and her name is Addie so I had mommy of angel Baby Addy engraved and daddy of Angel Baby a d engraved on the other one. Their little angel babies in heaven
5.0,Love ❤  them
5.0,Sometimes there is one dress in your closet  that makes you forget you are wearing clothes. It is very comfortable and looks elegant with a statement necklace.
5.0,I received many compliments in this dress. Just wish I got a medium.<br />5’4<br />155 lbs<br />34ddd
5.0,Super cute on! I’m 5’7 180 pounds and the large fits nicely.
5.0,"Bought this for my wife.  Shipping was very quick, and she absolutely loved it."
5.0,"I was looking for something to hold a quarter sized coin and had previously tried other items that claimed they could do so...  but most are designed to hold medalions and aren’t good at holding anything else.  Due to it’s design, this one does.  An Amazon thumbs up!"
5.0,"Love this jacket, will be ordering other colors"
5.0,"Great look, nice fit, fast ship - will buy in other colors soon!"
5.0,Comfortable top. Nice crisp & bright color. Runs small...I bought a size up. Looks great with jeans or slacks.
5.0,Pretty but two big
5.0,This is such a beautiful piece. I am so happy I purchased it. I got a lot of compliments.
5.0,My daughter plays soccer. She loves these.
5.0,"I don't normally buy white, but for the occasion, it was such a cute top. I love the design on it and the material was good! Looking to buy another in a different color!"
5.0,This jacket was so cute! It looks exactly as pictured!
5.0,My husband wears this shirt often to the gym and he goes everyday. He usually just wears cotton shirts which can feel not as breathable after he begins to sweat. But this shirt has such great material that helps him have a seamless workout and doesn't have any discomfort. He looks great in it too just look at the pictures! He loves it and I'm glad I got it for him!
5.0,"The wallet is compact and holds adequate amount of cards.  The money clip is great, however, it limits the amount of bills it will carry because of it's firm grip"
5.0,Just lost my husband and this is the perfect inspirational bangle bracelet.  I've enjoyed everything I have bought from Rosemarie Collections.
5.0,Enamel painting done well larger than expected details nice overall good value for price am pleased to gift it
5.0,"Love the jacket!  It is warm and very, very comfortable."
5.0,"After wearing this set for a little over a month, a big run/rip has formed right in the middle of the butt on the pants. I contacted the company and they shipped me a new pair, which was unexpected and appreciated. I left my original feedback on the set below, but I initially gave it a 4 star rating. Considering how often I wear it, its comfort, and the pleasant customer service, I am inclined to kick up the rating to a 5 ⭐️!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The high waist stays up, no rolling down.<br />-Thinner than expected, which makes it feel breathable.<br />-*Mostly* squat proof<br />-Love the stretch and the pattern on the legs.<br />-Bra is comfortable and supportive on me.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Because of thin material, can see a bit of panty line if not wearing seamless or thong panties, or when doing a very deep squat.<br />-For large busts, the sports bra top doesn’t feel supportive enough for high impact activity like running or heavy cardio.<br />-The thin elastic strip on the shoulder of sports bra sort of rolls on itself with certain movements of the arms, which can be slightly distracting. That’s a minor issue."
5.0,Bought this for vacation. It fit great. I felt like the LADY that I am.
5.0,I love it! Keeps my 4c hair protected while I sleep. I also purchased one for my 5yo daughter to keep her curly tresses smooth. I like that it has extra room in it for longer hair.
5.0,Great fit. I like that there are grip strips on the inside to stay on your heel. These are no show socks. With Sperrys you can see a small part of the sock over the back of the shoe.
5.0,Bought a set of super hero cufflinks for my daughters wedding.  Couldnt be happier.  Great quality and wonderful prices.  Quick delivery!
5.0,"This is so amazingly beautiful, I purchased this for my daughter's senior prom and It is stunning! The photo dose not give this item justice. You have to see it for yourself. Just buy it........."
5.0,The picture on this does NOT do it justice I love mine so muck I ordered another set as a gift.
5.0,GREAT fit
5.0,Looks and feels soft and great!
5.0,It is a delicate ring with good detail and a finished look unlike some of the others I've seen Highly recommend it.
5.0,Very cute and comfy BUT runs small. If you want it to fit you loose go 1 size up. I would order again in another color and size.
5.0,So cute and fluffy! Soles are a solid rubber and seem like they’ll last
5.0,"These do the trick. Perfect for showering at the gym at work. They smell when they first arrive but I'm sure it wears off like most rubber products. I expect them to last for a while since I only wear them once a week, but if anything changes I'll update my review."
5.0,Love this!  Very warm and good quality of fabric.  Took a while to get to me but worth the wait.
5.0,Good made sandals
5.0,girlfriend loves it.
5.0,Nice light weight perfect hot summer shirt
5.0,I bought a pair of this brand In a store and I was so sad when they wore out after a few years.  I am grateful to have found them on amazon.  My only problem is taking them off long enough to wash them- so I bought another pair!
5.0,I've bought two of these bathing suit tops. They are super comfy and the colors have not faded at all. True to size.

5.0,Exactly what was promised. Works well with my new camera
5.0,The shipping took way too long for 3 little charms! The product was as expected so far! They are all Christmas gifts!
5.0,"It looks great and the quality is awesome. It is a little snug on me. I have other spyder products in medium size and they are perfect fit. This runs a little tight I guess. Overall, I am satisfied with the product."
5.0,"Beautiful, elegant looking good craftsmanship."
5.0,Bought this for my best friend he loves it! He likes the fact that he can fit it most of these types of bracelets are too small for his wrist this ones perfect. Thank you for making it in larger sizes for men.
5.0,Nice items
5.0,"this bracelet was s petty and so easy to put on with the magnetic closure..  It arrived sooner than expected, and packaged so pretty.  II got a lot of compliments on the 4th if July when I wore it,."
5.0,Fast shipping awesome customer service and great quality sweaters!! Will buy again
5.0,My son loves this watch. It is one of his favorites. Real leather band. Stylish piece.
5.0,ADDS A NICE LOOK
5.0,"I love this, so ordered another in a different color. Fits perfectly."
5.0,"This is a beautiful and stylish necklace. I don't like fancy jewelry so this is very natural and down to earth and yet I've received many compliments on it. It's a real crystal and it just has a natural beauty to it that blends with formal or informal wear and is appropriate for any occasion. I would highly recommend anyone to buy this necklace. It's obviously well-made, sturdy and very good quality. More importantly, it didn't break the bank!"
5.0,"I'm very satisfied, good quality, good price, up to expectations, delivered promptly, thanks."
5.0,Love this shirt.  Get lots of compliments.
5.0,These were so much fun! I bought these for my grandchildren's (ages 10 to 18) stockings. They really enjoyed them.
5.0,"I had been searching for something to wear under my flats, mostly to prevent sweat and odor. I tried a couple of brands purchased in a shoe store. They were adequate, but these are even better. They stay in place and are comfortable. No more stinky feet! The bonus, though, is how the lace peeks out just enough to add a bit of dressy-ness. Love these and would definitely recommend."
5.0,These all worked and all of the kids enjoyed playing with them.
5.0,I love the color. The bands were easy to attach and are great quality. The color was perfect.
5.0,I was so glad to be able to buy gray shoelaces for my New Balance running shoes after one of the original laces broke.
5.0,"Gorgeous, but the underslip is too tight, I don't want to ruin the look with bunchiness or pulling down a slip that may ride up, so I have to buy another slip :("
5.0,Chic!  Casual and dressy!  Love the fit!
5.0,really cute top!!
5.0,Arrived fast in perfect condition. I love it! Fits great and feels comfortable on hot days pool side or at the beach. I am 5’4” size 8 and it’s loose on me but drapes nicely. It comes down to the top of my foot and does not drag on the ground. Already getting a lot of nice compliments from strangers.
5.0,Very nice. For that price I have no complain at all. Overall a good purchase
5.0,"Yes, I love the handbag."
5.0,LOVE THE CAT EYES EFFECT. VERY SEXY ON ME.
5.0,Good product! Seems Like good quality
5.0,"There is something about this simple hematite bracelet that makes it an attractive wrist addition...I think it's the blue bead!  The bracelet stacks well with other bracelets and the healing hematite is a bonus for sore wrists.  Although it's not a cure it does feel good when I wear it.  And, I would also like to add that this company is very pleasing to deal with:)"
5.0,"Delighted with this watch band. I used it to replace a nylon strap on an Electric California watch and it was a great match. I could see this strap working well with any moderately large face watch, particularly any with a thick case and a lot of silver tone. I think the light colored leather and silver buckle on this strap are perfectly matched for either brushed or high gloss stainless silver watches. It provides a casual but classy look. I especially like how thick this band is...it will definitely stand up to larger, heavy watches. Comes with replacement spring bars, too. Really nice calf leather; comfortable; quality made. I would definitely buy this brand again."
5.0,Carrying it with me
5.0,Wonderful soft material! So comfortable
5.0,"Love my glasses, they came with nice and genuine box and they look exquisite! Thank you"
5.0,I love this necklace! The colors are so nice and the chain length is perfect.
5.0,"All my son wants to be for halloween is a horse head. When I found this online, i knew it would be perfect for his costume.  I'm pleasantly surprised with the material and how breathable it is. And he's super excited that you see out the nose and not really the eyes. He thinks that amazing.  I have a very happy boy!"
5.0,It protects the medallion and you can fit two in it with ease I keep my 24 hour coin and my month coin in it.
5.0,It is such an unusual piece that I have had many people comment on it. It is a very versatile piece of jewelry. I am also very happy with the quality of workmanship.
5.0,"Love this sweatshirt jacket. It was just what I was looking for. Perfect weight, not too light, not too heavy."
5.0,"This is super cute! I love the sparkle and how it's placed. The ring goes in backwards, unlike normal rings, so it's placement is unique. I think that's why a lot of people say it doesn't fit right. I put it in the wrong way the first time and it doesn't sit correctly. But when placed in backwards, it lays flat. I don't find it any heavier than other rings I've worn."
5.0,Fits true to size. Lots of finger room and very flexible. Super warm. Great gripping ability as well.
5.0,The material was good and the graphics good
5.0,My son loved them. Definitely worth every penny!
5.0,I've ridden about 10 times in these shorts now. The padding is a significant upgrade from my previous pair. It takes about an hour of riding before I start to feel the bike seat. I am a 36 to 38 waist and bought 2XL and they fit well.
5.0,Absolutely by far my favorite leggings.  Material is good quality - squat proof...no one seeing anything they shouldn’t.  I have purchased 3 pairs and will be buying more.  Fit was perfect!  Have received compliments on them when wearing.  Have recommended to several of my workout buddies.<br /> Wear the casually even when I am not working out.
5.0,Love the style and print! Perfect for summer weather.
5.0,"Color of this dress is so pretty! However, the cut and fit isn't the best. Maybe it runs small but I found the top area to be perfect and mid-section down to be too tight. For an off-the-shoulder top dress I expected a cute form fitting but not TIGHT lower half.<br />Also, it came with a large spot on the chest area so it's getting returned.<br /><br />UPDATE: Customer service contacted me after the initial review, which I think is great! You don't often find such attentive companies so they get another star just for that.<br />Just opened the replacement dress, no spot and a size larger and it's great!!! I'm usually a true medium but with the off the shoulder ""comfy"" look, this dress fits great in a large. It's not frumpy or baggy, it's loose where it should be for the style and tighter where it should be to show a little body shape. Can't wait for the weather to warm up so I can wear it!!!"
5.0,Must have. Everything just right. Cotton material isnt thin nor to thick
5.0,"Beautiful,no problems, boxed as if purchased from a fine jewelry store."
5.0,"I like the shirt. Its good, just got to figure the sizing. Im 5'11&#34; and athletic 170 lbs. The XL is too small for me, going to try an XXL."
5.0,Everyone loves this piece.  It is beautiful
5.0,Bought these for my son and he was SO excited when he got them. He loves that they are polarized which is why I bought them. Would recommend!
5.0,Came in right color fits perfect
5.0,This neckles is different and beautiful
5.0,"Our glove loss rate is one per week in my house. Our kids go outside for recess at school even when there's snow on the ground, so my kids have to wear gloves. This value pack looked good because the colors work with my daughter's coats. They're stitched well - they'll hold up really nicely on the lost and found table at school for at least a few weeks. She likes that she can play on the monkey bars and playground equipment because the gloves have grips on the hands. Of course we haven't even had these for a week and she already lost a gray one. 🙄"
5.0,"It is really a nice, durable, heavy mask that looks like Uncle Fester."
5.0,Very attractive!!!  Looks nice with my rose gold watch!!!  Very easy to install!
5.0,My daughter wears it almost every day.
5.0,son muy comodos y protejen super bien del frio y son lijeros y funcionan super bien con las pantallas tactiles
5.0,"I'm 5'3'' 123lbs, Small fit well"
5.0,One of the many items that I have ordered that fits as expected! Love it!!
5.0,Nice quality. Actually better quality than I expected. Very nice.
5.0,AMONG US
5.0,Shirt has a good stretch to it. It fit really well and was really flattering
5.0,"Cute, durable bag! My daughter loves it!"
5.0,The Seller contacted me and sent me the right scarf. I’m very happy with the scarf and their customer service.
5.0,Love the item but had a problem receiving it.................Customer service was great received full refund THANKS
5.0,This is a very beautiful blouse. I love the soft pastel/feminine color.
5.0,"I wanted a little bag to carry to work, and I searched a ton of online reviews to find one of good quality.  This LPV bag had the best reviews.  I've carried it for close to a year now, with lunches, tablets, and even a netbook. It holds a netbook and power cable comfortably. The bag is good quality and I've had no issues with straps or zippers. I would definitely buy this again."
5.0,Best shoe on the market
5.0,"Fit as expected and the material is not too thick, not too thin. Washes well. I only wish it comes in more colors."
5.0,"I love these pants!  They're super comfortable and I've gotten so many compliments on them!  I'm 5'7&#34; with a ~28 waist, and these fit just fine.  They're plenty stretchy, so they could definitely fit a wide range of sizes.  Like another review said, I wouldn't really consider these &#34;parachute pants&#34;.  They're looser just below the waistband (and have fun pockets), and they fit more like a loose legging.  The colors are really bright and have survived one cold washing so far without any fading.  The only thing I'm not in love with about them is that, while soft, the exterior is a little grippy, so they sometimes have a slight tug on blankets/other fabric.<br />Bottom line, I bought 5 pairs because THEY'RE SO AWESOME and I want to wear them every day!"
5.0,Great quality and fit. Highly recommend.
5.0,My daughter love Them.
5.0,"I will use these boots for hiking. They are very comfortable and I like the look. I think they run about 1/2 size too small so I would order up 1/2 size, maybe a whole size if you wear heavy socks."
5.0,Over all completely satisfied! Great Product! Definitely ordering other colors.
5.0,I got this for my 14 year old daughter and she loves it. It is padded nicely to protect her laptop.
5.0,"I wore this skort on a bike ride and it was awesome. It made me feel girly yet, I was covered.  As other people noted, the shorts are loose.  I actually liked that they were a little loose.  It made me feel as if I was wearing bloomers under my skirt.  Loved the pockets.  Follow the sizing instructions."
5.0,Love the unique look of the case.  I have received many compliments!  It also is easy to see in my purse.
5.0,Great buy! My son loves these too!
5.0,This was an ok quality. Some of it was hot glued and not sewn like I assumed.
5.0,Excellent quality for super low price!!!
5.0,So perfect!
5.0,Great gift for baseball fans. Great customer service.
5.0,This was purchased for my son & he said that he likes it & was glad I got it for him.
5.0,"Don’t hesitate to buy this flannel. Quality material, excellent fit. Satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,"loved it, my daughter thinks it is great"
5.0,Love these sunglasses. They are perfect for driving and are surprisingly well made considering the price.
5.0,Love it material is light airy smooth and soft. The jacket runs a lil small in the arm length but I still love it bc I pull my jackets up my arm just a lil anyways. The pants have pockets thank gosh I hate ordering things without pockets. I tried them on over a pair of leggings and still had wiggle room yesssss. Can’t wait for my other outfits to come. Quarantine who not gone stop me from looking cute.
5.0,I used this product to clean my Nike airforce 1 and my FILAs and I think it works pretty good. You do have to be patient and scrub and clean it a few times. I also used some bleach to get the yellow out of the bottom on the shoes. I think it would be awesome if they made a rougher brush for the bottom of the shoe along with the first brush.
5.0,This was not thick was very thin and see through. Definitely not warm but wearing it long enough in room temp can feel warm in it. I think you’d have to have a booty to see it better with these type of leggings on. I got an XL just to be safe because I get worried with clothes from amazon. I’m usually an XL but i thought since it stretches shouldn’t be bad. I think i could have done a large because still felt stretchy enough to. Other than that still looks good on me. Just can’t wear it out in public only home.
5.0,Love this bag. Holds a lot and comfortable to carry
5.0,I like that it is easy to put on and take off.
5.0,"Loved it, it is beautiful in the design and I look forward to wearing it with costumes as it is a versatile mask."
5.0,"Looks as described and fits the bag I bought it for. I bought it to fit this tactical backpack, https://www.amazon.com/Mil-Tec-Military-Tactical-Rucksack-Backpack/dp/B005KDBHWM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1465516885&sr=8-1&keywords=tactical+molle+36l. I am going to the Philippines so if it works for this one trip it will have served its purpose. Honestly though, if you took a couple of double-ply hefty garbage bags with you, a garbage bag would probably fill the same purpose. Nice product though."
5.0,Too cute 😍
5.0,"A bit heavy, because of the thickness of the glass, but very cool."
5.0,"Thick, warm, comfortable. I ordered the size 1-2 for my 18m old and they fit just right."

5.0,"Love the way it fits, and it’s a very cool fabric, perfect for summer!"
5.0,Love these I get more complements on them.

5.0,"This product is the perfect size for just the basics needed when not wanting much weight to carry. Hiking, biking, running, shopping and daily needs. The zippers and inside compartments are perfect to fit small items and the material is so easy to wipe off. The phone holder is secure and in a great location, nice to have quick access!!!!! Comfortable on the back and shoulders. I haven't tried but I bet a smaller size drink would fit nice in the phone holder also. I bought two and love both deep bright colors. Thank you Hotouch"

5.0,"Cute, looks the picture. The top of the long pendant hits around my bra band and the top of the shorter light pink pendant hits about 3” higher than the low one. You can tell the shorter one is plastic but it’s pretty darn good for costume jewelery"
5.0,Beautiful. My mom loves hers

They fit well, are just the right amount of thickness (not too much either, just enough to keep you warm and your underwear doesn't show through), and are so affordable. I'm going to buy a few more pair just to keep them in stock."

It is a slip dress (which, if it's from free people, means its probably see though.. this is really sheer.) It looks really cute with a half slip and bralette. Just be aware that most free people stuff seems to be made for layering. The tie is nice for customizing size."
5.0,Very comfortable sock
5.0,"My wife, whom is a former Disney employee, and self professed Disney nut. Very much loved the look of yet another beautiful Disney charm from Pandora for her Pandora Disney bracelet. It looks and feels great and really captures the Magic carpet scene in the movie"

5.0,"Received quickly, boxed securely. Beautiful!  The comb stays in my hair much better than the alligator clips, so I'm going to change all my hats to combs.

(Now that says a lot for a company who wants too make sure their customers are satisfied).....Don’t know what the other reviews are chatting about “ASmell” ( they did not smell of any strong odor-besides a real leather scent)....Anyway! Their are Tru to size for me and I had enough toe room to move mi toes freely as well as an all over comfy feel! #JustPurchasedOtherStylesAndColors!💋"

5.0,"Soft leather, holds a lot without looking stuffed."
5.0,"This is my second pair of these exact glasses. They are amazing. Well made and sized frame, stunningly clear and well tinted lenses. The coloring of these particular lenses is what make then worth buying again. The contrast from these lenses is great. I wanted to hate the from the minute I got the. Today, i have four pair of different color combination but same style frames. Definitely worth giving a chance."
5.0,"Bought it to portray a ""fox bride"". Holds in place with what's considered a ""French comb""."
5.0,"I have only had them for 3 weeks. what I like about them is that they are light weight, arms have not loosened up and they do not slip down on the bridge of the nose. I also like that you get three pair and so far, I only have had to wear one. surprisingly I like the orange arms. my lenses are 2.5."

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:b6505d4bd79fc6e534ea95fde7d4ad6f]] So my youngest daughter got these for her crocs, well there ended up being enough to not only share with her sister… but her Dad also swiped some! He ended up with all “The Land Before Time” looking dinosaurs! Definitely suggest them!<br /><br />***BUUUUUUUT***<br />I had to order these twice and they still almost didn’t make it!

5.0,Wow! Very impressed with these! They are very light and fit well while also being stylish. I love that I can still wear with a ball cap which is an issue with many larger lense glasses. I've even purchased an additional pair for myself and 2 for others who love mine.
5.0,Dress is absolutely beautiful. Better than expected. Quality is good as well.

5.0,Super fast delivery-these are perfect-not too large and fit my small face perfectly-the green is not as bright as the pic-which makes them look even more authentic!!! Came with a durable case and polishing cloth-packaging was nice!!!
5.0,"Cute ,good material I’m 5’7 and about 157lbs I bought a large. I wish there were more colors"

5.0,"These goggles are perfection! My kids love them!<br /><br />They’re so great, my son’s pair was stolen from where we take swim lessons. I keep looking to see if I see them on anyone’s face so we can get them back.<br /><br />The fabric of the swim cap didn’t quite work out for my daughter. It slips a bit.<br /><br />But overall, this was a great purchase."
5.0,"I wanted a smaller locket (see photo), this one is the perfect size for me. I love the filigree cover and the fact that the picture peeks thru without being fully revealed. I have been wearing the locket daily for a month now. For the photo, I used the preview sheet from my Walgreen's photo print order.  The preview pic is the idle size.  This is now my new favorite necklace."
5.0,"Love these tunics!  Perfect with leggings, soft material and fits great."

5.0,Loved these when I traveled to Spain.
5.0,I’m 6.0 225 I bought a size bigger than I normally wear so I got an xxl the fit is good enough so I can wear layers underneath.<br /><br />Have not used yet but very heavy duty compared to most stuff I’ve used in the past<br /><br />Wish I rolled up smaller but that’s probably a lot to ask when it’s gonna keep you real dry on a motorcycle
5.0,Fits to size and not too long - I am 5’ 9’
5.0,These cover ip is one size but even for a large size person it was too big but I love the color and the fabric. Will recommend to friends

5.0,"I make, sell, or gift others with mini albums, portfolios, charms, etc. I am always trying to find charms which aren't cheap feeling or flimsy but still aren't so expensive you can't use them as often as you'd like to. These are perfect. They are nice and shiney, the perfect size, wonderful variety. I'll be sure and purchase from AlphaAcc in the future. love em.<br />'"
5.0,"I'm new to power lifting and I'm very happy to be recommended to get these sleeves. I'm 145 lbs and 6'0 tall. The size small work just fine for me, maybe could have done extra small. Easier on the knees for squats and deadlifts. Keeps knees warm. Does what they need to do. Highly recommend."
5.0,I like it 👍👍👍
5.0,"This dress did the job for me! I am about 5’6”, 148 lbs, size 36C chest.  LOVE THE POCKETS. The material was light and airy for this hot day, went great with my sunflower themed bridal shower. I loved the zipper being on the side."
5.0,Gorgeous earrings! Love them!
5.0,There was nothing to dislike...……..
5.0,"VERY tiiiiny. Sadly, had to return. The fit was wayyyyy too tight in the legs and waist. But the color/wash and distressing were PHENOMENAL!  The bells are the perfect size too."
5.0,"I’m obsessed with these things.  It’s not because I don’t want to tie my shoes, but because I just don’t like the look of bows on shoes that aren’t otherwise supposed to be “cute.”  You just have to make sure you get the right size.  If your shoes have four grommets, they won’t need laceez as long as your six-grommet shoes, regardless of your shoe size.  If you’re not sure, just measure the laces you have now at the length you need your new ones to be.  There is always the option of cutting them off and tieing knots at the ends if you get them too long.  If you get them short, you can skip a set, or every other set, of grommets.  Sometimes those are even better choices.  These work and look great.  Buy them!"
5.0,It was a little irritating across the nose to begin with but works great after using it a few times
5.0,"Great quality, fast shipping."
5.0,Very comfortable! I use it alot. Like the fabric for it's softness.
5.0,This product was the perfect size for my project. I made Christmas ornaments with clear balls and added my friends senior picture and another picture of them from our yearbook.

5.0,Im in love with the dress!
5.0,Great quality not cheaply made. Easy to snap in and they came individually wrapped which made it a plus.
5.0,Ordered this necklace for my mother-in-law and she absolutely loved the pendant; definitely worth the price
5.0,I especially liked the contrasting color of the heels.  It definitely makes sliding the socks on easier while maintaining proper orientation to the foot.
5.0,"Love it Love it, better than what I expected!!!"
5.0,"So cute! Love the fit for both style and comfort. What first makes you think “Yellowjacket,” looks surprisingly different and adorable on. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"IT HAS POCKETS. This is very important, for those of us who are tired of seeing dresses or pants that look like they might have pockets but do not."
5.0,"Amazing!!! fits great.I am 5'7 165 and got size XL. could have gotten a L to really show off my curves!! Its perfect,love it"
5.0,"I got this item to give as a gift. The material is very stretchy and soft. Seems quite large and will be plenty big enough, like that bow was included. Very bright, pretty colored pattern. Can't beat it for the price compared to other similar items."
5.0,These are super soft and so comfortable. 10/10 will buy again. Love the deep pockets.
5.0,These fit so well. They look great with skinny jeans and with my ankle pants I wear to work.
5.0,"I received a nice pair of Ray Bans from my husband as a gift. Unfortunately, the sunglass hut we went to said that they don't make the style I chose of sunglasses in small and polarized. Bummer. Well, I got them anyway, but they were sliding all over the place. I put on these rubber ear pieces and its like night and day. I would highly recommend. If you've got long hair though, don't try and rest your glasses on your head...unless you like your hair pulled."

5.0,"Bought this for my 3 y/o 4 th birthday party. Very, very cute. Fits her well. She loves it!!"
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress. It's perfect for the daytime paired with a racerback bralette and your favorite sandals. I'm 5'7&#34; and about a size 8, so I tend to be between sizes. I ordered a medium in this dress and it fit perfectly and the end of the tassels hit just above the knee. I highly recommend that if you're in between sizes, order down. A care recommendation I would make is not to wash it in a normal load for fear of the tassels falling off. Instead I would stick it inside of a mesh laundry bag with your delicates to prevent them from being pulled."
5.0,"Despite the price for one strap only! I would say it’s totally worthy l, it works really well, they look strong enough and good quality. My son feels comfortable with this strap."

5.0,I live these for my grandson. They are great quality and not thin cotton. Only kind my daughter and I will buy from now on.
5.0,I didn't wanna replace the original band on my Samsung Gear S2 because of the $50 cost.  I'm hard on bands and needed an affordable replacement.  This is the only band that's legitimately fit my watch without alteration or discomfort issues.  The price is very good for the quality.  Saved $40 and I'm still using it.
5.0,its very nice. works well
5.0,"I love this item so much! It came in a short amount of time, I think it was two days! I highly recommend purchasing."

5.0,"I really like this leather, hence more comfortable than plastic band. I really like the neutral color, because it goes with everything and my original black plastic band was just ugly."
5.0,"Very nice tie, knit and thin design."
5.0,Based on reviews I sized up to XXL and the fit is great.  Super warm without feeling too thick.  Great phone pockets that don't sag.  Once I got them pulled up properly they had great staying power.  And now I've washed them a few times and they aren't pilling in the wash which is a HUGE bonus for me as well
5.0,Nice and comfortable<br />You can almost see through them but that's cool
5.0,"I would recommend this cap to anyone! The lining on the inside of the cap, makes it super comfy! It also was the perfect size for my head (no headaches). And to top it all off, it was super stylish. I received many compliments at work!"

5.0,My son loves the pajamas! He looks adorable in them.
5.0,"I was hesitant to buy this product at first, but I'm glad I did. I may need a bigger size since my wife took mine. The quality and comfort of this product is unlike any other cap."
5.0,"Love this tote and the small change purse/wristlet that comes with it. I had been searching for a purse that would work well at the park, beach or camping. I wanted something that looked nice, was functional, won't discolor if water gets on it and roomy. This tote checks off all those boxes. I think the colors are great. It has plenty of room in it and a nice inside zip pocket which is perfect for key and phone. The wristlet is compact but surprisingly has a lot of storage. I currently have 2 lipsticks, lip balm, feminine products, eye drops, change, ear buds and earrings in it, all without it becoming bulky or distorted.<br /><br />My only negative is that I wish the inside was divided, that would be more functional for me.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was given this product for free or at a discount for my hones unbiased review."
5.0,This is a gorgeous watch.  I bought it for myself but I'm giving it to my husband for Christmas instead.
5.0,"I bought this set for my grandmother for Mother's Day. It's stunning! She loves flowers and the color purple, so this is perfect for her. I am VERY pleased!!!!"
5.0,This bracelet for the class of 2016 is beautiful!  The detail on the chain and on the charm are so beautiful.  It fits nicely and has a little room for adjustment.  It is a very high quality bracelet and made my 2016 graduate very happy. I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.  I loved this product so much that I bought another one for a friends daughter.  If you are looking for a nice inexpensive gift for a graduate this is the one for you.
5.0,Loved this shirt
5.0,Very nice....it was a gift they love it😍
5.0,I had these for about 10 or so years. They fit my teeth and stayed on pretty well. The mold just fell apart while I was teasing my 6 and 4 year old (monster high fans!) I’ll be ordering another pair. That’s why I’m on here and I’m reviewing them.
5.0,Great ponochos that I used at Disney World when it rained.

Still really nice quality and beautiful!"
5.0,I love that these come with a little cloth case for my son. He gets to rock these & be just like dad!

5.0,I love these! I’m using them as bathing suit bottoms!
5.0,"I LOVE this shirt! It's a nice thick, stretchy material. The rouching on the front is really slimming. Its low cut but looks amazing! I'm 5'2 and a 36DD, usually wear a L to XL. I ordered a L and it fit perfectly. Will definitely be buying more from this seller."
5.0,"My daughter really enjoyed this bracelet.... I picked it as it is smaller than many bareclets and she has very small wrists...it was a bit loose but she loved it and said she could feel the love across the state... it is very sweet.... and not something you have to worry about someone stealing, but gets the message across... thank you."
5.0,This shirt is well made! It seems a bit small but I probably need a larger size than I thought. This tee is of a heavy thickness - love that it's warm; not flimsy.
5.0,Tthis rosary is beautiful and my young daughter loves it the quality is outstanding I would highly recommend this product.
5.0,Purchased as a Christmas gift; heard it was the perfect size and she loved the design!
5.0,"I love this dress! I got the chiffon coffee and the light green one, they are both so cute. But just not the right color for what I need so I have to return. But xxl was a little roomier for me. Xl did fit but I like the roomier option. I'm 5'5 245lbs 38gg"
5.0,"This silk is exquisite. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. Especially for the price!  It does take some time to get to the U.S., but be patient because it's worth it."
5.0,"Gifted this to my 12 year old daughter.  She loves it. My biggest issue is the cord. It keeps coming untied. Nothing a silver chain won't fix, though."
5.0,These earrings provide the right amount of sparkle without feeling over the top. They would work with jeans and sneakers and can add that special something on a night out. Lovely

5.0,fit great and did the job! happy with purchase.

5.0,"I bought this wallet two years ago.  The quality is top notch, I love the minimalist form factor, and the materials are luxe.<br /><br />Over the years I've managed to lose quite a few of the little screws that are used to mount the faceplates.  I reached out to customer service and asked where I could but some additional screws.  They said the screws aren't available separately but that they would ship me a new wallet with all of the accessories, including extra screws.<br /><br />AMAZING customer service.  I am a customer for life"
5.0,"Cute item,"
5.0,I am very pleased with the beautiful bracelet I ordered from the Art Depot. It was exactly as pictured and it arrived right on time.
5.0,"Ordered this for an upcoming concert I’m attending, and I wish I had purchased more! I (6’1”, 44in chest) think this fits very well and nice. The fabric came clean, and no faults with manufacturing. This fits comfortably on me; hardest thing about it is taking it off as it’s a little snug in the shoulders for me. The fabric is a little thick, but is nice and breathes well. I would make sure to purchase the right size for yourself, but I think everyone should own one of these!"
5.0,"A VERY NICE ADJUSTABLE RING FOR COCKER-LOVERS!!! MOREOVER, QUITE AFFORDABLE NOT TO SAY CHEAP..."
5.0,great glasses.

5.0,"Bought this for my daughter for our disney trip, which unfortunately had to be cancelled, but it is super cute and fits great.  Love it!"
5.0,"I usually wear a large or extra large to provide for a roomy fit, so I can easily layer underneath with a turtleneck, etc.  in this case, based upon other reviews, I ordered the large and it's still a nice roomy fit.  Thus, ordering one size down makes sense.  If you like a really snug fit and don't plan to layer underneath, perhaps order 2 sizes down.<br /><br />The royal blue color is vibrant.  I highly recommend it."
5.0,Loved the fit & how comfortable it is.
5.0,"Birthday present for my granddaughter, which will celebrated later this month."
5.0,Very lovely.
5.0,Absolutely a beautiful peace of jewelry.
5.0,"great standard masks, fit was more snug (in a good way) than the usual disposable masks. only concern is i’ve read that the masks with little vents don’t do as good of a job keeping your particles from escaping, but these are fine if you’re in a pinch."
5.0,"My dad wears this hat all the time! The only thing he wishes were different is if it said ""Veteran"" on it."
5.0,They're great!  I would order again.

5.0,"They appear to be well made time will tell but , they fit perfectly !!"
5.0,This is one of my favorite dresses.  It fits wonderfully.  Too many times dresses are too short or show too much of my chest.  I like that this dress is easy to slip on and can be dressed up or down.  It doesn't hurt that it is my favorite color too!
5.0,Awesome quality!
5.0,one of my fav pair of sweatpants and im a female!!! Fits perfectly
5.0,These are your basic tennis shoes for kids. I can’t complain. They’re good for your money and comfortable for kids. No complaints here.
5.0,the best shirt ever
5.0,Got it for my lady and loved the look

5.0,This is a real bag it is a small but perfect size to put your phone and wallet in. I love these as they are so comfortable to wear. Also it is a real hand bag as long as it has the number stamp in the back.
5.0,"These socks are really nice and soft which are made from bamboo fibers. My husband likes using them with his chuck taylor shoes.. The socks fits fine on him and mine as well, his size 12 and I am size 7. The pack comes with 6 pairs and each has a silicone grip inside the heel so it would not slip off of your feet. True to what they say, the socks are really invisible like when wearing shoes because of the low-profile design. The socks are also odor resistant and when my husband use them, his feet doesn't really smell coz with his other socks his feet does smell a bit sometimes. These are really comfortable socks. I received this complimentary product for testing and review purposes. All thoughts and opinions are of my own and were not swayed by anyone."
5.0,Second one like this I have bought for my 10yr old son. He loves it and says it keeps him warm on the coldest days. He won’t wear another coat he just always wants this for his winter jacket.
5.0,Beautifully finished sterling pendant on a smooth snake chain. Arrived on time and gleaming. Recipient loves it.
5.0,great fit and very  very comfy.I am petite so sometimes one size fits all does not work but these leggings are great. material is not too thin so great for day or eve wear. washes well.
5.0,"I bought these because they look almost like the silver fern that's a symbol of New Zealand. I love that they follow the curve of my ear, and they're really pretty. Like other reviewers have said, bending the back part scares me into thinking that it's going to snap off one of these times, but I've gotten pretty good at taking them off and on without bending it much, so hopefully they can last a long time. I haven't had any issues with them sliding down very much--just once in a while if I sleep in them or something.<br /><br />These are quickly becoming my favorite earrings. I've only worn them a few times so far, but I've already gotten more compliments than I can count. I highly recommend these to anyone who might be on the fence--they really are as pretty as they look!"
5.0,The product was just what my son wanted
5.0,"Adorable, perfect size, lots of pockets. Definitely recommend!"
5.0,i received a lot of compliments. It was just what I was looking for a special outfit
5.0,This shirt is super soft and stretchy. It look really good quality. Seems true to size. I got this shirt for my dad and he likes it a lot.
5.0,"Love these socks! Ordered one pair to see and now ordering another one.  When I wear regular compression socks with tennis shoes, they are so hot in the summer.  These are omfortable and I think I will like them a lot."
5.0,This was such a cute dress and it fit perfectly.  It has pockets and now I will be looking for pockets on every dress I buy!  It came with a belt of the flowered material that you do not have to use.  t looked fine without it with a fun necklace.  Going to buy more of these.
5.0,Love these glasses and I get a lot of compliments.
5.0,Better then expected. The fit was perfect. The color was beautiful and the details were LOVELY!
5.0,"Love these boots!! I wear a 9 - 9 1/2 normally. Was afraid these would be too small but they are perfect. A little narrow at first but after wearing a few minutes, they are perfect! I wear thinner socks too. These are quality boots! I got them at a great price!"
5.0,Love the different patterns.
5.0,Will keep using and love it.
5.0,"I Love them, they are Comfy and very easy on the feet--especially on hard surfaces! If you want them then get a pair as they are a wonderful fun addition to the Holidays!"
5.0,Very nice!  Strong bands but delicate design.  I love the leaf that hangs!  Please don’t be like me trying to change bands for the first time and not read directions.  I almost tire it up.  The band release is on both ends of the watch face on the back of the watch.  Can’t wait to buy others!
5.0,Great product took awhile to get the smell of the rubber aftrer that it worked fine all the kids love it.  To 5 year old and under too scary.
5.0,"I love this brand of leggings. They are SO SOFT. I normally order black but this time I took a chance on a color. I ordered “pink” and (to me) they are not pink. They are more of a lighter purple. Color shown here for pink is not accurate for what I received, just to be aware, but nothing I knock for because I know colors can vary."
5.0,Was everything it said it would be.  I am very satisfied with the purchase

5.0,Very well made. Nearly perfect fit. Having lenses made this week. Great buy!
5.0,Sent it back--beautiful dress..  my wife loved it--just too tight..
5.0,A little.long for a small size
5.0,Just like the photo. My birthstone is May so it’s perfect.
5.0,love urban expressions bags! roomy and not cheapy looking. 🤣
5.0,Gave to 8 yr. old granddaughter for Christmas in size 10. Be aware that it definitely runs small. Am re-ordering in a larger size.
5.0,Good fit but the color was lighter than expected.
5.0,"Perfect sleepwear, soft and comfy"
5.0,It is so cute. I will buy it again
5.0,BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL! Well made so pretty!

5.0,Very comfortable shirt and the small fit perfectly.  Lightweight and perfect for early Fall weather.
5.0,i bought these socks in july of 2020 and theyve held up really well. only one pair got a hole in it but it was small enough to easily patch. they are wearing out but its been a little over a year (which i think is very good). i can probably get a bunch more wears out of the set that i originally got but i order another set cuz these are just too dang good. the fit is amazing and the length is absolutely perfect.
5.0,"super nice and cute! I'm so happy with my purchase! A+++++ seller, Highly recommended! :)"

5.0,Esta muy lindo pero también súper cómodo tiene una excelente tela
5.0,Thinner material but that’s fine for summer. Gives u a 70s vibe
5.0,"I ordered this for a wedding. It is probably the most comfortable formal I have ever worn. I am 5'4"" and 148 lbs and 36C and a medium fit me perfect."
5.0,"I specifically purchased these shoes for Tough Mudder New England 2013 and they performed exactly how I was hoping.  The lug shape, size, and number were perfect for all the trail running during the 4 months of training and for the event itself.  They would disperse the mud and not fill as other shoes with a tighter tread pattern would.  Gripping on rock, or trees was also excellent.<br /><br />The materials used were perfect for releasing water and drying relatively quickly.  I actually removed my socks part way into the mudder course as they were only hindering the benefits of the shoes.  These things are light yet rugged and show no signs of seam or sole failure after all the abuse.<br /><br />From the basic traction on trails and through streams to the obvious amount of mud to negotiate and the hill climbing of the mudder (this one was at Mt Snow, VT), I would highly recommend these shoes for trail running confidence or helping to complete any of the obstacle-type, running challenges!"
5.0,Good for price. Wishing for more than two sizes
5.0,"As described, elegant and style watch, but the belt is little bit short should be more length, over all is good."
5.0,De muy buena calidad
5.0,Everyone compliments the ring. I have to keep a nice manicure because I talk with my hands and everyone notices my little shiny something. Very classy ring for an unbeatable price.
5.0,nice for work or play
5.0,"I love my new sunglasses. I bit big for me, but excellent in all other aspects."
5.0,I bought this to use as a summer nightgown and have worn it for that purpose but wore it a under a couple of dresses for work and it was perfect. It stayed in place and though it's nylon I didn't have static issues. Will buy another.
5.0,I purchased this for my girlfriend a few months back. She loved the color and style. It seems to be holding up well.
5.0,I LOVE these leggings.  I have replaced all of my others.  I’m curvy and these fit perfectly!  They stay up and are definitely squat proof.
5.0,My son uses this on his shoes to keep them looking good.
5.0,My man loves these shorts.
5.0,Feel comfortable. Very nice to wear.
5.0,"Now I can tell everyone to back the heck off without getting violent. And if they're getting too close from the front, I just Ash Ketchum it and they get the message real quick."
5.0,"Great look, Great fit, Great price,, will order another or two!"
5.0,Bought these for our family shoot and purchased the 1-3T for my daughter she’s in a toddler size 8 shoes right now and these fit pretty well and still were a little big!! Loved them!
5.0,A lot more sturdy than other bags I've bought.  Holds just enough for a weekend trip.
5.0,"I bought this dress for a bridal shower, it was a perfect fit."
5.0,Great buy and lots of room.

5.0,Simple and secure. Easy to attach to the earpieces. Nice snug fit.
5.0,I love this nose ring!!!
5.0,No complaints at all. Product was just like it was described
5.0,"Looks exactly like the picture, very pretty. Doesn't look super cheap and it gives kind of a jingle sound from the &#34;coins&#34;, which I like. AND the package was delivered in 8 days! Wayyy sooner than I expected. Good purchase."
5.0,It fit just right over my swimsuit. It wasn’t too baggy. It fit just right.
5.0,"Though I was bummed that this ended up arriving 2 weeks AFTER Easter, I enjoyed trying it on for the first time! Just add batteries (not included), step in, zip up and turn it on. I recommend wearing a swim suit inside as it will get hot ! There's only one spot to look out of by the mouth.<br /><br />I accidentally scared my 4 cats and 1 dog the moment I walked downstairs - which gave us all a laugh. I had no idea what I looked like on the outside until I watched a video my husband filmed of me. My Easter plans fell through with this but Halloween is right around the corner!<br /><br />BTW I imagine you should be at least 5'5"" or taller to wear this thing and see out of it. It is very very tall and I am 5'6""-5'7"""
5.0,I was looking for a pair of lightweight modest pants for summer and these were perfect.  I’m between a size 16-18 right now and the xxl fits great. I ordered them in sage and got many compliments on them.  They also kept me cool in 80 degree weather.
5.0,"Comfortable, silicone on the back of the heel keeps them in place."
5.0,Beautiful- mother in law loved them
5.0,"This is an OMG purchase...It is SO beautiful and looks SO much more expensive than it is. I purchased the XXL based on previous customer reviews. I normally wear a large, and the XXL fits perfectly. I purchased the gray and am buying 3 more in different colors. The previous reviewer who said the gray is darker in person is absolutely right--but it is a lovely dark blue-gray. This is my favorite clothing purchase this year."
5.0,Perfect fir 8th grade theme dance!<br />The mask fit very well and it matched his suit!
5.0,"I want this dress in every color!! It fits like a glove, not too short, and looks so classy.<br />The medium fits bustier gals like myself. I'm 32DDD-27-36.<br />I did note the mesh sleeves are delicate so I know they will have runs if I ever wash the dress in the machine. I'd suggest hand wash only."
5.0,Must buy!! Favorite piece of jewlery.
5.0,Well made hats keeping me warm this winter.
5.0,"So the product runs small, as expected, but that is why I always go up one or two sizes. My daughter looks amazing and wears the dress with a shrug to church. She is beautiful and always gets compliments."
5.0,Great looking time piece I am on about six of this brand love everyone of them
5.0,"This purple scarf is everything, its the most beautiful purple I seen in a while and it's long enough to wrap in different styles. It's a deep deep gorgeous purple! That's is I'm buying more of this brand right now."
5.0,My family loves this mask. It’s easy to take off and put on. Very breathable.
5.0,I love these. I don’t like hats or visors on my head. I have used this item for years. I was so happy to be able to get them online!!
5.0,Just what I was looking for. Perfect size. Love them.
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress. It is incredibly comfy and perfect for warm spring and summer days. Also the xs fit pretty much as I expected (I am 4'11'' so everything is a little long on me, but the length is perfect for my job as a teacher!) Definitely ordering more in different styles and colors."
5.0,Love it 🥰! I bought these panties because I had an hysterectomy total abdominal. It’s work great. I was looking c-section pantie and these work great for me. I recommended.
5.0,Im 5'7&#34; 200 lbs  and I ordered the extra large .  It is actually high waisted  like it stated.  it fit great but the stomach area was a little Loose on me.  I am actually going to order these these jeans again but one size smaller.  The jean material was also very thin  but very comfortable so it works!
5.0,Excellent. Just like the band that came with my watch
5.0,Very light weight protection for your eyes.
5.0,Pack like a pro! We were able to combine two suitcases worth of clothing into one suitcase thanks to these amazing packing cubes.
5.0,Love this little umbrella! I keep this in my work bag so that I will always be prepared for rain. It’s the perfect size and it’s very sturdy. Before I had a Totes mini travel umbrella and I believe this is the same size umbrella but this one is much sturdier.  Comes in nice case to protect it while in my bag and keep everything from getting wet when I use it.
5.0,Perfect thanks
5.0,I bought this product in a store and love the design and get a ton of compliments.  My only feedback is that I wish the pockets were quite a bit deeper as it is is a tight squeeze for my Iphone 6S.  The zippers are also not very user friendly and need to hold the jacket down to zip and unzip.  I have noticed that the zippers could improve generally with goode rider products.
5.0,"I like it, its flowy"
5.0,Perfect hat. Fast shipping. Came clean white. No complaints on this one.
5.0,I love these earrings! They're a fun way to make an outfit look nice. The orange ones are definitely the wrong color from the amazon picture. it's a very bright true orange (not a burnt orange)
5.0,I love it it looks sexy and is perfect for tanning bed
5.0,Beautiful! My friend loves it!
5.0,It fits to my head..nice.
5.0,"Item as described, great seller. Thank you"
5.0,"[[ASIN:B01ABHGYFG Tyzon 925 Sterling Silver Promise Ring Luxury Design Cubic Zirconia for Couple Engagement]]<br /><br />This is a beautiful set of rings crafted of fine sterling silver.  I very much enjoy that the rings are nickel free because I don't have to worry about our fingers breaking out, or allergic reactions.  The rings are a lovely matched set with the man's ring having a single solitaire stone and the woman's ring having a center stone surrounded by 6 smaller stones on each side of the solitaire.  The bands are adjustable as you can see if you look carefully at the back of the band in the picture.  The inside back of both rings just slides to a larger size, as needed.  I am sure you could take it to a jeweler and permanently set it to your correct size.  The rings are beautifully crafted and smooth polished to perfection.  I am enjoying the set of rings very much and my boyfriend loves his too.  I love the shape and flow of this ring and the nice modern look of the set.  I get complemented on it often and and happy because of it being crafted of noble sterling silver, it should last for a lifetime. I have no complaints or problems at all with this product and it's working well for me."
5.0,for the money I really like this watch

5.0,"I'm 5'1"" 210lbs and super curvy. This dress was everything. The color is amazing and I received many compliments.  I put a black petticoat under it for fullness. Buy it!"
5.0,i had to have it bec its  green color. The chain is definitely duty  not plastic
5.0,"I love the ease, style and quality of this ratchet belt. It comes extra long but cutting it to a shorter length is easy. I'd recommend it."
5.0,"Seemed very thin and i was skeptical at first view, however it is very warm with the fleece on the inside. I don't see any wind breaking through this jacket and i feel comfortable letting my toddler wear it in her carseat because it isnt heavy. I ordered 3t and it is big on my 2 1/2yr old who is petite but not so big she cant wear it. So it fits as expected"
5.0,"great style and quality, would defintely buy another"
5.0,I love the dress!! The material the length is perfect. But order a size up lm 5'2 tall and 125lb l order m it fits perfect.<br />I highly recommended!!
5.0,I will always buy my vet hats from rapid dominance.  They are made well and fit well
5.0,"First impression: Package came in 2 days all the way to Hawaii, no weird smells and came in good condition. For size reference I am 5 feet tall, 24 inch waist, I weigh about 115 lbs. I ordered a size xsmall, and it fit me perfectly! It hugs my waist without being too tight, has the perfect compression around my stomach, and stops at the perfect place on my ankles with no bunching."
5.0,"GORGEOUS dress, especially for the price. I am in my late 20's and ordered several dresses to try for a black tie event... This was the uncontested winner! It's elegant, fits in all the right places, and seems like it is made well for the price. It is true to size, but it's a little on the tighter side. This dress would also be perfect a perfect bridesmaids dress."
5.0,Everything was perfect. The pants are pretty short as mentioned in other reviews as well as the boot covers being super snug.
5.0,Holds everything and compact
5.0,Love it but it was just too big and heavy for me. Great bag though.
5.0,"I love this dress so much. The fabric is so soft and cozy, it fits really well, I love the pockets and the length. The only thing I don't like is the fabric clings, I bought this dress for family pictures and need to wear it tonight so i will rub it down with a dryer sheet to see if that helps."
5.0,"Excelente, me encantó 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
5.0,"As an individual of the male species, I instantly started to like wiener when I wore this. Don't ask me how or why, but as soon as I put this bangle on, I felt the urge to call every guy in my phone book and talk dirty to them. I mean, I'm still going to wear it, because it looks fabulous on me, but for all the straight men who don't want to turn into a peter puffer while wearing this, it's cool. The effects subsided the second I took this bad boy off. You've been warned."
5.0,6 Year Old Daughter loves them
5.0,"This is exactly as stated in the description and a great deal for the money. It has a stylish, but muted design. You will have to install and cut to length the belt. It's a little hard, but worth it"
5.0,Really cool.  I bought a number of these and gave them to my daughter who is a teacher.  Her literature class was reading the LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy.  She gave them as rewards to the students who had the highest marks on tests and quizes.  They were thrilled.
5.0,Loved these gloves! Super warm and kept my hands completely warm in the 20 degree mountain weather! Touchscreen with the globes worked really well too!
5.0,"The dress fit well and was flattering. I have not washed it yet, though."
5.0,Fantastic!
5.0,Loved the ArIat top.  Perfect flattering fit
5.0,use to my free time
5.0,"I bought this jumpsuit to wear to my son's November wedding as a backup to my first choice. This was ordered after my initial choice and it arrived first. Upon unpackaging, I noted what a luxurious-feeling fabric it is & the thickness of it prevents any unwanted panty lines from showing. The color is just the same as a deep, California ripe summer-plum! It was about 4"" too long, but nothing a quick stitch couldn't fix. The initial outfit arrived and paled in comparison to this jumpsuit. So, due to the quality, this became my only choice for the wedding!"
5.0,My husband loves these waders.  He went trout fishing and said he was able to maneuver sooo much better than any other waders he has ever had!  Climbing in and out of the stream was a piece of cake.  He usually falls at least once but no problem this time at all.  Would definitely purchase again. He has much more confidence now.
5.0,One for each day of the week for weeks.  Or two for each day of the week for one week.  Mix and match.
5.0,"My previous Swiss Gear bag lasted over 6 yrs. before the zippers broke,so I'm very satisfied with this an will buy another."
5.0,"Love this bracelet! I sent to my mom for Mother’s Day and she loved it. When I saw in person I ordered for myself and wear constantly. For the price, it is so well done and “heavy” and gives the appearance of real. Will probably order more to stack."
5.0,I like it. It's the style I want. It's comfortable and I'm satisfied
5.0,"Color, quality, fit"
5.0,Cute earrings purchased for a women's Halloween skeleton costume
5.0,GREAT PRICEA QUALITY
5.0,So pretty and great value for price
5.0,"Good quality, fit as expected, my wife loved it"
5.0,"Totally what I expected.Beautiful, just wish it was 1-2 inches longer."
5.0,Resistente al trabajo fuerte.
5.0,"Came in a little mesh gift bag, however, they are very attractive and go well with a nice black or cream colored dress shirt."
5.0,These are well built and look like they will last. Very happy!
5.0,Great quality and.my daughter loved them for her birthday.
5.0,Very comfortable pjs. :)
5.0,quick shipping and a very nice shirt! from a not as lean anymore Marine! :-)

5.0,grate  slippers have purchased 2 times
5.0,"They were exactly as described, and in great shape.  Exactly what I expect in a pair of Oakleys.  It's a shame they discontinued this line."
5.0,"Well, well. My beautiful grand nephew was born almost 7 months ago, and he is crawling. Amazon has amazing deals on baby clothes and accessories, and I am elated these knee pads were available.<br /><br />Although he's too young to appreciate all his auntie does for him, I'm sure he will love the comfort these knee booties will provide. They are great quality and thick. Thank you! Love. xo"
5.0,Love it!  Thanks for the heads up on sizes. They do run small
5.0,I got this for my best friend and she loved it
5.0,"Bought for my roommate - so over the moon for these, the craftsmanship and perfection has this individual quite ecstatic"
5.0,This is one of my son's go to pajamas when he's cold and it is extremely soft and well made.
5.0,I wear a large or extra large I ordered a 2X it fits great and I love it and I got it for a wonderful price thank you Amazon
5.0,adorable! I turned out better than I was expecting
5.0,"Arrived much faster than expected. Great little shoes, easy to make fit. My little grand-baby grew out of them too soon."
5.0,"Ordering from Amazon sometimes hurts my self esteem. What I mean by that is I wear a size large or a 12. Often when I order from Amazon I have to go up 1-2 sizes. I know the products come from overseas and they run much smaller but if there was a way for Amazon to fix this problem I'd be so much more confident with ordering clothing items online, Even when you look at the sizing charts sometimes a person that wears my US size has to order an XL/XXL or my measurements are &#34;off the chart&#34;<br />I suppose I vented, but yes this shirt did fit (order big),"
5.0,This is a really nice necklace and I wore it with a pair of jeans and a black bodysuit and It’s everything!
5.0,Beautiful & affordable
5.0,"Cute, casual shirt that fits really well. Tight around chest and then flowy around midsection."

5.0,Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my 13 year old. She loves it. She said it's breathable and comfortable.
5.0,Like the product...will buy again
5.0,Amazing for the price! Mine didn't come with mittens like one person said but it also didn't have a sharp zipper or perfumey smell like others said. I bought the 2 yo suit for my 15 month old and while it was big (had to roll up sleeves and pants) it was wearable and kept her nice and toasty.  The cold and wet didn't penetrate at all and it will fit her next winter!
5.0,Fit great 👍🏻
5.0,This is such a comforting dress
5.0,Love it. Added to my sachel purse now I have a cross body purse
5.0,"I should have read the details, I own another pair of pants similar to these but they are a lighter, thinner material (which I like) these ones are polyester and kind of heavy. Almost feels like a bathingsuit. Otherwise, I ordered a large and they were a tad big. I am typically a size 10/12 and 5'3. They were extremely long as well. I LOVE the colors and wish I could keep them but the material just isnt my fave."
5.0,"great watch, i buy it as a gift and everyone loves it!!"
5.0,"This are the best pair of sunglasses ever purchase, the frame is hard, fit great and the lens are really dark"
5.0,Soft thermal top!
5.0,Always get compliments on this hat.  Well made and fits well.
5.0,Fits as expected.  GEttinger a XXL next time I buy. A tight fit is good but a loose fit when biking will cool me better.
5.0,"Comfy, bright vibrant colors & can be used as a head bandana face covering, or as a hair accessory. 100% cotton & machine washable, colors stay vibrant even after a wash. Great Seller!.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
5.0,"These fit great and help with light incontinence while running.  I ordered a small and they fit as expected.  Overall, great purchase."
5.0,Grandma loved it! Says it’s cozy but a little small
5.0,The frame got loose and now they fall off my face but it is expected for the cost.
5.0,Nice and warm. Easy to wear
5.0,"Love it, it's perfect and gorgeus"
5.0,I was afraid they would be short on me as I'm 6'6&#34; and usually get nothing less than a 36 inseam.... which I own 2 other pairs of. These allow just enough room to show off my sock game. ;) Conversational piece.
5.0,Hermosa tiara!!!
5.0,Very comfortable! Fits very well. Have gotten many compliments.
5.0,Love it! Quick reply and status update. Greatly appreciated and will be ordering again!
5.0,"This dress is to die for!! I was a little concerned it would be too big based on some of the reviews, but it fit just right. I'm 5'5 110lbs for reference, and I ordered a small. The fabric and cut are extremely flattering, you can pull it up so the fabric gathers slightly to cover any stomach areas you're uncomfortable with. It's not extremely short, in fact, I even folded it under a bit to make it shorter for going out dancing. The material isn't too thin and I didn't have any trouble with it being translucent. It's very soft and stretchy with a lot of give. The cutouts are so beautiful and really make the shoulder line look fantastic. I highly recommend this dress!!"
5.0,"Great bag, roomy, love that it’s made from tree bark!"
5.0,adorable little wrap ring and fits perfectly on my little finger
5.0,Feels good and looks good and has lasted.

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:bbc706fee3b137c2b77561801f2c9d1d]] My nephew is a Fortnite fiend and he'll be having a Fortnite birthday party in January, so this boogie bomb will be perfect for making all those 2nd graders stop and boogie!<br /><br />It is made of plastic, so you'll have to take the appropriate precautions- don't actually throw it- but it's great for the cost."
5.0,"I purchased this dress to wear at my wedding shower and absolutely loved it! The material is thick and the fit was spot on. I am 5'4, 135 lbs, and bought a size small. I'm excited to wear this dress again!"

5.0,Love the pretty stones as well as the quality of this bracelet.  Very pleased with my purchase.
5.0,Super cute! We love it!
5.0,"Oh how I love these skirts. Flattering. Well fitting as expected. Form fitting at the top, flowing at the bottom. I'm old fashioned and wear a slip under mine.<br />The ""red"" skirt is actually cranberry, not red. The green skirt is green / gray. However one sees the color, we can agree that they are lovely.<br />Fits as expected for a 3x. I'm 5'4 and have to fold the top bc the skirts are very long.<br />These were purchased as a gift to myself. I am pleased with the purchase!"
5.0,We bought these to keep the sun off our necks while we r digging for diamonds in Arkansas this month
5.0,"These sports bras are a PERFECT  !!<br />Great fit, good material I will buy this brand again."

5.0,They look like a burnt orange when the light hits them just right. Absolutely stunning.
5.0,"This worked perfectly for my 48 hours total flying.  I loved having my head covered, gave a sense of security.  Soft material.  Many people in their reviews said they don't like how the hood doesn't come over eyes.  It did for me."

5.0,"Better than I even expected - they fit great, were super comfortable, and really cute!"
5.0,"Wife has had it for a few months now and wears it to her vet clinic.  Gets complements all the time.  Is holding up well, especially since she wears it more than her other scrubs because she thinks its cute."
5.0,"the bands that come with watches never are that great, so i always buy the watch then get a band i like for the look i want.. these bands are extra nice high quality and i love the way it looks on this watch. I highly recommend them. The bands are a Top quailty product."
5.0,These are even cuter in person! I love thar the sole has durable rubber and seems like they will be great for walking! I may have ordered a size too big but my daughter should grow into them in no time. Really like these! Great value for the price especially when stride rite and others are double if not more!

5.0,Great leggings and very warm with fleece
5.0,Very pretty vintage style dress! Love it!
5.0,Granddaughter absolutely loves this pajama. Wears it at every opportunity. Looked too big when we first saw it but it was not. Fits her well.
5.0,"Absolutely love these leggings!! I’ve bought 7 pairs now. They are the only ones I’ll buy. I have some that are xs and some that are small so I’ve noticed that depending on the color they fit a little differently, which I’m okay with, I just exchanged them for a different size. I did order two pairs and receive the wrong color, but again, no biggy, just exchanged for a different color. Please never stop making these!!"
5.0,Perfect for my 1 year old
5.0,"This canvas is &#34;picture&#34; perfect. The dimensions were exact, colors true to match my decor, and image so clear I expect<br />the chickadee to move at any moment! It was easy to hang and arrived to Alaska in perfect condition! Who could ask for<br />anything more. It is now in my &#34;Chickadee Corner&#34; of my living room."
5.0,Very happy with whale tail
5.0,This bag is perfect . Looks great and very spacious . Great for the gym or even a weekend quick getaway . Great quality and very attractive for men and women .
5.0,This is absolutely beautiful. So pretty.
5.0,"This is the perfect commuter or shopper bag.  I take the train into work daily, so one large and lightweight bag is most helpful and this bag fits the bill in every way.  It's just large enough to hold my work shoes, lunch, wallet, umbrella and any files that I take back and forth plus it has 6 interior pockets for my cell phone, kindle, work and train badges, misc items and two exterior pockets for keys and such.  On the weekends, I can take it shopping and keep lots of smaller purchases right in my purse at the mall or shopping center."
5.0,"This is a soft cotton top and it is thick, soft cotton"
5.0,The price was excellent! Good value for the money. And very comfortable to wear.
5.0,So cute grandkids love it
5.0,"A truly beautiful color, gives the watch a sporty look.<br />Easy to install, easy to clean (my husband washes it after gym) and comfortable. Goes with many cool watch faces.<br />Good value for the money."
5.0,"My Son loves this - he was surprised I found a hoodie in flame retardant fabric.  Comfortable, and worth the price as he'll wear it!"
5.0,Great Turkish robe made from Turkish cotton
5.0,My boyfriend loves it!  Thanks for a great product and great service.
5.0,I bought these a few weeks ago. Thought they were good enough to buy more. They are comfortable.
5.0,"Beautiful mask!! Much higher quality than I had expected for the price. And thank you for such speedy shipping, my daughter loved it as part of her Halloween costume. Would recommend highly!!!!"
5.0,I love the color. They block the sunlight really well. They are very lightweight
5.0,These are beautiful and bigger than I thought they would be. I purchased them as a gift for someone that loves studying stars and ruby is her birthstone.
5.0,"Love this suit! I ordered this in a XXL because the reviews suggested to order up. I could have gotten away with XL, but the size I ordered worked fine and covered all my mom parts that I wanted to hide. The bottoms are loose, but the long top covers them. I'm a size 12/14 and a 38D."
5.0,Luv my earrings!
5.0,I really like this shirt/ blouse because it can be worn as dressy or with faded jeans with holes.
5.0,These are great! I was a little nervous because the packaging is in an unfamiliar language to me but they're pretty self explanatory. I should've ordered another one! These make organizing so easy so that cords don't get all tangled and whatnot. Definitely should give them a try!
5.0,I love the pants It’s fitting nice on my body
5.0,"I love this tunic length tank, it is very flattering if you have a wider measurement in the hips then in your thighs. It does not show all of your &#34;business&#34; when you bend over either, love that as well."
5.0,Wish it was bigger but absolutely love it.
5.0,"I'm a size 12 and large is what the size chart recommends but, I like a longer and look so I bought an xrlg and I'm very satisfied. Great fabric. Definitely recommend."
5.0,very nice colors
5.0,Great price and the necklace is just amazing!!!! Very good quality for price.
5.0,Still using this product! I love it! it hasn't worn down or become uncomfortable. Great for my trail running and yoga! No need to change!
5.0,I was very happy with the value and my son loved it.
5.0,Installed on my Timex and love the side button to release. I would say more but it's just a good quality watch band. Not much else to say. Pay attention if your watch has or needs the curved ends or if that's the look you want. I would buy again.
5.0,"I actually bought this for my review mirror. It helps me find my car faster in a packed parking lot, but also I love looking at it. Calming when driving."
5.0,Great size! These are awesome as earrings.
5.0,"This is a hat which has appeal.  The look is just fantastic and it's got a real straw feel to it.  To combat any sizing issues it actually comes with some 3M felt pads which can be affixed to the headband to tighten things up.  This is just the perfect hat for a beach party or an informal get together with friends.  If you're thinking of buying someone a fun hat as a gift or fashion accessory, this one should be high on your list, it helps nail the look!"
5.0,"Such a gorgeous ring! I only wished I had ordered a size 7 instead of a 9. The ring is very comfortable to wear, but I little looser than I anticipated. I sized up since the ring is bigger. But these babies fit true to size. The detail of the scales and teeth on the dragon are amazing. Excellent craftsmanship. I love it!"
5.0,I got this for my mom as part of her Christmas gift. Unsure about the fit as of right now. It appeared to fit as described!
5.0,"These are perfect, great price and love the colors"
5.0,"Very cute. Fits as expected, Came in time. Looks so good i recommend buying it"
5.0,"I purchased it for my daughter and she loved it, great quality for a great price. The hat is adjustable with a gold hardware small buckle for adjusting in the back.  I got it in the color red."
5.0,"These earrings are one of my favorites! I have had them for over a year and they still look great. Of course with any costume jewelry, it does tarnish. Over time, the gold finish has become duller but honestly, because of the style of the earrings, it adds to the antiqueness of the look. The tassel portion has remained true to color and hasn't faded or frayed. (I got the purple color). The weight of the pair is on the heavier side so if you are sensitive to that, you may not want to wear them all day. Literally every time I wear these earrings, I get compliments on them so it's definitely worth the purchase and I can't wait to buy more in the remaining colors."
5.0,"The lenses were well packed.  The color is so vibrant, really!!!!  my husband replaced my old lenses out of the frames, it didnt take him long, but I could not watch because I figured he would break them with him man hands, but he did not, they look great."
5.0,Decent price for decent product
5.0,"Iris makes nothing that isn’t colorful and sparkly. This pin did not disappoint. Heavy. Cannot be worn on a t-shirt, in case you ever thought about it."
5.0,I love ❤️ it
5.0,"Great tanks, fit well and are breathable ."
5.0,"They look great. One of my favorite things about these are they they don't make my ears smell. They get &#34;aired out&#34; and washed out so there's no smelly build up, not to sound gross, but anyone wearing gauges knows what it's like to have ear holes that smell like death."
5.0,very sparkly!!
5.0,"The battery life is good, the app is easy to use, the shock feature worked great to wake me from sleeping when usually I sleep through alarms. Great product:)"
5.0,"These fit perfectly. They are like the ‘more expensive’ brand, thick and the pockets are GREAT!"
5.0,"My 8 year old daughter wanted these boots bad, but I had my reservations. I was wrong. She's had them for the last 2 months, and they keep her feet warm, dry, & have good traction."
5.0,"These reusable bags are so versatile!! I keep them in my car to use for a lot of things.  Even when stuff spills in them, I can hand wash them and they air dry very quickly!  They also hold a lot and didn't tear when filled.  The little pouch is a good idea but I don't really use that for anything."
5.0,My daughter (11 years old) loves the goggles. She says they fit her very well and did not fog up when she went swimming. She especially loves that they come with a carrying case. Thank you for a fantastic product 😁
5.0,My original review for this item wasn't a very good one because the backs that were sent with the earrings didn't even fit.  I couldn't even wear them.  But the company reached out to me and fixed the problem and I got another pair.  The backs now fit and I love the earrings.  Great purchase and great customer service!
5.0,"I've been using these socks on my longer runs (greater than 5 miles) and find that they provide great support, as well as my legs don't feel as sore afterwards.  Also helps minimize swelling, they compress but are not uncomfortably tight.  The price is good and the quality is great.  Just wish more fun color combos were offered, hopefully soon =)"
5.0,"This sports bra has the perfect amount of cuteness and support, plus it's very comfy."
5.0,Great colors! It feats comfortable.
5.0,amazing sunglasses they are perfect and it took 2 day only to get deliver
5.0,"This is fabulous, forgiving of bodily imperfections and very slimming.  It is a stretchy material and hugs you in just the right places.  I am 5' 6 and weight about 170, normally a size 14-16 comfortably in jeans/pants.  I ordered the XL and it fit perfectly, with extra room.  I probably could have been fine with the L, but I don't like things skin tight on me.  The fringed hem is cute, and hangs down a little further than the photo shows, but if you like to cross your legs when you sit down, you wouldn't want it any shorter anyway.  This dress looks very dressy and you could easily wear it to a formal black tie event with the right jewelry.  I highly recommend this dress because it looks wonderful, fits great and is super comfy."
5.0,Love! I can’t believe how affordable these leggings are. I usually wear medium but I got a small and it fit just right. I weigh 140-145 and I plan to lose more weight & small was perfect.
5.0,"Love Spanx, love their structured leggings, and thought these would be great for the upcoming holidays.  Ordered a large initially (as that's what fit well in the regular fabric Ready-to-Wow structured leggings) and I could wear them, but they gave me a bit of a waist muffin-top.  They may stretch, but I ordered the XL just in case they don't.  These fit well, are still quite tight - not uncomfortable, just suck-you-in tight), and the fabric is great.<br /><br />I am 5'7&#34;, 145lbs...most of that hips and butt."
5.0,"I love this hoodie, it is very soft and comfortable. It fits as expected. The tag says to dry clean only and for anyone reading this let me tell you all you have to do is throw it in the wash and just let it hang dry. I do this with several of my other sweaters so it's not a big deal for me."
5.0,Great bag ! Fun
5.0,Super cute top that is very fitted! Love it!!! I bought the xsmall.
5.0,My wife was iffy about them and didn’t think it would fit. Got them and fit perfect she uses for home and gym A+++
5.0,"QUEDO MUY BIEN, BUEN COLOR, BUENA TELA"
5.0,The dress is really cute for this price. I order a small and it fits perfectly. Material is nice
5.0,"These are the softest socks ever. Every Christmas I buy them for my neighbor and her sister. I think they would be disappointed if they didn't get them. Other than being so soft, I love that they don't cut my circulation off in my legs like so many other socks do."
5.0,Great first big boy belt for my son. Easy to use & looks nice. Buckle is heavy metal & dressy too
5.0,This hat is very well made and has very rich colors.
5.0,Material is not the best but the print is fun and unique.  The size chart is slightly off and the dress looks beat belted because of it.
5.0,"I’m picky about my clothing. I usually pick comfort over style, but this shirt fit perfectly, was cute, and one of the most soft and comfortable shirts I own."
5.0,"Fits perfectly, very happy"
5.0,My husband loved them!!!
5.0,"I love these for my toddler, the only down side to them is once it’s dirty, it’s hard to wash completely clean."
5.0,"I wasn't sure if they would be as cute in person, but they are. They fit perfectly and they very warm."
5.0,"I love this swimsuit! Second suit I’ve bought from this company, and it did not disappoint! I’m quite busty, and the straps on this suit are thin so I will be using it for a layout/chill suit. So in love 😍"
5.0,I really like this piece and glad that I purchase it. I thought it may not fit but I was surprised that it did fit really will with extra room. I am glad that I got the chocolate brown color. The only thing I don't like is the button hold in the front is a bit hard to open but if it had of been elastic then it would of soon broken so I believe with a little bit of wear that it will loosen up. I love the quality and the material of this piece.
5.0,I bought it from my sister and she totally love it. Very good material and spacious.
5.0,Beautiful scarf.. great color and quality.  Fast shipment.
5.0,Perfect- love it
5.0,"This is the second time I've purchased this watch! I lost the first one while training unfortunately. I couldn't wait to replace it! Most of my coworkers prefer wearing big bulky watches like GSHOCKS but they just get in the way and don't look nearly as pleasing on the wrist. Plus I can wear it perfectly in any occasion (unlike most watches people wear) because of its minimalist design. Its simple, it works, and it get the job done!"
5.0,"Totally Worth the Price! I used 4 of the hooks to hot glue to a piece of plywood for a ring toss game at my 4 year old's pirate party and used rubber diving rings and these hooks held up for a year after that! The other 4 I added to the kids costume box and they love them! They don't come pre assembled, you have to insert the hook into the black cuff but that isn't hard. I would definitely buy these again. fit children and women's hands perfectly"
5.0,"I like others have always been  a big fan of Paul Neuman, but I didn't realize the struggles and rejections and the really hard work He did all His life getting to be who He  was.. The Biographer writes beautifully and down to earth.I used to live not to far from Neuman when He was growing up in Shaker Heights, Cleveland is a great town. Thanks again for all the information.My favorite movie was ""The Witness"", and the Sting"" I thought it was a great job of acting,He made acting look easy!!!"
5.0,The Pacific PPE 2 Pack Household Glove Mixed Package comes in a set of two different color gloves (purple for the flocklined PVC and white/pink for the unlined PVC gloves). They are individually packed in a plastic bag which can also be used for storing the gloves when not in use.The gloves are made of good quality material which sustains some tougher cleaning jobs like cleaning the kitchen sink and bathtubs. I also like the fact that the gloves are reusable which I believe should last for quite a while.
5.0,This is a lovely conservative but cute dress. I can see myself wearing to work and church. I bought it in the navy size large (5’4” 175 lbs). It’s fully lined. I like it a lot!.
5.0,I really like them and WILL likely buy more
5.0,"Love this shirt!  Only true fans will know what it refers to, which is what is so unique about it.  Excellent design - simple and well-made."
5.0,"Its a beautiful crossbody bag. Cute and ready to go bag. It goes with everything, classy occasion or even nothing but ordinary day. Just simply love it."
5.0,"Lightweight, inexpensive, no nose piece problems, and durable did I say inexpensive. They last me on a construction site almost 6 months to a year and then I replace them if they get too scratched. The lenses never popped out and I never broke a pair and they took heavy abuse. I recommend them highly as durable readings."
5.0,I love the sparkle and shine.  It really adds to an outfit.
5.0,Fit as expected! Love!!
5.0,I had one of these before. And I was so happy to see it on here. It looks just like the one I had before.
5.0,"I didn't use it yet, but I was thoroughly impressed with the TSA lock system and the space a available in all 3 sizes. I highly recommend it."
5.0,Love these yoga leggings. I get so many compliments on them. They fit very well.
5.0,Really loved this outfit it’s super cute and flattering. Could have gone with an extra small but wanted a more modest look with less of a crop. The bottoms were comfortable and although had compression did not pressing too hard.
5.0,"I orig bought 2 of these pullover quarter zips for work. (I work at a hospital). I wanted something not too thin or thick, but enough to keep me warm. These are more flattering than the men's quarter or half zip sweatshirts that are a bit cheaper. Since they passed the dryer test without shrinking. I even bought a 3rd one. Runs true to size I can wear a M or L depending on the fit. With the M, it's still roomy."
5.0,It allows me to keep all the gift cards I receive in one place without me having to keep my gift cards in my wallet. That would stretch out my wallet and make it bulky which I do not like. This cubby is easy to organize alphabetically and fits in my purse very well.
5.0,"Clear lens, durable, and lightweight."
5.0,Very nice color and the fabric is soft.
5.0,I had seen it being used on various YouTube videos and decided that I wanted to try it.  I LOVE it!  It is great for those thick projects that your sewing machine doesn't like.  It works well with the walking foot too.
5.0,My husband loves this jacket.
5.0,"Although it took awhile to come in, these are very cute! The ears are shaped well and the jewels add some highlighting factors to it. I would recommend it!<br /><br />Even if they break, it's such a small price that you can just buy another one easily"
5.0,very stong
5.0,"This necklace is very classy, looks expensive and is simply beautiful!"
5.0,I have several of these sweaters. No problems with them shrinking if you wash on gently and lay flat to dry. I usually wear a medium but ordered a large. I size up one so I can layer. Will continue to purchase.
5.0,I was looking for plain nude socks and was happy to find these. They seem to be good quality (but u did not wash them yet) and feel nice on feet. I wore them with my converse and running sneakers - no slips and felt comfortable in both shoes. If they are good after wash - I'll repurchase.
5.0,Still have to wear this blouse but I love the look!
5.0,"Surprisingly beautiful in person. Fits PERFECTLY.<br /><br />From the photo I thought it would be attractive but I was blown away by it in person. Additionally, it came supremely well packaged, and ready for gifting should that have been my desire. Overall really exceeded my expectations."
5.0,"Very nice handbag, especially for the price, better quality than expected. The bag has outer pockets on each side which are identical on both sides, and are somewhat padded. Bag is nicely lined with a pleasant soft grey fabric (I bought the black leather bag). Bag has two handy zippered center compartments, which each fit an iPad. Leather is soft and supple without being limp and shapeless. Definitely recommended."
5.0,"The fit was great and the material soft. The fleece, so far, looks unwrinkled after wear. This makes a casual outfit look a bit more dressy."
5.0,Fits very well. Flatters my figure😊.
5.0,Fast Service Great Product...........
5.0,Very nice light shirt. Ordered a large & was sent an X large that fit perfectly.
5.0,I love the weight of the material and the fit is cute even tho it’s baggy.
5.0,Got these for my granddaughters when they come to visit and they were fighting over the one pair!
5.0,Very nice cape. Met my expectations.
5.0,"First time I wore it I got so many compliments! I was worried it was going to feel/look cheap, but it feels great. The inside of it is cool enough to where I can still wear it indoors. It’s not meant for extremely cold weather, so it’s perfect for those chilly, cool days. I expected it to be longer so it’s pretty short, right at my waist. It’s a tad puffy but I think that’s what makes it look good. Order a size up! I’m a medium but ordered a large and it fits me just right. I actually think if I went an even larger size it would still fit good. I washed and dried it and it did not shrink like I thought it would have. The sleeves are long enough to where it doesn’t cover my watch on my wrist. Good length. I’m looking forward to ordering more in other colors!"
5.0,"Beautiful dress, can't wait to wear it for a special occasion.  Prompt delivery as expected..thanks!"
5.0,my daughter loved it. it fit  well with the other charms that she already had<br />will buy nmore charms in the future
5.0,Soft jammies or loungewear<br />Bought for teen (14  5’4”  105#)
5.0,Product is great
5.0,love love love!
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted for washing dishes and cleaning. Great length and fits perfectly.  And this may sound strange, but they smell really great, like a very soft vanilla, not like rubber or plastic.  I wish I could but an air freshener with this smell!"
5.0,Love My Carreras....Prefect Fit.....<br />Wear them Everyday....Looks Sharp when worn...
5.0,Great watch band. Love it!
5.0,"I expected the size to be bigger...I guess I didnt read the details but it turned out to be perfect.... the look is classy, the metal is weightless and I'm pleased that there is no metal-ly smell you get from costume jewelry sometimes... great buy...looking for other geometric earrings currently :)"
5.0,Just got a Cadillac SRX and wanted to show it off  so this is the PERFECT addition to my keys !
5.0,Love this ring!!!...definently purchasing more Anju jewelry!
5.0,This dress is amazing. Especially for the price. It's flattering. It's comfortable. It has pockets. The design is beautiful in person. This is just an all around great dress!
5.0,"See through, the fabric is too thin"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:275532913c410fb9668aba5cc1b71a1b]] Superrrrrr cool for kids kind of hard to see though but it was expected
5.0,This dress fit perfectly and is made well. Really good quality. I purchased size Medium in rosegold.
5.0,Better than any cuff-links I've ever known.<br />Although the instructions were not clear enough. Finger is still stuck in toaster.
5.0,My new fav's! Very stylish!
5.0,It fit somewhat large because I ordered it too small and it fit perfectly. The lights all worked and I raged the night away for 2 days straight in it a d they still all work. It's really soft material too.
5.0,This is a super cute top but you will want to order a size or two larger.  It's very fitted and actually looks super cute but will lift in the back and show more than I want if I'm not careful.
5.0,I feel pretty cute in this. I bought it as a lounge around the house type of robe. It's definitely too short to be comfortable around anyone but my husband. but I love it. High quality and cute.
5.0,"I love these.  I put them into my heavy winter shoes and also at home slippers.  They work for both, wear very well, and are cozy and comfy.  They are perfect for this (Old) lady."
5.0,Well made/Designed
5.0,Small enough to fit in a smaller purse.
5.0,Nice and tight on my skinny leg. Would do the job for an athlete or a senior citizen.  Love the calf sleeve better than a knee high stocking.
5.0,I love this bag -- so much that I got a second one! Shipment was fast. I highly recommend this bag.
5.0,I love how these fit my kids face. More like a safty glass than anything but awesome none the less
5.0,Everything I have come to expect from QBaby
5.0,This is my second time ordering and I love these! Hopefully my daughter doesn’t lose them lol
5.0,Looks expensive fits perfect
5.0,This is exactly what he wants for Christmas and I can’t wait to give it to him.
5.0,Perfect!<br />Great value!!!!
5.0,"These tanks are great! They can be used for working out but also are real cute for everyday wear. I just ordered myself more cuz they're so versatile. They're so soft and so comfortable! Im 5'2 135lbs and its not too long for my height, like many are. Note they are slim fitting but are true to there size. Highly recommend."
5.0,This dress is beautiful and fits wonderfully!  Love it!
5.0,I am very pleased with the purchase. These are of comparable quality of ties that I have paid $20 for each.
5.0,"This is an amazing jersey!! Quality is great, fits perfect (XL), and just overall highly recommend it. I love it!!"
5.0,For a gift.
5.0,"I’m so glad I read the reviews that say these fit SMALL. They do. So I ordered accordingly and I LOVE them! High quality, they hang nicely because of the weight of the good fabric, and if your waist measures 35” comfortably, buy the XL like I did. No pinch in the elastic waist and plenty of flowing material :-)"
5.0,"These are adorable. The fabric isn't like that super thin, stretchy stuff that a lot of kids costumes have.  The scrubs feel like real scrubs! I was surprised at the high quality of this costume and I'm very happy with my purchase."
5.0,Will reorder in a Large. Fit's a little too small.
5.0,"These are a Christmas gift for my son. They are very well made, and the colors are great. I can't wait for him to open them on Christmas morning. He is going to be super excited! :)"
5.0,These are perfect and got like a dream. They are sold individually so be sure to order 2 for a full set!
5.0,"I love it, it is really cute. Like what I expected for . I will recommend this bag. if you want small this is for you ladies. And you can still put lots of stuff in. Thank you."
5.0,I love this necklace!  Very comfortable and contemporary style.  Nice clasp.  Noticed by many on the first day I wore it.
5.0,"Great colors, easy to free pads which is important because we all know how they like to migrate in the wash. I am trying to wear bras less because of how bad they are for your breasts. These are not too tight, not too loose. Keep the ladies in line while not smashing them down."
5.0,"Like all polyester or silk scarves, they will need Bobby pins or some sort of clips/ device to stay in place. Otherwise there is no resistance and they’ll slide right out.<br /><br />I just received mine today and already enjoy the bold big prints! They are beautiful!<br /><br />Sorry for the bad photo but my hair is very long and scarves help protect it from getting dirty and can keep it from tangling badly.<br /><br />The lightweight feel of this scarf prevents styles from weighing down on my head."
5.0,They arevreally nice
5.0,Used these during the winter months an loved that they kept me dry an worm
5.0,"Great fit, perfect match to the bikini top."
5.0,Love this dress! I'm curvey and love this dress!
5.0,"My wife bought this for herself and loves it.  Your business cards and credit cards fit nicely.  Inside there is an elastic strap that holds your cards, etc. in place.  It is a good case for a good price.  We recommend it."
5.0,Pretty necklace. Goes well with casual wear. No problems with it.
5.0,My twin boys wear them all the time. They’re going to wear them out before summer is over. They say they are comfy.
5.0,"This wallet is well made, holds the apple tag perfect. This was a present for my father. We tested it out and he can easily find the wallet using the air tag."
5.0,These snow pants fit perfect. There warm and waterproof.
5.0,I wore this out to dinner and am very pleased that it is the perfect weight for the Texas evenings. I am happy with its overall look and fit.
5.0,I love the dress and the material. It fit just how I wanted.

5.0,Very pretty without being too flashy. Love it.
5.0,Very lovely and looks good on.  Would buy in other colors!
5.0,Esta perfecto el articulo el color me gusto.
5.0,"The ring is great and their customer service is even better. I'm between sizes but bought a size up because some comments said it would be better. Tried for a day, felt it was a tad too big and told them so.  They then told me they'd send me another one free of charge! Awesome"
5.0,"These are the second pair I have bought.  Very comfortable, love these pants!"

5.0,Love it and it fits great
5.0,"Orient watches are considered by many people to be the greatest value in the watch business today. Orient's been around a long time, they make their own watches, they are now partially owned by Seiko.<br />This watch has everything. It's a good compromise for people who like large watches. The indices are incredibly easy to read. A real Plus for an old man like me. The off-white dial increases to the ease of reading. And by golly, the date window is wonderful it's so readable. When I write reviews I often say highly recommended if it's a great product, I would have to say this watch is highest recommended.<br /> In the vernacular, it is ""Hacked, Hackable."" It is: 1. Automatically wound. 2. It can be hand wound. 3. And the third part of hacked. The second hand stops when you set your watch.<br />Be careful not to over wind.<br />I gave this watch five stars. Again it is an incredible watch and an incredible price. However, this was returned merchandise. The clear plastic sheet that protects the crystal is missing. This is a good way to tell it is returned merchandise or used merchandise if that's missing. Also, mine came in the wrong box. I knew I ordered a Bambino 5th edition, but when the package arrived the box said Orient Star which is the top of their line and not something I am willing to spend that much money on right now. Inside was the watch I ordered. The watch was not secured as it should have been and probably bounced all around inside the case during the whole trip. So I can't give this watch any higher praise. It is a wonderful watch. But I would try to find it from another dealer."
5.0,So cute and so well made!
5.0,"Great glasses, real deal!!"
5.0,Absolutely loved it. Worked great for my awards ceremony.
5.0,Very sparkly and beautiful.
5.0,These shoes were perfect! We went to a resort in the dessert with tempature as high as 115 degrees. These shoes held up and she never complained once. Usually she has issues with heel rubbing and giving her blisters but these fit perfect! So glad I purchased these they are amazing and oh so cute!
5.0,I was in search of a dress for a Bridgerton party that was affordable. I used the size guide to help determine what to order but was nervous it would be off. I wear 10/12 and ordered the large and it was perfect. The top was stretchy and accommodating and the fabric was lightweight and comfortable.
5.0,So Pretty!
5.0,"I keep my shoes in one spot, bottle in another, clothes in the main bay, and dirty clothes/towels in the wet-sack. I commute using public transit daily with it. Hasn't torn or frayed."
5.0,Everything and they were gifts
5.0,Very light weight and breathable when wearing during a run or workout at the gym
5.0,"I love this dress. It fits perfectly, is thick fabric, and looks amazing on. One of the decorative buttons did fall off the same day I wore it, but I just sewed it back on and it wasn’t a problem. I would highly recommend. I wear it to work all the time."
5.0,"This is a wonderful case. It's easy to hold, keeps my Nook safe if it slips from my hands and falls and protects it from other damage and dust, etc., when it is closed. It gets used every single day and is wearing quite well for all the use it gets. It both wakes up and puts to sleep my Nook when I open and close it, which is a handy feature I like. It fits well on the Nook and is not in the way at all for any use with my Nook. I also feel it helps keep the Nook cleaner and in better shape all around. It is so handy to have the feature that props it up so I can put it on a desk or sitting nearby to read from instead of having to hold it. My compliments to the company on it's design and quality!"
5.0,These are excellent winter gloves that keep your hands warm and protected from the bitter cold when you have to be outside.

5.0,Beautiful dress but it does run larger
5.0,Very cute scarfs
5.0,I really like this strap. I was reluctant to purchase it because it costs more than similar straps like this available out there. But the others had buckles and clasps. No way I want to possibly scratch my mandolin. Very good design soft as well.
5.0,Cute and I love them.
5.0,First night worked great.  Looking forward to see how it works long term

5.0,"I cannot describe how beautiful this ring is. The picture does not do it justice! It sparkles and shines and the stones are not too big which makes people think it is real. I have received so many compliments on this ring. If I am asked where I got it I answer honestly - from Amazon. The usual response is that they don't believe me. That's how genuine this ring looks.<br /><br />I ordered a size 10 and it is a little snug due to the 8mm width of the band; however, it is not cutting off my circulation so I am going to wear as often as I can."
5.0,Really a nice bag. Good quality leather and nicely done clasps. I ordered the wrong color by mistake and the customer service at HESHE is amazing. I will buy from them again!!

5.0,I bought this for someone else!  She loved it!  Had no complaints!  Is as pictured and described.

5.0,"This watch does exactly what a watch is supposed to do. I love the looks I get and conversations with people with expensive watches on their wrist.<br /><br />Actual stranger encounter-<br />Stranger: *looks at my watch* Wow, what is that?!<br />Me: A watch.<br />Stranger: How come you don't have a smartwatch?<br />Me: I spent $15 dollars on mine, how much was yours?<br />Stranger: *looks at her Apple watch* I'm not sure how much it is. I make payments on it.<br />Me: Wait... you financed a watch?!<br /><br />Every time I look down at my wrist, it reminds me that money is much better spent on something else. Can't believe people spend $400+ on a sad excuse for a fashion statement that will be obsolete in a year.<br /><br />Also, the retro look is pretty cool."
5.0,Bought this shirt for my nieces 3rd Birthday.  Fit perfectly and my sister in law loved it.
5.0,Nice and sturdy product.. my shades keep in place all the time..
5.0,I love how it allows freedom of movement for my arms when I run or do yoga. I also appreciate how I can perspire and it drys out pretty well and doesn’t cling to me. It looks great and FEELS GREAT! This is my second order.
5.0,Very nice variety for multiple piercings. The metal is quality and heavy duty. I have not had any issues with irritation at all
5.0,It is so soft and the perfect length! I bought this as a gift and the receiver loved it!
5.0,Took some time. Received a nice apology notice for the delay. This is a gift so I hope it will work as intended and not break.
5.0,"I'm 5'3, 38C. I purchased xl... The dress came right above my knees.  It fit perfectly! Very stretchy."
5.0,used it right away :)
5.0,"Luxury Handbags, high quality, Love it so much!"

5.0,"Love it, it’ll make a perfect gift"
5.0,Cute and goes well with any outfit
5.0,"I got to demo this shoe at a RAGNAR trail race and ran a 4.2 mile trail loop climbing up and down decomposed granite slopes and running through dry desert washes, with no issues.  The shoe fit great and had awesome support and cushioning.  So I bought a pair on Black Friday.  I'll update if there are issues with my own pair."
5.0,"You know all those cute Pinterest posts you see with camo sweat pants?!  You know how when you buy from amazon sometimes it doesn't look anything like the picture?!  NOT THE CASE with these!!  These pants were exactly what I was hoping for and look just like the ones I've seen on Pinterest!  They are exactly what you see in this image, fit really well and are so comfy.  I recommend sizing up one if you want a little bit of a looser fit.  Wore these while traveling and was so comfortable the entire time.... TOTALLY worth it!"
5.0,They fit great!!!
5.0,"This cellphone purse is perfect! exactly what i needed and wanted. It fits my Droid Turbo 2 comfortably, along with my thick wallet, chap stick, keys, and other things all in one! I don't use the given strap, but a wristlet strap i bought separately instead. I'll be using this for store runs and quick trips that dont require a big purse. on top of that, if i need to use my bigger pack, i can just put this in it instead of transferring everything if wanted.<br />I highly recommend this if you just need something to carry the basics and want something cute :)"

5.0,I bought it for my sister.  She really liked the color and style.  It fit her as expected.
5.0,I love the vintage vibe and special handmade touch given to these earrings. I love how they look aged. I've been getting a lot of compliments and people asking where I've bought them. I like that they're unique and everyone else won't have them. They are pretty small but I like that because I don't wear huge jewelry. I received a discount on this product in exchange for a review. This in no way effects my opinions stated here. I would buy more products like this in the future. I'd love to get a similar necklace.
5.0,Ilove these socks..  They stay on and don't slip off heel like other ones i've had..
5.0,"So far, my wife is very happy with this purse.  It's been a few weeks, and it's holding up fine so far.  She loves all the pockets.  I personally think the straps are a bit short, but she says they're perfect."

5.0,The shirt is very soft and flattering with its shape. It’s not too snug so I can move freely in my work out and it’s not so loose that it gets in the way.
5.0,My boys love their new backpacks for school. Hope they hold up all year.
5.0,I really love this dress. Tons of compliments and it looks great in person
5.0,Soft and comfortable to wear. Stretch well.

I requested a size small, and they fit as expected plus that is my regular size in almost all exercise pant brands.<br /><br />The fabric, the stitching, the comfort, the inseam, the overall design and appearance, it is all fantastic! I am very pleased with these pants."
5.0,The packaging alone told me I bought a solid product. Very light and easy to use.
5.0,"If your mission is to sweat while working out, this sweat gear from Hotsuit will get it done. I am 5'10"" and 175lbs. The large fits me well. Its tight but its supposed to be. Well made top that I recommend."
5.0,In love with my Treelance Organic Cotton Workout Top! I needed a fitted tank for yoga to practice comfortably and this one is perfect. It's soft and it doesn't fall over your head. Great price and quality. Happy Yogi
5.0,"I have looked at a lot of carry-on size backpacks and in the end it came down to this Tortuga and the Osprey Farpoint 40. What won me over on this one, is that the laptop sleeve sits closer to your body, the fact that it does not have a waist belt (not planning to hike with it or wear it all day) and the ability to expand it from 27l to 35l. The fact that it's on sale on now cheaper than the Osprey helped, too. The back and shoulder straps are very well padded and comfortable. I like the small logo and the material seems very sturdy. My trip to Europe isn't until August but this model is being retired and for me it just fits the bill. Highly recommended."
5.0,"1st time user, and i like them a lot."
5.0,I love the material and has accurate sizing!<br />Sooooo cute !

5.0,"I am a nurse working a covid unit, and use these caps as part of ppe. This is a great scrub hat for anyone with longer hair that needs to be covered up and protected. The material is comfortable the inner sweatband adds a good cushion. It is large, but can be tightened with the clasp and elastic on the back. Will definitely repurchase!"
5.0,Really good earrings to pair with any outfit!! The three different sizes help if you want to change your look and pair with the earrings.
5.0,"The wristlet was the right size.  It fit in my purse and could be carried alone.  My passport and phone both fit neatly inside, always easy to reach and safe."

5.0,A beautiful dress and very affordable.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:92de62d9cf7309584600d33691b19827]] This bra is very comfortable. I chose a size medium so it has light support. A small may have offered a little more support, so I would say it’s true to size. I could sleep in this bra and be comfortable! I am 5’7” and 126 lbs. The material keeps you feeling dry, even with a sweaty weight training session."
5.0,"First time buying the PattyBoutik brand and very happy with my purchase! The dress is super cute, comfortable, and warm; appears to be of good quality too (although I have not washed it yet).

5.0,Beautiful dress fits perfect
5.0,"Love!! I bought this for our engagement party. The material is textured and I totally didn’t see the detailing on the neckline and sleeves before I purchased it, so that was a nice surprise."
5.0,"Beautiful but I bought this because I wanted something similar like the one in the movie Evil Dead, this is much larger than that so if anyone else is thinking of buying it solely for that purpose it is much bigger than Cheryl’s.  If you aren’t worried about that it’s lovely!"

5.0,"This item is super cute--and a steal at $5. The MSRP on the tag was over double that.

The fabric is 55% cotton and 45% polyester. They are much softer than expected. No shrinkage w washing. There were two pajama bottoms in one pack for the stated price. I expected only one pair. Both my husband and I love these. I highly recommend.

5.0,"I got this for my 15 year old daughter, knowing she prefers two pieces that aren't low cut and have higher waists.<br /><br />It's a hit! She's a size 6 and the medium fit her perfectly. It's incredibly flattering, and she says it's very comfortable.

5.0,I bought this for my 19 year old niece and she LOVES it. I had a gut feeling when I seen it that it was stylish for that age group and I still believe my gut was right. It is very sophisticated and the feel of it is very nice. The side pocket is spacious too. Definitely worth the buy.

5.0,"My son thought because his original laces broke in half that we needed to buy him a new $200 pair of shoes.  As money does not grow on trees, these did the trick when we couldnt find laces on Nike's website or in local stores. These were the perfect replacement in thickness and weight. Arrived quickly and did the job. Make sure you count your eyelets so that you get the correct length."

5.0,It was just what we expected and we received it when we expected.

5.0,Well packaged and fast delivery. This was exactly the headband I was expecting it to be. This is simply an inexpensive silver tone plastic head band. It's a little on the small side but that is what I was hoping for. The silver finish is a bit dull rather than a more shiny polished look.

5.0,"Love them. Perfectly light weight slipper to wear around the house, perfect enough to keep my feet warm."
5.0,beautiful gift for my stepdaughter
5.0,It fits big but I don’t mind it. Use it mostly for around the house. Super comfortable and has pockets!
5.0,It’s adorable!!! I got it for my goddaughter and it fits her perfectly.
5.0,Seller ensured I ( the customer) was taken care of. Went out of the way to make it great. Thanks a million.
5.0,"I loved the color, quality, material and fit of this pretty shirt. I normally wear a medium/8 and I ordered a medium and it fits perfect. I plan to order another color in this shirt."
5.0,My two kids love these. They work amazingly and would recommend especially cause the price is great
5.0,My grandma loved this charm!
5.0,"an awesome gift for my roomy.  He looks great in it but then again, he was a model for several years and anything he puts on it looks great.  Lucky him!!"
5.0,"I love owls and most products containing them can look silly or cheap.  I wanted something small and simple in real gold that I didn't have to take on and off each shower and night.  I found this and decided to give it a try.  Is it tiny?  Yes!  It even says so in the main description.  I wore this through my entire week long vacation...in and out of the pool, in and out of the ocean, showers, wore it to bed...and it's still perfect.  Love this purchase!"
5.0,"My only problem is the large was a bit to tight across the chest, even though I checked the size chart. I am keeping it as a beach cover up. I'm sure around the house is another option."
5.0,Got this as a gift for someone and she loved it!!  Love the versatility!
5.0,It was perfect gift!
5.0,Nice colors. Held up well to multiple washing and salt water vacations plus pool use. Would buy again without hesitation.
5.0,Not real leather
5.0,Pretty and dainty
5.0,cute dress!
5.0,I love this dress. It's really warm inside and was warm even on a cold night. You won't be disappointed ladies. My bf got turned on by it as it flatters your figure 😂
5.0,Love this dress! Fits perfect and so cute. Will be ordering in another color.
5.0,"They are great for the price!! Did fit my boyfriend's Oakley frame. He was concerned about them not being polarized lenses but they were. Explained that's what HD was. As far as the thickness of the lenses, we didn't notice that. You can see through them perfectly."
5.0,"Working from home indefinitely now, I'm constantly on the hunt for a comfy bra with no wires that doesn't look bad in public for those few essential trips a month. This is very nice, fabric is silky and light yet gives a nice hold. I like that the padding is removable and in one piece (I have a few with two pads that I just can't seem to get right again after washing). Purchased XL for 38DD and it fits JUST right. I don't think a larger bust would work. The support is good for light workouts such as yoga or an elliptical. I wish there were more colours!"
5.0,I purchased this and I am so very pleased with it. All of my Co-workers are so jealous of me.
5.0,Best wallet!  I am able to fit my iPhone 6s in it as well as clip my keys on the side ring for easy carrying with having to bring my purse all the time.
5.0,I use these on the regular and the battery life is great as well as the sound quality. Best value for the price and performance.
5.0,Great Sox.  Comfortable and well made.
5.0,Excellent band. Works well with watch.  Comfortable and flexible yet durable and sturdy.
5.0,Loved it such a wonderful product
5.0,My husband loves these. They are exactly as pictured.
5.0,"Love this dress.  Exactly as pictured, fit well and love the fabric."
5.0,Gorgeous necklace! Just as pictured. Nice size. Sparkle sparkle sparkle! This is my second purchase with this designer...purchased the bracelet to match and will make for a lovely set. ONLY negative...wish this came in a bigger box. The necklace does not lay round...seen in pictures...hoping once it's worn it will lay correctly...Nice purchase otherwise.
5.0,Bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter.
5.0,"Love it, So beautiful, great quality"
5.0,Ver nice
5.0,Bought this for the chef.
5.0,My LO is such a cruiser on her hands and knees and these help keep her pants clean on the one area or just by themselves as she wears a onesie. Fun colors that can do with anything.
5.0,"These are probably some of the best skivvies I've ever had, They fit well and the size chart is accurate. Feels good, looks good (that's what my GF says) not too long or short."
5.0,"She loves them, so I love them."
5.0,For school so appropriate and made students feel good.
5.0,"I used two pairs of them for a birthday gift, and I kept two pairs for my own use.  I like the quality and fit of these compression socks.  They are not difficult to put on."
5.0,"Long enough for my long torso.  Can use with strap for diving, which is a nice option"
5.0,"Bought this for a birthday present and my wife loves it. The mix of diamonds, gold and amethyst is really unique and interesting to look at.  I was also very impressed when I asked for expedited service and it arrived in two days with no extra charge. Fanatastic service at a great price. I would definitely buy from EORC again."
5.0,"I was surprised by how soft they were! They are very comfortable all around. I am usually a size small and ordered a small. Fit perfectly. I got a pair for myself and my sister to try out and now that we love them, we are definitely going to buy more!"
5.0,"Lovely dress. It just wasn't the right shade of burgundy so I returned it. Really more of a red/maroon. The back is lower then a bra, so it will show if you try to wear a regular one. It does have thick bra cups so you can go bra less, but those things aren't holding anything in place past a B cup. If you are well endowed, forget it. The dress is well made. The lace is lined with a mesh fabric- some reviews said theirs wasn't lined, but this was."
5.0,"Awesome Karen Walker knockoffs! Pretty close to the real thing (which sell for 82 bucks on Amazon).  Seem to be of good quality.  They feel pretty sturdy.  They are BIG frames though, so keep that in mind.  I’m tired of seeing one star reviews for sunglasses because “they are too big”. Huge sunglasses are Très Chic!"
5.0,"The pro and con are the same thing. The latch is difficult to open, but you know its never going to accidentally open in a pocket or purse. Built like a tank, and beautiful to boot."
5.0,"good quality and fit, nice layers and run out hoodie to put on"
5.0,Exactly what i was looking for to wear at work and use around MRIs .
5.0,Kids love to put keychains on their backpack. This is a fun assortment of cuphead figures
5.0,These were exactly what I wanted and expected. My Granddaughter is gonna love them.
5.0,Top notch!
5.0,"Perfect small gift for a very special<br />Friend.  Easy to order, quick delivery and nicely presented in pouch."
5.0,"Great quality, perfect fit."
5.0,"I LOVE this dress!  I am partial to this 1940's style and have several dresses in this full skirt style but this one is my favorite so far!  I love the cut, the fabric, the fit!  I would love to get another one in a pattern ~ cause can one really have too many Rockabilly style dresses?<br /><br />First the fabric and manufacture are top notch!  My tag says 100% cotton but there is definitely spandex in the fabric as it has a pretty decent stretch to it.  This is the first one I have purchased that has the stretch and I love it ~ it makes it fit PERFECT!  Gives it a very curvy and fitted look.  I love the other ones I own as well, but this just makes it fit really nice.  The manufacture is really far better than I would ever expect with such an affordable dress!  As should be expected with any dress the stitching is tight and straight.  I didn't find any little loose strings anywhere and the inside of all edges is surge finished to stop running.  What impressed me was the lining inside the bodice.  (I took a picture) Not that this is a scratchy fabric or a see-through fabric but the bodice is fully lined with a super soft, shiny knit.  Not only does it make it more comfortable, it really makes it look nice on ~ smooth and fitted! It really impressed me that extra attention to detail on an affordable dress!<br /><br />The cut is nice and full but this really looks top notch if you finish it with a crinoline slip ~ makes your waist look tiny and lays really nice.  I used a 26&#34; crinoline petticoat and it fit perfect ~ you can just see the hint of the edge at the bottom.  The bow is perfect size - not big enough to be obnoxious just a nice touch to draw attention to your waist which again, looks so tiny in this dress!  I love it!  Also if purchasing the black with edging ~ the edging is red, not pink.  It is hard to tell for sure in the stock photo.<br /><br />It fit me extremely well but it just fit me.  I ordered a medium and usually can wear a small or medium in a dress.  This is definitely form fitted and although it has some give I am not sure how it would fit if you are well endowed breast wise.  I easily wear a small in tops but zippered this is fitted and tight (tight properly, not uncomfortably) and that is with a B cup.  Use some caution and possibly even order a size up if you have a larger chest.  Otherwise the fit is just so, so complimentary!  I am really considering a print yet because the cut and manufacture is so nice on this one!  Really impressed, especially after purchasing other similar dresses!  This one was right around the same price but just so much more attention to detail.<br /><br />Can't speak for anyone else, but I try to take my reviews seriously ~ I know how much I count on them when I am buying, especially online! I received this product at a discount for my honest and accurate review, but I am not obligated to leave a positive review, nor do I receive any incentives or monetary compensation to do so. My goal is to help buyers understand aspects of an item I would like to know before purchase. I am not affiliated with any company and am a normal consumer just like you. I pick items to review that I would normally want to purchase. (I don't do reviews for things I would already deem to be junk). I would never write a review for a product that is anything but my personal opinion and I have already purchased the product, nothing changes for me based on my review, but hopefully the time I put into writing can help someone out. Please feel free to ask me a question about any of the products I've reviewed; I am happy to help if I can!"
5.0,So soft and comfy and light weight.
5.0,i ordered the xl and it fits my 45/40/48 L/XL with plenty of room to layer underneath.. really like the cuffs that are elastic w/the sleeve overlay.. there’s a mesh lining that makes the fabric not so moist when it rains. it’s definitely a bronze gold (which i wanted) and not green in the least.. all&all i love this jacket
5.0,"These are my fav leggings, the print is nice, even calming to me. I always shop Legging Depot they always have good quality, great prices and always ships quickly. If I could I’d order a pair each day so I’d have a new one every day."
5.0,"Just what I needed and the best of several that I tried.  Also, a great value."
5.0,Fabric is soft and feels comfortable
5.0,They with a little paper in front great for kicking round the house
5.0,love the fit and feel
5.0,"I purchased the 7.5mm and it is lovely.  I have been searching for a charm for my gold necklace and this is delicate and classy.  Yes it is small so I would recommend the 7.5m at the smallest if you want it to be more noticeable.  But this pearl is so dainty, shimmers, and is high quality.  Obviously one can spend thousands on pearls, but for 40 dollars, this was a steal.  I love it."
5.0,Great product and timely delivery.
5.0,Ease of use very sturdy
5.0,"I picked this up on a lightening deal for $19.99, so I consider it a coup for this quality.  Mestige is Australian so the original price is AU$130 rather than USD as is shown.  It's striking with the gold inlay and Swarovski elements.  Defintely made for a small hand.  I bought it for a gift, hope it's enjoyed."
5.0,Great messenger Bag! Quick shipping. Very happy with purchase.  Just used it this weekend at a convention. Held and protected my comics and art works I purchased!
5.0,It’s great I wear it every day in a freezer and it keeps my head perfectly warm
5.0,Great socks for occasions. My son wore these to a wedding and now we use them for church.
5.0,I absolutely love this romper! Super fast shipping and excellent quality! Adjustable straps so you can shorten/lengthen as well as criss cross them if you like!! Vivid color both in the flowers and the black! Love the surplice front & Pom poms! I get compliments everywhere I go and I always refer you guys by name!!(: would love to do business Again! Xoxo
5.0,"I carry this daily in my pack. Simply put, it does exactly what it claims to. It is light, compact and surprisingly well made. I have a large head and it still fits well."
5.0,I love it.... Lots of compliment.
5.0,"Beautiful, high quality, butterfly necklace that shipped relatively fast considering COVID delays. Not sure of durability yet as I have not worn the necklace. Would purchase from this seller again."
5.0,"My father liked it alot, wears it every day"
5.0,"Love the colors, price was great. It was a bit bulkier than I had hoped, but the reviews had suggested that and I ordered fully knowing that might be the case. It's really too big for me to wear as a scarf, but it actually makes for a great, light but warm blanket/throw/wrap when lounging or working. Did I mention I love the colors? The quality is great too. I'm now thinking of ordering it in an infinity-scarf version, which won't be quite as overwhelming on my frame."
5.0,I love it. Very nice and comfortable to wear
5.0,Loved they way they look but wish it was a bit bigger
5.0,Not a bad price. Kid likes it soo that’s a win
5.0,Great design comfort fit for my son.
5.0,"Looked adorable on my wrist, but now I wrap it only twice around my ankle.  Makes the coolest ankle bracelet ever and I've not taken it off in weeks!  So many comments also.  I rubbed the leather with Shea Butter and it is very soft and dark now!"
5.0,"This is a terrific watch for hikers, it is very handy when walking out in the desert, out of sight of landmarks (my vehicle), where everything looks the same.<br />It has a strong clip to hold it to a belt or pocket or backpack strap.  An easy-to-read-dial.<br />And it is very attractive.  keeps great time."
5.0,"Wow, at this price, I thought the socks would be itchy, scratchy, thin, hard and floppy. To the contrary, they are wonderful, according to my wife. Everything you could ask for in a nice cozy sock. Great blend of fabric.<br /><br />Personally, I also like the bright colorful patterns as well. Snap these up before they raise the price."
5.0,My son loves!  This polo is an athletic cut so it runs slimmer than the classic cut.  It came with the original tags but a lot less than buying from the store.  I actually bought 2 more shirts in different colors.  My son wears medium shirts and I bought him this shirt in medium.  So it runs true to size (just keep in mind it runs slimmer due to the athletic cut).
5.0,all well
5.0,"Very nice piece for the price! The chain is heavy, not super oversized which I like. Excellent option if you don’t want to spend that tif’fanny’ money ;)"
5.0,I looked fabulous on vacation in Mexico. Get a size up
5.0,"Perfecto para la ocasion, mi niño muy feliz, buena calidad. Bien diseñado."
5.0,"These gloves look great and feel great.  The straps fit kind of loosely, but I intended to wear them over other accessories, so they fit very well for this purpose.  The touchscreen function works as advertised and I am overall very pleased with these gloves."
5.0,Beautiful dress and great quality! -It just was a little too big on top
5.0,Cute and versital.
5.0,"My daughter is 5'6, 190lbs and a size Large fit her well. Beautiful dress, pretty color, nice twirl on the skirt, not heavy fabric, not too hot, seems well made, good for dancing."
5.0,"These are really nice shirts. I've bought several for my son. They have vivid colors, and silky feel. Wash up on regular cycle, and hang dry. Comes out great every time!"
5.0,These are the best frames for wearing with muffs. They are comfortable all day and they don't break the ear pro seal.
5.0,Love this shirt. I bought a large. I’m 170 5’6”
5.0,I wish I’d have gotten a xxl but the short was cute and made of good material
5.0,"Fit great, loved the color"
5.0,"These short styled pants were very wrinkled out of the package and a bit large for me. Once I washed and dried them, they shrank just enough. I like the weight of the fabric for this hot weather we’ve been having in the northeast. I bought an xxl (med-US size)."
5.0,Very comfortable. Happy the padding comes out though because you can see lines through clothes!
5.0,"Amazing pair of high waist skinny jeans! The material is very strong and quality, not paper thin but also not too thick, just right. They have a small stretch to them but otherwise the jean quality is one you don't find often these days more reminiscent of the old days when we had good quality denim. I loved them so much I purchased 2 more pairs! I'm 5'5"" 118 pounds and the size 26 fit me great."
5.0,"Loved the look and quality, style not for me and sadly returned."
5.0,I wore this dress to a Christmas party at my Fiancé's job.  It was so pretty and fit well.  I ordered a size large and I am normally a size 12 and it wasn't tight at all.  The waist is sort of elastic so it will adjust to your waist size.  The only thing was that it was pretty long.  The image shows it as above ankle length but this was definitely a maxi dress on me.  I am 5'4 so I didn't expect it to be as long as it was but I didn't mind.  It was closer to my ankles.  I believe I wore heels but it wouldn't have been too long without them.
5.0,Love the feel and the appearance of it awesome product and totally worth buying
5.0,A nice way to let people know how much you appreciate their work
5.0,Will layer and use for cooler weather work outs. I am 5’4” and weigh 123#. Sized up to large. Fit is contoured but not too tight. Usually wear a medium. Pretty colors and fabric is soft. Happy.
5.0,Got the Family Crest for my cousin for her birthday! Can't wait for  her to receive it! She's gonna love it!! NO DOUBT! 😍
5.0,This watch is gorgeous and looks very expensive! I am very petite (5'0) and have small wrists. This watch is the PERFECT size. It is heavy and seems to be good quality. Hopefully it will last and will not tarnish!
5.0,"Attractive bag, just the right size for iPad + wallet, keys, makeup, etc...  but not oversized.  Can use as small briefcase or purse. Has removable shoulder strap not listed in product description.  Glad I bought this and will definitely look for this brand again!"
5.0,It was just what I wanted.
5.0,"Adorable heart shaped adjuster, perfect for Valentine mask. Great price and super fast shipping!!"
5.0,Great quality. I purchased the Green and the color is exactly as it appears on screen. After reading other reviews I decided to order a Small. Usually I wear XS; I'm 5 ft tall and 105 lbs. The small fits perfectly for width and length.
5.0,"It's a relic of the yesteryear old school gangta, with heavy chains and grilles on your teeth to rival car grilles.  It's heavy, hopefully it won't tarnish easily, so use the cloth and bag in the package.  Something, both gold and silver was needed to compliment some pieces and this fits the bill.  I like it, I really do and glad to have the simple design at hand."
5.0,I was asked to review this item. My daughter birthday was coming up and she’s starting to wear jewelry more. Knowing how she is with losing stuff I didn’t want to spend a ton. I found these and thought they were cute and the perfect size. They are a smaller hoop and heavier than expected. Not too heavy that it bothered her ears. She was surprised and loves them so I would say all and all a good purchase
5.0,True to size and the material is as expected. I love it
5.0,Ordered a small as am tiny n preggo fits perfectly I love this I got two ❤️❤️❤️ Buy this dress worth the money
5.0,"Used it as a prop in a photo shoot.  Top notch construction, fit as expected and was very easy to work with"
5.0,I wore this sequin jumpsuit for my friend’s Soul Train themed birthday party and it was an absolute hit! Sexy & stylish! I am fairly tall with a long torso so A Medium would probably have worked better for me lengthwise but I wasn’t able to find that size in this outfit so I stuck with the small. Super cute and I’m secretly hoping that I have another reason to wear it again in the future!
5.0,Very high quality. Read the other reviews and ordered a size smaller. Was perfect!
5.0,I normally wear a medium but these run a bit smaller then some other brands. The Perry Ellis pullovers I have are medium. I am somewhat in between a medium and large slim fit.<br />Looks to be good quality but the real test will be after a few washes. I will update this in a month or so.
5.0,It's fire 🔥
5.0,"Very cute bracelet, I would recommend it for a child 5 years or smaller. The bracelet is small and will fit a small child or toddler."
5.0,"New favorite dress! I ordered a Large. My current measurements are 38” chest, 34” waist, 46” hips. Material is the perfect thickness to flatter body textures, but not be too hot. Great length. Could easily dress up with some heels or throw on some boots and denim jacket for a cute Fall vibe. Will definitely be buying in other colors. 100% recommend to most body types, especially if you are pear shaped and have trouble finding a dress that flatters top to bottom."
5.0,Awesome hat. Windy threw the little strap on. Wanted to see my kids bent the wire in the hat. Will be buying another
5.0,"Love this dress!! Can not say anything else!! One of my favorites, which I had bought more when they were on sale! Very flattering for my body style."
5.0,Very comfortable and affordable mask option
5.0,"The mask is well made, colors are rich and it's a comfortable mask to wear."
5.0,Fits perfect on my Mi Band 5
5.0,"Great fit, flexible fabric, useful pockets and the price was fabulous."
5.0,"My husband has Parkinson's Disease and mobility and falling are issues for him to deal with.  These shoes are comfortable, lightweight and do not slip on the hard wood floors.  He hasn't fallen once with them on.  Unfortunately has fallen when he did not have them on."
5.0,"Its hard for me to find warm weather clothes that are flattering due to my shape. I am busty so if its not fitted it adds 10lbs. This shirt looks good on me.<br />Soft, comfy, shapely, perfect length for me to wear with leggings. I am short so it almost covers my hips and butt. The neckline adds length to a short neck. It will also be great for layering when it gets colder.<br />Simple staple for my wardrobe."
5.0,Absolutely adorable. Has a button waist instead of elastic and the fabric is breathable. Perfect for back to school wear.
5.0,Quick shipping. Adorable jewelry.
5.0,Great shorts an very comfortable<br />Draw string is a bit of a hassel other than that there fine
5.0,Thanks for the cool shades - they are very comfortable for a value item.
5.0,Beautiful necklace. The chain is just the right size and the design is great.
5.0,I absolutely love my minnie mouse purse. Ot has enough room to fit all my stuff in it and it is so cute. I get lots of compliments and it is also good quality
5.0,"Super stylish and reliable, the only thing I don’t like is that it doesn’t have a screw crown."
5.0,Very comfortable and great fit
5.0,"I am 5’4” and 138 lbs.  I ordered a medium and it fits perfect.  Feels well-made.  The sleeves are a tad bit loose, but that is how I prefer them."
5.0,"Looks and fits as expected,  my son loves it"
5.0,I have previously purchase other similar watches and am VERY HAPPY with them!!!
5.0,good product and looks great
5.0,My fiance loves these and he works out in MN cold (sanitation engineer) and he says he is never cold.  Just wears flannel pj bottoms underneath.  Great buy and good quality.  Would purchase again.
5.0,PREFECTION!!!
5.0,"This is my third pair of these lenses (I have a collection of sunglasses). I use them for Cycling since I have no need for distance vision correction, but I cannot read the fine text on my GPS unit without readers. This works a treat and saves me from having to buy $200-$300 prescription sports sunglasses!"
5.0,To keep my glasses on
5.0,Husband and son love these. Its dark here by 5:30 in he winter so these come in handy when out doing chores.
5.0,"My daughter absolutely loves this outfit, and how soft the skirt fabric is!"
5.0,bought these for my 21 years old son. He told me yesterday they are awesome! I will be getting him more!
5.0,"These sweats are nice and thick, warm. I bought them a size larger than needed for an outpatient surgery. I had to have something loose-fitting to wear home and these fit the bill perfectly. I ended up staying an extra day and it snowed the day I went home. My pants were warm and cozy and I had pockets - I love having pants with pockets."
5.0,Love these sunglasses! Wear them daily and really love the fit and reflective nature. The colors are so pretty!
5.0,stunning piece. loved it very much.
5.0,For anyone who is concerned these chevrons are perfectly fine to wear in uniform and are almost indistinguishable from the ones you can find at the PX
5.0,Just got this bracelet today. Packaging is as nice as others have shown. Seems like a good quality bracelet. But my OCD kicked in with the arrangements of the stones so I rearranged them and made an adjustable bracelet(didn't know what a couple of the stones were but did some research and found that a couple of the stones can be used for more than one chakra so I just arranged them how I saw fit). I used 1mm waxed cord. If anyone does the same just know some of the holes aren't the same size and I had to cut the cord at an angle to get a point so it'd be easier to go through the stone beads.
5.0,I was happy to choose the length of the necklace.  I was also pleased with the size ofthe
5.0,My granddaughter loves theses. This is actually my 2nd pair in a bigger size
5.0,It is  ompact and sturdy to carry
5.0,Watch can take a beating and still works great !
5.0,These are so much prettier in person than in the picture.
5.0,Well made and perfect for my Wayne costume... And everyday wear.
5.0,"arrived as expected. great comfort, weekdays a great plus"
5.0,Bought the shirt and my friend loves it.
5.0,"These are awesome, 100% cotton, they fit as expected. I'll buy them again"
5.0,"These are the best! I have worn them all summer and have not lost one single crystal. They are black with tons of colors and go with every single outfit, from dressy to super casual. Inside, they catch all the artificial lighting, and outside, the sun is blinding off of them which makes them so beautiful. I get compliments every time I wear them. The rubber itself is very comfortable. I was told to make sure that you don't throw other shoes on top of them, so I am careful when I take them off where I put them. However, I have worn them every single day almost, for 5 1/2 months and still not one crystal has popped off. The layout of the colors also is perfect. I bought my daughter-in-law a pair for Mother's Day and she has had the same exact experience."
5.0,I was very please with this purchase!  Looks great on and I can't wait to wear it for the Halloween Birthday Bash I am attending.  Nice material
5.0,Loose like boyfriend style great alternative to skinny jeans for my first grader
5.0,Love this item. Works great at keeping you cool while in the sun. When it gets a little wet from  sweat it help cool you off even more. Works well while on a golf course or on a bank fishing.
5.0,"My husband recently upgraded to the iphone 7 through our carrier. He was offered a &#34;deal&#34; for accessories, which to me sounded like  mumbo-jumbo. I told him that he could get the same items  elsewhere for a lot less, but he decided to take the package. So he wound up spending 40 bucks for a glass cover and $40 for a Te.... 21 case. The glass cover appears to be fine. The case however is a very poor fit. At the bottom near the home button, there is a rather obvious gap and the phone did not fit snugly into the case as it should have. There begins the quest to find him another, reasonably priced case. I looked at a lot of them, on Amazon and elsewhere and read the reviews. When I came across this one from TIERGRADE I couldn't believe how inexpensive it was and how good the reviews were.  But hey, it was less that 5 bucks - how wrong could I go? Worst case scenario it would wind up in the garbage. Well, surprise surprise - it's fantastic. It fits like a glove and is very attractive. I especially like that there is a cut-out for the Apple logo - his phone is black as is the case and the effect is stunning. The feel of the case is soft but provides an excellent grip. Now, like every other case there is really no way to know how well it protects the phone until you drop it. I did watch a video on Utube showing a guy dropping it twice from around 6 feet with no damage at all. Just remember this is for the Apple 7 year 2016 - our model is A1660. If you don't know your model look on the back of the phone and it's there in very small print. Overall we are very happy with this case and as of right now can honestly recommend it.<br />UPDATE 5/28/18 - My husband has dropped the phone at least 7 or 8 times, that I know of-no kidding.  The phone has remained in pristine condition - no chips or cracks. This case is just fantastic, especially if you happen to be a klutz like someone who shall remain anonymous. Can’t recommend it enough."
5.0,Feels great - large scarf that can be used for multiple purposes. Left my hair soft and smooth and long enough to wrap around and tie off.
5.0,Fits a little big but overall durable shades.

5.0,Love these sunglasses! 🦋
5.0,"I like these pants there great, a bit tighter than the ghast drawstring pants but they do have the cool design around the knees"

5.0,Great jacket. My son loved it. Used it for his Indiana Jones Halloween costume
5.0,"THE most comfortable, stretchy and soft pjs! Love them!"
5.0,Been looking for earring cuffs.  These are very nice!
5.0,"My city has had a mask mandate in place for several months. I found that the lack of pockets in women's clothing made it difficult to keep the mask handy. And trying to pull it out of a purse sometimes resulted in the mask falling to the ground, gross! This solved the problem, when I'm leaving a store I remove the mask and it hangs around my neck, staying clean and handy for the next use. My 20 something kids  wanted nothing to do with these, but my 60ish friends and I like them."
5.0,"Warm and supersoft... medium is snug on me and I have small hands and fingers, so you may need to check sizes when ordering. The index finger touchscreen works for me. The thumb seems to work,  too,  if you have it at the right angle (in a really awkward way), so I'm only using the index finger on my phone."
5.0,My daughter wears this leotard to dance class every week. She looks good and it fits great
5.0,I love the compression on this top. It fits beautifully and the white is not transparent.  Love these and an excellent bargain as well.

5.0,"Excellent suction and performance until they got too scratched and filmed up! I wish I could find an identical pair since other mask style goggles I ordered this season (see my other reviews) turned out to be a disaster. By far this was my most leak-proof, wide-angle mask style goggle ever, with a nice clean rigid seal that worked. WHERE OH WHERE DID YOU GO ROTERDUN Swim Mask - Wide View Swimming Goggle ?!?!??! Was it COVID and the supply chain fiasco that did you in?!<br />If anyone knows, please comment, I'd love more of these!"
5.0,They're alright!
5.0,Absolutely beautiful dress and super comfortable.  I love it!
5.0,"My boyfriend bought this for her sister and when she opened the box, she was amazed. The presentation as well as the watch is gorgeous."
5.0,I love this little black robe! It is the perfect everyday post shower clothing article but the lace trim adds a spice of sexy. I recommend this robe 10/10.
5.0,Love the bag.!
5.0,Very nice! My son loves these items!
5.0,Adore the color
5.0,"My brother has wanted a neon green tie for a long time so he's going to love this one !! Fast shipping, good quality product! Love it!"
5.0,My wife loves this bottom.  Fits perfectly and is amazingly comfortable.  She loves the way this can be rolled up or down depending on your current sizing needs.  Stays in place while getting in and out of the water.  The color works with a huge variety of tops and she can mix and match to suit her needs.  Drys quickly and so far is holding up to the public pool with no fading or fabric degradations.  This is a great addition to any swim suit collection.
5.0,Darling dress. Made well for the price too.
5.0,This is a great product. I received one as a gift form a friend I I loved it so much I bought a second pair. The packaging is beautiful and the product itself is really sturdy. They sit comfortably on the face. The polarization is not too dark. It seems to brighten the colors. The glasses are a GREAT value for the price.
5.0,Total fit of product
5.0,"Great Price, an accurate size"
5.0,"Got these for led strip lights and they worked great. Easy to use, worked for what I bought them for. Great product"
5.0,"It's hard to find a good strapless bra. I really like this one. It's very comfortable, well made, and true to size. It stays up without an underwire, and the price is right."
5.0,Great butt coverage! Love this suit. Nice thick material
5.0,I order them larger than what I would normally wear. These are the best tops ever I have four of them in black and I am looking to buy several more! They hang great on my figure – they don’t wrinkle hardly at all – they are just the best tops ever!
5.0,such a wonderful piece!  The quality is excellent and the price is very reasonable.  I have purchased several Spunkysoul pieces and have been very pleased with every one!  I think I'll go back and see if I missed any pieces I need.  Thank you Spunky
5.0,"This was exactly what I was looking for--a pocket watch case to house a medallion.  Works perfectly.  The product arrived on time and in perfect condition.  And it functions just as it's advertised.  The glass dome simply fits over the wooden base--no attachments, no fuss.  The only thing that might take a little adjusting is the plastic cradle.  There's nothing for it to attach to, so it  floats on the base.  Once the case is moved, it's likely the cradle will slide to one side or the other, requiring a readjustment to the center.  But it's no big deal.  Just lift off the dome and move it.  Simple."
5.0,I always buy this! Love them!!
5.0,This product met my expecatations and are the most comfortable sandals I own!!!
5.0,Absolutely lovely and beautiful!

5.0,"Ordered a medium for my wife, and it fits fine, even a little loose; just like she likes it.  Received with no damage.  Fuzzy on both sides."
5.0,"This necklace is quite pretty, and is well made.  The thin chain has a series of larger links at the end is the length can be easily adjusted.  The clasp is easy to work.  The pendant itself is eye catching without being gaudy so the necklace looks far more expensive than its' relatively modest price."
5.0,I love my Anuschka by Anna purse. It is a nice size and beautifully painted. I have had other of these purses and enjoyed them all.
5.0,Bought these for my best friend’s newborn and they are just way too cute! Wish they had them in my size!
5.0,"So says my wife who is always challenging me when I but another ball cap.  This one, purpose purchased for the recent Seahawk vs Green Bay debacle, if well made and one of the best designs I own.  It really looks sharp!<br /><br />I'll likely store it to wear during the Seahawks Super Bowl appearance in 2021!"

5.0,"VERY USEFULL, IT COMES AS I EXPECTED. STRONG MATERIAL"

5.0,Perfect for my baby shower! I’m 5’4 and 9 months pregnant ( about 130lbs) I ordered an XS and it fit perfectly.
5.0,I really like the earrings especially they don't turn black after wearing.after sitting in the air or jewelry box they satay the same
5.0,"I love these.  These earrings fit my lobes perfectly and are easy to close.  I think that if my lobes were slightly bigger, I may have a little difficulty.  They are very pretty and I can hardly feel them when I have them on.<br /><br />Perfect with jeans and a tee, but gorgeous with a little black dress."
5.0,Like the shirt. Fits good great price..
5.0,This is a very good bra. I bought a La Isla before and it was great but it had Velcro straps and the velcro wore out quickly but this one is way better. And it's great for jogging.
5.0,Super cute I love it!
5.0,I love this dress!  I love that I don't have to wear a bra.  I love how it makes me look slimmer! I love how easy it is to take care of!

5.0,"I love these earrings even more than I expected! I got a free pair of blue-ish star earrings with them that are really cute, but I probably won't wear them much. It was really cool to get 2 sets of earrings, though, for a really great price! I got these in the mail pretty quick too! Very satisfied :)"
5.0,My new favorite earrings. I have worn these almost every single day since I bought them. I love the size and the look. They are well-made and the backings are large secure and beautiful. I want to buy a second pair just in case I misplace one of my original.

5.0,I liked the quality of these umbrellas and they are sooo cute as well.  Giving as shower hostess gifts!!!
5.0,I used for groceries
5.0,Very pretty band. Matches Versa perfectly and really dresses it up. This is the second one I bought since the first started losing its color in about a year. It cannot be worn for workouts and such due to this. It is definitely for dress only.
5.0,Totally adorable and durable. Exactly what I wanted ❤️
5.0,I did return this one for a bigger size
5.0,Good purchase! Great for hot California weather. Washes well. Very soft and easy to take on and off. Colors are great.

5.0,Love these!  I bought quite a few pairs & get lots of complements on the style.
5.0,"I like the dress, it is just a little to wide in the hips."
5.0,"Wow, these leggings are so soft and comfy, I went back and ordered 3 more pair. Paired with Levaca Women's Fall Long Sleeve Sweatshirt (actually T-shirt thickness) casual side-split tunic -- this is my winter wardrobe this year -- I live in mid-north Florida - not super cold, but does get chilly. So comfortable. Perfect for everything. Loving it!"

5.0,I love these boots..... I have a pair & brown & black.
5.0,It was a gift. And he loves it.
5.0,Mother
5.0,I found that it works great to keep my glasses where I want them on the bridge of my nose. Works great when I am out hiking and it reduces the risk of having them fall off.
5.0,"Nice shirt a little tight fitting but it is what it is for the price. Wish I had a little bit more design but again you get what you pay for, I will have to say though that it does feel real nice on the skin."
5.0,Cuddl Duds are the best.  Good product and good durability for wearing over and over.
5.0,I absolutely love this dress ! I ordered my regular size and it fits wonderfully. Not too tight in certain areas and it’s perfectly flowy and lightweight material . I will be ordering more colors!!!
5.0,This is the closest you will get to drinking beer with Stone Cold Steve Austin

5.0,It wasn’t flattering on me but it’s a very nice dress.
5.0,Exelente relog. Comodo y elegante.

5.0,Like the color of the earrings and the style.
5.0,My niece loved her socks.  They fit well and were very comfortable.  I will buy these again.
5.0,"I have to say this jacket is not bad for the price which surprised me does it get scorching hot no but it does keep me warm when I'm riding my bike in cold weather the only bad thing is it drains batteries fast so make sure you have a good powerbank ,all in all I glad I purchased this item no regrets whatsoever."
5.0,Fantastic waders. Very warm. Nice to be able to buy a size and adjust to you body size. A little high cut in the groin area but not uncomfortable. Shoe size runs true maybe a little on the big size. I wear a 12 ordered a 12 and have enough room for warm socks. I have been out in some very cold water with no warth issues. These are a bit heavy but it comes with the territory. I would recommend these to anyone looking to get a  set and not spend a fortune.<br /><br />Update<br />Still recommend these to the entry level waterfowl hunter. these lasted me 3&1/2 seasons before they just gave up. I didn’t treat them the best broke through ice and brush. They started leaking at the top of the boots where there are glued together. I am sure I could have repaired them but I upgraded instead. If they are all made as well as the pair I bought you can’t go wrong.
5.0,"I purchased the 6 piece set, however, I gave the clear away, but immediately reorder it."
5.0,Thin enough to be comfortable inside and really blocks the wind when you go outside.  Anatomically correct cut.  Good product.

5.0,Great Product !!! Quick delivery !!!

Then I saw the set of all 3 colors for an excellent price and bought the set.<br />The pendant is one very solid piece with nothing that could break. Solid stainless ( NOT hollow inside) so good weight.<br />The chains are strong and sturdy.<br />I am a female but wear these with everything!<br />Love, love love!<br />My favorite pieces of jewelry."

5.0,"I loved this dress. It was perfect for the party. I'm an 8/9 in.the waist and I am top heavy. I was willing to take a chance. SO GLAD I DID!! I ordered a large.

5.0,"I used this in a Cancun trip and my bathing suit was a deep V one piece. So, there was no support to hold the girls up. I used this tape and it worked amazing! It is great in water! It didn’t come off or shift and my boobs looked great for the 8 hour excursion we had. Definitely buy!"

5.0,Never bought something on here that fits true to size this was a good purchase
5.0,Perfect fit.  Great support.  Will buy more.
5.0,"This top is great for working out/lifting and lounging around. I can wear it running since I don't need much support, but if you need that I wouldn't recommend for high impact stuff, or maybe size down for more compression. It is very comfortable, stretchy, and soft. It has held up great so far, I only put it in the washer, I wouldn't put it in the dryer. Love it!!"
5.0,I usually wear a medium (5’5” 135lbs 20years) but it’s a good thing I ordered both the small and the medium. The medium was too large in the chest and the length (34B) so I didn’t have much chest to fill the dress to begin with. I got tons of compliments on the dress from the back it looks like a 60s dress and the front is sexy and modern :) light fabric but did not show my black bra and shorts underneath. 10/10
5.0,Nice earrings!!!  My wife wears them a lot!!!

5.0,"My husband wanted flats for christmas. He doesn’t like fitted slippers. He says he loves them, so I’m happy. I find them too flat, but I like a full fitted slipper. Airwalk is my slipper of choice, so I chose these for his present. Since he likes them, I’m good."
5.0,"It's a bit tighter than I thought it would be, but it fits nicely. The cloth is less shiny than it looks on the picture, and it doesn't stretch much, also it is a bit transparent. They delivered in time, and it was a good purchase."
5.0,Classic design from the best watch company in the planet! Thanks for making such awesome watch!
5.0,This dress is super sexy and I want another in another color...
5.0,"Washed twice, I've not put in dryer,  but just because it fits good and didn't want it to shrink any.  It's held its shape.  First girly girl tshirt I've bought,  but based on this one,  I'll get another"
5.0,The item was for Valentine's  Day  my favorites jewelry  is hearts
5.0,"Love it, it is so handy."
5.0,"These earrings are small yet appropriately sized. They fit very comfortably. They arrived in a cute satin like bag. I purchased them to wear with 2 dragony body con dresses and a sage green dress from F21. I am telling you ladies, I look edgy & fierce. I'm 28 and a black woman who is currently enjoying a 90s fashion kind of a summer. This is neck sucking earring, needs to pair with a small diamond like silver necklace. I highly recommend this sex magnet pair of earring."
5.0,great top
5.0,"Fun and colorful, have worn them twice so far."
5.0,These are so cute and the size is great for new born photo .  We really loved them

5.0,"Love, Love, Love it I wear a size 14-16 I ordered the 2xl, with the intentions to wear it open with a graphic Tee and it worked perfect, I got a ton of complaints and inquiries about where I got it, I will be buying another one."
5.0,Ok so I was hesitant about the seller’s directions on how to get the dog to use these as his directions suggested but it worked just as described. Last night was July 3rd. Our little beauty wore them to bed and yes she left them on!!!!! Looking forward to sleeping during future thunderstorms and fireworks without a quaking and freaking pooch!!! A win for everyone!!!  They do take some adjusting but our dog seemed to be fine with the readjustments to get it to fit her little head.
5.0,"I expected it to be a little loose after reading all the reviews. But I want it to wear around the house and in my garden especially when I get out of the shower. It's perfect. And I am so pleased with this light green one. I wasn't sure when I ordered it, but it is such a soft moss green background and the blossoms are soft hues of peach and yellow! Very feminine and pretty!"
5.0,"love these, got so many compliments and they fit really cute!"
5.0,"It's very soft with a medium weight. The colors are true to the pictures and the fit is perfect. I'm 5'11"" athletic build at 180 lbs and the medium worked well for me."
5.0,First of all...This veil is amazing.  Wore it to a Moroccan party and everyone asked where I got it from.  Def worth the money.  Very well made and looks to be much more expensive than $25.
5.0,One size fits all beanie! Got a big head(within reason)? It'll keep it warm. Got a small head(within reason)? It'll keep that warm too. Got something in between? Hey it'll keep it warm. Wouldn't recommend it for the Arctic (probably need a thicker hat) or the sunny skies of the Sahara (will keep you warm but probably unnecessary). For general cold outdoor needs you should be covered although I would recommend wearing other articles of clothing with it.
5.0,"Very good sweater! Quality and comfort. Fits perfectly on 6’3 frame. Comes from the UK so expect it to take a while, (like 2 weeks) but worth the wait."
5.0,Decent belt for the price. Color in picture is a bit off though.
5.0,Absolutely love this product. Great to wear understand skirt or  dress in summer.  Keeps you cooler then regular slip
5.0,Wore these for a holiday work event. I sized up so they would be more flowy. They were perfect. I got soo many compliments on them.
5.0,"Great product, recommended..."
5.0,"Nice, like these pants."
5.0,"I use this for my e-cig and works great, great quality!"
5.0,I bought this hat for my boyfriend.  He loves it! They work so well! The sound quality is good for talking as well as for listening to music.  He said the side with the buttons is a little bulkier than the other side but that is expected. I'm going to buy one for myself!
5.0,"I wore this dress for a very significant, meaningful occasion, and it did not disappoint. It was so comfortable to wear and fit exactly as I hoped (I am 5'9&#34; and curvy - I usually wear a size 10, but it recommended to get a size lower and the 8 was perfect). The top is soft and comfortable, the waistline was very flattering and the bottom wasn't stiff or resting weird. I'm not a dress person, but I'm so glad I choose this dress for the reason I needed it and it's definitely a go-to now for when I need to dress up a little and want to feel cute as a button at the same time. Definitely recommend."
5.0,I'm 5'6 and usually wear Size 12-14.<br />This dress is very nicely made and covers the belly. The chest part is beautiful and fits perfectly. Size L is too tight though so I'm returning it for size XL.

5.0,"stunning dress, excellent bead work, durable for a playful child."
5.0,"This is a light pant, casual and cool. Very comfortable. It looked rough at first till I put it on. Of course if you prefer you can iron it to make it smoother, but I felt so comfortable I didn’t want to do anything. It’s good around the house or even to bed. I love it."
5.0,Its a bit big for my wife's wrist bit is able to be sized so that is awesome
5.0,"I bought this for christmas parties, kinda for fun dress. The colors are bright and it's just fun. I ordered an xl. I usually wear xl or 14 to 16. I weigh 220 and I'm 5'7.  This xl is a little big. I probably could have ordered a smaller size and it would have been ok.The dress feels smooth. The fabric is thick. I like the long sleeves for winter and it looks great with red leggens . I received this product for free / discounted price in return for my honest unbiased opinion. ."
5.0,"I received my dress yesterday and it's beautiful and perfect! Since I'm elderly,it was hard to find a dress suitable for my sons upcoming wedding.this one was just perfect,not too fancy but graceful.thank you!"

5.0,Loved these glasses.
5.0,"Shipped on time, and the product looks great. Easily fits an adult."
5.0,"Well made, looks great, made in USA!<br /><br />I like the look of this bracelet! It is polished ""gunmetal,"" has a bit of stretch and flexibility, it is well made, and it is made in the USA!  It arrives in a cute little drawstring bag.<br /><br />For reference, my wrist measures approximately 6.75 inches at the base, maybe slightly under.  Although the description states that this bracelet is intended for small to standard size wrists, it fits my wrist just fine!  In fact, I like that it doesn’t move around a lot, nor does it fall up my arm when I lift my arms, nor down my hand when I’m walking.  The bracelet has just enough stretch and flexibility so that I can work it over my hand with ease!<br /><br />I emailed JANIS to inquire where this bracelet is made.  I'm happy to report that it is made in the USA!  Nothing on the actual product or packaging indicates where it is made, and nothing in the product summary on Amazon tells the consumer where it is made. It would be nice if JANIS clearly and proudly stated that this item is made in the USA, and include that information with the bracelet.<br /><br />As a side note, if you have any peach fuzz on your hand or wrist, this bracelet will find it! 🤪 It will get your attention and remind you to defuzz!  Lol!<br /><br />Overall, I like this well-made JANIS BY JANIS SAVITT Flexible 7mm Cuff Cobra Bracelet and I am happy to recommend it!"

5.0,Holds all my cards without being bulky. Very satisfied with it.  I do wish it was available in a darker leather.
5.0,"I was wondering if these were real, and between New Year's Eve and New Year's day I was holding the certificate wondering if it was real and focusing on the "" authenticity "" and I felt something on my heart. Of course The Pink Holy Bible was with me. But a little of this, alot of Jesus, and Eucommia bark... I am healed and free from a heart problem. I do believe these are real now."
5.0,I love this type of shirt because I can wear it for so many occasions. Dress it up with slacks or down with jeans. It fits a little bigger than I expected.

5.0,Durable and cute. Doesn’t tarnish. I keep a choker on literally 24/7. Even in the shower. These hold up great. I’ve had the same one on for a couple months now with no issues.
5.0,bought as a gift ....and they were well received...
5.0,"I ordered my first pair because I was having trouble with one of my calfs swelling to almost twice it's size when I worked out.  I spoke to my doctor about this and he told me it's because of the problems I have with circulation in that leg..I suffer from vericose veins only in that leg and no matter how many times I have them fixed, new ones pop out. My doctor suggested wearing a compression sleeve when I work out. I immediately went home and searched Amazon only to find these really cute ones with butterflies and ordered the light purple ones in xs/s. The first time I wore them I was so impressed that they worked and prevented that calf from swelling. I decided to order another pair. The second pair seemed to have an issue as it did not stay up while working out. I made a comment regarding this and much to my pleasant surprise, I was contacted by the company and they stood behind their product 100% and refunded the purchase price. I will be ordering from this company again as I believe in supporting a business that has ethics. Plus these compression sleeves are not only cute but VERY effective."
5.0,They seem to be very well made and they stay in well.  They're also quite pretty.
5.0,I love this shirt.
5.0,"As the pictures show, this hood reflects SOME light, but it's otherwise very effective for hiding my head in my helmet.  I can see and breathe OK in it.  It should make RenFest and Halloween lots of fun! ;-)"
5.0,"Beautiful, high quality jacket! Absolutely happy with my purchase! I bought some 9 for my 6 y.o. and it fits as expected slightly roomy and will definitely fit her for the next 2 years. Will buy more of this brand!"
5.0,I love the jewel tone colors of this bag.  It goes with everything. The colors are much nicer than in the picture.  It is small enough to be used as an everyday bag but large enough to carry everything you need and more.  I like that I am still able to carry the bag on my shoulders using the shorter straps but I have the option of using the detachable longer cross body strap. This would make a great travel bag.
5.0,It was light weight and good material.
5.0,"One of my faves for cooking with my mini guests, my 9 yo daughter 😊"
5.0,"I bought this shrug to go with a sleeveless lace dress I was wearing to a winter wedding.  I liked how it covered my arms and kept me warm, without being too warm.  The shrug is see-through in the back, so my dress could still be seen."
5.0,I did not know 18 inches would be this short.
5.0,Gift for my daughter - she loves it.

5.0,"Super comfortable, beautiful and looks so hood on me"
5.0,Lots of sections. Leather is great.
5.0,"Love this item, colors are beautiful!!!"
5.0,I dig these trunks! They look good! I got us size medium Asian XXL LOL<br /><br />I wear 34-35 pants and I’m muscular and have big wrestler butt and quads. This looks dope because you expose your muscle pull the short up a little and look badass!<br /><br />Fit: id Say they fit snug but not wayyy too small. If I was buying underwear in US I always get Large but if I buy shorts in us I always get medium.<br /><br />So I got medium knowing the material stretches and it fits. I wear it in the pool every time I swim! Next pair I will size up but still happy very happy with this purchase.
5.0,Very nice. Good quality. Like the non slip surface.
5.0,As described. Ships fast. You will need if you wear a sling after shoulder surgery.
5.0,I bought this dress as part of a costume. It first a little tighter than I like but probably the way it is suppose to fit. It was very soft and comfortable.
5.0,I love this top. So many things you can do with it.  I travel a lot and this top is indispensible I am a size 20 and I actually found that the small to large size fit me better than the larger 1X-3X size.  Wish they came in other colors like red instead of just black and that ho-hum beige.
5.0,My husband really likes them. He can wear them for church or on dressier outings
5.0,"I bought a watch w/ this type of spring bar. GENIUS!! Why wasn't this around yrs ago?? Watches are an accessory and called 'time pieces' anymore. I have dozens: colors matching outfits and jewelry, small and large 'faces', dif metal 'tones'. I can't imagine NOT wearing a watch anymore and these spring bars would have made my life easier by 5-10 min. I swap bands all the time. I LOVE THESE. Warning-Only useful on WIDE band watches."

5.0,"I purchased this pendant with a few other items from this seller. The pendant itself arrived in perfect condition! I have only worn it a few times in the 4 months I have owned it, and it withstood just fine. It lives in a jewelery box with many other pendants, and has not gotten tangled or broken. I receive many compliments on it when I wear it out! It's quite long (I am 5'9&#34; with a long torso, it sits just at or under the bust line) and flatters a lot of outfits! I have worn it with a lightweight scarf as well, which made it pop out a little more. I enjoy this piece, and would certainly recommend it to others.<br /><br />The shipping time was long, but that was expected. It actually arrived faster than I had anticipated! And it was quite fun to receive a package from overseas! :) I highly recommend."
5.0,These offer nice support with light weight.  They are easy to put on and the color is good.  I do like the footless feature.

5.0,I like them theyre spacious
5.0,"Update: I've had this for two years and it had held up well. Satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />Black Denim unisex, feels sturdy. No factory irregularities. The tag says hand wash, so time will tell if the dye will leach out in a machine. Overall very pleased with the apron."
5.0,My nephew had me order this as a gift for his girlfriend. He said she loved it.
5.0,"I love the dress. I ordered a medium and it’s somewhat big , I’m 5’4 145lb but it’s nothing alterations can’t do!! I’ve gotten so many compliments and I haven’t even wore the dress yet so I’m excited to put it on"
5.0,"A welcome gift for your Postman.  When he arrived I handed the package back to him.  When I told him it was for him, a pair of fingerless gloves with a mitten enclosure for more warmth.  His eyes lit up and he was delighted.  They came at a most welcome time.  Our first snow this morning and day started out at 29° F.<br /><br />Update:  He was wearing his gloves this evening.  Smiling and waving as he crossed a very cold snowy lawn."
5.0,"Very soft with Velcro backing, I bought the grey/white/black package. They fit my five year old sons head and my forty-one year old head....😀"
5.0,"A very well made Wallet. Has lot of storage space. Allow me to store credit cards, Id Cards, and lots of other junk. Has money storage pockets, but hard to get money into wallet if full of cards. But over all a great wallet for protecting your credit cards."

I love unicorns and I've been converting over to only purchasing vegan materials, so I was pretty excited to get these. They're ridiculously cute. I am a 7-7.5 and they fit perfectly, albeit a little narrow but I'm hoping that doesn't cause too much discomfort. Overall, the cutest shoes I own right now.<br /><br />I received this product discounted in exchange for my honest opinion."

5.0,This dress is awesome! So comfortable to wear! The fabric is stretchy and breathable. The drawback? I’m a curvy woman.. and this dress shows every curve. Great for around the house though! (It’s not the seller’s fault that I’ve blossomed during Covid 🤷🏼‍♀️) Did I mention the pockets? They’re awesome!
5.0,"Cute top can't with to wear, with purple jeans to a Prince tribute"

5.0,I wore this dress to a funeral for a friend. I received numerous compliments on the dress and my sister asked if she could borrow it.
5.0,My stepdaughter loved it!
5.0,"I always get compliments by cashiers whenever I have to pay for something. As for durability, I have had it for about 2 months now and it is holding up pretty well considering it is made out of paper, this Tyvek material is very durable! I can fit about 5 credit cards on each side before it starts getting uncomfortably big. This is my third Mighty Wallet and I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a thin, durable, water resistant wallet."
5.0,Just like they look in the picture.  Good quality for the price.
5.0,I love my bag it everything and more
5.0,"Lots of compartments and the bag is very light, good when you carry loads of &#34;stuff&#34; as I do. Very pleased with this handbag."

5.0,Cute and priced right
5.0,"Love the quality. Very well made and sharp looking. Hold a regular pair of glasses and fits nicely in my shirt pocket, Strong clip let me work in the yard without glasses falling out."
5.0,"This t-shirt is very good quality.  It is 100% high quality cotton and true to size.  I was surprised just how thick it was.  It washed very well.  No fading or pulling. Very minimal shrinking.  The print and graphic are not just iron-on, they are good quality.  I bought this for my husband but my teenage daughter has stolen it.  It is one of her favorite shirts.  We get many laughs and comments whenever we are out in public.  Very funny shirt that makes light of this crazy election.  I was given this at a discount for my honest review."
5.0,Soo cool!! Works great!!
5.0,I really love the style and fit
5.0,Good quality fabric

5.0,it's for a daughter and I feel she will love it.
5.0,Very nice gift
5.0,"As I stated on the Eagle Eye Sunglasses, I needed a pair for night driving.  I do not drive to much as night because of the car beams (look like bursts).  But when I do, these will help.  It is great to be able to get the size small, so they do not fall off my face.  Have not tried them yet but will soon.  I try to drive at night once a month to keep in practice.  At 68 legally blind in left eye and macular starting in right, sun and night headlights bother me.  So I hope these glasses help me at night."
5.0,"I ordered this fully expecting to receive a ghost trap without a pedal. To my delightful surprise, my ghost trap absolutely had a pedal to activate the doors! Call it fate, call it luck, call it karma, I think I was meant to get the trap with the pedal!"
5.0,"Love the color, perfect fit."
5.0,Fantastic item. Im 5 foot 3 and 130 lbs.<br />It hits at my ankle. Well made and flattering.

5.0,Really comfortable and just how I expected it! I love it.
5.0,Soft and stretchy! Very comfortable and worth the price.
5.0,The hat looks way better in person!
5.0,"I received this product packaged perfectly. The seller really made the effort to stuff the shoes with paper to keep the shape and avoid being smashed or pushed in. The feel of the leather is soft and the color is exactly as advertised. There is no weird smell, they just smell like brand new shoes which is nice. These shoes are perfectly seamed and beautiful as well as the shade of pink. These do not look cheaply made at all and I love how well they are put together. An elastic band is wrapped so discreetly around the heal to the ankle part of the Moccasin for such an easy way to put on my daughter. Once on or off you could never even tell they are made with the band. The inside is soft and comfortable and they do not bother or itch my daughter at all even when wearing them for a few hours while out. I will be recommending these to all the mothers of daughters I know, for presents and baby shower gifts. These shoes are perfect! I did receive this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review and this is exactly that."
5.0,I bought this as a late Christmas gift and the Marine I gave it to LOVES it (he wears it all the time).
5.0,"I loved my skirt. I am a minister, si I like to have long skirts when I do so. It fit very well, and its so comfortable. I am definitely ordering another one. I give a special shout out to all of you who gave a review because your reviews were very helpful.<br />#wellpleased<br /> Thank You!"
5.0,"Love them, especially for the price!"
5.0,"The jacket is great the value is awesome. The only thing is how it arrived, wrinkled but no biggie it still was hot once I put it on."
5.0,Not much to say other then I'm very happy with it
5.0,Bought it for my GF and she loves it
5.0,I love the way this dress fits and looks.  It washes up very nicely too.
5.0,My husband loves the shoes they are very comfy
5.0,Love love this top! The quality and fit was great! Would order again in a different color!’
5.0,"I bought these for a trip to NYC. I walked around in them for 5 days and they were perfectly comfortable. More importantly, my feet never got cold! Love these boots. Living in south Florida, sadly I won’t get to wear them often."
5.0,Very pretty comfortable and sexy
5.0,"Great quality, the silver is striking and beautiful, the size is as promised. Everything checks out, recommended"
5.0,"Honestly, I was a little skeptical about these sweatpants because the material felt too silky. Once I put them on, they felt amazing. They fit perfectly, not baggy, but not too tight like leggings. I like the elastic at the ankles, since I am short, I don't need too worry about the legs being too long. I wish they came in more colors than just two. The pockets are not deep enough to be useful but I did not plan on using them anyway."
5.0,Gift for daughter.  She loves it!
5.0,"Beautiful dress,  got so many compliments"
5.0,"Perfect size for a pocket dump, looks nice and made well. will be getting a couple more."
5.0,I love this skirt! I always wear skirts with bike shorts underneath and I thought it was time to buy something designed to be worn that way with more intention. The shorts are long enough to be comfy and protect thighs from chafing. The skirt is super cute and the pockets are handy. The material doesn't scream 'sports' like most of these similar skirts do. I might buy in more colors!
5.0,"Great product, quick delivery"
5.0,It is exactly what we hoped for and fits perfectly. Highly recommend.
5.0,Very summery sexy
5.0,"This is soft material, washes well (and did fine on low heat in the dryer) and fit perfectly."
5.0,"This bracelet is well made and well weighted. It is a simple classic bracelet that will go with everything. I, unfortunately had to return mine. The 7.2 "" size was a bit too small for my taste. I usually wear a 7.5"". I was bummed as I really like it. Good quality for a really good price at the time ($109)."
5.0,I absolutely love this dress. So easy to just throw on. Does not wrinkle if you roll it after you iron it and throw in your beach bag. Great summer staple.
5.0,I love it. It's nice and well made. It is a perfect size for me and there are enough pockets for me  to organize my stuff. And it is lightweight.
5.0,Lovely dress. Fits perfectly.
5.0,Dainty and sweet would recommend
5.0,This dress feels like a blanket without feeling heavy. It’s really soft and fits well.
5.0,"Lightweight feel to the material, I usually wear an X-Small or Small. I ordered a Small and fits great. The print on it of Rick and Morty is awesome and is not bulky feeling. Overall happy and LOVE the teal color."
5.0,"A coworker of mine purchased the same wallet a year ago and was really happy with his purchase, and suggested I try it out.<br /><br />I have to say the wallet is perfect. First it's much smaller than your typical wallet. It may not seem like much, but it makes a big difference. This is the opposite of your &#34;George Costanza wallet&#34;, it fits very comfortably in your pocket.<br /><br />The magnet money clip works great (and is strong, it can hold the wallet against any metal surface, or it can hold up your keys). But it's not so strong that it makes retrieving cash a problem. Actually I find it so much more easier to retrieve cash than compared with your typical folding wallet. No more fumbling with the wallet trying to put money back it without crumpling it.<br /><br />I got the blue version, and I will say it looks a little darker blue than the picture suggests, which I actually like even better.<br /><br />I liked it so much I bought two more from this company as gifts."
5.0,"perfect fit and very thinning, can't wait to wear this summer!"
5.0,Looks really good on my Girlfriend! Love the quality!
5.0,"Nice wallet. Good size.  Fits my IPhone 6 Plus with my speck case which is a little on the  larger side.  Good quality, not cheaply made.  Plenty of slots for cards, ID and cash.  The wristlet it comes with adds a nice touch.<br /><br />I took this wristlet on trip to Cancun and let me just say I didn't have to pack a bulky purse on top of a carry on bag which made my trip A little more comfy.  This little purse slipped right into my carry on making it easy to remove when needed.  It held my cash, cards, cell phone, two passports and airline tickets nicely.  Easy to get to all our important documents as we went through checkpoints and then easy to tuck away.<br /><br />Overall very happy with my purchase."
5.0,Great addition to my costume. Headband was comfortable and not too tight. It even came with little clips to hold it in place.
5.0,Love these sunglasses.
5.0,"Ever Faith is ever faithful! The jewelry is always more impressive in real life. I actually wore out my first Ever Faith bracelet (maybe I shouldn't have slept in it, too?), so let's see how ling this one lasts! (By the way, showering in it really makes it shine!) Lol! But it really does..."
5.0,"Love the fun pattern, easy to get on and help prevent my feet from getting sore after 12+ hour shifts. Effective without being uncomfortable. Would recommend."
5.0,"Have yet to need them, but seem to be very warm when i tried on"
5.0,"The reason why I gave this product 5 stars is because:<br />-Cheap price;<br />-Digital watch;<br />-The timer.<br /><br />One personal negative thing about this watch for me is that it is water resistant instead of water proof. I started swimming a couple of months before I had bought this watch, and I want to have a timer for my swimming exercises. I only looked for a cheap watch with a timer, and I forgot to look for the purpose of swimming (and thus water proof instead of water resistant), but it is my own fault. Because of the previous typed reason; I have to buy a new watch which is water proof instead of water resistant. I will still wear this watch outside the swimming pool."
5.0,Me gusta la variedad y buena calidad
5.0,The purple pearl is AAA quality however  the picture does. It show the real color of the pearl . It looks much beautiful than picture
5.0,"Very warm. Granddaughter can play in the snow, stay warm, dry. And they are comfy."
5.0,Took me about an hour to adjust the size due to trial and error. but for the price its nice. i got the silver one w black detail to match my black apple watch
5.0,"This is my second North End jacket.  The fit is perfect and the weight is just right--not too heavy, not too light.  I wear this jacket almost year round here in the desert.  It blocks the wind, and is very comfortable.  The white goes with everything.  Washes and dries well.  Very easy to pack.  My favorite jacket."
5.0,Well made for kids
5.0,Great fabric tick and strong loved it
5.0,Very good belt buckle fit my leather belt just right
5.0,My feet stopped hurting immediately the first i wore them to work
5.0,"These where wonderful, really nice quality, they wash great too."
5.0,Very nice quality for price. We gave them to our daughter as a birthday gift and she adores them. She has a pet tarantula and a gecko so the spider and lizard are her favorite! No discoloration with extended wear.
5.0,"Soft, fits well...want all colors, I have a few!"
5.0,Wore to a wedding and the dress fit great and I got many compliments.
5.0,Omg. Love. Beautiful! So cool.....
5.0,"Comfy pants for fast food work. Need pockets, though."
5.0,"Beyond cute.  So many pockets to keep things organized.  I first glance I thought would be too large, but I think anything else would be too small.  10x12x5"
5.0,A great way to organize your packed items into easy to see cubes.  Zippers work great.
5.0,Bought these for my son and he absolutely loves them... Wears them all the time.
5.0,"LOVED this tutu skirt! I bought it for my bridal shower, I ordered the small afraid it might not fit but the waist is elastic so it adjusted perfectly to my Size. I got SO MANY compliments on my skirt, girls wanting to know where I got it from. HIGHLY RECOMMEND ordering skirts from here!!"
5.0,Love this watch use it almost every day and catches peoples eye wherever I go
5.0,You know how some totes are too big...this one isn't. It is a great size for a large purse but not big enough for a beach bag unless it's one person with a thin towel. I got this because I'm sick of fumbling through my bags to find stuff and I wanted a place that would fit my planner (I have lots of planners I carry) and diaper bag items. It barely fits everything but I love it soooo much. Its so cute. I think I may buy another in black (I got the teal) and use one for my planner stuff and one for a diaper bag. IDK but this is a great bag.
5.0,"Great fit, comfortable and safe"
5.0,"After buying and returning the ""School Uniform"" sweater that also has good reviews on Amazon and is a comparable price (returned due to it being too large, not blue enough, and somewhat flimsy), I purchased this for my husband.  It's great!  It's really nice material for the price, doesn't seem cheap at all (except for a few rough threads on the bottom front), and at 6'0"" and 210lb (much of which is muscle), the large fits him perfectly.  The navy is a really nice dark blue, and it works both as a house sweater and also worn out as needed with a nice outfit.  Haven't washed it yet - hopefully it holds up well!"
5.0,Best flip flops I've ever owned.  I love the Nike Free technology in my tennis shoes and it does not disappoint in these.
5.0,A quality tank
5.0,These are the best all around athletic socks I’ve found. And I’m quite picky!!<br />They are equally padded all around the foot and they fit & last very well.
5.0,Very comfortable and nice looking band.  Fits my ZenWatch 3 perfectly.  Looks great with brown clothing or blue jeans.
5.0,Wore it to a wedding
5.0,I love beanies. And this one is awesome!
5.0,Was expecting a little bigger but gives me a reason to lose more weight!!
5.0,"Great purchase, excellent product"
5.0,Highly detailed coin for the FFVI fan.
5.0,Material is so comfortable
5.0,"This collar comes up a bit far, it caused a bit of discomfort for my gf. She couldn't sleep with it on and decided to go with a smaller collar like my wife."
5.0,Very good quality.  Even included tool to change pins and am extra set of pins
5.0,Queda perfecto y es de muy buena calidad.  La talla es perfecta
5.0,I love my hat.  Fashionable and fun.  Warm and cozy.  It’s been great for the cool weather.
5.0,"Nice shirt for the price. I would recommend this purchase. Good value, look and feel. Color holds up after washings."
5.0,love it it looks awesome
5.0,I ordered this september 9th and got it by september 17th. Very fast shipping and very nice. Bigger than I expected but love that it is. I can say the chain looks like it will prolly tarnish fast but for the price i wouldnt expect anything different.
5.0,This dress is exactly as pictured. I absolutely love the pockets! I ordered in a different color as well.
5.0,Totally 💯 worth the price. I’ve bought jewelry from them before. Great value!!👍
5.0,So cute and great size !
5.0,"This is one of my favorite t-shirts to wear. It's very high quality fabric. I was a little surprised at how it almost felt heavy when I took it out of the package, but it doesn't feel heavy on. It's really soft and it has a nice loose fit. It has been through several washes and held up great. I hang it to dry (like I do with all of my other shirts). It still looks great! I would buy it again."
5.0,I got these sunglasses for a Halloween costume and was pleasantly surprised how great they are. They’re stylish and seem high quality for the price.
5.0,This choker and earing set was perfect for my vampire's costume. It is very pretty and the price was reasonable.
5.0,Luv it..really nice.

5.0,My son loved these shorts
5.0,Looks great and sturdy. My 2.5 year old wears this hat while playing in the school playground.
5.0,These readers are great!  I can easily adjust the magnification to clearly see no matter how small the print. Reading was becoming a challenge.  No more stacking pairs of reader glasses to see the smaller print.  Glad to have discovered them!
5.0,The necklace was beautifully made and larger than I thought it would be. It was a gift for my mom and she loved it.
5.0,Beautiful necklace ty!
5.0,So pretty! I ordered a tutu from Etsy and it was terrible! I rushed to order this one and it’s exactly what I wanted
5.0,This Leotard is light weight and perfect fitting for our 31 lb 1.5 year old girl. But also has some room to grow without it looking too big now.
5.0,"It’s a good mask. It shed a bit, but I still enjoyed it. I plan on wearing it next year on St Patrick’s Day."
5.0,Repeat customer
5.0,How warm it kept my head and neck. Amazing comfort
5.0,"I got the purple version of chocolate and I love them!  The size is good, the color of purple is lovely, and they are very light.  I figure I'll have to let folks know it's chocolate, but that's true of most of the molecule choices."
5.0,"Really cute. Slightly stretchy material. I meant to order a size Large, but accidentally ordered a Size M and it's tight, I'm 5'1"" and 170lbs. Small waist but wide hips and big bust. Despite it being tight, it still goes over my body though due to the stretchy material.. I'll be exchanging for a large size, but I'm happy with my purchase."
5.0,These boots are great for cold weather
5.0,"love the colors , soft and warm ,fit great!"
5.0,Loved the tags!  They came on time.  They look good and are high quality.  And they have stayed in great shape through my travel to 10 countries throughout Africa and Thailand over the last three months.  They still look new!
5.0,Excellent.  I love these lights. They work fabulously. Lotta fun. Highly recommend
5.0,Very nice. Gave to my grandma to use after heart surgery

5.0,So cute and goes with anything.
5.0,Love this dress fits perfect. Love the multi-way design.
5.0,Basic and great colors and fit
5.0,"Heavy duty. Really pretty. Add essential oils to the charcoal stones to enhance its abilities.<br /><br />The quality is nice. So far nothing has broke off or tarnished.<br /><br />I wear this and at times wrap it in my palm like religious folks would a rosery, during my meditation.<br /><br />I've also bought 2 others in a different stone and style as gifts for family. Same applies with those. Very beautiful pieces."
5.0,It has already become my favorite sweatshirt-and I own a lot of sweatshirts.
5.0,Cowboys
5.0,"This fit pretty good! My sizing is a little weird. I’m smaller in the chest but larger in the tummy. It fits my chest okay but is a bit big. A strapless bra fixed it some but the straps are still a little large. The waist fit a little snuggly but it’s not uncomfortable. The material is light which is nice and I love that it’s long for a train. The beading and sequins are pretty as well! They are a bit scratchy but not unbearable for a couple hours! Overall, I’m happy!"
5.0,"Dress fit as expected, great fabric, perfect size."
5.0,Looks great and fits great. Perfect band to dress up the Apple Watch.
5.0,"Great wallet, works perfectly!! just ordered a second one for when this one wears out, cause if I like something... they quit making them!"
5.0,nothing to complain about
5.0,This is so cute on top of a bun!
5.0,"Overall the ordering process, arrival and quality were great. It fit well but once it was on it had a little give to it and I would have liked it really tight. I had to keep pulling it up around the crotch area all night. I'm 5'5, 164Lbs. I should have gotten a medium."
5.0,my man really love this.......
5.0,"Holy smokes, these pants exceeded my expectations. The elastic waist is comfortable and rests just below my belly button. I'm 5'4"" and they are full-length on my body, not ankle-length like the photo suggests. The material is lightweight and really flattering. They have regular pockets and side-zip pockets. I wear them hiking, on travel days, running errands... and even just around the house. I get lots of compliments on them, and have highly recommended to friends and family."
5.0,Love it and I'm 54.
5.0,the wife loves it
5.0,"I bought these pants for my husband. He is extremely critical of clothing that he buys for himself. He loves the comfort of wearing these Lightweight Athletic Pants, which are tapered at the legs. They do not ride up the leg on him.  He actually wears them as PJ bottoms at bedtime because of the how lightweight they are."
5.0,"This skirt surpassed my expectations.  It is lovely...well made and a fantastic buy for the cost.  The fabric is just beautiful. I purchased this for a formal event we are going to, and it will look beautiful with my white silk top."
5.0,Love it!!!!! It fits perfect
5.0,"This is the third set of these that I've bought and use. The sunglasses are great and fit over my regular glasses and the night driving glasses are super to wear at night, stops the blinding headlights that are coming toward you so you can see what's happening in front of you.  These are great and I'm sure when these get scratched from using them."
5.0,Great hat. Quite honestly I only purchased this pink hat because it looks similar to Lady GaGa's. I am a male with a big dome and it did not fit me. Great hat for smaller cranium humans or pets. 👍🏼
5.0,"Comfortable boots, however I did put insoles in mine.  They are cute whether you wear them with the top covered or uncovered."
5.0,I like the cloth
5.0,"1: I liked how the packing was easy to open. As it always reflects negatively when something is impossible to open.<br />2: Easy to understand how they work. Slipped right on and seem very secure. I liked the rubber as I can be hard on stuff, should hold up well.<br />3: Personally I would like a longer option. Like most older people I sometimes wear 2 different glasses. I usually wear sunglasses most of the time but like having my reading glasses around my neck for when I need them. That way I never have to search for them.  I like my reading glasses long and my sunglasses short so I know which is which.<br />4: All in all I am happy with them. I like that it's easy to use, They don't  need to be complicated to install. They seem well built and should last a long time."
5.0,Really cute versatile look
5.0,My bestie and I have gotten so many compliments.  Fits very well

5.0,This is versatile. I use it to style my hair and wear it around my neck.

5.0,Gorgeous very high quality! Love it!
5.0,Cutest shirt for a fourth birthday party.  Out son looked so cute in it!
5.0,"I love this dress! The sizing is VERY weird though. I am 5’9, 175 lbs, 36C, smaller waist, curvy hips and ordered a large based on reviews from others and it fits perfectly. The size chart provided  would have had me ordering an xl or larger I think so go with the suggestions on the reviews."
5.0,"I love this sweatshirt. It is super soft and long enough to cover your tush! I am 5’8, 155lbs and the large fit great! I bought the sand color and was very pleased with both the color and quality.<br /><br />Great purchase!"

5.0,"Wow! I am thrilled w my readers.They are so cute. Each pair came in it's own little case. And the seller even included a cleaning cloth! Naturally I am headed back to buy more. These are by far the cutest, nicest quality reading glasses I have found anywhere including an optician shop."
5.0,Very soft and pretty
5.0,I love the size and look of this thing. I wanted a single strap instead of two as it's more practical these days. It's pretty durable so far and definitely holds all I need it to. Even came with a cool little velcro patch in the middle.
5.0,this ring is beautiful. buy it just for yourself. the complements pour in when you wear it.
5.0,"Absolutely love the durability, size and color of this bag. It fits everything I need to carry."
5.0,Not bad at all. Feet well. Somewhat comfortable.<br />For this price it's best I could find. Recommend for people who would rather pay $30 not $300 for their boots.
5.0,"Love this!! So soft and comfy, and it’s super cute! Highly recommend this, great find for the price"
5.0,VERY COOL. MY BROTHER LOVES IT! THANKS!
5.0,"This bag is beautiful! I did waterproof it and it darkened a bit but it is gorgeous! I am going to have &#34;feet&#34; put on the bottom. The insert is removable and gives a nice option. Scratches come right off!!! I don't care for all the jazz they put on so many bags these days and this is a timeless bag, I'll have it for a long time. Great buy and arrived quickly!"
5.0,I love this sweatshirt!!! I wore it as a shirt The only this it has to be dry cleaned
5.0,Steelers fan so it was perfect
5.0,Very pretty straw bag for the summer.
5.0,"AN ATTRACTIVELY UNIQUE INEXPENSIVE AUTOMATIC WATCH. Doesn't keep great time (even in a winder) BUT with its SEE-THRU DESIGN, it's definitely an eye-catching attention-getter!"
5.0,Very comfortable. Can wear it casual or dress it up. Love it. Great for down on the beach. Or going out to dinner.
5.0,"Great Bag - this fits the purpose I was looking for very well. I wanted a bag that I could carry my golf shoes around in, and this fit great. It is made of durable material, has a double zipper to open the compartment for the shoes and is very spacious. It also has a nice side zipper where I keep my golf gloves now and a convenient carrying handle. I've used it to transport my shoes to the course once and was very pleased with the purchase. I received this product at a discount for an honest and unbias review, I do believe in the product and would purchase again. If you are in need of an easy lightweight bag to transport your shoes I would encourage you to purchase."
5.0,Perfect fit and super soft fabric!
5.0,This shirt screams &#34;'Merica&#34;
5.0,"These pants are stylish, nicely made in a light weight (but not see through)nice material. I liked them very much and if they had fit, would have purchased them in every color. I usually wear a 3x but took a chance because of style and price. I am disappointed to have to return them. I would gladly pay more if they came in a larger size."
5.0,I loved it & so does my bff
5.0,"Great, as expected 👏"
5.0,Same as title tbh
5.0,I liked the looks but it's not lined so had to add a mask underneath
5.0,Loved this purse! Perfect size and color for any outfit or occasion.
5.0,Perfect for wearing under shirts or sweaters instead of a cami
5.0,Cute. I loved it...
5.0,I bought these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them. They’re very comfortable and fit well.
5.0,Gift for friend. Loved it
5.0,Love the design. Very dressy.
5.0,I used to wear Doc Martens in my teenage years when goths were emerging more mainstream.  I loved my old Docs and wanted another pair to go with my uniform and came upon these.  They look lovely and I get complimented a lot on them.  I walk well in them and they don't make me feel achy like other heeled boots. Got to break them in more but I am glad I made this purchase
5.0,Cute! Arrived quicker than expected. As described and shown in photo. Will be good for a casual at home summer flipflop
5.0,Love it! Fits well looks amazing.
5.0,"Took this on 6 different airplanes to 3 countries in Europe. What a great bag! Many pockets, wheels spin around perfectly to make going through airports super easy. Very high quality handles and construction. Would buy again."
5.0,"I got this top in M - I'm a size 6 and it was a perfect fit.  It was comfortable, not so easy to iron out the wrinkles but it worked out just fine.  The black color isn't see thru - some people mentioned the lighter colors are too sheer but I just ordered one in white.  I plant to wear these with skirts and jeans.  I got so many compliments. this is a satisfied customer."
5.0,"I am so impressed with the quality of this dress. The fit was perfect, I'm 5' , 105 lbs and an xs fit. The material is heavier quality than I expected for the price and not see through at all. I'll order more from this company in the future."
5.0,"I liked these water socks/shoes so much I ordered 2 more pairs. My daughter really liked the colors and patterns and the soft and flexible material. I really like the rubber bottoms and even though the size of my daughter's feet are a little small, it fits well enough that it stays put and doesn't fall off. I haven't yet washed them so I'm not sure how well it will maintain it's form, but so far we are happy."
5.0,"Love it, so many different variations that you can use. Just so comfortable, doesn’t fog my glasses. I recommend this to my friends,,"
5.0,"Absolutely love this dress! Seems to run true to size - daughter wears size 14/16 and we got a size 16 for her. Adorable (we got it for the nutcracker ballet!), well made, love that it’s machine washable too."
5.0,This product is worth the hype.
5.0,"This necklace is charming and very tastefully made! Let me start with the chain. It is delicate but has little silver beads that add a touch of dazzle when they reflect the light. Even though the chain is delicate, it’s really strong and has a very secure clasp, and the 18” length is perfect for the size of the charm.<br /><br />The charm is absolutely adorable. It’s a little larger than I expected but not too large. The stone is a nice size and could easily be mistaken for a real stone. It is clear, shiny, and just the right shade of blue (I ordered the light blue) to be a topaz. The proportion between the stone and the dolphins is perfect. The dolphins are the feature and the stone just dresses them up a little. If you like dolphins, this is a perfect style of necklace. It works well for dressing up or for every day. I have a sterling silver dolphin bracelet that goes perfectly with this necklace. You’d never know that this is costume jewelry. So far it seems like it will be able to take quite some wear too. The only thing to be aware of is the metal. If you have allergies to certain kinds of metal, this may or may not work. It does seem to be a good quality, although I don’t think it is steel. Overall, it was well worth the purchase for someone who likes animals.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I purchased this necklace at a discount in exchange for my review. However, my review is my honest opinion and was not influenced in any way by anything other than my experience with the product."
5.0,"Feels good, not to tight and went on easily. Will purchase more, thanks."
5.0,Quality Thin style socks.
5.0,"These fit as expected,  perfect size. Wearing them to a 70's anniversary party."
5.0,great fit.  excellent product
5.0,Great quality hat and a great value.
5.0,I need to be able to use hands while wearing gloves and these definitely work. They are by no means a heavy play in the snow kind of glove but that's not what I wanted. Use these for taking the dog out and other reasonably quick tasks. These are the second pair I have bought. Keep 1 set in the car and 1 in the house. Would definitely buy again
5.0,"Bought large regular for 11 year old daughter. Fits great. Don't forget, this shirt has incredible stretch, so it might look small, but it's not once put on."
5.0,"My daughter loves it and was only going to wear it on the 4th of July, but has worn several times this summer."
5.0,keep buying... perfect product
5.0,Perfectly sized to hang beautifully
5.0,"Wife loves her new slippers. Fits good, non-slip soles work, feel comfortable. Well made and not cheap."
5.0,"This delicate little dress was a great surprise! Fabric seems to be of amazing quality, everything seems to be seamed to perfection.<br /><br />You do need to iron it for it to look its best! Other than that, exactly as pictured!"
5.0,Talla perfectamente me encanto
5.0,"I have another review that said the size was perfect. But I have to update that. I wore it on easter and with my broad back and 38D I will buying in the next size up. I used to be a large but after two kids I guess the girls need more space. So give yourself enough time to exchange or reorder if you get it.<br />It's beautiful and super comfy. The fabric is not too thin. Iron necessary though.  It's says cool iron, but it needs to be warmer to get the wrinkles out. I did hand wash first, than machine wash after Easter. It held up. But I hung it to dry just to be safe. It's easy for me to shrink anything I wash. Even if it's old and never shrunk before.<br /><br />I really needed one size up at the time. But after losing some lingering baby weight it fits fine."
5.0,Lire it
5.0,My daughter loves her tutu
5.0,"I purchased this to increase my visibility while riding a motor scooter. I wanted something lightweight for summer months. The jacket was just as described, easily seen with reflective design on the back. The fit was accurate. I am satisfied with my purchase."
5.0,Wears very cute!! Fits very nice.. can wear for business or pleasure.
5.0,"Soft, nice, simple and very beautiful.  My mother loves it.<br />Gladly surprised about the quality / price.  Thank you.<br />I washed the top, and hang dry. Perfect.<br />I would not take the chance to put it on the dryer, since the fabric is not thick, and the sleeves as very light."
5.0,The book bag is great quality and super cute.  The lunch bag is a little big and not very well insulated.  Also it doesn't have a side pouch on the lunch bag for a thermos which in turn has my child constantly forgetting her thermos at school. Wouldn't recommend for a preschooler because its a little heavy but is great for Elementary and beyond.
5.0,Virtually identical to the original.  Previously purchased a different color from a different brand but I like this one much better.
5.0,Using these for a prop at a murder mystery dinner. Items are as advertised.
5.0,Fits like it was made just for me!  Ordered a small and am so very happy!
5.0,Awesome item. Can be dressed up or down. Definitely a wardrobe favorite.
5.0,I bought these for my daughter and she loved them.  Very nice comfortable material.
5.0,This dress is light weight and super stretchy. I can't wait to wear it to Cabo. I am usually a size 12. Weigh 170 and Im 5'6&#34;. It hits right at my ankles.  The back is very sexy!! Love it
5.0,To hold my glasses
5.0,It was sooooo cute and sexy. My husband loves how it looked on me. I’m 5ft 152lbs and I bought a medium.
5.0,Color and detailed workmanship
5.0,I got this as a present for my mom. It is beautiful!
5.0,They are cosmic!
5.0,"What I like about the underwear was how stretchy the material is! The underwear fits perfectly. When I purchase items online, I am accustomed to material being cheap and the items of clothing fitting too small. I’m glad this was not the case!"
5.0,"I really like this ring. At first I thought it was going to be too big. Then I had troubles trying to close it- the bar that goes through your nose is pretty short, so it left me trying to click it together with the smallest bit of end poking through the other side. I almost gave up. But glad I did because once I got it close it brings the piece up a bit and it looks really cool. All I see is a crescent moon with 3 crystals in the middle. Like maiden mother crone. Triple goddess. Anyway, I haven’t experienced any irritation, no color changes. Comfortable to wear. I’ve had it in for about a week now no issues. I’d definitely recommend."
5.0,Totally recommend! Can’t wait to use😍
5.0,Great Matierial & fits great!
5.0,"Surprisingly comfortable and great for boat shoes. I was concerned that these wouldn't stay on correctly while going through my day, but they really are snug and comfortable the whole time wearing them. I'm not a huge fan of wearing shoes without socks so these fit the bill of getting that look with the comfort of socks."
5.0,I bought these as a gift for my sister and she LOVES THEM. She was happy to have so many to choose from and they look super cute!
5.0,"I’m guessing I’ve owned more pairs of slippers in my lifetime than the average person because I wear them all the time, almost all year-round. I live in the upper midwest, so other than during the warmest summer months, you’ll find me with slippers on my feet. Since I work from home, there are many days that I will wear a pair of slippers for eighteen hours a day. So, I tend to be picky.<br /><br />I’m never sure what to expect when I order online and it’s a brand I haven’t previously purchased. These slippers were a very pleasant surprise. They are soft on the outside as well as on the inside, and are tall enough to easily cover my ankles with a bit of a cute slouch to them. They have a sturdy sole that should hold up to a few trips outside (though I don’t wear mine outside) without being overly clunky and so skid-proof that they tend to get sort of stuck on the wood and tile floors. I hate that. I got the pink ones, and I love the pale pink color of them. They look almost like a cozy sweater. I wear a size 6 shoe, ordered the 5-6 slippers, and they are perfect for me, even with a pair of socks.<br /><br />These slippers are something I would buy again for myself and would also happily give as a gift. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"This was a super cute dress, perfect for a wedding we went to recently. I ordered a small, my normal size, and it fit just a tad bit too big in the waist. Otherwise, it was perfect!"
5.0,This pendant blings!! It is superior quality-very worth the price.  I recommend this product highly.
5.0,Nice quality for the price and I really liked this.
5.0,These are fabulous earrings that are great quality.
5.0,Just love 💘them
5.0,"Absolutely love this shirt,very warm and cozy."
5.0,I'm ordering some more
5.0,"I love this watch, I bought one about a year ago. Love the style and I always wear it with the bracelets it comes with. Always got compliments. I went to visit my family overseas and my sister in law loved it. I gave it ho her when I saw I could buy it again. I was very excited about having the watch again. However, I got a bit disappointed when it arrived without the bracelets this time, which are part of the charm of the watch and, as I said, I always wore them with the watch. I don't understand why the bracelets didn't come since it said it still come all together. Nevertheless, I love the watch and I guess I'll wear it now without the bracelets. It is very good quality I had not needed to change the battery yet to my old one. still looking almost the same as the day I bought it. Even without the bracelets I still give it 5 stars."
5.0,I love this. The material is soft and thick. Not transparent like others I've ordered from here. I will definitely be ordering more.
5.0,Exactly as described! They fit great and my kid says they’re super comfy.
5.0,"These take away all the dread of the period, period. I wish I had these when I was a teenager!! No more bulky pads or tampons. Total game changer! Great product!"
5.0,"Bought these in my usual size and they were a little big in the hips. No problem for me as I have a sewing machine. Now they’re perfect. I love them. I got the light grey. They are very stretchy and lightweight - perfect for our Louisiana summers.  Expecting the Navy today (in the next smallest size). Wish they had more colors but I’ll take these two on our Florida vacation with a variety of tops. It will make for easy packing. I’m 79 and have long outgrown shorts, so these are perfect - even if your legs aren’t. Love them!!!!"
5.0,Works great for outfits that you can wear a regular bra
5.0,Ordered Medium. Fit as expected. Love this shirt.
5.0,"I was somewhat concerned about this purchase after reading some of the previous reviews, but I am pleasantly surprised with the quality of the belt buckle. Everything about it appears to be high quality. Very well worth the price to please the Ghostbusters fan in you!"
5.0,Love love love this dress!
5.0,Bought these bands for my husband's new Samsung Galaxy watch and he absolutely loved it! He likes how he change them from gym wear to fancy wear. He mentioned it comes with a special tool that makes the bands easier to change. Would recommend the item.
5.0,Awesome sauce!
5.0,Very sturdy and convenient as well as neat to pack with cubes. Make things easy to find
5.0,"Product is as pictured. Great for everyday wear, but not thick for winter or snow."
5.0,Product is delightfully soft - washes well - does not shrink or pill.  Recomend highly
5.0,I wear a size 6-8 and I ordered the medium.  It is a perfect fit.  It is also a light weight sweater material that is perfect for Spring or Fall weather that doesn't call for a heavy sweater.
5.0,"I'm 5'1"" and usually wear a Petite 0 or 2 in both tops and bottoms.  The XS in this fit me perfectly.  It's light and comfortable for summer.  Comes just a couple of inches above my knee.  Love the fit and flare fit.  Easy little dress.  Fabric is soft and flowy.  It looks much more expensive than it is."
5.0,"The sunglass holders are great! Nice colors, strong and the right length. Well made product!<br />Gil"
5.0,I really liked the earrings- bought to wear with a Christmas shirt I have - matched perfectly- love them--
5.0,My husband loves his.  Light weight and he keeps it on his neck while not on his face.  His is alittle small but he is a large man.  So it's a perfect fit for an average person.  I suggest this mask for errands and restaurants.  Mine looks like a scarf when it's not on my face.
5.0,Took this to the hospital when I delivered my daughter. I still use it now at home. So comfortable.
5.0,Love the pretty colors and floral designs.
5.0,"The item came in a reusable storage bag which I liked. The scarf came zipped into the pocket which will make storage for summer easy. Very soft, comfortable and warm. The pocket is large. I would buy again."
5.0,I love the kitties! It is a beautiful tee that is very comfortable.
5.0,Love this wrap! Got it promptly!
5.0,Its perfect.
5.0,"I ordered these lingerie items for my wife as something simple yet sexy and inexpensive yet fun and of course as a male I love the idea of g strings and lacy underwear.  I received a few dollars off this product to review it and although the shipping took a little longer than Prime shipping, this lingerie is definitely very sexy. The fabric, while not the thickest, is probably on par with other products of its design, and it is certainly an intricate piece with fabric accents, although the front fabric coverage is not as substantial as some other products she has purchased.  Basically the product advertisement picture is an accurate description and I can appreciate the lacy design and definitely not inferior construction of the piece. Overall, very sexy, I certainly appreciate the good value of the entire package and would definitely buy it again."
5.0,Love the hat. I bought one for my 1 yr old and 3 yr old. Reviews said it ran small which is why I got it. My boys aren't huge and most toddler hats are too big. I just adjusted the hat down one size for my 3 yr old and a few sizes down for my 1 yr old. This should last them till thry fit in a normal size toddler hat which I'd say is a 3T and up.  This paw patrol hat is like a 2T and under size.
5.0,I needed gym shorts that would have a functional pocket and this does the trick.  They do run smallish.  Now when I started wearing them I was 5’1” and 160lbs.  I’m now 138 :) .So far they are holding up well to the gym and laundry.  I do hang them to dry.
5.0,Love it !!  Great buy the quality was strong
5.0,I love the length of the dress! It’s flattering for my postpartum tummy. I love it! Perfect for a date night
5.0,Great fit. Happy with item.
5.0,"For really nice, but the material is a little thin. More for summer"
5.0,"It is a thicker higher quality material than I was expecting. I saw that it ran large so I ordered a small and was afraid that it might be too little, but if fit great with some room...so definitely do size down. It is a great shirt to throw on with some jeggings. I may get more colors. I do find it odd but tolerable that the lace doesn't go around to the back."
5.0,Have in several colors and love. Super comfy.
5.0,Very Satisfied!!
5.0,"This is a cute beach dress/coverup.  Unfortunately, it came too late for me ."
5.0,"Nice and good belt, I like it"
5.0,Nice looking watch and good price
5.0,"Im 5'7 & 145lbs and ordered a medium..When I took it out the package I thought it wasn't gonna fit, but what do you know its a perfect fit! Its comfortable stretchy, exactly what I was looking for. 😄"
5.0,It’s almost perfect. One of my cards stick out but it’s not a big problem. I love this wallet some much and it’s different from my kitty wallet I had for years.
5.0,Pants are perfect for work. Fits true to size.
5.0,"Amazing quality, perfect bag strap for my LV."
5.0,It’s a cute outfit fits my 3 year old perfect
5.0,I have some tight slip on shoes and this shoe horn makes it some much easier to get them on.  Edges are not to sharp and the rubber coated handle adds stability. When putting shoes on.  BTW works on my basketball shoe that are tied and rarely untied  because I'm lazy and just want shoes on in a hurry.
5.0,"I've had bogs before for my son, and they've been amazing keeping his feet dry and warm. I always try to buy used but I couldn't pass up this deal! My son loves the  dino print!"
5.0,Cute shirt and great way to announce that it's your little one's big day. Nice quality as I've come to expect from Carters.
5.0,"Great quality and it doesn’t look fake or like costume jewelry. I love it, highly recommend and for the price what do you have to lose?"
5.0,I got this for my wife cause we are hue Red Sox fans and she loves turtle necks. She wears this all winter long and loves it.
5.0,Made things clearer.  Good value.  Nice style.
5.0,"I have a small head and they're snug fit, which I appreciate while running.  But I can imagine they could get uncomfortable if you had a larger head."
5.0,Fits perfectly!!!!!
5.0,Beautiful coloured leather. However the smell of the leather is terrible. Trying to air out but not working. I bought 3 as gifts. Hoping they air out by December.
5.0,Lightweight. Comfortable fit. Great shirt for exercising or running in.
5.0,"Directly shipped from Japan, the quality is superisely great!! Really happy! Well worth the money!"
5.0,These dresses are simply fabulous!!! I love the material and that they are soft and so comfortable to wear!!! I bought 7 different colors I love the so much!! True to size and the dress touches the floor just like the picture. I would love to model these for whomever company makes them. Thanks
5.0,Very cute for a longtime snoopy fan
5.0,These gloves were very comfortable. I bought them to go to NYC and they kept my hands warm. I didn’t have to remove them to use my phone.
5.0,"I do really like this shirt.  The only thing I wish it were just a little bigger, as it's smaller, more snug than I thought it would be.  I still can wear it, but I'd like it a little looser.  I'd say really check out the size chart to be sure before ordering.  It's a nice in between shirt, it keeps you warm, but not too warm.  I'd recommend this shirt, but suggest ordering a little bigger size, if you prefer a shirt with a little more room to it.  The seller and shipping were great.  Thank you."
5.0,"I love these earrings, the design is great and they are heavy enough to be weighted on your ears to not fall out but not too heavy. The only complaint I have is that they do not have my size in these, however I like them so much that I still wear them, even though they’re too small!"
5.0,"The jumpsuit is super cute ,I purchased a lg, I’m 5’6” and about 195lbs, bra 36ddd but it fits a tad bit too large At the hips and the crotch is a bit long , so I’ll have to get it tailored but although it’s a little too big I gave it 5stars because I love the style."
5.0,Arrived much earlier than quoted. Great quality & super cute.
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this mala!  The beads are beautiful and of the perfect size.  I keep it wrapped 4x around my wrist most of the time so I have it handy when I want to meditate or relax, and I've also worn it as a neclace.  Wherever I wear it I get many compliments.  It's durable - I'm really hard on things, when I love them I wear them constantly and I'm an outreach worker for the homeless, so I'm in some crazy places - and this mala is going right along with me!  It came beautifully packaged as well and quite promptly!  Namaste!"
5.0,I enjoy my pink pearls.
5.0,This is such a beautiful dress! I am 161lbs and 5.4inchs tall. Got the medium size and o my!!! How pretty! I got so many compliments when I wore it. And it is well made. The material is soft and nice to touch!
5.0,Muy bonitos  tal y como están en la foto
5.0,Excelente luce  muy elegante
5.0,Daughter  loves them
5.0,Super cute! And comfy strechy is always forgiving!
5.0,Great Price for 3 hats. Nice warm lining and my little man looks adorable and it's very affordable.
5.0,I bought this for my youngest daughters birthday (14).  She loves it.  The secret pocket was to small to comfortable get her iphone 5 in it or anything else she wanted to put in it but she loves everything else.  She has actually started carrying a purse since we got her this.  She had given up on finding one that worked for her.
5.0,"LOVE these!  Soft, warm, long enough and the &#34;stirrup&#34; just fits over your heel to hold them down around your ankle.  This allows no gaps, and when you put your foot into your shoe or boot, they don't bunch up.  They are thick enough so they are not see through so I can wear them with a short top.  The fit is very flattering and the fleece lining feels wonderful.  I like the high waist, and it doesn't roll down.  Good for any age.  If it helps for fit I'm 5'8&#34; and 138 lbs.  They are a one size, and it gives a size chart to assist.  They are pretty stretchy, but snug. After trying them on I ordered two more...they are only 12.99!"
5.0,Good Customer service
5.0,Really nice boot<br /><br />Measure your feet if you haven't lately.  It's amazing what you think vs. what it is.<br /><br />I ordered a 1/2 size up based on doing this and was not disappointed.
5.0,Slimmed up the middle and created a perfect shape.  Usually they are too short in the torso. This one was perfect.
5.0,"So comfy, the fabric is so soft. Colors and typing look great!"
5.0,"Highly functional practical umbrella. It's pretty small and can easily fit in most bags, while expanding to a big size. It seems to be able to handle wind. At this price, I definitely recommend this umbrella."
5.0,It came in a little bag and everything
5.0,Everything I wanted at a great price.
5.0,"Very cool item, looks like it will last a long time. Bold colors."
5.0,"Love the feel and how cute it is.  It does run a little long, but other than that a perfect top for Christmas!"
5.0,Very pretty and fit was perfect
5.0,This was a perfect size. Wanted something on the smaller size and different for my sister. She absolutely loved it!
5.0,Looked old timey i loved it
5.0,sometimes snags
5.0,This was a gift for my best friend. She lives it and it's even prettier than in the picture.
5.0,Love these headbands! They fit great and are so cute. They wash really well too!!
5.0,"I love it, I have little fingers, so it works well. I’ve been searching for something like this for a long time to work with my curling wand. Because I can’t work with gloves, so this works so well for me."
5.0,This shirt is amazing.  The colors are very vivid & the shirt is well made.  I would be careful of the size.  I ordered the small for my 4 year old grandson and it will surely be too large.  But I'm sure he will love it since he is a huge sonic fan.
5.0,Bought this for a beach vacation.  Nice shirt!
5.0,"Bought this as a gift for someone special, which didn't stay on very....ok,  too much info here!!  Just buy this for your best girl, she will be happy and surely you will as well.  And that is why we were late to the concert.  Best girl?, my grandfather used to say that to me, I guess he thought I had a harem or something, he was from the old country, so they had their sayings there, he meant well.  It got me the stink eye from the girlfriend at the time."
5.0,"We ordered this to dress up like a little granny.  We have continued to use it for about 4 more months.  It is good quality fabric that is thicker, not sheer and it has not pilled.  The lace has maintained its shape after several gentle washes."
5.0,"Wife loved it, good sizing & style. Shipping good"
5.0,Love these tshirts
5.0,"Super Cute. it is hard to find sunglasses that are actually &#34;oversized&#34; and these ones are huge, but in a good way :) I love them. The pink color is super pretty too :)"
5.0,"Used this when I went to Vegas. I had a budget for each day. At the end of the day, anything I had left from that day's budget went into the bank. I came home with money when my friend did not. Definitely a wise investment."
5.0,My little girl needed to dress as a pig. So I bought this to go with her pink skirt. It fit just right.
5.0,It's so cute! And good quality. I like it.
5.0,Super cute. Worked perfect for a performance costume
5.0,"Ralph Lauren is no joke.  Whether you prefer a nice casual day, or want to throw one of these nice shirts with dress pants and shoes, you are always looking good.  I would recommend that more athletic build men like myself go a size up if you are not slim fit."
5.0,"Used this for a costume. &#34;It's called a satchel, Indiana Jones wears one&#34;"
5.0,Came in the normal shipping bag and scarf came folded in a nice/neat ziplock type bag. The print is beautiful and vibrant. It’s also just what we ordered: an infinity scarf. Thank you for a great product.
5.0,Wonderful watch with excellent packaging for a gift.
5.0,Product is high quality so soft good for sleep it covers till knees I love it
5.0,Beautiful. Make sure you follow the size chart. I will be buying many more of these. I typically wear a size 12 but in this make I bought the 4x. Don't be fooled by the numbers. Just go according to the manufacturers size chart.
5.0,Several compliments
5.0,Bought this for my 60s theme birthday party ! Size Medium fit great I’m 5”3 and 150 lb.  Love it so much that I’m ordering it in other colors!
5.0,For some reason I was expecting this to run a little small so I ordered up. I'm 5'11 and about 180 fairly athletic frame with a little bit around the middle and the large is just too big. Going to try shrinking it and hopefully that might fix it. Otherwise the material seems great.
5.0,"Got this watch for my toddler and she loves it! She is still too young to operate all of the features and that's totally fine with me, she loves turning it on and off to see the dolly's as she calls them and swiping her little finger on the display."
5.0,"The watch is exactly as advertised a d arrived on time. I can't speak to durability, as it only just arrived, but it came already set to the correct time in my time zone, which seemed interesting."
5.0,I read the reviews so I purposely picked a bigger size. My baby wore this in hawaii and it was great that we never had to worry about her getting a sunburn underneath the suit and it kept her nice and cool when she was not wet. It did dry pretty quickly and was easy to change her diaper with the snaps. I also prefer the plastic snaps they are super nice. The hood is purposely big so it can give her face some shade.
5.0,"I love Sock It To Me Socks!  They don't stretch, fall down or lose their shape.  They are super comfy too!"
5.0,Snow & teens in MT<br />Keeping me warm!
5.0,Fit good on your face
5.0,Quality mask! My daughter loves hers.
5.0,"No surprises. Leather looks good, and it fits the prescription pad well. There's a spot for business cards, as well."
5.0,This dress fit a bit weird. I’m 36c 30 waist and 135 lbs and purchased a M. The chest compartment was a bit short. Was not flattering at all.
5.0,gorgeous band.
5.0,Fabric was not what I was expecting. Quality doesn't seem bad over all. But I'm super disappointed that when I pulled it out it has a green spot on it. UPDATE I contacted the seller and they were amazing. Sent me a new hat no issue and the new one is perfect no issues at all.
5.0,"Cute and light dress, perfect for summer."
5.0,"I've only worn it once but fit was good, rolls/folds well for above the ear wear, and covers ears nicely when rolled down... expect it to perform well during deer season."
5.0,Best product ever!!! Keep her eyes safe and she enjoys watching the water fall safely in front of her face!!!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:262d29df28dedbd938eab8219906c10]] Me encanto me quedo un poco chico pero hermoso
5.0,"Very nice style, my wife liked."
5.0,Great and simple looking key ring. I like it and it feels real sturdy too. Would recommend if you're looking for one.
5.0,"My Corso has yanked on this so many times with his claws and it is still hanging on to my wrist lol! I am impressed that it hasn't broken yet! It's pretty heavy, sturdy and shiny for the money. I would definitely buy this again! Well worth it"
5.0,Very comfortable very well made I'm very happy with them
5.0,Lost a hat similar to this that I had for years.  Love this hat though.  Prompt shipping.
5.0,"I’ve had this landyard for almost two years and it is still going strong. It’s warped a bit where I’ve stretched it out at the top just playing with it, but I love this lanyard. I’ve kept it on my keys since day 1 almost two years ago.<br /><br />One thing to know that I didn’t when I purchased it: it’s stretchy!! It’s an elastic-type lanyard, so when you pull on it (or get it caught on something like my klutzy self does), it stretches instead of breaking."
5.0,"Honestly, at this price its really no comparison with the Apple band!  I am sure the Apple is more difficult to make, but from the perspective of feel and look, i think its exactly the same!  I purchased this for everyday wear, so not really looking for it to look expensive, but i think it does look like the Apple band!!!"
5.0,Love these.  Second pair!
5.0,It's very nice...good size! I love to show it off to my friends!!
5.0,Perfect for games!
5.0,"Love the dress, is a little longer than expected but very nice material"
5.0,I love my new sun glasses. They fit perfectly over my glasses and I don't look like a bug. They are so pretty the purple design looks amazing. And I see better with them on!!
5.0,"Great dress, much nicer fabric than I even expected for price. Very flattering and well made. I'm 5'9&#34; and it's the perfect length"
5.0,"I haven’t put them on yet , but it’s what I needed."
5.0,I wore it on my honeymoon and it fit me well. My hubby loved it and he couldn’t stop taking pictures of me in it.
5.0,The nose clip and the ear adjustments help the mask fit snug to your face.  The pocket makes it easy to put the filter in.
5.0,Awesome quality
5.0,Worked great and really took my recent Santa performances over the top
5.0,Good quality shirt outstanding
5.0,Is adjustable and easy to wear
5.0,Great price and great fit---my credit cards fit easily inside the pockets
5.0,I absolutely love the purses!!!  The large one is just the right size to carry everyday and the medium one is perfect for when you just need a few things.  The small one for me is a great makeup case.  I would definitely recommend buying these purses.  The quality is far better than I expected!  Love them!!!
5.0,"If you are on the fence, buy it/don’t buy it….choose BUY IT!  This watch is stunningly beautiful and keeps time down to the second.  One of the best buys I’ve ever made!"
5.0,It looked better in person! So happy with it!
5.0,"Well made, excellent quality for the price point. Perfect size for everyday use."
5.0,Nice gloves. The large size is a little small but I did not want to order extra large. I know the gloves will fit better with wear and time.
5.0,5ft 4 inches. 180lbs and i bought a large.  Fits perfect and looks gorgeous
5.0,My daughter loves that she can put these shoes on herself very easily.
5.0,I am in danger of wearing out the material of this sweater already because I have worn it so much. It is so flattering and comfortable. The blue it sharp and deep and the neck piece gives the appearance of wearing a loose scarf. It's my go to outfit when I want to look cute while still being comfortable. Just throw it over a pair of leggings and wear some tall boots.
5.0,"Received them earlier than time frame given,  which is great."
5.0,I bought the cheaper one for my son a couple years ago and upgraded to 14k since he's been responsible with it. It's open back (not solid) but it's nice and lightweight so it hangs on his chain perfectly. it's also one of the best looking fleur de lis charms I've seen on amazon
5.0,Great product!  Bought one of these in the past and it broke after only a few hats.  This one has very solid construction and I've already used it to stretch a hat that had shrunk over the past couple of years.  Very happy with this purchase.
5.0,It's light and comfortable.
5.0,Sporty & great fit
5.0,"I wear these earrings almost daily! I have a pretty severe allergic reaction to most metals, but these have been great! I’ve had no problems with them or the metal at all!"
5.0,This suit is very nice. Extremely happy with the buy.
5.0,"The designs are simply unique and fantastic! I have one pair myself and bought these for my daughter. The box is lovely but we received it all torn this time, maybe that's why they were on sale?<br />Anyways, shoes are really comfortable and have a great quality.<br />Love them all!"
5.0,Love these shades happy I bought them came with hard case which is nice
5.0,It's a wonderful wireless  bra that feels super comfortable while providing nice aesthetic look.  I hope it wakes and holds p well over time but  so far very pleased and order in different colors.
5.0,Very comfortable top to wear now that I spend most of my days at home
5.0,"I love these earrings. They are beautiful and are not too heavy or too light. I like this weight because heavy earrings are uncomfortable as they pull down on your earlobes, but super light earrings just scream cheap to me. So this is a nice balance of being made well but without being too heavy. I I like the size too, it is big enough that someone could tell they are feathers but not obnoxiously big. These are basically &#34;goldilocks&#34; earrings. They are justttt right! They add the perfect addition to any outfit. I like that I can wear these to work and not have to worry about them being cheap-looking or obnoxiously big as to be not &#34;work appropriate.&#34; They add a fun flare to my outfit while allowing me to still look classy and professional. I also can wear them out with my girls, so they are super diverse as they can be dressy or casual depending on your outfit. Like I said, these are the &#34;goldilocks&#34; earrings. They are great! :)<br /><br />*I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review*"
5.0,These are awesome. My boyfriend and I love them. They send you extra string too incase you want to remove some beads to resize it. How nice!
5.0,"USUALLY WEAR SIZE 30, HAD TO RETURN FIRST 3, REALLY LIKE HOW EASY IT WAS TO RETURN.  THE 32 FITS ALMOST PERFECT, AFTER ONE WASH.  LIKE THEM SO MUCH BOUGHT 3 MORE, NOW HAVE  6, SO HOPEFULLY THEY WILL STAND UP TO WASH AND WEAR, THAT'S THE REAL TEST"
5.0,"This skirt fits like a dream. It flatters all the right places, and the colors aren't dull!! Fantastic skirt, I am ordering another in black!!! Definitely would recommend to a friend!!"
5.0,"Super soft, very comfortable. I want to buy again"
5.0,"Very comfortable watchband. Was slightly long so I had to remove three links. The pdf looks a little scary, but the process is actually quite straightforward. Highly recommended."
5.0,LOVE THEM!  GREAT DEAL WITH THE SOCKS TOO!
5.0,I had so much fun with this costume.  I went to my brother/sister in laws for Halloween.  They had no idea who I was.  Laughed<br />till I hurt.  I'm a rather small person...5'2&#34; and 110 lbs.  It fit PERFECT!
5.0,"I starred using this under my shoulder pads in ice hockey, after I sustained a rib injury. It fits great, and protects well, especially against cross-checks to the back in front of the net."
5.0,"Fits perfect, the blue is dark as shown"
5.0,I use them as undershirts for work the work perfectly.
5.0,I’m beyond impressed with how forgiving and flattering this dress is! I receive multiple compliments every time that I wear it.  I’m order 3 more for our trip this summer to Europe.  It packs great and can easily be dressed up or down to meet your needs.  I’m 5’4 and the length is perfect.
5.0,Absolutely love these wish I'd have seen them sooner
5.0,I love them!!
5.0,This was the real deal!!! I have a Marvel Prop collection and this fit right in. It's as close as I'm ever going to get to the real Eye of Agamatto
5.0,"Great fit, great look and great workout short!"
5.0,This is great bracelet for someone who backs the blue. I’ve had it for a few months now and wear it every day and it still looks great. Only negative thing is that it’s made and ships from China.
5.0,This dress looked amazing on me! It was a little baggy in some areas but the compliments kept rolling in. My cousin loved it so much that I gave it to her and plan on buying another for myself
5.0,"Not only is this comfortable, but it is forgiving since I’ve gained 15 pounds over the pandemic."
5.0,Perfect socks for no show on low profile shoes
5.0,My 20 year old daughter (with long single braided hair) loves the hats...
5.0,I get so many compliments on this dress every time I wear it!
5.0,Love the little fringe on nech and cuffs. Very cute and fir perfect
5.0,This ring is beautiful and perfect size too.  You will not be disappointed in your purchase.  Excellent eye catching ring.  The diamond are very sparkly!
5.0,Very comfortable. Perfect. Many compliments on the look
5.0,"a very comfortable dress, I am 5'6 wear x large in all essence should wear bigger but have always bought x large , I am busty and fits perfect. would fit if you were not busty. need in all colors"
5.0,Love this hat. Great quality construction and sooooo cute. Worth every penny!
5.0,I usually wear between medium & large After reading reviews I ordered large & fit well
5.0,LOVE IT! Super pretty and comfy!!
5.0,It fits well it’s good looking.
5.0,I love the fit. I’m a big sunglasses girl.
5.0,"This shirt fits perfectly and it's very comfortable. I ordered size medium, I weigh 137, bust 36D. Will definitely be purchasing more in different styles. :)"
5.0,More beautiful in person
5.0,"Love them very comfortable, all though a little long and the color will run, if you lay them out to dry make sure it's on something that you don't mind getting stained"
5.0,"Wore this for my bridal shower, was a huge hit! Looked so cute and fit perfectly. I'm usually a small, but the sizing scale made me nervous so I opted for a Medium and it was an absolute perfect fit. I got so many compliments! :)"
5.0,These are nice socks and so comfortable
5.0,"These socks are just what I was looking for. Wool socks to wear with my dress pants at work. These are soft, not too thin and not too thick. I believe they will last a while. Will buy again."
5.0,"Very warm, 6-8&#34; of snow and my feet stayed perfectly dry"
5.0,Very nice.  Just what I expected and I will use this one daily.
5.0,I like they don't hurt our ears and individually wrapped to keep them clean.
5.0,most comfortable and best polarized I have had in many years and really a good price
5.0,Very good looking for the prize! This will be my new summer watch!
5.0,"It arrived fast. Fit well, giving my son plenty of room to grow as I had wanted when I ordered it. The fabric feels nice and the seams feel well built, I have run into no glaring problems as of yet with the jacket. Color is what I wanted, over all perfect for what I needed. It took the heat of an iron well and held up to my additions. Now Simon will pierce the heavens in a stylish fleece jacket."
5.0,Very well built hat. Fits great
5.0,The dress fit perfectly! Beautiful and comfortable
5.0,"If you're looking for a solid pair of flops, then be sure to check out these from Utenag. Made (almost) entirely of rubber (except for the inner lining of the straps) so you can use around (or in) water, in the yard, at the beach, etc.. They are also form fitted to your arch. So you will have some decent support. Very squishy! And once broken in they will be super comfortable to wear for long periods. If I have to make one suggestion (as other reviewers pointed out) it would be to GO DOWN ONE SHOE SIZE. Other than that, a very nice pair of flip flops!"
5.0,"Better than expected.  Great for summer golf when the Aussie chiller is wet.  Good for cold weather also.<br />Due to some pre-cancer spots on the top of my ear, my doctor recommended I get a full brim hat for my golf (I walk 3-4 times a week) game.  It has worked out great.  Stays put on windy days when wet, big advantage over many full brim hats."
5.0,Very styleliish!  Thanks
5.0,My husband absolutely loves it and he looks great in red I just found out
5.0,"The want is super sturdy, and the scarf is super soft"
5.0,"Yayyy love these! Perfect looking and quality, especially for the price! (Btw, the stand is from Amazon too, only $4!)"
5.0,"Finally found the perfect fit and quality.  After trying many masks this past year, I took a chance on these. I love everything about them - fit, material, workmanship, colors, comfort, etc. etc.  I wash by hand and air dry so I had very little shrinkage.  They mold under my chin and are snug at the sides.  The pocket for the charcoal filter is a great extra safety feature.  I'm buying more to share with family and friends."
5.0,"Even premier Tham the picture,  thanks"
5.0,Love this dress - wore to my daughters wedding.
5.0,"This dreas is beautiful, I usually wearan Xl so I ordered Xl. It was a tad bit loose fitting. Would have been best in L. But overall its a great buy"
5.0,I bought these for my wife. The picture looks exactly like our little Pomeranian!
5.0,"Pendant is tastefully designed, and functions well. IIts surface is slightly smaller than that of a dime."
5.0,"Fits well and comfortable, I’m glad people are making stylish masks ."
5.0,"This is such a great solution to an ongoing problem. These work so much better than other ring sizers/guards I have tried. Comfortable and invisible, you can't tell you have one on!"
5.0,You don't buy these for thickness necessarily it's more of a office thing. My son loves them.
5.0,I love the soft cushy feel of this case.  And of course there's the red slippers!  Cleaning cloth is great.
5.0,By far my favorite glasses and the price is incredibly reasonable<br />I’m a huge fan and customer for life
5.0,"AWESOME for the money. I bought these for my 12 year old son as a first pair of sunglasses and these are GREAT. They are more for fashion that blocking the sun., but they ARE great for that extra pair to keep in the car."
5.0,Nice quality material.
5.0,Super cute and comfy! I love that they have astronaut wear for little girls.
5.0,This top is very flattering and works well for casual or business casual.  Ordering more colors!
5.0,Absolutely love these dresses.
5.0,Great gift for my daughter who is a dental assistant. Very nice and great value
5.0,Love this watch<br />Great price too!
5.0,Good tanks. I did return them because they were a little on the tight side for my size. (I know they are supposed to be tight) Possibly order a size up if you want a little wiggle room
5.0,"I have purchased nightgowns from this manufacture before and loved them, but this nightgown is a vast improvement. The fit is perfect including the length, super warm and snuggley. The most awesome feature are the two pockets. This nightgown is well worth the price paid.<br />I love it!<br />Perfect""5"""
5.0,This is a great item. My googles get crushed and scratched so these will save me a lot of money and aggravation!
5.0,"Bought this for my little cousin, she absolutely loved this, she won't take them off now. Great gift."
5.0,Excellent quality.  Exactly as described.  Great for pool or day trips.
5.0,"I think this looks the best with a black swimsuit underneath. I love that it is one size fits all, because I can share with my daughter (and we are not the same size). It is soft, comfortable, and feels of high quality."
5.0,Bought for my daughter she loved them and got several compliments.
5.0,I love these bare trap boots. They are awesome and cozy.
5.0,"This is now my second watch bought from this company. I liked the first one so much, I decided to buy this style as well.<br />The details on this watch look very sharp and like an minimalist expensive watch. Sporty, yet classy at the same time. I prefer the metal mesh style band instead of the typical leather. Looks great as a dress watch when going out or getting dressed up. Great buy for your money. Watch only weighs 2.5 ounces and very light on the wrist.<br />The only thing I don't like, is it gets fingerprints easily on the glass watch face & I have to wipe it off from time to time to keep it clear & shiny.<br />Nicely gift boxed as well. Lots of detail in the watch & packaging. Very satisfied with my purchase."
5.0,Shirt is great quality and fit as expected
5.0,It fits my wallet perfectly and allows a few more cards and photos too.
5.0,Fast delivery. Beautiful ring! Love it
5.0,"Really Nice quality for the money. Less than half the price of an Everest. Fits the case perfectly. Buckle and strap are way too big and ugly, don’t fit the watch at all. Normally I wouldn’t think much of an aftermarket strap but since this is only fits a black bay, they should really fix that. I originally swapped in a buckle and rubber strap holder from a Barton strap. Way better. I’ve since shaved 2mm off and installed a Tudor deployant clasp. Fits so much more comfortable than original bracelet."
5.0,A gift. They loved it!
5.0,GREAT Work Watch 😀
5.0,Fast delivery and great product
5.0,The costume is for my grandson and it fit great!
5.0,Love this matching hat set for my little one and I. We did a photoshoot in then and they photographed really well. Great product for the price.
5.0,Light. Convenient.  Good light filter
5.0,Purchased for my 10 year old daughter and it was a hit!  One of the flowers fell off when we first got it but just glued back on and no problem.  Super cute item for a unicorn lover.
5.0,Its very soft and stretchy yet holds its shape very well and can be worn several different ways.  I personally wore it today while i worked out.  It works well at holding your hair back and out of your face. I used to have long hair but recently cut off 6 inches so my hair is quite short now and almost always ends up going in my face and getting on my nerves lately.But this headband prevents it from doing so now so i couldn't be happier.  I also use it for when i want to wash my face and put on my make up as well because it pushes my hair back and out of the way and holds it in place well . I like the way they stiched it you can use it as a turban style look or turn it around for a standard looking headband and make it larger or thinner so its very versatile.  I love it and plan on ordering more :) I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
5.0,Very cute and love the fact that it zips! Great deal considering the ones at AU bookstore were 4x as much.
5.0,Looks like a jersey
5.0,Xcellent
5.0,Luv it!!!  Very comfortable and still flattering.  I need more colors!!
5.0,We bought this pretty bracelet for our daughter as a graduation gift and she loves it
5.0,"This was a birthday gift and it was well worth the price! Beautiful, elegant, and very sophisticated we both loved it!"
5.0,I love these. I tend to over pack but these kept me organized. I WOULD order again.....need to see if they make shoe bags
5.0,To keep feet warm in the house.
5.0,Nice an soft shirt. Going back for another color
5.0,Love this product. It also came with a 2 yr warranty.  Cant beat that.
5.0,"Good product, fits exactly"
5.0,"Oh My Gosh! Ok, I wear a US Plus Size 32W or 4X/5X and I ordered the largest size 3X. So I knew it would be tight. BUT, I actually find this to be VERY comfortable. Because it's ribbed and stretchy, it just hugs the curves and then flares out at the bottom. It's THE PERFECT length for my bottom layer. (I ALWAYS wear layers.)  But I wouldn't feel bad just wearing this by itself!<br /><br />Like I said, it's not really tight because it is really stretchy and just hugs you. It's SOOO COMFORTABLE! This is DEFINITELY one of my new favorites! So happy with it!<br /><br />I purchased this Staringirl Short Sleeve Slim Fit Dress Top at a discounted price in order to test it out and provide my honest and unbiased review.  I am not paid by nor am I affiliated with the company in any way. As with all my reviews, if something stops working, gives an adverse reaction or changes in any way with continued use I will absolutely update this review."
5.0,Great thanks
5.0,"I bought these because it turns out I'm allergic to the non-medical grade silicone bands. As someone with very sensitive skin, these are a great option. They are easy to swap out, and this set works great as a neutral range. I dress business professional for work, and being able to coordinate the fitbit bands with my outfits is a great option. Love these. Would buy in more colors if I needed them."
5.0,"So cute, the package comes with so many bands."
5.0,I love this dress it fits perfect and is really pretty
5.0,"I love how soft these socks are. I wear them all throughout the house and during cold months they keep my feet warm. they're fuzzy and seem woven so the material has a few air gaps but it‘s just breathable. I bought these to keep my feet warm in the winter while sleeping. I didn’t want socks with a tight elastic on top because that’s not healthy. These socks are soft, comfortable .They’re cute too!"
5.0,I purchased this as a gift for my wife for our trip to Colorado. It was very warm and fit her very good. It did not rise up on her ears the way some hats seem to do... SHE LOVED IT!!!
5.0,Beautiful I can't wait to wear it to an up coming event
5.0,So pretty on and fits great
5.0,Wear it always even though I'm in Texas.
5.0,Love love love this dress. Girlie enough without feeling too overdressed. It’s so comfortable you won’t want to take it off.
5.0,Nice buckle with some weight to it. Awesome accessory for Zep fans.
5.0,"These computer anti glare glasses are great for all blue light technical gadgets that you may use; computers, cell phones,tablets, games,etc. They protect the eyes so you feel less fatigued. At first I was skeptical but after using them I can definitely feel the difference. We spend so much time on the computer these days, it makes a lot of sense to use them. I highly recommend them; not only for relief from fatigue, but also for the future health of your eyes."
5.0,Outstanding watch great price. I have been wearing these watches for over 35 years
5.0,"I ordered these to prevent air travel-related swelling. I have thick calves, so I ordered a size based on my calf circumference, and I was worried that the foot might be big.  These fit great (both on the feet as well as my calf), were comfortable, and certainly less boring than the usual compression sock.  Even after a full day of air travel and minimal opportunities to move around, my feet looked great the next day."
5.0,"I ordered 1 pair to try.  after wearing these socks i immediately bought 4 more pair.  The socks are true to fit and when they say strong compression, that is a true statement.  i tried several other brands and nothing compares to these.  with my large frame they are fair amount of work to get on,  but very comfortable to wear.  they work very well to keep my leg swelling under control.  I would recommend this product to anyone needing good quality compression socks.  the material is of excellent quality.  the compression is consistent from toe to top, i would even go so far as to say closer to 30 than 20mmHg."
5.0,"It is nice material, usually when I buy shirts online they are thin, this one is not and is perfect for the summer.  Love the design.  I am 5'5'' 150lbs and the medium was good."
5.0,I love it it’s great to dispel negativity
5.0,"Just as expected, perfect Alex and Ani bracelet."
5.0,"Small for kids, but enjoying the print."
5.0,"I like this top a lot, but it does make me look like of shapeless. Is probably just a size too big for me, though. Overall it's very comfortable and cute."
5.0,Nice pouch.  I wish it was a little bit bigger.
5.0,"Great pants, literally the best tactical pants I could ask for especially for the price. I bought these for work although they are the wrong shade of navy, I need LAPD NAVY, if they would make these in LAPD NAVY I would buy 3-4 of them. Awesome pants."
5.0,Love the comfort and just waiting for cold weather.
5.0,"It works really well, but it does feel a bit stuffy."
5.0,These run a bit small but they're really pretty
5.0,These caps are fun. My staff and patients also comment on the cap of the day
5.0,Very nine quality items
5.0,"Good quality, and great service, I give it a 5 star.."
5.0,It is very light and looks good on the face.  Everyone around liked it. The price for the sunglass is very reasonable.<br />I willhighly recommend it to those who like John lennon style round sunglass.
5.0,Product as described; pleasure doing business with.
5.0,Suitable for spring/ autumn weather..<br />The fabric is of good quality..
5.0,"Earrings were great price and nice quality.  Purchased as a gift, hope they like it as much as I do."
5.0,"Not only is it a cool baseball fan's gift, it is a quality front pocket card holder that is very similar to one I've own in the past so it's even better than before. Best gift ever!"
5.0,Great gloves for great price and fast delivery!
5.0,It’s cute. Tight on my wrist! Works great.<br /><br />Edit to update a few months later. Stretched out and was loose on my wrist and would constantly catch on things. I had to remove it for good eventually. I wore it daily.
5.0,This shirt is just as it is online...GO GET one!! I did;)
5.0,Love it thinking of ordering another so when the one I have gets old I have another lol.
5.0,"Love! Best no show/no slip socks EVER! Super lightweight, and best of all they never slip!"
5.0,Perfect Length!  Just what I was looking for! They are very light and comfortable.  I can wear them all day without having to take them off.  They dont pinch.
5.0,my husband absolutely loves these shirts . perfect workout fit !!
5.0,"Both very cute and comfortable socks.  I know I will be able to get a lot of use from them, no matter the occasion.  I recommend these adorable socks."
5.0,Awesome shirt. I wear it all the time.
5.0,Bought for my 7 year old. She loves this better than traditional face masks. She was willing to wear this while on a safari type tour in Louisiana summer heat and never complained or tried to take it off.
5.0,I purchased these socks for my wife and she loves them.
5.0,I bought one size larger and shrank it down. Washed & dried HOT.
5.0,"Jack Wolfskin has a great quality, this sweater is not any worse but I expected a little thicker material. I would say it's mid-weight, a great layer underneath a coat. Prices change on Amazon daily, so if you want to purchase something, it's a great idea to put it in your cart and check prices daily."
5.0,Love them.  I have very sensitive ears cannot wear cheap earrings.  Always have to get 18k gold post.  Thought I would give these a try.  Been wearing them for a week now with no problems.  Will buy more.
5.0,"It's great. My toddler loves it. It slightly oversized but I expected that. The apron is as long as she is lol. The color is great, vibrant and as blue as the picture."
5.0,Beautiful soft and comfortable dress.
5.0,Absolutely amazing!
5.0,Real cute and my 6 yr old loves it
5.0,This is an awesome cross! I don’t want to take it off! The only problem I have is that the chain is too short!
5.0,Fits great and love the color!
5.0,So cute love the fit and color
5.0,"They’re easy to wash since they have no padding. They fit a bit on the snug side, but they’ll hold you business in place so you can be active without the added distractions of chest inertia."
5.0,You can't go wrong very nice watch
5.0,"I wanted a bag for the small shoulder bag trend. I had bought another one previously and it looked so cheap. I have Saint Laurent wallet so I wanted that wasn't obviously a cheap bag. I was pleasantly surprised  to see it wasn't cheap looking at all. It also holds a lot more than I expected it would. I wouldn't say anyone would think it to be a pricey bag but not the low price from an Amazon purchase. It's comfortable on your should and doesn't fall down on my shoulders, even on my coat. It's very cute and is exactly what I was looking for."
5.0,My husband loves it. He's very hard to find belts for since he wears a 29 but this one fits him perfectly!
5.0,Very Nice Cap.
5.0,"Fit my 8 yr old boy perfectly. Looked really good with his outfit as ring bearer! For reference, he wears size 2 with sneakers. We went with a 1 with the dress shoes, but you can go 2 if you want it to last an extra year.No complaints here. 5-Stars!"
5.0,Haven't used yet but great quality.  Sturdy and elegant for prom.
5.0,Great price and quality. Fits true to size.
5.0,"My kid often loses stuff in his pockets. These offer zippers to help keep everything in, and it's comfortable, too."
5.0,"I needed something I could see while running. Most watched have small numbers, but this one is great. It IS a big watch. I have small wrists so it wouldn't work for me to use all the time, I use it for running. Easy to set. No bells or whistles ... just what I wanted. Great watch."
5.0,"A while to ship, but cute!"
5.0,Have only worn once... but got a lot of compliments.  Can't beat the price
5.0,"Bought on sale for 12.50.  Looks great.  Little stiff but expect leather will relax after I wear a while.  Great deal, half or a third what I planned to pay."
5.0,"My research for a dress like this was extensive ( at Amazon and in other stores), before finally deciding on this one. So happy that I did. I bought the black one, which is true black (not dark gray like in the pic above). I'm 5'3, 145 pounds, and the XL is just perfect. The fabric is amazing quality very soft and  the pockets are an excellent addition. It made you look taller and thinner. The only flaws it had, was to be a little loose under the arms, something very simple to fix.<br />Another good thing was the time, despite the long time the estimate of arrival was, it took only 9 days to receive it.<br />I'm definitely buying more of this.<br />Thank you so much!!"
5.0,I am 5'4 and 155 lbs. I ordered a medium and it was too large. The skirt is stretchy so it had a lot of give even though i have wide hips and buttocks. Ultimately I am returning it not because there was anything wrong or I didn't like about the item. I just decided to go with a dress that had a lower neck line.
5.0,My daughter loves it and won't take it off
5.0,"I purchased these on a whim because I've always wanted wood frame sunglasses and the price was perfect for ""not sure how they'd look on me"". First off, they look good. Not great because I have a large noggin. They're just a little on the small side, but I'll still sport them around. And because they have the spring hinges, they still fit on my giant head comfortably. If they offered them in a slightly larger size, I would definitely purchase them. Lenses are clear and polarized as advertised."
5.0,Cool look last long
5.0,These are beautiful and move freely as you walk. I have received several compliments.
5.0,Love it omg best phone case every

5.0,"It looks like it might run small, but I haven' given it to the skinny person I bought it for.  Very nice sweater....soft."
5.0,I bought this shirt for my friend. Super cute. Looks like the picture
5.0,"Excellent bag. Tough material. Seems to be very well made. I anticipate it lasting a long time.<br /><br />However the product in the picture is not accurate. I ordered the 23” anticipating an additional pocket on side for shoes/wet clothes, as that is what is pictured for all bag sizes. However the additional side pocket is only available in the 30”.<br /><br />With that being said, because of the quality of the bag I will not be returning. I have purchased a small wet clothes bag to put in bag after workouts. Not a big deal."
5.0,"These pants are amazing.  I do not like things extra tight.  So if you do it is possible you would prefer the medium.  But I have been teaching yoga 15 years and these stay comfortable and don’t roll down or squeeze me out of them, NO TIGHT ELASTIC BAND AT TOP.  I absolutely LOVE the print.  And you cannot beat the price!  I bought 4 more the next day.  I will update if the comfort level changes.  But for the price you will not be sorry.  I would have to buy 8 of these to equal what I used to pay for one pair."
5.0,I get so many compliments on these zippered masks!
5.0,"Love this dress,  especially considering the price! Super soft and comfy."
5.0,"It doesn't  look cheap at all.<br />looks very well , like if it going to last for long time."

5.0,"Got this for my wife for her new car, she loves it, very happy the way it fits and looks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5.0,"Goldtoe has always been the best,  and that continues to be the case. If you want soft, comfortable socks that keep your feet at the right temperature,  look no further."
5.0,Perfect just perfect.
5.0,Nicley designed.
5.0,Loved the mask but the rubber smell wasn't to pleasant
5.0,he loves them and he's very  picky . I need say no more worth every penny.
5.0,"It is so beautiful, I love that they are two separate pieces and you could choose to wear one or the other or both at the same time. I just hope it does not change it’s beautiful color."

5.0,It’s better than I expected
5.0,I’m in love with the keychain and received many compliments for it. There’s not much else to say lol.
5.0,"This is the ONLY way that I like to put my hair up in a bun .... it works GREAT, is EASY, and STAYS PUT !!!  These are super little simple devices !"
5.0,I purchased this ballet dance dress for my daughter's ballet class. This dress came very quickly. The color is soft pink and it is very pretty. The material of the dress is very soft.

5.0,Fits great! Just enough sparkle!
5.0,"I actually purchased these in a retail store, but was so impressed I just wanted to leave a review here. Tried on this shoe at the recommendation of a clerk. I told him I didn't like lightweight shoes because they don't have enough cushioning. He was about 6'3&#34;, 210 lbs, so I figured there had to be something to them if he liked them. Lo and behold, he was right !  I ran the 2014 AJC Peachtree Roadrace in them, and they are wonderful. Perfect combo….lightweight, great cushioning in sole, breathability, decent price. Btw, I'm 46, 5'11&#34;, 178lbs…..now, run along !!"
5.0,I have a lot of foot pain. I have bought many types of shoes/slippers  looking for comfort.  These slippers have been better than expected.
5.0,My friend loves sock monkeys and this was really a hit with her.  It was so nice that I couldn't wait until Christmas to give it to her. Beautiful craftsmanship. Way to go Amazon.  I love dealing with you.
5.0,Just like the old one which lasted about 10 years
5.0,"LOVE these caps. My frist time wearing hair caps as a Dental Hygienist. They are full coverage, good quality, comfortable and attractive. The biggest PLUS is the side button so you do not have to wear your mask all day around your ears. SO MUCH MORE comfortable. Game changer when wearing N95 all day long."
5.0,"I use it as a day pack for unit functions, and shorter hikes. Holds enough for what it is, so far I'm very satisfied with the quality. If the durability doesn't hold up I'll update this review, but otherwise I'm very satisfied with this product."
5.0,Umm it’s a freaking scorpion that glows in the dark.

5.0,"Great price, length, 100% cotton. Thank you.  I bought one to try.  I am buying 3 more. As good as if not nicer than Jockey brand 100% cotton one that costs 2.5xs more. Jockey has lost me."
5.0,My husband usually gets expensive brands that look just like these and they always break. I’ve gotten him these a while back and they are still holding up! He loves them
5.0,Great hat fits perfectly
5.0,"Just got my band and cover. Worth it, band fit perfectly. The cover was easy to install and protect the surrounding of the watch nicely. Color was exactly like the picture."
5.0,"This is the most comfortable sports bra i have ever worn, i am only a B cup but it is very supportive for me, coverage is great and doesn't cause back fat bubbles. Straps spread out and don't dig in anywhere, while looking very stylish, they are thin to reduce tan lines."
5.0,My 6 year old was delighted. I bought it to match her new bathrobe.
5.0,"The waist trainer came just as pictured/ described by seller. Shipping was on time & came packaged well. This is perfect for people who have a short torso, if you don't I urge you not to purchase! But If that's you than you'll be very happy with this.

5.0,Súper bellas

5.0,I love it!!!! I can't wait to use it!!!
5.0,"Definitely didn't realize when I ordered these that these are SOFT rings - meaning they are flexible, not structured.  I was really disappointed when I opened the package... but I tried them and turns out I love them.  They flex with your finger - no worries about bending or hitting them into things.  They are light and airy and I forget I'm wearing it.  I will order again!!"

5.0,"Nice, warm ski mask."
5.0,"Took a between 2-3 weeks for this product to come. Once I opened the box I was well pleased to see that I had received exactly what I had ordered with the diamonds all in tack. Usually orders from China either get lost or replaced with another order, but thankfully this order came through correctly the first time."
5.0,Very good quality and very quick delivery.
5.0,Overall the products were great for the price but there were 8 different kinds I got 2 of the same thing. I didn't get that one chocker that had a tringle which was what I really wanted. Even though I'm sure it was a mistake I recommend getting this item:))
5.0,very beautiful and a nice size<br />especially well made for the price
5.0,Nice design and much in style.  Bought for husband to put his silver cross on.  Sterling silver does not wear well around the neck.  Stainles steel is much better.

5.0,I love it kinda of short but I love it !
5.0,"My son loves them, but hasn't worn them yet."

5.0,Socks are wonderful!!! Great colors and well made. Arrived on time and good shape!
5.0,"The leg holes (size medium) are a bit larger than expected, but my kid (teen) has large thigh muscles so it worked out. But the BEST part about these is that the &#34;junk&#34; area has a lining so everything isn't just out there. As as result, that area is much less pronounced than with other jammers we've owned. And they fit fine under the wetsuit with no rashes from that extra lining (I'd worried, but it was just fine)."
5.0,Very lovely barefoot bracelet. My wife wears this all the time.
5.0,"These were fun. Enough to give out at a bday party, very worth the investment.m"

5.0,"This set was awesome! It runs a little small so I'm glad I ordered a size up! Its super comfy, stretchy and contorts to your body! I am curvy so the material was perfect!  It was easy to customize for my costume. I bought black and spray painted it gold. The material never got icky or ugly after painting it."
5.0,looks just like the picture and the fit is perfection. this is a Men's watch. if you are a woman you will need to remove the links for a smaller fit so don't buy this watch.
5.0,I’m 5’3 145 lbs M was perfect I have a big lower stomach and it hides it without needing spandex. Looks good on me with 36b breast but if you have big breasts it’ll be very revealing. It’s short but not too short.
5.0,Good quality and decent price.  Just be aware of length and width for what you want to do with it.  Very nice simple ball chain.
5.0,"tl;dr If you just want a strap that won't stink after you swim with it, do NOT get this strap.<br />But, if you just like sail-cloth (because it's sailcloth), then this is a nice looking strap, I'm sure you'll like it.<br /><br />The inside lining is made of &#34;Genuine Leather&#34;. If you arrived at this product page, by searching for &#34;sailcloth&#34; wrist watch straps - with the intention of having water-resistant/non-stinking material on your watch - you'll be disappointed to learn this strap has actual leather on it. It says so in the description, but it's not visible in the title or in any of the photos. It's cheap enough that you might just click purchase without looking at the description carefully to catch this."
5.0,I bought this for my daughter's 8th birthday.  She loved it!
5.0,I Like the product. I’d buy some more of t shirt

5.0,Perfect pants for traveling.I really love those pants I will probably get another pair
5.0,i love this dress so much! It's so long and really comfy!! super flattering!!! works well for maternity or NOT ;-) BUY IT!!! i could have gotten a medium in this! I'm 5'8 and usually a size 12-14
5.0,"quality washes well, wears well.<br />recommend"

5.0,I'm spell bound by it's beauty! I'm speechless... it is right out of some Disney movie! Love it....thank you!

5.0,This is SO soft and comfy! A little short on the sides but perfect for around the house and sleeping!
5.0,"My husband wanted a different wedding band to wear at work. He is a brick mason so he's very hard on it and he didn't want to mess up his original band. This was somewhat similar to his original so I ordered it for him. He really likes the ring and wears it to work everyday. It's made very well and it will definitely hold up! He has worn it for 3 months and there is nothing wrong with it, so that is saying a lot considering how hard he is on it."
5.0,This product is exactly what I was looking for. It is going to be used as part of a costume in a certain period of time. The quality is awesome. Thank you

5.0,Comfortable and affordable.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:c90a1ba22c3a9bf4e5f14f9dd60fa21e]] These are a must especially if your favorite designer is Micheal Kors this man never fails and the fact that I only paid $100 (size 9.5) instead of the $300 at the Kors store i got them in the cream color but they didn't have my size in the brown ones Idk if they bringing more sizes because I bought the last one in this size but if you do get these in the other style I'm typically size 9 or 9.5 these are tight so I suggest the 9.5 even the size 10 would be fine because there really tight fitting also, I have skinny long feet I wouldn't recommend these if you have really chunky feet they're not going to pass ur heel as its extremely tight fitting and they do not stretch at all. But, honestly size up would be fine to."
5.0,Size sm. Delivered promptly & the fit is great. Order your correct size.
5.0,"Thinner fabric, but plenty dark and pattern on it is clear. I wear a noodle-strap shirt underneath in case of any see-through. Very light and stretchy and comfortable. I work at a bank and it is professional enough to wear with clients. I get complements on it."

5.0,"These are my second pair of Fly London boots.  My first pair in this style was brown.  I wanted a  pair of black boots and odered these. Out of the box they appear a grey black, however after I rubbed them with neatsfoot oil and applied black shoe polished I got them to a true black.  After initial break in these are truly a comfortable boot.  I wear size 10 in a dress shoe and Euro size 43 fit the bill. I took out the insoles and inserted a pair of SuperFeet insoles to make an even more comfortable fit.<br />These boots are shipped from the UK so it will take some time for delivery, however they came earlier than the promised delivery date.  All in all I am very satisfied with my purchases from this vendor and highly recommend this product. Hip hip and cheerio!"
5.0,My husband said these are so soft and warm! Would totally recommend!
5.0,This purse is exactly as advertised.  I made it into a cute sign for my store window.

5.0,It was perfect! Can’t wait to give it to my bestie!!
5.0,"I just got these today and I am so happy with my purchase!! I got the blue and the hot red ones because I wasn’t sure how intense were the colors. They are exactly what I wanted! Vibrant, eye catching colors and the fit like a glove! I will style them with a pair of high waisted jeans and a crop top! Keeping both and I’ll order more colors!! Thank you Positive Brands!!"
5.0,Kobe ...what an inspiration... great item
5.0,Exactly what I wanted ---strong an not conspicuous.
5.0,Beautiful thank you very much
5.0,Super comfy. I’m a bit bottom heavy so they were a little snug around the butt and thighs but stretched over time. Cute and have lasted many washes (including design). Make your butt look amazing lol
5.0,Esta perfecta si buscas algo para cubrirte el frío y que no sea bromosa

5.0,"I've had Russell sweatshirts before and they were great. I ordered one to check it out because it's been a little while and they were harder to find in local stores. This one is fine and I will order a couple more soon.  There are a few thing I like in a sweatshirt:  I want them to my waist and not over my rear,  I want a good color selection which Russell has, and I want one that my wife can cut the sleeves off and hem.  I also don't like them super heavy. The russells are light but warm. Thanks for asking."
5.0,Arrived today in the mail and so far it fits well and feels good. Product has a nice weight to it and doesn’t cause any itching after showering with it on.
5.0,"I originally ordered this dress because I loved the pattern, which is just as beautiful in person. I wore it this weekend and received several compliments on the dress. It's a great dress for spring/summer since the slip on the skirt only comes down to around the knee, not making it unbearably hot on a sunny day. I also like that the slit on this dress stops at around the knee, so no need to worry about showing more skin than you intend to.<br /><br />This really is a beautiful maxi dress for us shorter gals. I'm 5'4&#34; and the dress falls just above my feet, so I can definitely wear it with heels or flats. It's a nice change from all those dresses that drag on the ground and need to be altered. As far as sizing goes, it actually runs a little bigger than I expected. Generally I have to size up (way up) on a lot of clothing that I order here, but I noticed the reviews said this wasn't the case for this dress. I ended up ordering a Large, which actually felt a little big on me. I could have gotten away with a Medium in this dress. For reference, I'm a 8 on the bottom, 10 on top and 34ddd."
5.0,"Good  Merchandice, Good seller, Takes a little long to ship.  But other than that A+"
5.0,"I really love this flowy dress. Received so many compliments even though I wore it w/cami.<br />Only (-), chest pt. a bit snug on me purchased Xl & my ""correct"" bra size = 38C."

5.0,They fit great on my regular glasses.
5.0,"Very attractive and easy to use. Every slot is easily accessible. It is a bit bulky once you fill it, but I now have everything in one wallet and it's all protected. Before I was carrying 2 wallets because my regular wallet didn't provide protection. Definitely glad I have it."
5.0,"I first bought XL thinking I really wanted a robe to wrap me up in warmth.  It was way too big.  Bought the Lge and it is perfect. I'm 5'3"" and is 3"" above ankle and sleeves to knuckles.  So warm and wraps me up in soft warm comfort.  You will love it!"
5.0,My wife loves her new bag! Great color and the script graphic is awesome!
5.0,"Fits comfortably. I work long hours 8+, and sometimes I even forget its on my head. I also like the variety of colors and patterns. I can match with most of my uniforms."

5.0,Going 3 months strong of daily use!!  No complaints at all!!!
5.0,"I am really impressed with the quality, style, and value of these t shirts. These are the ideal boys’ basic t shirts with some really great colors. The moisture wicking material is perfect for hot, humid summertime weather like we have here in the South. It definitely keeps him cooler. One of the best things about these particular shirts is their length. A lot of t shirts are short or shrink up and become short after washing, but these are nice and long. I would definitely recommend these."

5.0,"I have a large head, and when I find a hat -- any hat -- that fits I rejoice. So you can imagine how pleased I was to receive the Sterkowski Trapper Hat. It is warm, and in its way it is rather attractive. Unfortunately we have not had much cold weather this year and the hat will have to wait until next year. But I owe Sterkowski a ""tip of the hat."""

5.0,"For years I’ve worn Spiedel Twist-O-Flex watches and was always impressed with their look, comfort and durability so was very happy to discover that they made a band for the Apple Watch. This purchase did not disappoint and I am very pleased with this purchase.  One thing though, unless you are extremely lucky you are going to have to have some links removed. On the Spiedel website you can download a pdf that contains a measure you can cut out to determine the size band you require and I fell right on the line between medium and large. So I ordered the large knowing full well a band adjustment would likely be necessary. It turned out that I did need to have some links removed in order to get a good pulse measurement when I exercised. Now many years ago while doing some outside work I caught a similar band in an obstacle with enough force to tear it. In that case I removed a link and fixed it myself but it never looked quite right after the job I did. So knowing that, I took my new band to a jeweler to have the links removed. He sized it perfectly, took less than 10 minutes to do the job and charged me $10. It looks, feels and fits absolutely perfect now. Best $10 investment I ever made. Net: extremely happy with the band and the decision to take it to a jeweler to have the necessary adjustment made. This is a big improvement over the original Apple sports band that came with the watch. Very happy with this."
5.0,"Perfect fit and great fabric. Beautiful forever piece, can be worn for most occasions. Combines well with all colors. One of Eileen Fisher’s best."
5.0,"I am about to return these for a different size. I am not saying the sizes are off, I just don't know what size I am since I've been scaling down from 1inch and have no idea what size I need or have been wearing.<br /><br />What I like the most about these is that they're one of the only pairs of rose plugs I've found that actually have a backing and aren't too front heavy. When I realized that I ordered the wrong size, I made some on my own. I found some roses that looked just like some of the other rose plugs on amazon and I glued them to the front of some tunnels I have. The rose stuck out so much I couldn't use a phone comfortably and since the tunnels I put them on are a little small for my hole, the addition made them want to hang or fall out since the screw-on backing can fit right through my hole.<br /><br />SO I'm definitely going to try to find the right size with these ones because they don't stick out too much, they lay flat where I want them to, and they are really good disguises. I don't hate my stretched ears but sometimes I'm not interested in showing off the gaping holes in my ears but still want to wear my hair up; so these are pretty awesome. I might even wear them at my wedding if they get here in time & I picked the right size this time :)"
5.0,Very pretty.  arrived quickly.
5.0,"Use at work, keeps the sweat from my eyes."
5.0,Perfect leggings. I ordered the dark blue or navy color. Washed them twice already and no fading or shrinking. They fit true to size and have a comfortable elastic waist. The fabric isn't too thin and works well for our early Fall weather.

5.0,Excellent product!!!

5.0,The kid loved it!
5.0,"During a trip to Northern Arizona I stopped by the AZ Handmade and Fire on the Mountain Gallery. This is where I discovered Darren Seweyestewa's art and creations. I'm a fan of his work and proudly wear it. I own the Overlay Water bracelet. It's a piece that speaks to me. The functional weight, design, and presence are bonuses to the eye drawing styling. Thank you Darren and look forward to my next purchase."
5.0,I ordered this for my daughter and when it arrived i thought that it would be an adult size hat but its a junior. Luckily it does fit her even thought she is only 8 she had a big head. She love Tokidoki and the unicono so this was perfect for her.

5.0,This is a beautiful piece! I receive questions and compliments every time I wear it. What is that? Where did you get it?  Love it!
5.0,"I bought these for my May costume from the game It Takes Two, and they worked really well!  They did keep sliding down my nose all weekend, but that might just be my face.  I should also note that after three days of wear, there was definitely a sore spot behind my ears, but nothing unbearable, and I have a VERY large head, so again, that might just be a problem for me.  Ear pieces and nose pieces both came bent, but I was able to gently maneuver them back into place without any breaking, and the glasses were in excellent condition otherwise.  They come in a cloth bag and have a little sheet for wiping the lenses.  I like them so much that I think I want to get a smaller pair just for everyday wear, as these are a bit over the top for regular usage."
5.0,They are long but I like my tanks longer. They are very nice for layering. I wish they weren't ribbed but it's not too bad. They are exactly as advertised.
5.0,It was a gift. It was absolutely beautiful and loved by the girl it was for. She wore it with her prom dress.

5.0,It states it is cotton but it says poleyester on the tag of the dress. I don't buy poleyester. But I will keep this dress. It is very pretty.
5.0,"I love skull jewelry. I can usually only find pieces in silver. Super stoked to have found this heavy weight bracelet in gold. I stack it with other loose bracelets. I love when the skull peeks out from my suit jacket while I’m in a meeting. That’s right, I’m cool, listen to me."
5.0,"It's so pretty, a nice sparkle"
5.0,Bag as described and  on time. Daughter was surprised and pleased.I reordered three more.
5.0,Use these for crossfit and running. I order on the smaller than normal for a snug fit.
5.0,"I couldn't ask for more frill, and I'm glad I ordered the largest size from this brand. It's such a girly dress, and yet I can see this with boots of all kinds for Autumn. The fabric overall is slightly thin, so I'd  wear tan kickpants underneath just in case.<br />I'm an 18/20 standing at 5'7""; less than or equal to 220lbs."
5.0,comfy nd fits as expected. my daughter wore this for bed on our trip to Disneyland and will continue to wear it. Great buy!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:ebadf264dc139337ead879bb547aa30a]] I bought a shirt very similar to this one a few months back that I absolutely love, but I made the mistake of buying white which never stays very white for me, so when I saw this one in navy I absolutely had to have it.<br /><br />I ordered the 2XL, which is listed as a US size 18.  I would say this is pretty accurate.  I like my shirts to be nice and loose and I always have to order a size up for my bust, so this size worked out well for me.  What I did not realize about this shirt is that the sleeves are actually a super soft chiffon material. I absolutely love this.  This shirt feels amazing on and the sleeves are so soft and pretty.  I don’t have very many casual shirts as I spend a lot of time in business clothes and this shirt is absolutely perfect for pairing with jeans. Another great thing is because the sleeves are chiffon is I can wear this on cooler summer nights when a sweater is too much, but you want a little coverage.<br /><br />This shirt is fantastic.  It’s well-made and comes in a variety of gorgeous colors. I’m partial to the navy (it’s actually more of a teal color, just as pictured) but all of the colors are pretty and I may have to get one or two more.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion."
5.0,Lightweight.  Perfect hoops
5.0,"This band is superior to one I paid $60 for. It is substantial but not too thick, and the space gray color complements my Apple Watch perfectly. I have very small wrists so finding a band to fit is challenging. This one fits well with even a little room to spare, yet appears that it will fit large wrists just as well. Can’t beat the price and super fast shipping—Highly Recommend!"
5.0,"I spent a few years flying on this type of aircraft as a crewmember, and look back fondly.  This pin now adorns my hat with a pair of other aircraft from my military history."
5.0,I love it.  Very comfy and cute.  Thanks.
5.0,"This is a beautiful well made bag, I have 3 of them and a fourth on the way , this one is my favorite, looks just like the picture it’s tan and browns. And there’s a pocket in the front under the flap behind the number 5 big enough for a cell phone which was a surprise!! If your thinking on buying this you won’t be disappointed! And my bag measures 11” wide and 10.5 height. Great size for every day use.  And thank you to the seller for quick delivery and packaged nicely"
5.0,"I'm so glad I got this scarf when I did, our weather changed quickly and my time for wearing knit sweaters came earlier then expected.  This was a great addition to my collection."
5.0,"Size is just right. It would have been nice to have some sort of adjustment for others, but since I am a 6 feet tall, the pendant part sits right on my chest."
5.0,I gave this dress as a gift & recepient loved it!!
5.0,Wife is very happy this are the second pair of glasses that I buy For her
5.0,The length is great especially bec I'm large chested so it doesn't fall in the cleavage. It looks just like the picture maybe even better!
5.0,"Took forever to arrive, but just what I ordered. Perfect for my husband who loses nose rings like crazy!"
5.0,I ordered this piece as work watch and it is perfect. It’s lightweight so it doesn’t feel heavy on my wrist at all. The face is just big enough. It also has a 12/24 hour function. It’s affordability made it ideal.
5.0,"Got this dress for my wife, to wear on my son's birthday party.<br />The dress was gorgeous and elegant. The material was stretchable.<br />Received compliments about the dress from all the guests.<br />Good one for the price."
5.0,"This gold cross bracelet is AWESOME & just what I was looking for, it's a very nice bright gold & so far has kept that brightness & not dulled, which I was concerned about as some turn to copper looking after a while, but NOT this one!  If need be I would order again,"
5.0,Ive been using this purse for a long time now and I get compliments on it almost constantly.
5.0,I love them..ordered 3

5.0,"LOVE THIS SUIT!!! Size chart is accurate. The zipper is surprisingly durable, and no signs of tearing. I bought the black and white one, and love that it covers my back completely. I need to buy another one, but a different color. Wish they had more color choices."
5.0,These are great! Each one fit very nicely.
5.0,"Was looking for a back pack my three granddaughters could carry on the airplane with their books and crayons as we headed for Disney World. This was perfect, and a wonderful size; not too big and not too small."
5.0,"These gaiters are very well made and they are a high quality product.  Bright colors that do not fade with machine washing (cold/hang dry).  We did not purchase for insulating properties, only for masking.  Customer service with this company is exceptional"
5.0,This jersey was perfect.
5.0,Fit great and look great at a great price
5.0,I have been losing weight and have a very wide middle and with the strips around the middle I was afraid that it would make me look larger.  It is true to size and very soft fabric I will go back and order the additional colors.
5.0,This product works as advertised and my hubby gets through TSA without taking his belt off.
5.0,"I live in Chicago where it gets pretty cold during winter months. This hat works great and is very warm. It is also very stylish and since COVID is here, the mouth piece is cool if you forget your mask."
5.0,"There was nothing to dislike. The material has a nice feel, the gown is very comfortable, and it fits perfectly.  Was not expecting the quality to be as good as it was for the price."

5.0,"FANKUTOYS Funny Apron for Men - Dad's Barbecue Best in Town - Adjustable Kitchen Aprons with 2 Pockets,Professional Waterproof BBQ Apron for Cooking Baking Grilling<br /><br />I got this apron to give to my husband as a gift. He loves to fire up his BBQ and grill for the kids and grandkids. He often ends up getting stuff on his shirts, so it will be good for him to have this apron to help protect his clothes. It has a fun graphic and the material is fairly thick and the apron feels well made. You can't beat the price, around $9 at the time I got it. The two big pockets are a handy feature and will be a good spot to stash his grilling tools or an oven mitt. I think my husband is going to be happy with this gift."
5.0,These flip flops are as good as any major brand...at 1/2 the price.  They are very comfortable and roomy.
5.0,It was a wonderful product
5.0,Super soft material not hard to breathe through. Doesn’t sit high up under my eyes very comfortable. My favorite mask by far

5.0,My favorite workout tanks
5.0,"My 11 year old daughter loves these swim suits!  They fit great, arrived on time, and were a great price!"

5.0,Comfortable glasses!
5.0,I like to look of this watch.  Keep in mind you need to wear it to have it keep working.  If you store it for a long period it will stop working but it is very nice.
5.0,This sweater is soft and fits as expected (pleasantly over sized).  The color matches the photo and it arrived ahead of schedule!
5.0,It is so beautiful!!!!!!!! Very good quality with lovely price!!!
5.0,"I like that it goes down below my knees by about 4 inches (I am 5'10"").  My son is around 48 inches tall, and these are so long, we'll have to trim or just roll up a bit and tie.<br /><br />The arm length was decent.  If I stretched my arms out, the ends might creep up away from my hands by an inch... but with my arms just slightly bent, the ends stay way out by my hand.<br /><br />I bought these for the water rides at Universal Studios/Islands of Adventure; so I didn't care about the thickness of the material.  It seemed fine; nothing tore as all of us tried one of these on.  It should easily last the three rides that I care to use this on.  I figure when I'm on the rides that I'll be wearing this on, I shouldn't be getting wet above the knees.  Frankly, I probably went overboard, but I bought some of these too:  https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B084NXGD5Q/<br /><br />The hood string worked great.  If you pull on the string ends coming out the hood, you can close the hole up until it's tiny (if you really wanted water protection), and look out through the clear plastic.<br /><br />The plastic smelled bad right after I opened it, but after a short time, it wasn't so bad.  It was never so bad that I thought I couldn't wear it.<br /><br />PRO TIP:  I tried to open the pouch in my living room, and had trouble ripping it open.  If you are somewhere, and don't have anything sharp on you, you could have trouble getting this open.  Maybe I was doing it wrong, but that thing was tough!  So I cut a slightly diagonal slit in the top, above where it even opens up into the pouch containing the poncho.  Just a ""start"" of a cut in the upper corner, so that when I'm at Universal, I can easily tear it open from there.  I tested that theory at home, and it was super easy to tear the top off."
5.0,"A quality shirt that will protect you from the sun, I was in Santa Fe and was worried about getting a sunburn at the high altitude, this worked fine, comfortable and could roll up the sleeves without looking like a bum"
5.0,Mask is very cute and a must for the chihuahua lover.  Fits great and is breathable.  Has a pocket for a filter which I like.
5.0,Be the talk of everyone!<br />Highly recommended!
5.0,"Covers everything that needs to be covered, the sleeves are a little longer(as shown on the picture) and the shirt itself is plenty long, so no plumber crack when bending over! I had ordered many different shirts to wear with scrub pants for work, and then I ordered two more of this one because it was by far the best!"
5.0,Perfect size and keeps food warm and hot!
5.0,"Great spray bottles. Pretty blue color, sturdy, sprays great. Includes labels. You could mix scented oils or create your own scented hand sanitizer.  Beautiful glass bottle. Looks good on counter tops."
5.0,Beautiful colors and I really like the material
5.0,Good qualify
5.0,Original very Nice Quality
5.0,"I just got these today and they are incredibly comfortable. They fit perfectly with just a bit of stretch/compression that feels great. Very soft and cozy. If they feel this good after they are washed, I’ll be buying more!"
5.0,Totally excellent!!!!!!
5.0,"Folds up nice and small, and has a good heft to it. Not flimsy at all."
5.0,very nice and a beautiful neckless.
5.0,Very nice belt its not heavy and is very comfortable
5.0,So this is a correction to my original review. I loved this piece at first for my PA. I soon came to realize it was a piece of junk and the it away. The screws in the end balls are just glued into the balls. I found out while at a friend's house when it fell off and went down my pant leg.
5.0,they fit great!  Lighter than I expected but glad they are.
5.0,Bought these as a gift for a friend. She loves them
5.0,Bought these for my husband and he loves the way they feel and fit. Very comfy

5.0,Beautiful necklace. Love it! Bought for my niece I know she’ll love it too.
5.0,Very breathable. Will order again
5.0,(4X) Love this blouse! I was looking for something dressy for my concert and my polka dot shoes... this was perfect. The style is very flattering for my shape. The cut is low (I wear a 46DDD) but with a good bra you could rock it. The fabric is soft and flowy. The cut on the arms adds just a little sexiness. I prefer to have it dry cleaned. I look forward to buying more colors!
5.0,I have these jeans in a size 14. I have different colors in 14 and 16 and they fit perfectly. The leg shake and sizing are for curvy women.
5.0,I like the pants
5.0,This is one of the best rompers I have ever purchased on Amazon.  It is true to size (Medium 8/10) and perfect for a night out. Love this outfit.

5.0,Woo Hoo
5.0,This a very lovely piece. I have received numerous compliments on it. I have several co-workers ordering it!
5.0,I was hesitant at first but since over a month I have never took it off I love this band it made my wife feel so much better no complaints at all great bands and all honesty I probably bought three or four different bands because I wanted a black band
5.0,"Add to fit perfectly, good product"
5.0,"I bought this for a costume, it has a rubber strap to hold it place but I will use hat pins instead.  It works really well with the rest of costume.  It was well packaged and arrived looking great"
5.0,Dress looks just as pictured. It has long slits in the side so I'll likely wear a seamless slip under it. I'm normally a size 14 and ordered an XL. It was a perfect fit!
5.0,"Doesn't look like much in packaging but once you put it on, WOW! I love how this dress fits me. It's defiently an eye catcher and glad to have this wonderful piece in my wardrobe!"
5.0,"Fit great, only bought a new pair because my dog chewed up my last pair of the same sandal."
5.0,"The fabric is thin and wispy as expected. Great for summer and pattern is somewhat oriental and cheery. Like it a lot. I ordered the pink one and this, I can't decide which one to give away to a friend. Like them both."
5.0,Absolutely great product and service! Always prepared for any temperatures to tube the river with our lab family!
5.0,"The fit is exactly how I wanted it to be, TIGHT! The material is perfect for working out and staying flattering during a good sweat😉"

5.0,I got a lots of compliments!!!
5.0,"Does stop glare, but everything has yellow tint to it"
5.0,Pretty and fun!
5.0,Even though it's a bit pricey this the type of shoe tree was recommended for my more expensive shoes. This product is well made. I would purchase again
5.0,"This back pack is HUGE, buy it, what a great price and perfect for camping and back packing, not only will it carry all my equipment, but plenty of room for clothes and food supplies too, in fact, I may be hard pressed to fill it completely."
5.0,"just what I wanted.  fits to size, and it holds my pants up! yay. so glad to find a belt for plus size. thank you"
5.0,"Daughter gets migraines with around loud noises.  She loves wearing these, they fit perfectly (she is 8 years old), and they muffle the noise but she can still hear.  Glad we found these!"
5.0,Love these pants! I'm a size 8 us and 5&#34;1 in  height and medium size fits me perfect! And I can't forget to mention that they really compliment my butt.
5.0,I love my pin. It is my favorite pin. The photo doesn’t do it justice. It is glittery and tge colors pop.
5.0,Just Lovely! This will be perfect this summer. I'm a 40 DDD and got the XL

5.0,Great.  My son is 3 & loves them.  They're pretty tough too.
5.0,Best hat ever created you have my love and respect
5.0,Fits perfectly & true to size
5.0,"Not a sweater, more like a long sleeve shirt. Very nice material and looks nice with a pair of jeans or dress pants."
5.0,Love these gloves. The grey is a dark charcoal grey. They remind me of a movie or cartoon. Very fun! Feel like wool and thick!
5.0,Love this apron! Wear it almost daily as I am cleaning and cooking. Have 2 different colors!
5.0,Bought it for my son for a football game in Buffalo. Worked great his feet were warm. Used good ski socks.
5.0,Gave this as a gift for a Harley Quinn fan and she was thrilled with it. It is heavy and well made. I recommend it.
5.0,"These are fantastic. As long as I make sure to pull them all the way up when I put it on, they doesn't slide down. They are very comfortable and don't feel tight/restrictive.  I forget that I have them on while protecting me from the sun.  It does feel cooler than the sun beating down on my skin, as some of the other reviews have said.<br /><br />Would love to find these for my thighs so all I have to worry about is my face getting burned."
5.0,I like the bra.  Like the straps.  The padding could have been a little thinner but I’d rate it great for comfort.  Best one I’ve tried lately!!
5.0,They were cute for the amount of product and the price. I was quite happy.
5.0,I like it-boyfriend
5.0,The kids love these and get creative with them.
5.0,I purchased these as a little gift for a girls weekend. They were received well by everyone. Very attractive and a good variet. I actually bought 2 packages of them. Love them
5.0,Just a little smaller than I would have liked. No measurements of hat provided by seller
5.0,Absolutely awesome - very happy!! These boots are absolutely divine!! Fantastic quality and so comfortable! The leather is very good quality and the gold metal embellishments are very classy. The colour is absolutely gorgeous and looks fab with blue jeans. Just perfect - I would highly recommend!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:f7373fbb195f879c861ca61250423e75]] This is such a beautiful bracelet and looks very expensive as I seen designer versions that were very similar with very hefty price tags. . Just make sure you check the size as it fits true. I think it would be very tight on larger wrists.<br /> I like the twisted stainless as well it has a great gift box.<br />I love the message that is included as well the cleaning cloth.<br />I’m impressed with the weight as it doesn’t feel to heavy or light. It’s just right. The box indicates as a gift but I’m keeping this for myself. It looks great as a stand alone or with several other bracelets.<br />Definitely worth the money and I do recommend.
5.0,The necklace comes in a nice box with a cleaning cloth included. Shine is good and the clasp so far has not pulled my hair. I like how long the chain goes on my neck and the pendant is a good size for the diameter of the chain. It would make a lovely gift .
5.0,"These are a great pair of readers, especially for the price. Love the design!!"
5.0,I love it! Fits perfectly
5.0,"I would buy again in another color, fits true to size & stretchy."
5.0,Fits at Shoulders and through chest. A little big through belly and hips. But absolutely adorable. Great fabric. Makes it feel very luxurious.
5.0,Great product.  Superior quality and great design.  Love that I can machine wash it!
5.0,I loved this necklace as soon as I opened it. I got a compliment on it the first time I wore it. It's beautiful and not too small.
5.0,These will be a perfect gift.  Better than they look. Came in a nice gift box.<br />Very pleased with them
5.0,"I love this dress!!! I originally ordered a different color in an XL because I decided ordering a size up was the safest bet, but the XL was so big. I had so much room. I ordered this dress in a M and it fit perfect. I am 168 lbs 36C. The material is very stretchy and comfortable without it looking cheap. Very impressed. The colors are vibrant and pretty. Going to send back the XL and keep this one."
5.0,The fanny pack was exactly as described and I found it to be very handy when traveling.
5.0,Good products and fast shipping!
5.0,"This is the only baby toy that I have found  that has bells in it, they love it!"
5.0,I had a horrible time getting my piercing to heal. Someone suggested this. It worked! My ear doesn't burn anymore and it finally healed.
5.0,Quick service
5.0,Very comfortable!<br />Love it!
5.0,Washable<br />Material is durable<br />Extra parts shipped<br />Good protection and durable filters
5.0,Broke soon as I put it on.  Not worth it at all
5.0,"Great quality, does prevent scratching and biting. Very thick and up over elbows, got these for my boyfriend to wear while bathing my 3 cats. Very happy with this purchase!"
5.0,"You cannot IMAGINE how much this baby can hold.  I am a over packer admittedly, but even I have got a 3 day weekend down to this piece. Its heavy duty, the spinner wheels make it so easy to handle.  Great Price too!"
5.0,"I love this dress. I actually have the same dress in a shorter length from Miusol that I wore for my engagement pictures so I was sure this one would be perfect, and it is. The lace sleeves have stretch to them and aren't at all itchy. There is plastic along the neckline so it grips your skin (comfortably) and doesn't slip around."
5.0,"I had something very much like this 25 years ago in college and it served me well.  I like the simplicity and versatility; I would like it even better if it had fewer colorful markings (for wear with dark clothes).  It arrived quickly and worked perfectly; I used it swimming at the YMCA and so on.  And at about $10, it's hard to go wrong!<br /><br />The watch lost a star because when I took it swimming in the ocean, and used the timer functions, that evening the watch developed some condensation on the inside, and 2-3 days later it stopped working.  Maybe I had a loose seal.  I'm going to get the G-Shock (bought one of those in 1990 and it lasted well over a decade of heavy use); if it's too bulky for the office then I'll get this model again.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/21/2015:  I did in fact buy another one some time ago; it's still cheap, very functional, and understated enough that I can wear it to work in an office setting.  And maybe I just assumed that it was waterproof last time, but I now notice that it says &#34;Water Resistant&#34; on the back of the watch, so my bad for taking it into the ocean!  It would be silly to dock it for not being water proof since in addition to it saying so on the watch, the web page says resistant rather than proof, so I'm changing it from four to five stars."
5.0,My son who is 16 and on the small side loved the fit and look of the jeans. He is about 5'5&#34; and weighs about 125lbs. The fit is perfect. Thanks so much.
5.0,Easy to put on in the morning !  They feel great and give good support!
5.0,"This is a nice outfit, soft material, very pretty.  Very reasonably priced."
5.0,"These run a bit small, but if u turn them inside out, they look better & fit better."
5.0,I bought these laces to replace the regular ones that came on my son’s new tennis shoes. They were very easy to put on and so far they are working exactly as expected. I like the extra pop of color they add too!
5.0,"This is a very nice and comfortable dress! You can dress it up, or dress it down. The criss cross across the chest is a great accent. I am a size 8, and wear medium tops. I ordered a small, and it fits perfectly. I am five four and a half, and it stops right at my ankles. This is a great dress for the office! I just wish it came in more colors."
5.0,I love Amazon.com products!!😊
5.0,My grandson looks adorable in this outfit 👍😊
5.0,Cool Shirt! My son loves it!
5.0,These shades are awesome. I can't believe the quality which is comparable with expensive designer glasses.
5.0,"After reading the reviews, I purchased a large for my husky son who normally wears an extra large in boys or a small in men's sizes. They are very short, as others stated, which worked in our favor. If you're buying for a husky boy, these are great, but not for a full grown man."
5.0,"Great romper, super comfortable!"
5.0,Comfortable with durable straps for the ear.  The pleat makes it so the face mask is large enough to fit on my face and leaves room to breathe. I would definitely recommend this product.
5.0,Very nice jacket. Size was right.
5.0,"Never has pants shopping for back to school been this easy!! I ordered these for my 14 year old 3 different colors and they all fit like a glove  . The material is a  very light stretchy supper comfortable, and the colors are amazing. I wish all the school clothes shopping was this easy !!!"
5.0,Perfect for inside Winter swimming
5.0,"A lightweight yet warm garment.  I've been wearing this during both cold and chilly weather and it provides the protection from the cold, concurrently it is not too hot when worn indoors"
5.0,Fun watch
5.0,"Super comfy, easy to wash and wear, loose fitting and slash pockets on side."

5.0,"Felt nice in this dress, sweet"
5.0,These studs look just like the photo they are a nice size.
5.0,Got these for my sister and she totally loved them
5.0,I liked the color (bought red wine color one). Loose but comfy. I bought another one too in green/teal. Love the fabric pattern/detail.
5.0,I have ordered the black pair several times over the last 2 years and I live them. the red ones are perfect. the red is a dark blue red as apposed to a orange red. the fit like a dream. these jeans are basically stretch pants for men. I plan on getting them in every color.
5.0,"Purchased two patterns in two sizes (normal size and next size up) and my normal size fit perfect. Thus, I don't recommend sizing up. Its a tad short like you see on the model but not enough to wear as a tunic (would have to size down). The material reminds me of fake silk... very lightweight, doesn't breath so could be problematic in humid weather."
5.0,BEST postpartum dress ever. Easy to breastfeed in it. Easy to wear right out of dryer (cool temp) and can hang dry too. No wrinkling. Easy breezy. A lady stopped me at the DMV office the other day and made me write down the name of the dress so she can get one too!
5.0,My special lady loves it. It is a very modest and flexible design and very appropriate for the Halloween partys we've been to! Want to order them all!
5.0,This is an awesome bag.
5.0,Le quedo perfecta !!!!! Somos felices
5.0,I wear these with overalls they're great everyone at work loves it

5.0,I love these shoes! They are super cute and fit great!
5.0,Returned item - didn't realise I needed appropriate button holed pants to use there braces/suspenders
5.0,"Love this product , extremely soft and comfortable"
5.0,"Such a cute dress! I am 5’4 and about 118lbs, small fit great. I put this on right after getting out of package so will definitely need a dryer fluff or iron. I really like the material, light but thick enough to feel like a better quality."
5.0,"Fits my 3M safety glasses well, keeps them from getting scratched in the tool box, truck, etc. Once for every pair!"
5.0,"As soon as I opened the package I knew I had a great bag. This is a great hiking backpack or camping or whatever you would want to use this backpack for. There are a couple different storage compartments in this backpack; there is the top load and front load. The bottom can unzip and you can fill the entire compartment/backpack from their or the bottom can be its own compartment. The rain cover is a very nice feature. Also the padding is pretty decent but could be better structured, but it is still comfortable. Also the metal frames are a nice feature but it is only 2 stake like metal frame not a full frame and the buckles seem like they could be more fragile, could break.<br /><br />The zippers are durable along with the fabric (which is typically not the case). The frame was quickly adjusted to my size (5'10&#34;) and felt like it was a part of ne with the lumbar/hip cushions feeling very good with about 60# of food, water and cooking supplies. An added benefit was the integrated rain fly, though a small add-on, it really sold me on these Mission Peak packs.<br /><br />This is a large bag and most definitely will hold 80L. The bag features both a top loading option and a front loading option with a &#34;sleeping bag&#34; compartment entry at the bottom of the bag. The neck cuff expands to allow plenty of room for even the bulkiest gear. This would easily pack in a full week of gear and supplies, especially if you pack light and use extra compression straps to add loops for external gear. All zippers are strong and work perfectly. They are stitched well and have zero catches or weak points. The bag is very, very solid.<br /><br />With multiple compression straps, bungee lash points on the front, D-loops on the straps, two mesh pockets on the sides, there is PLENTY of room and options for you to lash extra gear to the outside of the pack! It's also hydration bladder compatible with a hose clip and port built in.<br /><br />Overall, this pack is awesome and extremely well made! I'm incredibly impressed with the overall quality considering this pack is less than $75! I'm surprised I was able to find a pack for under $200 that I found acceptable but I'm very happy with this pack.<br /><br />Notice: I read a lot of reviews when I am deciding whether or not to buy a product. I enjoy purchasing and reviewing products and am not required to write a positive review but will give each product its fair and deserving review when needed."

5.0,love the fabric

5.0,Great as expected
5.0,"Good transaction , I’m very satisfied !"
5.0,I love this watch! I was looking for an inexpensive everyday bangle watch and this one is perfect. The face does have different shading of white and grey lines but it adds a little something interesting to the watch. The band is very comfortable too. Great watch for the price!

5.0,"Just as described, good quality for price"

5.0,I love the fabric of this t-shirt. It is very soft and cozy .... did not shrink when washed!
5.0,Much better than expected.
5.0,"Queda hermoso, se vé fino y la talla correcta"
5.0,"I'm A BIG girl,  240 lbs there about, but I carry it very well. A regular size US 18, or Chinese size 20.  I purchased the large and it fit great,  no adjustments needed. Although it needs and fastener to hold the dress together to avoid it from showing to much ...but that's an easy fix.  I paired the dress with a wide brown belt and Micheal kors black wedges and I looked stunning ...I  definitely recommend replacing the dress  cord or belt with real leather wide belt..this way the dress will keep its shape and won't droop. So beautiful I ordered the blue and white also."
5.0,It's very soft! The material suprised me. It is a little smaller than I expected but I still love it.
5.0,"A friend of mine wanted an animal hat with attached mittens. I saw a picture of this and thought it was adorable. When it arrived,  I was right,  it was absolutely adorable. She will love it!"
5.0,"Sweet little earrings - not too big or too small, not at all heavy, true ""mustard"" color."
5.0,"This is an absolutely amazing little case! I have two full sets of Sharpie fine tip no bleeds, a calligraphy set, a watercolor pencil set, and regular color pencils and they all fit wonderfully. It is compact so I can haul it around with me with little change to my bag's weight. It keeps all my pens organized. I love it, love it, love it!!!"
5.0,"This will last a long time, and I didn’t have to iron it when it came."
5.0,Love the easy breezy and light fabric. I felt pretty wearing it. Weird but that’s how I felt. I tuned I.  in for my walk but around the house it’s so comfy. I will buy more colors.
5.0,I’m obsessed! These cubes make packing a breeze and help you stay organized while you’re traveling. I can’t recommend these enough.
5.0,This crease protector is comfortable<br />It beats sneaker creases like no other product on the market without having to buy a bigger size so you can put a hard plastic piece in your shoe
5.0,Works exactly like it's meant to. I'm sure it'll break sooner or later but the chain seems pretty sturdy compared to the ones I used to buy in china town.
5.0,"i now own 5 colors.  love the fit, colors, fabric."
5.0,Very cute and comfy dress!!
5.0,Me encantaron los zapatos
5.0,"I will be ordering more of these. I am 4'11&#34; and have a 27&#34; inseam. I've never been able to buy a maxi dress that didn't need to be altered or at least require 4 inch heels. I slid this on to wear the work the day after I got it, wanting to see if my heels would be tall enough or if it needed to be altered. Neither were true. It sat right on the top of my feet. It was amazing. Made my day. Can't wait to get more.<br /><br />The material is very soft and comfortable to wear all day. The elastic is barely noticeable physically. It isn't irritating or anything like that. I am a 36D and then dress definitely shows some cleavage which is generally fine, except when wearing to work. I considered wearing a cami under it but I was actually able to just pull the material a little. It over lapped a little more and everything was appropriate for work. Good to go.<br /><br />Oh I ordered the blue one with stripes on top and v-neck"
5.0,I gave this bracelet as a gift & the person loved it.
5.0,I liked the material and the way they fit.
5.0,i am 6ft and 150lbs. it fit a tad on the big size but i am a skinny chap. I'm sure one wash and it'll be what i wanted for sure.
5.0,Brought for my daughter! She loves them! Fit is true to size!
5.0,Everything was perfect. Great Christmas gift for my sister.
5.0,"Super bag; holds quite a bit (thanks to pockets), without being bulky. Has a small profile, without being too tiny to be useful. LOVE the RFID feature + sturdy straps. I feel secure wearing this bag anywhere!"
5.0,Loved it!!!!!
5.0,My wife says it's very comfortable and firs well.
5.0,"I absolutely love these. They are soft like my Lularoe leggings, but soooo much cheaper. I will be getting more colors for sure."
5.0,Finally got my second one. Favorite seasonal top. Keeps me warm. Wish I could have one for every day of the week. Wear for a shirt and base layer. Very comfortable
5.0,"I am impressed with the quality of this band. A few friends of mine have ordered others from different companies and they have been mostly plastic covered in a metallic finish. This is actual metal. The links were very hard to remove and broke the link remover tool I had (it was a plastic tool) and we ended up having to use some improvised tools and scratched the remaining links a bit because of it. The need for specialized tools aside, I really like this band."
5.0,"These are pretty and as expected. My daughter's ear piercings have really been having a hard time healing up completely, but so far these are helping.  No more crusties."
5.0,The slippers were a great hit!  They are very cushiony and comfortable.  All the adults want a pair for themselves now!
5.0,Very delicate looking bracelet. Doesn't even feel like i have it on. At the same time it is a sturdy bracelet. I put it on and haven't taken it off at all. Still looks great!
5.0,Great I love it.. I've been wearing everyday for the past month
5.0,Great alternative to HP themed costume
5.0,Looks just as good as the photo. Love it!
5.0,Wow! I'm so impressed with this wallet. I love the design and how it has two open view areas for a license and a badge. I usually buy Coach Kors Burch or spade but realized the wallets weren't fitting in my smaller bags. Definitely I will order more and it came with its own box & dust protection bag.
5.0,"The first one arrived in blue.  I was expecting cheap.  What a great surprise.  I went back and immediately ordered the pink blue and black.  The material is thicker than I expected.  Fit like a glove with a little give.  I wanted a little wider sleeve so I could wear a black bra underneath .... perfect!  Can wear alone with shorts, or dress up and layer with a skirt or dress slacks.  They are secy without being sleezy.  The pictures do not do them justice.  I always handwash and do not put China items in the dryer.  A light touch with an iron if needed.  Says to dryclean, but not necessary."
5.0,"Nephew loves superheroes and hates to keep his socks on, purchased this to keep something on his feet that wouldn’t/couldn’t take off. He loves it and wears it every night!"
5.0,My husband wanted these for work.  He works construction and uses them daily.
5.0,VERY NICE LOOKING SET OF EARINGS MAKES A FINE GIFT.
5.0,A mi nieto le encanto
5.0,Just what I wanted for our Florida vacation. I do not usually order clothes that need to be tried on but I was happily surprised in the fit.
5.0,I’ve had these slippers since December. I absolutely love them! I get the arch support I need from these slippers. My feet get instant relief when I wear them. Highly recommend purchasing if you have planter fasciitis.
5.0,Favorite shirt
5.0,I gave this as a going away gift to my son's goalie coach who is being deployed for a year.  She loved it and put it on her dog tag chain to keep it with her.  It was very good quality and came packaged in a velvet gift bag.
5.0,Quality very good and size perfect.
5.0,"pretty, light summer dress good quality arrived on time."
5.0,"Super soft fabric. Thin, but warm nevertheless."
5.0,"I purchased this for my 12 year old daughter a couple of months ago, she is still Wearing it every day… great gift for math lovers…"
5.0,"Just like it says in the description. I'm 5'4'' and have a 31 in wait and it fit well, with a little looseness in the arms and legs, so it might stretch a few more inches out on the waist. And woah, this company sent it so fast! Fastest I've ever gotten something from China!"
5.0,"Purchased for my daughter, she loves it!! Very cute and she gets compliments on it all the time!"
5.0,I have been wearing these reefs for years! I love these flip flops! No other flip flop can be compared to these!
5.0,Perfect for a bunny themed baby shower
5.0,"Popped right in with no issue. Work well, and half the price of the OEM. Can't beat it!"
5.0,"It is now my bag for short trips. It has plenty of room to fit all necessary cloth for 3-4 days. I absolutely love the special section for shoes, it easily can hold 2-3 pairs. Bag can be used as a carry on bag and fits nicely into the overhead compartment on a plane. It is light and at the same time has a stylish pattern and looks good."
5.0,cute and soft. Size  6 -18 mo
5.0,Good Material fit right
5.0,Very cute coverup or dress.  Fits true to size and gives arm coverage.
5.0,Very comfortable! Love this for hanging around the house. It does run large though. Would fit better if I had gone down one size.
5.0,Súper comfy and easy to use
5.0,"I’m not sure how much this review will help anyone that wants feedback on this to use on a fence post, but it was absolutely perfect for using as a cap for a citronella lamp. I took an empty Patron bottle and put some atones in it with citronella lamp oil and a tiki wick fed through a washer. When it’s lit you can’t blow it out and I needed a cover to put over the flame. This fits the neck of the Patron bottle perfectly. I first spray painted it with high heat Krylon then a bronze color over that. I can’t seem to upload the pic “Right side up” but you get the idea I’m sure."
5.0,"super cómodos, ajuste perfecto, agradable diseño."
5.0,I ordered these for myself and love them. My daughter saw them and ordered 2 for herself.
5.0,Great product. Fast shipping! Thank you!
5.0,so pretty!!!
5.0,"I have been wearing this off and on for several days and after washing it a few times I decided it was a good time to leave a review.<br /><br />I use this for yoga and for home based workouts. I also have a toddler so I need something that actually holds my hair back without tearing it. I wasn't sure if this was going to work because frankly most of these types of headbands slip or fall off after a bit of activity. Here's what I found and the key points I want to pass onto a potential buyer.<br /><br />1) It stayed in place in at least three of the positions I used it in. One was as a traditional headband, one was as a open head covering (just covering from the front of my hair to the back), and one was as a headband/ponytail holder but the not traditonally. What I mean by that is I sort of cupped my hair in the back of the headband, pulled it back up, and made it look like a traditional headband option. It stayed in place throughout the day with no issue.<br /><br />2) It isn't hot at all. I had no issues with being too hot or sweating with it just because I had it on. It looks heavier than it is and it is very lightweight. It doesn't feel like traditional spandex styles.<br /><br />3) It doesn't retain odor at all. There were a few days that I did a heavy workout and expected that smell to get in the band and it didn't. It wicked away the swat and stayed cool without stinking.<br /><br />4) You can hand wash it and hang it to dry. I tried the washer once and the hand washing several times. The handwashing was quick, easy, and it did just as well."
5.0,"AWESOME deal for these cute, stylish earring! Definitely a 5 star! Kept most and gave 2 pairs as gifts. I would buy again from this seller."
5.0,5 stair one piece swimsuit! Got many compliments and fit well.
5.0,EXCENTE VESTIDO DE NIñA
5.0,"Cute, fits great"
5.0,Love these shirts.
5.0,Very cute and trendy !! Lightweight large selection of colors
5.0,Love it .
5.0,"This is a very nice Workout Waist Cincher.  I did receive it at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />The latex fabric makes it thick and durable.  It also makes it very moldable so it is possible to actually move and work out while wearing it.  It has three rows of hooks available for adjustments.  The hooks themselves are also very durable.  The pink color is also quite cute. And even despite how long it takes to get all the hooks fastened, it really is a nice product."
5.0,Excelent watch
5.0,"My very expensive sunglasses just broke, so I needed a pair ASAP. These actually look much nicer than the overpriced pair I had before. These are now my go to sunglasses. 😎"
5.0,"I got this coat for a lightweight fall/spring jacket.  It's really cute and fits great.  I went by the size chart when I ordered and the size I normally wear.  It is lightweight, so it's great for cooler evenings, but won't provide much warmth for colder weather.  It's made from polyester, so it doesn't have any stretch to it.  It does have stretchy bands around the wrists and waist though.  It fit really well and I wore it with a long sleeved t-shirt; however, it would be too tight to wear anything heavier under it.  I would consider ordering a size up if you are planning to do so.  The patch on the sleeve is a cute addition and gives it a little something extra."
5.0,"Totally cute sweater that I can wear on themed Christmas days at work and still look fashionable. Typically, I wear one of my husband's t-shirts... this is so much more fun. I like that is oversized...I normally am a woman's XL. This is a large and I still have room. It is 100% cotton so I have washed in cold and dried flat... scared how much it could actually shrink if I tossed it in the dryer."
5.0,"i wear these toe rings at the dojo since i am bare footed. these are cute and give a nice finished look.  i have not had any of them break, fall off or get thin, they are made to fit various sizes of toes!"
5.0,Very soft and cozy. Washed well too!
5.0,Beautiful rosary bead.  Well put together and completely satisfied.
5.0,"It fits comfortably, non-spanx like; however over time, the bottom sleeves start curling up."
5.0,"I bought this for my daughter to cosplay, it’s sizing is great, and better than expected, it’s not fancy but the material is soft, I will be wearing it myself as an over shirt style and it can be used as a robe, it’s not short but the length will work well even as a swim coverup. I would recommend for the price is great"
5.0,"Great product, but an even better vendor. Had personal issues with the first pair I ordered, returned them and had new ones in a couple weeks. Painless. Returns/exchanges have been my biggest issue with Amazon vendors, but these folks were seamless. Will definitely buy from them again.<br />The glasses themselves are a little on the heavy side if you are used to RB's or Oakley's, but they are solid and fit perfectly. Great price for well made aviators."
5.0,I love them. They are a little bit loose for me so i need to have the adjusted.
5.0,Looks amazing and so shiny beautiful ring
5.0,Me encanto!! Muy lindo los colores son como la foto.
5.0,Beautiful dress but was too small.
5.0,Material is nice thick and very comfortable.
5.0,"Love it.. i got “small” . Im 123 pounds, 5’2” .. 34 DDD."
5.0,This hoodie look just Like the website photo. The size was as expected.
5.0,Great purchase! Quick delivery and good customer service. Strap looks wonderful. It's a Christmas gift for my daughter so we haven't used it yet on her ukulele but still pleased with purchase!
5.0,"My husband wears a lot of baseball hats to work and this is great to make sure that after they are washed they keep their shape. I dont ever dry his hats in the dryer and this is great because it is open enough to make sure the hat still air dries, but it also keeps the shape of the hat."
5.0,"Engagement gift, great product"
5.0,All I can say is I love it thank you it matches a lot of my clothing and it's light enough for taking to church and light enough that if you've got to go out in the cool of the morning it's good I like it thank you I may order it in another color not sure still deciding
5.0,"I love ""Uncle Scrooge"", I grew up reading and watching Disney comics.  My favorite comic books were the long adventures, all over the world, of Uncle Scrooge with Donald and the nephews.<br />The shirt is really cute and appears to be well made. I am a woman, small in size, and unfortunately even the men's small size is too big on me, too bad!<br />I will add the shirt to my collection of Disney's Uncle Scrooge and the Duck family."
5.0,I need another pair!!
5.0,"So I ordered a cosplay from another seller and it came and it looked cute however they didn't finish the bust part so I was disappointed. The person I bought it from had no reviews on the product so I was the first one so I was hopeful. However when I went back to the item it was gone. They took it off the listing so I got played. Con was within a week so I ordered this being hopeful and it came on time since I did prime shipping and im so thankful I got it. It fit well and I felt so cute in them. I got so many compliments and pictures taken of me at the con. It's really well made. The dress fit nicely, the gloves and cuffs are nice and the crown is a plush like material but I used the crown from the first purchase, that one was a hard material maybe made out of wood so that was a nice touch... the only complaint I have is that the zipper gets stuck at a certain point so it's hard to zip up but once you get it it's fine. That's the only thing. I would definitely recommend this cosplay if you want to do boosette."
5.0,I really liked them. Fit perfectly
5.0,"Love the look of the sweater. My son says it’s comfortable and not heavy to wear. Bought for my younger son. My older son liked it so much, I had to buy him one, too.  Thank you, Kid Nation, for making truly unisex clothing with cats on it. It is a drag that most children’s clothes with cats are pink or purple with glitter. Boys love cats, too!"
5.0,I bought these shoes in December 2009.  I also got the black pair.  They are my go-to booties all winter and into early spring.  Butter soft leather and super comfortable.  Would definitely buy these again but I don't need to because they still look new.
5.0,Fitted to size love the color just what I wanted
5.0,Good sock. My brother loved them.
5.0,"Outstanding customer service!  I had a small problem that they went out of their way to fix, and now my ring is better than before!  I will return here again, along with my girl friend, which may only be a bad thing for my wallet.  But with everything she orders, she is the talk of the office.  I win from that too!  You will not be disappointed."
5.0,Love all these earrings. Great selection!
5.0,Belts are sturdy and hold very well.  They are unique and definitely a good purchase.
5.0,This was a gift to a realtor. She LOVED it!!!!
5.0,"My son is graduating and I got this for him so it's always with him when he goes to college. And, it's not something he will be embarrassed of!"
5.0,This is cute and comfy for my son. He loved it and it looked really good on him. It’s kinda like an oversized style but looks really good and warm.
5.0,"No puedo usar metal en mi trabajo y estos bras fueron lo que buscaba, son suaves, comodos no te cortan la piel y mi busto se ve muy bien."
5.0,Me encantas estas sandalias!!<br />Hermosas y súper cómodas!
5.0,"Worked perfectly very quickly. I was sick when I got something that looked like black oil on my brand new $160.00 gray suede Dansko clogs before I ever even got out of the house! This,  along with a suede/nubuck brush got it out and no one will ever tell.  Fast ship with Prime, too."
5.0,"I seriously did NOT expect it to be this adorable for the price. I want one in every color now. Order by the measurement chart, not what you think your size should be. I normally wear an XL, their chart put me at a 5XL so that's what I ordered and it fits beautifully."
5.0,My husband loves this shirt. The material and fit are very comfortable but it's a great style too.
5.0,I bought 2 of these watches for my husband. One in two tone yellow gold and silver an the other all silver. They were beautifully made an come in a box that was brown an had a card of authenticity inside. The small crystals inside are very bright an eye catching. There was only one issue he cannot get the two tone watched sized properly due to the clasp being &#34;in the way&#34; but the other one was easily sized.
5.0,"It's cute and I really like how it came with both a left and right earring. After multiple days of wearing it, there was no tarnishing or greening so the surgical steel designation is likely true (which isn't always the case for earrings). The 16g was a little large for my holes but after a few days of discomfort, my ears are back to normal and loving the new earrings.<br /><br />However in under 10 days of usage, the little gems began falling out of the left earring. But the customer service representative at Candyfancy was awesome and a new one should be getting sent, which is why I'm bumping up my stars back to 5/5."
5.0,Love these they look good and they work great
5.0,"A nice quality snowboarding jacket, the fit is fantastic. Wonderful color and graphics, and feel.  Fast shipment. Thanks!"
5.0,Solid piece of jewelry.
5.0,It's a very nice dress.I really glad I bought it . IT'S Beautiful.
5.0,I waited a year for the price to drop. These are amazing shoes.
5.0,These were slightly too big in XL for me but I really like them otherwise. I usually wear USA size 14.
5.0,Very pleased with the masks!
5.0,Purchased this for a Bar Mitzvah gift. This is what he wanted and he loves it. The quality is good. Quick shipping. Would buy from them again
5.0,"My waistline fluctuates during the course of a day.  So the waist of my jeans is sometimes perfect, sometimes big enough that I have to keep pulling them up.  So I looked for a very slim elastic belt with an easy buckle to do and undo to keep my jeans up during the times of the day when the jeans waist is too big.  When my waist gets bigger after a meal, the elastic belt gently stretches and is still comfortable."
5.0,I didn't have any dislikes. It was great!
5.0,I really like these
5.0,Easy to use and grips bar well.  I bought two more.
5.0,"I have to agree with the high ratings on these especially for the money.  I've paid more for lesser headbands.  Colors, fit and density all great!"
5.0,This dress is awesome. I loved it.  It came as expected.  Fits perfectly . I had to purchase 2

5.0,Works great.  Quick delivery.
5.0,Great quality! My four year old loves his Pete the cat sunglasses.
5.0,"Exactly like the pictures and description! These are the most soft, stretchy, and comfortable yoga pants I own now. The pockets are great and don’t sag when you have your phone or other items in them. They go up past my belly button and are extremely comfortable on my waist line. They shipped instantly and the colors match the picture exactly. Couldn’t be more happy, will definitely be ordering in more colors! Great price and great quality!"

5.0,Bought these for a little girls bday. She absolutely loved them!!<br />Buying 2 more pair for my daughter and niece!
5.0,Fits well on my Basis Peak watch! The only problem is that it does not come with the pins.
5.0,Love it very much it's very stylish.
5.0,"Great fit! Great look! And the fabric is so soft, its perfect for all seasons. I am getting more colors."
5.0,"These shows are so adorable. They run a little big, but that gives my daughter more time to wear them."
5.0,Love the tie. Don't like knit ties that are too thick and bulky which make for a bulky knot once tied. The thickness of the Tiger tie is perfect which makes for a better looking knot. Will be purchasing more colors now that I have &#34;test-driven&#34; the grey one. Am looking forward to my next purchase...great purchase!
5.0,Very comfortable boots!  Soft leather and feels like you're wearing slippers!!
5.0,The shoes is beautiful and came in timely. My grand daugh love it but its 1 size bigger. Anyway she said she'll grow into it and didn't  want to return.
5.0,"The value on these is amazing they are every bit the same quality as sunglasses costing 5 times as much.  Sturdy construction, sleek look, and comfortable.  Could not be happier with the purchase."
5.0,Seem to be good quality for the price. Haven't wore them yet but don't expect any problems.
5.0,great bargain!  I wear a 36 dd and these fit great

5.0,"I was hesitant to order this brooch without seeing it but wow!  It is stunning.  Perfect size for my occasion, beautiful piece."
5.0,"These pants appear to be well made.  They have been washed and dried twice with minimal shrinkage.  I need a long rise.  Perfect.  Could be an inch longer in the legs but adequate.  I am 5'9&#34; tall, 150 lbs and bought a large.  If you like 'em baggy get an XL.  Can recommend."
5.0,"These are so adorable.  I hand washed the first time but forgot the 2nd time and the pink on the ears washed away , hung to dry but still very cute."
5.0,Cool and professional looking.  I love it
5.0,The dudes are great!!
5.0,Most excellent pair of sunglasses!
5.0,"I use this as an apple watch strap. I really like the rally style so I've tried a few different leather bands and they've all fallen apart or were otherwise low quality junk. I like carbon fiber, but not typically on my watch band. I gave it a try though and it looks much better in person. It's a solid band and I'm quite happy with it 5 months later."
5.0,"I wore it to my baby shower.... I got so many compliments. It was perfect. Yes, it is very thin and see-through material so you will need to wear something under. Other than that, it was perfect for my bohemian look."
5.0,It fit perfect and the quality was good.
5.0,"This bracelet is lovely and even prettier in person, and arrived ahead of schedule! It is very moldable for a custom fit. I really like the info the company included regarding the Native American historical inspiration for the design. Best of all it’s made in the USA ❤️🇺🇸💜 It’s too soon to to comment on whether it will help with my arthritis but my fingers are crossed! This would make a wonderful gift too 😊"
5.0,"Beautiful dress, I will buy more once I lose 15 more pounds. I am currently 215, and I ordered the XL, but I have a gut and no but, which means this dress didn't flatter me...yet! I highly recommend this dress to all flat tummy ladies!"
5.0,Going on a Disco Cruise. Costume theme nights!
5.0,really cute nicer quality then expected
5.0,"I wear this ring every day.  It is very comfortable,and I especially appreciate the adjustability aspect of it.  Plus since I drive some of the most heavy traffic in our area, it helps me keep my cool."
5.0,"Exactly as described, I’m blown away at the quality and quantity for the price I paid. I’m in love with each and every set. Thank you"
5.0,"We have been/will be wearing masks since before the pandemic and afterwatd die to my husband's health. I have about 35 masks plus 50 disposable ones. This one, and another one are by far my favorite!<br />If you have to wear a mask, choose a fun one which also provides a pocket for your filter."
5.0,"Love, definitely recommend."
5.0,Absolutely love this Sherpa. Super warm and fits great
5.0,I just love this dress to death it is to die for I got the best compliments from it . I feel like I am queen of the Watermelons

5.0,Perfect for the pool or the beach<br /> fit perfectly
5.0,I love red and my girls gave me a Fitbit for Mother’s Day and I am so happy... great job!!!!  🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
5.0,"They are a lot cuter in person, and a lot more bling than the picture looks.  Love them!!"
5.0,"During this pandemic, I certainly have been dressing in comfy clothes almost on a daily basis.  These pants were ordered and delivered in a size Large and after trying them on, I wondered what country they were manufactured in because either I've put on more than the COVID 15 (lol) or have grown a few inches.  I'm 5'10"" and weigh approximately 200 lbs. and these were very tight around my abdomen and short a couple of inches.  If you are a bit smaller than my size, these will fit fine and feel absolutely wonderful on you.  The material is light and cool and the pants are well made.  I am working on getting rid of my COVID 15 lbs. and even if they aren't long enough for me after I do that, they will still be comfy to wear around the house with a t-shirt or long pajama top.  Definitely would recommend based on the quality of the product especially if you are a bit tinier than me!"
5.0,"very nice,great for walking and biking"
5.0,Great product but go up a size!
5.0,"The pendant is beautiful...but I decided to buy another chain for it because the one it came with was nice, but short."
5.0,Excellent hat. Rugged wool. Very thin but very hot. Much warmer than the ones in the store. The ruggedness allows it to grip on your head better too.
5.0,So ADORABLE!!!! and really nice for the price 👍🏼
5.0,I love it! Such great packaging. I use it all the time of course
5.0,I love these shorts! I am 5'7 and 147 lbs. I ordered the large and they fit perfectly. The linen is lightweight and falls very nicely. The elastic waistband is wide and double stitched to prevent rolling. They are well made and I would highly recommend them.
5.0,I love it. I needed a bucket hat for a specific purpose and this one works great while being stylish and not having that traditional bucket-style look. The brim is shapeable which is the mean feature I was looking for. It's long enough that it provides a decent amount of shade to the face without being unwieldy.  It has a cute design that includes a stylish bow. I purchased the gray color which is nice and subdued. It's very lightweight which is great for hot days.<br /><br />The only thing I would have added was a detachable chin strap. The hat is pretty lightweight and has blown off my head on windy days.
5.0,I purchased another ring from this seller and was very pleased with it and was looking for something else in the Celtic design. I do quite a bit of typing during the day so a thicker/wider band works better for me and this ring has that along with a beautiful design.  I wear it everyday and couldn't be more please with my purchase.  This is an excellent deal for your money!
5.0,Love this huge bag for weekend travel!  I have purchased these for graduation presents over and over again.
5.0,"I've received compliments on this skirt. The color is flattering, too"
5.0,I love these pants. They are super cute and they are so comfortable too! I have bought them in different colors too but this is my favorite!
5.0,"I love the material, the fit is perfect."
5.0,My husband really likes these boots. He was not a fan of uggs but he has had so many complaints and now he is a fan because they are incredibly warm and comfortable.
5.0,best thing I ever put in my briefcase
5.0,My boyfriend is always complaining about carrying his phone while he runs/works out so I was so excited to find these! The material is soft and stretchy!
5.0,"I ordered 3 of these for the little girls I nanny for. They all immediately opened their presents and put these on and walked around with them on. The girls are 34 months, 34 months, and 3 1/2. They came earlier than expected as well! I highly recommend."
5.0,"Product is expected, excellent."
5.0,"Good, not too hot but good when it’s cold. Comfortable and happy it comes in a variety of size and colors"
5.0,"This watch is beautiful! I bought it for my husband for His birthday- he loves it! It's actually a little bigger than I thought it would be, but it looks great! I also was unsure about the wood on a watch- it accents it beautifully"
5.0,Great Buy & Very Nice.
5.0,NIce looking and very soft inside.
5.0,My nephew loves them.
5.0,My grandson loves his new sandals!
5.0,"This is very comfortable and I love the colors! I do not do any running, so I can't say if this is real supporting (as being a sports bra), but for general walking around I can say it is very comfortable."
5.0,"I was pleased with the quality for the cost. I am 5'10&#34;so flats are a must because there is no extra length in the skirt. The turquoise color, floatiness of the fabric, and the movement are beautiful."
5.0,Gorgeous! I got so many compliments wearing this pin. It really dressed up a plain black outfit.
5.0,My daughter love it ..yes with quality and would love to buy again
5.0,"Fits great, great price, feels and looks nice."
5.0,These shows are TOO cute. I wear the. All the time and they fit just right!!!
5.0,"This is a pair of exceptional slippers for my kid. It is very soft, comfortable and warm pair of slippers that also have a very cute and solid rubber base. It seems to be very durable and can probably last for a few seasons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cute Design, My Kid Just Love It<br />2. Comfortable, Soft, Warm<br />3. Rubber Base Makes This Durable"
5.0,My daughter loves all this
5.0,"I wear it just about everyday and it fits perfect. I get a lot of good comments and compliments on it, so am quite satisfied!"
5.0,"This is my second purchase of these glasses. I sat on the first ones and broke them. Liked them so much, I ordered the exact same for a replacement. The lenses are very clear and the blue tint helps with the headaches from too much computer work."
5.0,"I wish I could give this more stars, because it's a ten-star piece!<br /><br />This design is soft and feminine without being &#34;girly&#34;.  A very classy necklace, imo, and perfect for all sorts of occasions.  Great for prom, for your bridesmaids, an elegant evening out, or just for hanging out in your jeans.  The pink roses are soft and warm, perfectly framed by the green leaves.  The little pear-shaped stones add movement, and the light just dances off of them.  If you're looking for a large necklace that is not over the top, this was made for you!<br /><br />It's articulated nicely to insure a perfect fit on your neckline, and the chain is adjustable.  The earrings are post and clutch, so pierced ears are required.  The earrings are quite heavy, even to me, and I normally don't mind heavier earrings.  I may convert them to a French hook, which would mean removing the top.section, thus lightening them.  I'll post my results here if I decide to do that.  I could then wear the tops as a stud-style earring, giving me two separate looks.<br /><br />The pinks are delicate, shading from very rich, deep.rose tones to the loveliest of carnation pinks.  The leaves are a vibrant spring green, complementing the pinks perfectly.  Every inch of this beauty is jeweled, so light frames your face, sparkling and winking, drawing the eye to your most important feature: your face.  There are a few pink opalite stones hiding here and there, adding to the overall opulence of this set.  Kiss Bling has outdone itself with this necklace...it's utterly gorgeous!  You will be the center of attention with this stunning set so wallflowers need not apply."
5.0,"It is well-crafted and has nice attention to detail -- the picture on the website shows some 'bleed over' from the gold stars onto the Celtic cords, but the real thing is much better than that -- the color processing was to fault and not the pendant. The runes do not say anything, it is merely the Younger Futhark alphabet used from AD 800-1100, (in sequence from 1 o'clock position to 12 o'clock). The 9 stars represent the Norse mythology concerning the Yggdrasil Tree of Life and its nine levels of Reality -- kinda reminiscent of the Kabbalah Sefirot. The Tree of Life has a Serpent at the bottom and an Eagle at the top and when the Serpent (kundalini) climbs the Tree and merges with the Eagle, one experiences enlightenment, or satori -- How did the Norse know about that?<br /><br /> It is a nice blend of Celtic and Viking/Norse symbology, and reminds me of how the Celts conquered a lot of Europe and later merged with the Norse tribes (against the Romans). The cross represents the Celtic conversion to Christianity (their version to be sure, as practiced by Druids?) and the Celtic weaving and circle symbolizes the continuity of life, or a soul existing in eternity. The 4 arms also represent the 4 basic elements: air, fire, water and earth.<br /><br />Except that the runes have been allegedly used for magical purposes since Medieval times, and that was NOT<br />their original use, I found nothing 'witchy' or spell-binding about the pendant. It is purely symbolic of a true seeker growing in spirituality and acknowledging the different levels of reality and even the 9 major chakras -- 7 in the body and one 2' above the head, and one 2' below the feet.<br /><br />It appears to be pewter/silver with gold accents, nicely done. My only complaint is the nice metal (silver?) chain that comes with it is only 22&#34; and I had to get a longer one  -- unless you like to wear it right at the base of your neck.<br />It was well-packed and came ahead of schedule; the vendor is on the ball."
5.0,Sooo...cute! Fits perfect.
5.0,"I purchased this as an assessory to compliment the Cleopatra costume I am going to wear for Halloween.  I have already worn it without the costume however and it has been a joy.  Please note that the chain around the finger is larger than it seems in the photo.  My hands are quite slim, so the snake falls lower on me than the photograph, but only because the finger chain is too big.  It still looks good the way it fits me however, it is just a little harder to keep it in exact place (not a big deal).  Not everyone will have this problem, I think that the size of your hand matter.  However I do think it is important to keep in mind the large finger chain.  The wrist chain is adjustable and that helps to keep the bracelet snake from moving around.  At any rate, I am happy with my purchase given the price as it looks a more expensive than what I paid for it.  For your information, the snake eyes on my bracelet are black.  Green would have been even better, but I am happy I bought it and I will wear it often."
5.0,Makes the shoe look a lot cleaner but obviously not new. Great product for shoe care.
5.0,I love them! They are super cute. They look exactly like the picture and are comfortable to wear. Easily adjustable to fit my ear.
5.0,Love the feel of the material and it looks great! I have a bigger bust and the top fits great and compliments them
5.0,The stone has a definite blue color and the ring is comfortable on the hand.  Very nice.
5.0,"These shoes are comfortable, give you some added height and look very 80s retro."
5.0,Great quality and good fit
5.0,"I bought this for a friend of mine for her birthday. She loves it! I inspected the bag before giving it to her and it was all as it said it would be. Looks like great quality, very classy. I might go back and get one in a different color for me! :)"
5.0,Fit and working perfectly with my SH56 cleats!! Great quality!!
5.0,"I love this tee shirt! The fit is just the way I want it and the saying on it is very sweet. It could be a softer material but, I still wear it often."
5.0,Looks & feels fabulous. Everyone loved it!
5.0,Bought this for Christmas and it already glitched and stopped working. Very unfortunate.<br />Otherwise good product. Wish it still worked
5.0,"I really enjoyed and this outfit, its very elegant and perfect for the summer. If you have large breast beware you might have to tie the top pretty tight to make sure the girls don't get out the skirt is more of a silk than a fabric but it does fit well."
5.0,My daughter loved this dress! It has very bright colors and thick stretchy material. I paid $39.99 and think that is a good price for it. She looked beautiful and the quality is great!!
5.0,"I bought this to use while cutting my 4 yr olds hair.  It worked great and no hair got on my floors.  I just carefully took it off him when I was done and shook it into my trash can.  Very easy!  I don’t think this would work well for my daughters long hair though, which is in the middle of her back.  Better for shoulder length hair or shorter."
5.0,"Good quality, cute necklace. They do come separate. They're adjustable so you can wear them tight on your neck or loose."
5.0,True to size. It's soft and comfortable. I love it! It will definitely be one of my frequently used lol.
5.0,Nice value and quality you may expect
5.0,The edges could have been enforced a bit more but other than that it’s a cute top. The matching necklace is a nice touch and makes it look nicer than without it.
5.0,"Simple yet gets many compiments! The gold color is very nice yellow too! No complains, just searching for matching earrings as it will look even better with them!"
5.0,It's light and very comfortable. My 18 months toddler wears them everyday. It has good grip.
5.0,Loved this dress!  Fit great and looked beautiful
5.0,Nice firm weave fabric for leisure or hard work.  It has a good fit appearance and after a few weeks of wear it is still looking great.
5.0,"I will be wearing this after labor as well! It is a great dress!!! So compfy and cute. I wear it with a sweater when its cold or wear with flip flops when its hot. love this dress, great material!"
5.0,"I love this! It comes with cord and a chain so it works with any outfit. It really is worth it. It feels real and genuine, not plasticy at all."
5.0,"I ordered this dress just as an &#34;in case something happens to a different dress&#34;<br />When I put it on, I realized THIS DRESS is the &#34;IT&#34; dress for my vacation!!!<br />Also the fabric is fantastically soft - the dress is everything I was looking for!"
5.0,Comfortable perfect bra AND matched the dress I bought to wear it with perfectly.  Bought it in navy and gray because it was so comfortable.
5.0,I feel just like Major Kira!
5.0,I measure myself before purchase. If you follow the measurements it will fit perfect.
5.0,Such a cute headband and the adjustability to it is just amazing
5.0,"I was very impressed with these earrings. I only wear loops. These are very pretty, extremely light weight. I was seriously considering ordering another pair just to have when these wear out. Hahahaha."
5.0,"The colors on this are beautiful. The packaging is great for gifting. I wasn't sure if the colors would be as nice as what was shown in the pictures, but they were even better. I've been burned before with colors not being true, but this was great. They go especially well with jeans. I've received several compliments on them. I highly recommend this item as a gift & get one for you too!"
5.0,"the mothers day gift arrived earlier  than expected, it is a lovely looking item very well coated brilliant sheen"
5.0,I love the way it fits my body
5.0,"I love this dress, runs a little large<br />I ordered a medium but could easily wear a small<br />Now if it washes well, I’ll order more<br />Very flattering"
5.0,"These are beautiful, high quality shoes. My four year old didn't have any trouble buckling them by herself."
5.0,"Just - WOW!!! I ordered the dress JQ4 because of V-neck, which I always like. When I got it I was pleasantly surprised. It is just stunning, absolutely unique and glamorous! Just one important detail - I will always wear it with wide leather belt, though maybe someone will like it that loose.  Nice bonus - comfortable pockets. Sizing: I'm 5'1, 155 lb, chest 38B. I ordered L, and it's too big for me in the chest - I'm not very busty. Well, with this dress it's an easy fix - just re-adjusted three buttons, that is it. The dress is really very lose, looks exactly like you can see on the picture. Just order your regular size, and it will be OK. Material: thick and heavy, but soft and drapes well. Feels like natural. I'm not sure, but I think it partially cotton, partially linen. Anyway, it looks very good and... much more expensive than it is. I got a question from my coworker: &#34;WOW! Is it designer's dress from Italy?&#34; Of course I said YES!!!"
5.0,Had looked for something lightweight like this for a while. Compartments are great. Easy to see what they contain. Well made. Hook comes in handy in hotel bathrooms.
5.0,Loved the coloring
5.0,I have looked for baby bonnets long and hard & this is the best I've found! The bonnet PERFECTLY fits a newborn's head. It's so feminine with it dainty stitching and frills & flowers. I'd buy more in various colors if they sold them. You can't miss with this bonnet.
5.0,This set is perfect! It’s got a bit of weight to it so it feels very sturdy and easy to close also. I love that they can be mixed up also
5.0,"nice product, fits right"
5.0,Absolutely perfect addition to my fan club wardrobe. Was delivered in a timely fashion and exactly as described at time of purchase.
5.0,Make more colors!!
5.0,"Very pretty, has nice weight to it and the chain that came with it is far better that I thought it would be. The clasp is a traditional hook style and seems of average quality. I do like that it slides off without catching so I can switch the pendant easily if I want to use a shorter chain.This is absolutely gorgeous. The silver decoration is a great compliment to the diamonds coming from the pendant and makes the necklace look very elegant. The pendant stays flat and stands out, always catching the light and sparkling. The way the pendant is cut the light is able to catch it from so many different angles, grabbing attention most of the time. The pictures so not lie in this sellers post. This necklace shines and sparkles so much, it even sparkles when there really isn't a lot of light on. It comes with an 18 inch chain, so you can wear it as soon as you get it. The chain is delicate yet strong at the same time. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"This defines the solid, classic athletic hoodie.  Very well constructed, lasts forever. Not fancy, no bling, just functional. I have a number of them in different colors and front styles."
5.0,"Daughter needed a dress for an event, saw this dress a fell in love with it. It was delivered quickly, came packaged well. No smells of perfume on the dress, and for someone with sensitives to fragrance I was so happy. My daughter looked beautiful and she felt beautiful. She's very busty with curves, and struggles finding dresses that are big in the chest, but not big everywhere else. The fabric blend of cotton and a bit of spandex remedies the dress looking like a momo or a sack.  The price fit my budget, was made well, and fits well  I couldn't be happier. I plan to get other dresses in the future. ♥️👗"
5.0,"I really don't wear this outfit too much, I'm a bit awkward"
5.0,"I bought this for someone, she loved it. She tested it on winter and she didn't want to take it of, even indoors. Highly recommended."
5.0,These sunglasses r fabulous makes u look like a million dollars they look expensive simply beautiful
5.0,Hands down one of the best rings i have ever purchased for a small cost! Came true to size and color!
5.0,"Well made, where a nude or white bra. Its not thin, but if my bra was red or purple, I think the bra might  have shown threw."
5.0,Fit well. Mine are large and I wear size 10 or 12. Very stretchy.
5.0,"happy customer, good product"
5.0,"Wore these to a red hat event, they looked great and are just my style."
5.0,Beautiful and high quality. Nice colors
5.0,Love them. Arrived exactly on time & look as described.
5.0,used them with my J's no creasing when I walk in them. it makes your shoes a little bit tighter but just loosen the laces a little and it was fine. does take little getting use to but it does do what it is suppose to do.
5.0,I just had cataract surgery so I was looking for a pair of sunglasses for a planned trip to SC in Nov.  These fit very nicely at a great price and I like that they have some wrap around to them to further protect the eyes.
5.0,beautiful​
5.0,"I love these earrings. They are perfect for what I needed. I have a second piercing that I only wear very small earrings in. These are TINY. In terms of size, they are about the size of a pencil eraser. For me, they are a wonderful accent piece. For others, however, they may be TOO small. Please understand, though, that the quality of workmanship in this jewelry is extremely high. These are durable and are made to last. I, for one, couldn't be happier."
5.0,Good thermal insulation and strong water absorption
5.0,"If you feel tired of the rubber feeling on your arm, this is the way to go.  It brings your watch to life."
5.0,"This is a super attractive swimsuit, that is so flattering.  I'm curvy, 38D-30-40 and the large fit me perfectly.  I have already ordered it in 2 other colors.  Highly recommend."
5.0,Very nice scarf that perfectly matches the Joules boots.
5.0,Love it!  Just what I wanted.  Exactly as described!
5.0,"This is a very soft, very comfortable tank top. The fit is loose and flowy but accurate for sizing. I received a small and it fit great. I washed this on Hot and dried it on High Heat with the rest of my whites, and there was no shrinkage. I would absolutely recommend this top."
5.0,Its perfect covers your ass and its not too heavy or hot i wear it to work with leggings and wedges
5.0,These are relatively large and seem to be very sturdy. I like to take them when I go grocery shopping and they work great. I have gotten quite a few compliments on them too.
5.0,I love this Bracelet it fits just right
5.0,The Pleaser Kiss-209Lt 6 Inch Stiletto Heel Ankle Strap Lite-Up Platform shoes worked better than I thought the would. They actually blink when you walk. what an attention getter.
5.0,This bag is nice and durable and it’s peefect to stick in your suitcase for a beach bag or a tote!
5.0,I LOVE LOVE LOVED this costume!  I looked hot!!
5.0,"I like this dress a lot! I’m 5’5”, 35” bust and the Medium fit great. It’s cute, comfortable and has pockets! I prefer the way it looks with a belt, otherwise I feel the waistline is too high. I’m very athletic so it’s been hard to find something flattering!"
5.0,"A bright and shining gift with sentimental value, perfect for everyday wear."
5.0,Love this band all around. The color and how secure it is are perfect. I get compliments on having a skinny band. Would buy again!
5.0,"Fast shipping and the product is as nice as described. Simple but pretty, not huge and showy.  Highly recommend this seller and great products!"
5.0,Love them! They were all soft and the color was very vibrant.
5.0,These are the cutest PJs and they make you feel very girly
5.0,Just like the picture absolutely love it. Big fan of Once Upon a Time
5.0,Very cute and easy to use
5.0,Perfect hat for upcoming trip to Mexico. This is the 2nd one I've purchased for my wife. The first was left poolside after a few too many margaritas at the swim up bar and she won't go back without another one! Lol
5.0,Great idea to have a pair of these for the winter even if you aren't going skiing!  I wanted some for when I had to go out in the freezing weather and shovel the drive and sure enough these were nice and warm and kept me protected from the elements.  The fit is fine but they are made for very tall folks.  I had to roll up the bottoms and will most likely need to be hemmed if you plan to wear them out in public.  I like the material and they're made well.
5.0,"I really love this head band, this one stayed in place my entire work out. It kept the sweet from dripping into my eyes, My hair from falling into my eyes. Very easy to clean and care for. I would recommend these for all your work out sessions!"

5.0,"A sweet loving reminder of our stillborn grandson, Malachi.<br />Nana T"
5.0,"I'm only a week into wearing this band with my Fitbit, but so for so good!  For the price it's really hard to beat.  Adjusting was easy with the hardware provided -- quite frankly I'm very surprised they're able to provide this at the price it is with the tools provided.  I already have a brass mallet and pins, but still a nice touch. Will update as it goes, but all in all very impressed."
5.0,Great gift for my daughter.

5.0,This is a great corset as it is sturdy and attractive for this price range. The product page has been updated with better sizing information.
5.0,arrived on time and packaged very well but when I tried to wear them they swallowed my face lol just saying this might just be my face shape so its not the product's fault just mine I guess...went ahead and gave it 5 stars because like I said It was probably just my face's fault not the product..so yeah order it if u think u might pass the big face challenge lol jk..best of luck gals!

5.0,"I like the patch very much. It was a perfect size to cover the company logo on a black work jacket. The design was Impressive, very impressive. Unique, yet a very subtle."
5.0,"I was leery of this bc the shoe name on the website was what I wanted but it was named &#34;Aimee&#34; at checkout. Not to worry, it was exactly the shoe I expected. It arrive quickly and it pristine condition. It fits like a wide Clark should (roomie) if you know the brand and sold for less than half the price of a TV shopping channel that had no wide widths. A cute, versatile bootie, so glad this site had it and so glad I found them."
5.0,I love them keep my feet warm.

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:2a616d7e4db1fb3e6898e7298b8cac19]] The most stunning badge holder<br />Something to make the customer and co-workers smile<br />Addendum: after using for a week, there have been instances where I have put too much pressure in the chain and the magnet separated.<br />Also the clip holding the small ring has uncoupled and I almost lost my badge 3 times.<br />But still so unusual, not willing to give up on it<br />Well it finally happened. It broke.<br />Clip failed.<br />Returning for a refund.<br />Too bad<br />Liked the idea made in USA"
5.0,These were the best for my son’s micky mouse themed birthday party. Very Good quality . Highly recommeded.
5.0,Just what I was waiting for!! Great fabric! Beautiful as in the pic. And very stylish. It also fits me as I expected.
5.0,the dress fit great and I love it
5.0,"Snug fit and warm. Excellent for touchscreens!  Great looking gloves, especially for the price!<br /><br />These are soft inside and out, and look expensive."
5.0,"I like these and for the price, great!"
5.0,Great compliment to my watch
5.0,This shirt is very pretty and well made. The print is truly a  statement. Didn't wash it yet but looks like it can be machine washed and hung to dry. It is well made and a true tunic. It is true to size
5.0,"I got this vest because the side straps were more adjustable than other vest which had a panel sides rather than straps. I'm skinny so the straps help it fit me better. I have 12h x 10w soft armor panels in mine and it fits fine, haven't tried with hard armor. Velcro and stitching had help up just fine over the year-ish I've owned it."
5.0,Runs small so order a size up to avoid it being too snug in the mid section. Overall great tunic style dress that is more A line than billowing. The sleeves are a perfect length for taller women. Thicker jersey knit fabric is a nice weight and not see through.
5.0,Was great....warm cute n cuddly kept me warm hands too was a great add to my holloween costume
5.0,Work as advertised. I have large hands and they fit fine.
5.0,"I bought the blue belt. Good look, and nice long-lasting quality.  Definitely worth purchasing.  And the price is reasonable without having to drive from store to store looking for one."

5.0,"Fit perfectly on me, exactly the size I needed."
5.0,Fits great! We have washed and dried it several times and there has been no shrinkage. I wash them inside out and also hang dry the shirt to avoid any cracking of the design. My daughter loves these jammies!
5.0,"I am really happy with this poster; the cloth-like material, the size, the Sanskrit mantras are all perfect. It had been a while since I practiced yoga and this poster is easy to view as a reminder of the Sun Salutation progression."
5.0,"I thought, for the price, you can't beat the cool look of this ring. come to find out i was wrong, because this ring was way cooler and shinier and looks WAY cooler in person than these pictures show. the ring is heavier than you would expect also. the only thing that could be better about this ring, and will definitely NOT inhibit its rating or the fact that i plan to buy many more products from this seller, is the fact that it could come in a few larger sizes. i purposely bought this ring for my pinky, but wouldn't mind having larger sizes for my other fingers. I'm a big guy so the largest size only fit my pinky, so just be sure that you know your ring sizes, obviously. lol ANYWAYS... freakin' awesome ring!!!"
5.0,"The product arrived on time, and I was able to start using it straight out of the box. I would order from this seller again. Great price and great fun."
5.0,Perfect fit👟👟
5.0,"I knew I was taking a risk at this price, but the photos on the listing looked relatively solid and they represented the style of helmet I was after.<br />When the helmet arrived I was elated! The rivets are tight, the thing is actually comfortable to wear and it looks freaking BADASS!!! Thank you Queen Armour!!!"
5.0,My son will love this Christmas gift!  Soft and long enough for tall men!!
5.0,"These pants are designed well and are well made. The pockets are all in good locations for both standing and sitting positions. The colors and pattern of the camouflage is very near to multicam, so there is no problem mixing this in with other multicam clothing and equipment. On sizing, if you are on the larger end of your size, I would recommend ordering the next size larger."
5.0,Necklace broke first time using it but nice piece
5.0,This was perfect for the anime convention! Loved it.
5.0,I love love love this dress. It is so cool and comfortable for this hot summer weather here in the Bahamas.

5.0,Higher quality piece than I had expected. The soft pouch included with the items was a really nice touch! My daughter loves her necklace. I charge it everynight for her before bedtime. Thank you!
5.0,fast delivery
5.0,I bought this hat for my 9 year old daughter and she LOVES it!! Cute and functional and oh so warm!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
5.0,works fine.  used to put key on to a lock.
5.0,"I really liked this dress! It fit perfectly. Does not feel too tight around the midsection. Perfect for a wedding, so you can eat alcohol the food, and not feel self conscious in the dress afterwards. The high-low is also very flattering. Color works well also. I am fairly larger chested, and this dress still made me feel comfortable."
5.0,Good gloves !  Better than knit !
5.0,I like the shirt awesome Nike product
5.0,I would purchase in every color. If you have a large butt than size up!
5.0,It is a convenient size and can be modified for many situations and needs.
5.0,"Beautiful Watch, very well finished, and exceptional quality, even the Diamonds are real, and comes with a certificate.  Macy's sells this Watch for $319.00 same identical Watch, so it a steal for this price.  Would highly recommend."
5.0,"Intricate, detailed, and true-to-size fit! Also, it doesn't turn my finger green, which is a nice surprise for a cheap ring. As someone with a ring obsession, it's part of my collection of favorites!"
5.0,"Very soft fabric- just runs a little big, doesn't shrink"
5.0,Very pretty necklace.  Stone is lighter than it appears but still very pretty.  arrived promptly
5.0,I was hoping this was going to look as good as the pictures were and it did!!  It really has a good weight to it and I love the intricate detail with the little shimmery squares.  It feels good to the touch and even though it's a thicker type of necklace it feels dainty - a refined quality about it.
5.0,I purchased these for my 13 year old son who is very picky about his clothes. He loves these shorts and wants them in every available color.
5.0,"NinaQueen makes some of the most high quality and beautiful sterling silver charms out there! I’ve purchased several charms from them and none of them have failed to impress me!! I purchased the Forever charm as a birthday present for my best friend and I know she’s going to love it! The colors on this charm are a vibrant blue with a hint of green on the ends which is a perfect color combination to me and also my bestie’s favorite colors. I love the detailing of the infinity signs on the charm. It’s also very sparkly in the light. Shipping was also super quick. NinaQueen has made me another satisfied customer, yet again :) I highly recommend this seller!!"
5.0,Very nice! Definitely recommend
5.0,Got these for my baefy and she absolutely loved them she was like OMG I love these they feel like walking on little clouds!! And I was like perf!! 😍🥰
5.0,Just as pictured. Fit as expected. Happy with my purchase.
5.0,fits great & quality made.
5.0,I wore this sassy fascinator to an all white event . DEB NOLA !!!! It was very lightweight and beautiful. I received a ton of compliments and it stayed in place as I danced the night way
5.0,Me encantó el estilo y la calidad de la prenda. Viste mucho. Me enamore de este vestido. Gracias!!! Lo recomiendo! 😍👍🌸
5.0,Great quality! My son loves it!
5.0,"These earring jackets make old studs look like new earrings, and the drop earrings can be worn alone. I have worn the jackets both in front of my ear lobe and behind. Both ways look stunning."
5.0,Very soft and accurate sizing
5.0,"I'm a total snob when it comes to jeans-  Diesel and G-Star are my favorites, but tried these on a whim since I couldn't find skinny white jeans/5-pocket.  The white is more of a lightweight twill than denim, but the fit is perfect-  definitely skinny and tight at the ankles which I wanted.  Great price-  I bought a couple of the blue jeans for my partner to try as well.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
5.0,This is perfect for a 7 year old. It fit and looked really nice. Price was great for this bathing suit.
5.0,I love 90 Degree activewear. I have several pair.
5.0,Fits great on my bras. Great deal
5.0,"9 months pregnant, looking for some comfy underwear to use now and postpartum. These are definitely light and breathable. They do ride much higher than your typical bikini cut. Can't speak to my belly button because I'm a pregnant whale right now, but they come about 4 inches over my (excuse me) butt crack which would definitely NOT be cool if I wasn't already wearing high waisted maternity pants. They work for me though!"
5.0,So much better than the more popular brands... which have all descended into a level of marginal quality... but not this brand.
5.0,"Work great, look super cute! I gave some as gifts and kept others for me ;) They work well and are super sparkly!"
5.0,Firs every single one of my travel items with enough pockets to keep things organized. Looks a little like a circus tent wish it came in different colors but at least I probably won’t leave it in the hotel
5.0,Love the fabric and the way it fits
5.0,This shirt is soft and I will definitely buy another one.
5.0,I ordered an XL. Pretty and exactly what I wanted. I did notice slight fading after 4-5 washes though....
5.0,Great headband. Bright and doesn't slip.
5.0,Perfect little or midsize bags
5.0,Very nice shirt fits vreat
5.0,This bag is really nice. It looks exactly as shown
5.0,"Okay, this is an INFPs dream shirt. If an INFP was a shirt, THIS would be it. Lol I'm very introverted and could careless for people, so, this has EASILY become my FAVORITE shirt. Only suggestion, SIZE UP!<br />I expected it to be a bit smaller because of the reviews about sizing but, for me, it fit okay. It's a little tighter in the arms but, it's nothing to complain about. 🥰"
5.0,They are cool. Didn't seem to bother my ears from what ever metal they are. I don't use them to often though as the spikey ones hurt my head trying to sleep with them in. Their decent earrings though.
5.0,"I ordered a large so that it would be a bit loose since I was purchasing to wear to a funeral. I am 5'8&#34; and just under 150lbs with a 36C bust, the large did fit well but was a little tighter than I had expected but not overly(no pulling fabric and still a tiny,tiny bit loose) and hit about an inch below my knee.The material stretched for comfort but formed back to its fitted shape. I am satisfied and very happy with my purchase especially considering the price. One word of caution if you have a larger breast (like DD and up) I could see how the material could fit rather tight around your chest."
5.0,Excellent price and function.
5.0,Very nice for the price.  I wore it to the Belmont.  Simple but sophisticated.
5.0,I brought them for a friend and she love them. Even though I you order a 1/2 size larger then you wear they fit perfectly.  I will be ordering a pair  for myself and my daughter. Excellent choice.
5.0,I really LOVE this bracelet!  My husband got it for me for Valentines Day!  I fell in love immediately and it goes perfect with my necklace he got me years ago.  This is truly a great buy!
5.0,"Comfy, great quality and price was awesome.  Its a simple baggy tee… and I love it!  I need more in different colors"
5.0,Perfect dress up dress!
5.0,Identical to product description. LOVE IT !!
5.0,Very unusual. It was for a gift and was a hit.
5.0,Great watch for the value. I don't know why but I love the analog/digital combination on watches. The glow/light feature is awesome. I needed a watch to see in the dark and to give me the date. This watch looks really cool and does all of the above for less than $30.
5.0,"I was skeptical about ordering these earings because there were no reviews, but I’m so glad I did! They are beautiful and comfortable! I already worn two pairs and they didn’t hurt my ears. They are pretty light except for the snake and twisted hoop design. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"I use this in the office. Perfectly fits my work phone, ID, a lipstick and cash. I can go from meeting to meeting and have everything I need on hand."
5.0,Ordered three more love so much.
5.0,I love these pants. Got a denim version and hoping a size 8 in the white will become available. So comfy!
5.0,We bought this for our grand daughter. She LOVES it. One of the reviews I read mentioned that the buttons were too difficult to button. We had no problem. Really cute jacket .
5.0,love these!! can't wait for summer. not see through whatsoever and super flattering color!
5.0,Great fit and arrived ahead of schedule!
5.0,I wanted it to be oversized and yes it is it’s so comfy 😍😊 I’m happy with it ✌🏼😂

5.0,I love the color and quality! Amazing!
5.0,Great fit and work well. Helps save the environment.
5.0,Runs true to size I order my normal size and was a great fit! It’s a lighter weight but super comfy!!
5.0,"I got them so quickly. They were well wrapped, the green suede case is beautiful. Came with authenticity certificate and carry case. Perfect."
5.0,"G-shock, solar, and Bluetooth is the trifecta for a great wrist watch. The Bluetooth is a bit tricky to set up but once you get it going with the “Casio watch” app is well worth it and a great value.  It can even find your phone for you. Being solar is key as you will most likely never have to open it up.  And G-shock for all the outdoors people lives up to the hype.  This watch is also slim and lightweight. Wish it was a different shade of green but all in all this a great value and a great simple but sophisticated watch"
5.0,Great quality steel
5.0,Fast delivery and thx for the gift
5.0,"I got so many compliments on this that I had to write a review - I wore the red color to a holiday party and it was absolutely perfect for that. Everyone loved the color, the cut - people were saying it looks really classy and they were blown away when I said I got it on amazon. I would definitely order again - I might even get it in black!"
5.0,Great jacket for the price!
5.0,"Beautiful classy.<br />Everyone needs one, looks wonderful over a white or light pink dress"
5.0,"This dress was recommended by a friend. I ordered it first in the beige and mustard yellow. Both unfortunately were see-through. I tried again in the red/maroon size large. It fits very nicely. I usually wear an XL but I tried one of the other colors in XL and it was hanging on me. The large is fitted on top but perfectly loose on the bottom, hides what needs hiding and makes me look slimmer. It's comfortable and has enough material to gather around you when you sit. Standing it hits a few inches below my knees. I'm 5&#34; 6. Overall, a great dress. I would probably get another one in a dark color."
5.0,"I’m 5’4 130lbs 34D and ordered a size M<br />Love this dress!! I was worried that the bust area would be too small but the whole top part is adjustable and could go smaller or bigger, comfortably. Length on me is about mid thigh and the material is a quality and stretchy-like material. This dress is snug where it needs to be and I feel so cute in it!! It’s not too casual or too fancy."
5.0,This is one of the cutest pair of men's shoes I have ever seen. Excellent quality too. My guy usually wears US size 8 and UK size 6 fits him perfectly. Very happy to find this pair for him.
5.0,Have not had to use but test was very good in its results.
5.0,"This is the perfect bag to wear to football and basketball games.  Great for the water park or anywhere you need to protect your phone from getting ""splashed"".  Stylish and functional."
5.0,"This is beautiful.  Well made, nice quality!"
5.0,Love my case. Everything the description said it would be.
5.0,"I love it, especially the fact that I can take links out to fit my tiny wrist. Update: the band tarnished and leaves my wrist green."
5.0,Beautiful and just the right length.
5.0,I would definitely recommend!!!
5.0,"This is a really cute tank top. Very soft material. Definitely true to size! I sized up to an extra large, normally wear a large. It’s a little big but will be great to work out in. Love the design on the front. Seems well-made, not cheap. Recommend!<br /><br />Have a great day! 😁"
5.0,I love the gloves
5.0,"I have around 5 Vests and 2 SCOTTeVEST Men's Essential 2.0 Jacket Vest and have been wearing some for a couple of years. I use my older ones for working in the yard, so I can hold things like rags, water, glasses etc. I wear the nicer ones as for travel and everyday . I can have my phone in the outside chest pocket and my wallet in the other side vest pocket. I use the inside pockets as my (male purse) to carry meds, supplies and other things I like to have near me. I use the bigger pocket to hold papers, like when leaving a Doctors office or carrying to post office. The best use is to standardize which pockets you use for what items so it becomes routine to find. This year I bought a Tan SCOTTeVEST Men's Essential 2.0 Jacket Vest so I could have the vest but have sleeves. I bought one of casual clothes and a Tall Black for a raincoat over a suite jacket. I think these are amazing, comfortable, reliable, invaluable and well worth the money."
5.0,I love these t-shirts. Very comfortable and reasonably priced. These are on the thin side but very comfortable and perfectly light weight for summer.
5.0,Is so perfect! Looks super elegant
5.0,"I love that these are unisex. They look great on both my husband and myself. They seem to fit good and so far I haven't had to make any adjustments. These are a really great design and right in style. I did receive these for free, but these are my honest opinions."
5.0,Looks really good on my fiancé and made with great material
5.0,It’s all good
5.0,I received a lot of compliments. beautiful set.
5.0,I bought the gray ones and so soft and comfortable. Will buy again in black for work. They will never know they are slippers! and my feet wont hurt at work anymore. I wear them outside as well.
5.0,I'm obsessed with these leggings! Soft like LLR but the price is much better. I love them so much that I just ordered another pair. I like that they are somewhat high waisted to avoid the muffin top.
5.0,".it is exactly as pictured. I purchased 3.<br />This one was for me.<br />Unfortunately, it will not work for me. I don't like my ears to be covered except in winter when outside.<br />I am sure if I could wear over my ears it would fine.<br />That is reason for 5 stars."
5.0,Good buy. Comfortable.
5.0,I ordered a small and it came in as a large. It was a little loose but that could be fixed with a few safety pins. Overall it’s a good cosplay and I recommend it! TikTok p0ssum.party

5.0,"I love these pants. So soft! I’ve bought other colors, too. I work from home now so I needed more pants like this. Because who wears real pants anymore? They do run a little large but I wouldn’t get a smaller size."
5.0,excellent product and quality.
5.0,This necklace is super cute and great quality. I bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it! Highly recommend it to anyone who loves sloths!

5.0,"Well made, comfortable and lots of cushioning.<br />Price was great!"
5.0,It works very well and easy to use.
5.0,Love it military time and regular time all in one plus water proof💕
5.0,I love this bag!!! The image is accurate.
5.0,"I bought these for myself, I've been very into ear cuffs lately and these looked so pretty. They aren't too fancy nor too plain so they go with everything, they are lightweight and of course, being ear cuffs, you don't need pierced ears to wear them.  So far they have stood up to my wearing them as they are still as shiny as the day I got them, no tarnishing or color changing. I give them 5 stars and will probably buy them in gold!"
5.0,I purchased these boots for a production of Les Miserables.  They will be of good use for this production and future productions.

5.0,What a great buy! I’ve used this many times over. I used to win and put it all back. Now I come home with most of my winnings. Sometimes I use to reduce the amount I play when I’m not winning. Works for blackjack chips also.
5.0,Love the colors. It was a excellent choice for a day at festival .
5.0,Bought for 5 year old.  Bought bigger size on purpose.  Fits as expected.
5.0,Impressive tshirt!
5.0,"I needed something like this for a costume, and literally all the ones I was finding were reviewed with comments like ""this is waaaay too small"" and ""I ordered three sizes up and it still doesn't fit"". So as someone with a large chest that makes buying things like this challenging already, I was feeling a little like I was going to never find anything that fit. Took a gamble, and this was PERFECT!! I am so excited!"
5.0,Enjoyed it

5.0,"For the price I’m going to give it 5 stars. But they do feel cheap, but they will do. Definitely digging the pockets."
5.0,Beautiful ring! The picture doesn’t do it justice. Really a well made ring!!! Very very pleased with this purchase and seller!
5.0,These are the most flattering leggings. I ordered many from Amazon and returned most until i bought these. I ordered 3 pairs now and will order more. I'm 5 3 athletic and weigh 133lbs. I ordered a small.
5.0,We received this in exchange for an honest product review and she truly loves it. Perfect size and the color is just what she loves. It really seems very well made and we are very satisfied. We like Belfen's wallet line so much that we have in past purchased. Most recently purchased the Belfen (Soft Leather) Watermelon Red Smartphone zipper wallet and was equally satisfied with the quality. We would buy from them again!
5.0,Like that was adjustable. My wife's wrist are small so this worked well
5.0,"Purchased for my son as the holes on regular belts get worn out. This belt is the perfect solution. I did not cut it yet but he has worn it once and it was very nice. I probably will not cut it until he gets older. He is 14, thin build and 5 foot 9. Good purchase and worth the money."
5.0,Absolutely love these! I don’t have pierced ears but really wanted to have nice ratings for a special event.  Everyone thought they looked beautiful and people were shocked when I told them they were clipons.
5.0,Love it absolutely adorable
5.0,"Love the colors.<br />Got so many compliments. Quality is not that great but for a summer dress, it’s good enough."
5.0,"I ordered a Large deep purple sweatshirt.  (normally wear a women's M, but wanted a roomie, cozy sweatshirt )<br />Wow, love the intense deep purple color, and washed & dried it separately for the 1st wash. Came out great & such a soft inner lining.<br />In fact I like it so much, I will order another color as soon as I finish this review!<br />cheers!"
5.0,"I bought these shades as a gift for my mother. With the price range available, this is probably the best shades available in amazon right now. After doing some research, I found this shade which I was very impressed when I first saw it. After reading some reviews, I decided I would give it a try. The item came quick and my mother seemed very happy when she got them. Don't be fooled with the cheap price because the material did not really seem to look cheap. I got the 65 millimeters lens width since 67 millimeters was not available. I am not really sure how big of a difference 2 millimeters makes, but I am happy with the purchase of this product."
5.0,These are great for work. They are tight around the face yet very breathable. Even when your in a bad mood you always show a smile.
5.0,"I wanted to buy a day-to-day necklace, and came to this one for its simple, elegant design. The necklace came in two days, and with good quality. I’ve been wearing it since."
5.0,"A classic.  I just bought it to use for an exam, but I actually think it looks nice."
5.0,Fits perfect and is exactly what I wanted/needed
5.0,"I can’t believe I’m giving an AS SEEN ON TV item five stars!! Fit my door perfect, adjustable bag holders to my liking, withstood the open & close door test . Maybe put heavier material bags on bottom hangers. Other than that, I want more!!"
5.0,My man wore it and it worked fine. It was awesome. I would buy this again. My man had no problems with it.
5.0,Works well. Spring tension is good. Love the colors.
5.0,This pash is super soft and did it’s job! I love it! 💕
5.0,Super cute and easy!
5.0,I bought this for my husband and he loved it. It is well made and we loved the color.
5.0,"My son was quite envious of his sister's fun flippy sequin shirts, so we were thrilled to find one that was dinosaur-themed.  He loves it, and it has held up well over several months."
5.0,Great for pajama night with the family or pajama night with the girls!
5.0,Perfect compliment to my Gatsby dress.
5.0,"I usually wear a size 10 in shoes and flip flops, I always have to size up to 11 for yellow box flip flops. Other than that, they are the best flip flops, I won’t buy any other brand!"
5.0,This dress is very comfortable and becoming on. Glad I got it!
5.0,Excellent merchandise and fast delivery.
5.0,"Awesome shades for the money. Can't wear them too much though, because people tend to take you way to seriously."
5.0,"Perfect,  comfortable"
5.0,Very cute baptism gift for a girl who loves to dance!  Shipping was fast and the price of this necklace was very reasonable.
5.0,Fits perfect. Very comfortable and soft. A little long but all you have to do it cut it. No need to hem.
5.0,Great Watch - this is the second one I ordered as a gift.  Looks great on my husband and my son.  They wear it as their everyday watch and get many compliments.
5.0,"I love this dress. It flows beautifully and fits perfect. I wore this to a professional development (I'm a teacher) and received a lot of compliments. The color is vibrant and it really stands out.  For the record, I am 5'7&#34;, 170 lbs, I got a large. It does cover my feet a little bit (which you can see in the picture) but it isn't enough to hinder my walking when worn with sandles. I actually like it because it just feels so princess like. I will be getting more (so I can have more than one) and will always have at least one.  I am obsessed."
5.0,"my granddaughter loves them, we ordered her a second pair before vacation."
5.0,I have a round head. I can't get on many hats. I love this style. It stretches soft.  I even can get the slouch look.
5.0,"Since we are both Virgo, I purchased one for each of us for Christmas!"
5.0,This dress is beautiful and the material is comfortable. Will definitely order another one.
5.0,"Fantastic watch, especially considering the price.  So glad I went with this one over a $35 and up option.  This watch comes with simple enough diagrams/instructions, but if you are intuitive and explorative enough, you can figure it out just pushing the buttons.<br />Has a watch (12 and 24 hour), date, alarm, stop watch features, all standard features that work well.<br /><br />For soccer (and other athletic) timing specifically.  It comes set to 45 minutes, but can easily be set to any other time amount.  WITHOUT STOPPAGE TIMER: Timer counts down from 45 min. and at 0.00 automatically starts counting back up so you can easily see how much in to extra time you are allowing.  At 30 seconds prior to 0.00, continuous beeper goes off to alert near of end of regulation time, which can be shut off with the touch of any button.  Done.<br /><br />IF YOU'RE USING WITH stoppage timer.  Easily use another button to start and stop and additional timer for stoppage (stoppage timer is displayed above regulation timer).  Beeper does NOT go off at 30 seconds prior to end of regulation, but rather beeps at 0.00 and begins the count up.  30 second beeper then goes off instead 30 seconds prior to whatever amount of stoppage was calculated.  And final beeper goes off at end of stoppage to signal end of match.<br /><br />Great watch.  Glad I bought it.  I coach and ref and this watch is very usable.  If you don't want to alert teams to game time with beeper, simply be prepared to hit a button to shut off beep sound."
5.0,I bought for my 7 year old granddaughter and she loves it!  She did say that even when she turns the volume all the way down you can still hear it ?
5.0,"This was well made. The material was flowy yet structured.  Great color and fit me just right. 5' 6"" 175lbs.  Want more color choices!"
5.0,These were a gift to my my 78 year old mother.<br />Because of Parkinson’s she has heavey leg symptoms and walking in most shoes are difficult but these slippers were perfect for her to easily move around the house in.
5.0,"I wore these on a cruise I just came back from and they were a hit! Everyone loved the style and I love how they didn't turn my fingers green despite how wet my fingers got from water (and alcohol) They came in an adorable bag that I carry with me to store them when I need to take them off. I wear them all the time, they are apart of my everyday jewelry :)"
5.0,"Soft, fits well."
5.0,I LOVE these! They're my favorite! I have 2 pairs of the ankle length and one of the capris. I'm 5'1 and 145 lbs. I ordered medium and they fit great! They're a little long on me because I'm short but they fit great! Totally love the pockets too!
5.0,So many compliments. The green is so gorgeous. Exactly what I wanted. It's button down so be cautious if you're a bit busty.
5.0,"I'm usually skeptical of cheap ""sterling silver"" jewelry I find on here but these are the real deal. They're good quality and really comfortable to wear, I haven't taken them off since I got them over a month ago! These are my go-to daily earrings."
5.0,Loved this outfit
5.0,These masks are very comfortable and don’t fog up your glasses. Very easy and comfortable to wear.
5.0,"This necklace met every expectation that I had, I received so many compliments on this necklace. I love it!!!! Thanks!"
5.0,I love these. Now I have an object to present as an example of braces. They are just as easy to adjust as standard suspenders and less likely to pop off. I wear them with all my favorite slacks. All I had to do was sew in a few buttons. I've received many compliments on these. I love the way they look. Totally worth the minor inconvenience of sewing in buttons.
5.0,I love it. It was an amazing gift from my boyfriend
5.0,My son with ASD likes to wear it. It provides him much needed compression and comfort. He is sensitive to regular cotton shirts but he likes this one. I am more than happy to share this information.
5.0,I love them! Just what I was looking for. They are just like the pictures.
5.0,great for little girls
5.0,These the same glasses EASY E wore...rip bro your music and ppl you brought to the table r much appreciated..you'll never be 4 gotten bro
5.0,I got the belt and it was too small but the company was quick to get me a replacement this belt is very good quality if they ever come out with other styles I will be buying more and also will be referring this to my friends this is 100% a goodbye just I recommend buying one size up
5.0,I love my dress and it fits well. I was worried about the size But it didn't disappoint me. The shipment speed was also great!
5.0,This is exactly what I needed to continue the natural progression from one gauge to the next. I had ordered the black case version but received a yellow one and a friendly note apologizing that they had run out of stock due to overseas supply issues. While I personally don't care about the color they still included a gift - another one of their great quality products :)
5.0,Keeps my ears warm in the winter
5.0,"Great quality and color! I wasn't sure of the size as my math is poor but I am very happy, it is ""medium"" sized and I live it!"
5.0,"I love this interesting mix in my popcorn. It's somewhat addictive. Unfortunately it's so expensive, I won't be having any for a long while."
5.0,I love these. Simply elegant.
5.0,Love it! Better than I expected.
5.0,"I ordered the X large. I have a swimmers backstroke back with broader shoulders and it fit just fine. It took a moment to figure out how it goes on. With a little eager help from my husband, we figured it out. It really is quite flattering under your top. I also have size D's so it adds a little mystique. The material is a stretchy black satin. It looks put together rather well. A true bargain to express your style or add a little spice to your wardrobe. It came on time. Very Pleased!!!!"
5.0,"The color in person is pretty much the same as the color in the photos. We bought this pair, and another, similar, pair that $25.99. They are the exact same thing, the exact same quality and size, making these the better purchase overall. The only minor difference is that the others had been lightly distressed, which is not a big enough difference to me to warrant the price difference. A great buy! Does have a bit of a smell, but it’s the smell of leather and should be expected of any leather product!"
5.0,This is a very comfortable and warm layer! It is attractive and flattering. It can be worn as a layer or alone. I am very happy with this purchase!
5.0,"This is so cute , my daughter love it !!"
5.0,"Gave these to all our kids teachers, they love them.  Good enough quality, especially for the price.  Didn't mess up anyone's ears."
5.0,Nice dress. I like the color
5.0,Perfect addition to my kids' power ranger costumes.
5.0,I liked that I received my order
5.0,"This Flecktarn is better than expected and dead on with what others are saying, I was skeptical as to what size I needed to get, the size chart was telling me that a large would be the one, I’m 5,6 medium build 170lbs and I took a chance on the size Medium and glad I did, large would’ve been too large. Medium fits perfectly with room to spare.<br />This jacket kicks serious butt, it’s well made in Deutschland, ships from the U.K. got it in less than two weeks, it has a super warm fleece liner but doesn’t seem to overheat, has zippers on both underarm to provide cool air if you’re overheating, the liner can be removed, it also has a killer hood, it’s very well built and stitched, just received mine and couldn’t wait to write this review because I’m very pleased with it, best $150 ever invested in a jacket, only time will tell how good it’ll perform in the rain, I live in southern California so good luck with that, definitely makes a statement and surely will get compliments..."
5.0,"This is a cap to be proud to wear.  It sends a clear message that you are proud of your service, and, in particular, your brotherhood of belonging to &#34;the First Team&#34;."
5.0,Really cute and in great condition.
5.0,her new favorite shirt
5.0,"The Kentucky Derby is coming up and I have always wanted to dress the part! Well now I am totally ready to fit in with the ladies and make a statement this year. I choose the lighter grey variation even though most wear bright bold colors, my dress is lighter so I wanted to match! The hat came in a zipper bag, at first I wasn't to sure it would poof back up, but it did (as you can see in the pics) really easy and folding back to keep dust free in the included bag is simple. There is even a chin strap so just in case it is super windy, my hat will remain on my head for the entire day!<br /><br />In the spirit of full disclosure, I was given the above mentioned product free to facilitate this review."
5.0,These are the cutest pjs! Can’t wait for my boys to wear them for Easter!! 😍
5.0,Dope skirt. Very comfortable and good quality. Would buy again
5.0,I absolutely love this. Great price.
5.0,"I bought this dress for a fall wedding and absolutely loved it! It fit the girls great. I’m 5’2 so it was a little longer than I originally thought I wanted but it was so cold that day, I was grateful for the length!! This dress will not disappoint. There was even another girl at the wedding who was wearing this same dress (but in black!) She had a baby 2 weeks before the wedding and was rocking it! I believe this is a dress for all body types! If you want a tighter fit- maybe go a size down. I could put mine over my head without unzipping it but I didn’t want to be uncomfortable all night so I kept the “loose” size. (Size small- weigh 120 and 5’2)"
5.0,So so so comfy and soft
5.0,Perfect fit. Light and shed water to an extent but not water proof by any means. Good size pockets and waistband is flexible which feels great when I where them. I’ve had them for a month and washed 4 times so far with no signs of wear yet.
5.0,"These hair clips are beautiful and sturdy. on one flower clip I got, you can see where the glue application was messy."
5.0,My size is small.  I wish they had XSmall sizes.
5.0,Look pretty good!
5.0,"Has so many pocked and space, the perfect bag to travel far or close with"
5.0,This dress is very pretty in person and fits as expected.  I wish I had one in every color!
5.0,I love the way it fits and goes with everything from casual to business to dressy!
5.0,"This was a gift for my ski enthusiast wife who typically runs cold on the slopes. The HH Imperial Puffy kept her warm, dry and comfortable in far Northern Vermont snow storm over 4 days in early March 2020.  Really great jacket.  We expected more pockets / storage capacity but as the jacket is intended to be semi-form fitting we like the trade-off."
5.0,"Good quality and great fit, would buy again."
5.0,"Well made, looks nice on.  Love the side pockets."
5.0,"Love this OTT watch. Heavy, shiny and wide enough for a bloke. It's certainly not for the shrinking violet but, for those middle aged geezers like myself who refuse to grow old gracefully, it's top banana. As per usual for Oakley it's not the cheapest in the world and it is made in China, although to be honest the build quality seems no less than my Tag. I guess you pay for the name - but isn't that always the way with fashion? I like it and my son is after it as well. If you are in the market for something different and not too overpriced for a watch then this would fit the bill admirably."
5.0,"I grabbed these last minute for my wedding because my other option wasn't going to be here in time. Got it even quicker than I anticipated and they are gorgeous! These earrings are the perfect size, not too big & not too small. They photograph beautifully!!"
5.0,"Son loves it, and it fits his very narrow wrist just fine. After months of use, shows very little wear."
5.0,Amazing sunnies!!! Honestly surprised at the quality of the sunnies! Highly recommend
5.0,"I'm a boot collector! I love shoes, but boots are my favorite. I bought these a month or so ago and love them. The are true to fit and very comfortable. I wore them to shop at the market one day, and they never felt uncomfortable. The heal is perfect for me, because I have rheumatoid arthritis. I would definitely recommend these boots."
5.0,My wife and I wear these. I am a heart patient so these just seem fitting
5.0,This shirt is super soft and fit as expected. Love it!
5.0,"We love these frames, I am very sad to hear that the company is going out of business though and have discontinued the line. I just ordered this pair of frames to replace the ones my son has had for 2 years, These are by far the best frames we have ever owned. They do not break or bend at all. Les never pops out, just the best glasses ever."
5.0,Very comfortable but generously sized.
5.0,Beautiful elegant
5.0,"I am switching from a regular width brown leopard print. Since leopard print is now considered a neutral, I wore it all the time. This band is even better because it is so slim. I could not believe how much more comfortable the thin band is! It fits my 40 mm apple watch perfectly! It is very secure with a metal push in bar to attach the watch. I have a smaller wrist, and this is perfect! I have been wearing this every day for almost 2 weeks and have not noticed any fading or discoloration."
5.0,"So, she hasn't falling and broken anything.  She wears them everywhere except when we specifically tell her she cannot, like working in the field or whatever.  Honestly I do not know how she can stand it.  To walk in them normally she has to 'tiptoe' but from her heel, if that makes any sense at all.  But she's ten, she doesn't care as long as she can heely.<br />From a parents perspective I am shocked how well built they are, and how she still loves them after months."
5.0,Easy to put on and really comfortable
5.0,Wonderful  dress.  I wear a 16/18 and purchased an XL
5.0,Well made and a very high quality belt
5.0,Product as described.  Great price and quality.
5.0,I've been using it to carry my laptop to work and school and so far it's been holding up. It has a good amount of pockets and holds a 15.6&#34; laptop perfectly. I even use an extra laptop sleeve to protect it and it still fits.
5.0,Loved this dress! Ordered my regular size and it fit perfect.
5.0,Love these so comfy
5.0,"Have to dress 14 angels for an opera production. Was hopeful when I came across this product. Placed my order and waited. Package arrived early. The wings and halos are neatly packaged, which is great for when I have to take them up to the school. Took a set out to examine them and they are even better than I could have hoped for. These wings are going to look great on the kids. And they fold up for easy storage.<br /><br />Because they fold up and are packaged so neatly, the box is going to look a lot smaller than you are expecting so don't panic. This is a great product."
5.0,Great price and value.. ... overall a great buy .my son loves it
5.0,My 8 yr old granddaughter wanted me to get this for her mother for Christmas My granddaughter said it was just as cute as she expected and was very happy with it.
5.0,Fit perfect on my daughter!
5.0,The key is beautiful little replica!!!!
5.0,Love this bag😍
5.0,They arrived quiickly and the quality was good.  We had others and they are just the same.  Happy with purchase.
5.0,Adorable dress that fits great! I'm definitely going to get more in other colors.
5.0,Worked out perfectly.
5.0,"La calidad de la blusa es excelente, es suave, la horma es perfecta. Me encantó! Gracias era lo que esperaba."
5.0,"The scarf is one big flat piece of material with different colors running length wise.  It is an excellent value for the money.  I purchased two of the scarves.  One has a vintage dark blue, violet and pink color in it and the other has gray, violet, pink and cream color to it.  Scarf is very flowing and romantic looking.  It is very long, an excellent length to work with.  It is a very thin silk and has a similar texture to pantyhose and looks like it will snag easily.  I would gift it to people who are careful with their clothes."
5.0,This is a great product for the price!  I would def buy from this seller again.
5.0,"The attention to detail is amazing, quality at a very cheap price, I bought this 5th pentacle of Mars for my 11 yr old son. He loves this amulet, I will look for another in a more subtle color."
5.0,Best bra I have ever owned and I'm really sad it's not available
5.0,"Really loved this comfy long sleeve shirt.  I found it very soft. I bought a medium which left me with a lot of room, how I wanted it to be yet still looks great with leggetts or jeans. It is very comfortable and am pleased how well made it is made, thick but not heavy, really a nice surprise. I washed mine on cold delicate and lay flat to dry. I am surprised how cheap the price is for such a quality fall/ winter shirt! I think the whole comy feel sold me from the start. I am very happy and highly recommend to all."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:6db0e0a3945fdf7d2653db307410d68c]] This is an international travel must have! I have it in two colors right now, but I will definitely have more by the end of the year. Material is soft I haven’t had any issues and my skin is sensitive. The pocket is sizable enough to hold a phone money and a passport. It can even double as a little mini pillow, (my favorite feature)."
5.0,likeit
5.0,"This is a super cute and fun purse. This was a gift for my 8 year old who just needed a purse. It's a nice size for her, but would be a great size for anyone looking for a casual purse. It's constructed well, and it has, thus far, taken the beating it has received."
5.0,I love this ring it is very pretty.the ring can be adjusted and I wash my hands with it and still looks like new 😍😍😍
5.0,Very cool mask design. Fit's my teen son great. He loves it and every time he wears it some one asks him where he got it and most importantly for a teen...It's soooo cool!!! Even goes with his school uniform and school colors.
5.0,These are great.  Used as part of a centerpiece for a Mardi Gras Event.
5.0,These are great earrings for my 11 year old daughter. Stainless steal and just right.
5.0,These earrings are very beautiful and arrived super fast.  I love them and will order again.
5.0,I love it..look nice. The quality and size is perfect. The price is good for two pairs. My husband love it too.
5.0,Love  angel
5.0,Has good sturdy and strong clasps
5.0,"Cute, comfy and fast shipping- arrived a month before the scheduled delivery day!"
5.0,AWESOME PRODUCT!!!!! EXCELLENT AT THE RANGE.
5.0,The link necklace is beautiful. Then there is the pendant. A nice size cz sets the heart off. I like the piece as a whole and would highly recommend it.
5.0,It got here in one piece and is exactly like it was pictured! Very happy!
5.0,Shirt has yet to go through the wash but the product matches description. Based on reviews I ordered a size up and am glad I did. My normal size would fit too snug.
5.0,My granddaughter looks adorable in this dress!
5.0,"My daughter in-law loved it.  It was a gift from my son,"
5.0,These feel really good on.  They are nice and thin and silky.  I don't wear the top that much.  I wear the bottoms all the time though.  they have an elastic waist that also has a drawstring.  The elastic waist is enough to keep them up though so the drawstring isn't actually needed. I would definetely recommend these.
5.0,"These are nice and light, and look very cute on my baby. They fit well on my 9 month old (who is big for his age) with room to grow. The frames have some bend, which is a nice feature.  Overall, very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Perfect.  Just what I was looking for.  Beautiful color and well made.
5.0,"I have purchased several pairs of skecher fitness shoes over the years since they were first introduced. I bought one of the sandals 2 or 3 summers ago, and they lasted me until about a month ago. So I didn't hesitate to come and buy another pair of skecher fitness sandals. Sadly they don't have the same ones I got before, but these work just as well. The foot is a little more narrow towards the toes, but nothing too bad. I still love them."
5.0,Love the fit and very warm!! Also washed nicely!
5.0,"Beautiful wrap dress! (Its a legit wrap dress- there's no stiching to keep the dress wrapped/closed.) I am 5'6"", 115 lbs, 32A cup, and the small has a lot of extra room considering the size chart measurements. (I showed this on the pictures.) Tie it tight enough, rest the waist tie at the right height, and it is very flattering. The snap in the front is nice to have to avoid the front v neck sliding down too far, and the fabric wraps around enough to avoid showing undergarments while walking. I may have to buy this again in blue!"
5.0,This was exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,"I love the material quality and color quality of these! They are thick but breathable, making them great for winter or summer. And they have the deepest pockets I’ve seen on woman’s leggings! I’m looking forward together getting another pair."
5.0,This dress is super cute! Perfect for the summer. And the fit is great. I purchased an XL and it fits just fine
5.0,Absolutely adorable little tight around the top
5.0,"My son loves his hoodies. I bought 3. Size wise,they fit as expected.  They are made well and are so soft!"
5.0,I ordered a medium. It is very comfortable!
5.0,"Ok, does the trick."
5.0,"I bought a large in this product and was pleasantly surprised that it fits as I expected. The shoulders are cut a little more than I would typically wear but that's a small oversight on my part. It's warm, loose, and very comfortable. I bought a large and I'm 5'8 and 160 pounds. It hits me about a little before mid-thigh and looks great with skinny jeans or leggings."
5.0,awesome product i even ordered 3 sets of them
5.0,Best cotton nightgown I have ever had. I have been looking for quality like this for several years. Liked my first so much I bought 2 more.
5.0,"Really cute, I’m wearing it to work and then to Halloween with the kids. It runs big so I would size down unless you prefer loose clothing instead of skin tight. Color is bright and nicely done. Also price is perfect since I wouldn’t be wearing it again"
5.0,Just what I needed for my craft project. Nice size.
5.0,"KEEPS GOOD TIME...BE SURE TO KEEP THE DIRECTIONS....RESETTING TIME, DATE ETC. ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN MOST OF THEIR OTHER MODELS."
5.0,These laces hold up for a long time.
5.0,"Beautiful but only comes as one. People with stretched ears need two, seller should reconsider this. Annoyed that I have to wait another eternity for the other to come in because I can’t read apparently."
5.0,I love it! It's beautiful!
5.0,Great quality for the cost.
5.0,I'm in love with it. Thank you
5.0,Love it. Nice look great fit. Haven’t wore it yet but when I do pictures to follow. Not cheap or cheesy looking worth the buy.
5.0,Love them for my 6 year old. She can independently unzip and put them on. They look cute with a lot of different outfits!
5.0,It made my costume that I ordered from fashion nova pretty much set it off. Because it looks like the authentic costume with the Luigi hat and gloves and mustache
5.0,I love this hat so much!
5.0,These socks are very bright and fit well.
5.0,Love it. Fits true to size.
5.0,These earrings are gorgeous! I absolutely love them!
5.0,Very cute! Fits as expected.
5.0,My daughter is weird about texture and she loves the smooth satin feel.

5.0,"This dress is gorgeous. It looks so pretty on. Very comfortable and soft. I am 5'3&#34; 130lb and I ordered a Medium. The top of the dress definitely runs small. If you're bigger busted it may be tight. I am a little nervous to wash it, if it shrinks, it definitely won't fit. It is beautiful, can be casual or dressy depending on the shoes you wear. Love it, I ordered 3 total, everyone was beautiful!!"

5.0,"We recently moved to the coast of Oregon, lots of pine trees and rain. Love it here, learning about keeping the rain gutters debris free. Cleaned out the gutters during the first big rain of the season, my hands were aching from the cold. Ordered these gloves with the insulated liner, went out yesterday to install new drain guards and continue the debris removal. After two hours in the icy water my hands were dry and warm, these gloves are a game changer. Looking forward to today's outdoor project. Also, wore just the insulated liner to rearrange my freezer contents. Hands stayed warm and fingers limber. Can't sing the praises of these gloves enough, with arthritis cold can slow me down quickly, these gloves are allowing me to do all the winter outdoor work."
5.0,"Fits a little big and long, but it is so cute on."
5.0,Granddaughter loves these!
5.0,"I love this dress!! It fits a little snug on top, but the colors are bright and it’s the perfect length for my 5’4 and a half height."

5.0,"Lovely striped socks. The tag on mine said XL and came above my knee. I prefer to wear them below my knee. They are average thickness, excellent for fitted flats and lighter weather. Mine arrived without rips, tears, stains or fowl smells.  About 130 pounds, slender about 5'6. They arrived way before the expected date."
5.0,I ordered Fvstar Travel Luggage Cover Spandex Suitcase Cove Protector Washable Baggage Covers XL for SWISSGEAR 28&#34; Hardside Suitcase.<br />Generally it works well for couple overseas flight with connections.<br />But this covers fits too tight for this suitcase. It will definitely not fit for this suitcase if it is extended.

5.0,Nice finish and super comfortable
5.0,"When I opened the package, I was surprised to see a sturdy case, a soft case AND a key chain attachment to tighten any type of glasses or sunglasses. These sunglasses are so sturdy.

They look amazing on and I can not wait to tell everyone to go buy some!!<br /><br />I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST OPINION."

5.0,"Super cute blouse, great for office or semi-formal. Was not expecting it to be such great quality. I ordered a size up but ended up returning and having to order a size down. The shirt is true to size, and even then it has a loose fit look to it so if you size up you'll look like you're swimming in it. Go with your regular size."

5.0,I took it back
5.0,I used this skirt for Xmas trip. Perfect for traveling in and packing - refuses to crease and comfortable in any weather.<br />The only problem I had was that it was a little too orangey a red for Xmas that I had hoped it would look good for but it is the best choice for a complex trip or for wearing at home and the only drawback was it needs a slip.
5.0,Great value bought for my daughter who kept losing her glasses.
5.0,So the first one I got fit him what I thought was perfectly but come to find out it’s a little bit big on him so I went down a size so I’m saving this one for when he out grows the other. It helps him a lot to focus more when in school. I advised others that r looking to buy this to go down a size from what they already wear for the perfect fit.
5.0,"Love them. I sleep in them, haven't taken them out in months and I am quite allergic to nickel."
5.0,"I got this watch to replace my sons superhero watch that fell apart.  It was actually cheaper to buy this watch than another superhero one.  The band on this actually fits a child’s wrist better that the watches that are designed for kids.  Anyway, my 5 year old loves this watch and if fits his little wrist perfectly.  I would highly recommend.  It’s also a very lightweight watch."

5.0,well-made American product
5.0,Love it. Not a typical stretchy bathing suit fabric. It’s textured and not very stretchy. But that’s good because it gives it some structure. I love the pink and I would totally buy it in every color. It’s medium coverage on my butt. Definitely gonna have a new tan line.
5.0,Quick delivery.  Make recommendation ...a large size was more than generous.  Very happy
5.0,"Definitely worth the purchase, I was skeptical at girl but they’re definitely worth it and they’re warm"

5.0,Great boxer and very comfortable.  The fabric feels very soft on the body
5.0,I’m really satisfied with the turtleneck sweatshirt.

5.0,"This is a super cute shirt I ordered for my soon to be 4 year old. He is currently in size 4 and I was worried this would run small so I ordered a larger size. This is actually very true to size and you can order your child's normal size. I ordered the Small and it is true to size.<br /><br />The quality of the t-shirt is also excellent. It is the typical &#34;Hanes&#34; style material that washes very well. I have not noticed any shrinkage and I wash in warm with light colors. The colors and design in the shirt are also very well made and very vibrant.<br /><br />My son loves construction equipment and we are having a construction-themed birthday party. It is very obviously a well-made and high-quality shirt. This company has a lot of designs. If you are looking for quality printed t-shirts, this is the one stop shop.<br /><br />Will update photos soon.<br /><br />I got this for free in exchange for providing my honest thoughts and opinions in this review. No other compensation was provided and I was under no obligation to leave a favorable review."

5.0,I was so happy when I open the box.  I said &#34; This is it! and I would like to thank Belle for this creation.  I really love it!
5.0,These gloves are padded correctly for a woman cyclist. They compare to a Specialized brand that I paid $40 for. Do the suggested measures for you and follow their chart. The size given by the measurement will fit you like a glove! Pun intended.  I will definitely shop for another pair!

5.0,Loved this leotard.  It is very comfortable too.
5.0,Great lightweight long sleeve t-shirt with hood.  Good length.  Not a sweatshirt.
5.0,"Honestly, I'm perplexed. Speechless even. You don't realize how negative of a world you live in until something truly amazing, yet menial, happens. I did a little searching for a good quality orgone necklace. I found one I liked but was slightly discouraged because it wasn't ""prime"" and i had to pay a shipping charge. I actually backed out to continue searching for something else, hoping to find prime or something that doesn't charge for shipping. But the only product I could find, that I liked and had good reviews, was another orgone necklace made by the same people. So I buckled, I bought both. My expected delivery date was about 2 weeks out, I wasn't too thrilled about that, but I did read another review that said their necklace came earlier than expected. So I was hopeful. I ordered on the 20th, today the 23rd, I got my package. I was definitely surprised to say the least. But it was the extra effort that really made me happy yet confused. Confused because I got a bunch of extra goodies alone with my package that just gave me the warmest of feelings. Like if you could send love in a package, buy it from this company. Im telling you, you won't be upset. This kindness doesn't happen anywhere in life. I really want to meet the person or people responsible for this. You did an excellent job and if you keep this standard, you will thrive."
5.0,Just Funkin' Around!
5.0,I absolutely love this dress! The fit was perfect and the color is exactly like it looks. I am 5'2&#34; and about 185# and ordered the XL. It wasn't tight and didn't hug my curves. Just overall a super flattering dress. I want to buy another just can't decide on Navy or Black!
5.0,Delivery was fast and efficient and product was accurate.

5.0,"These are beautiful and classic styled earrings. You get all four metal colors, gold, silver, rose gold, and black. I have worn all four pairs. They are constructed well up to par with better quality costume jewelry. I love how I can wear the coordinating color to match what I'm wearing that day. There are no separate posts with backs to deal with, the earring is all one piece, you just press the post into the back catch of the earring and it clicks shut. This oval hoop style of earring is great for casual wear, formal or dressy occasions, and just right for the workplace as well. No complaints here. They are beautiful and exactly as described."
5.0,"My daughter has one and I really liked it, so I ordered one.  I love it too.  It has lots of pockets and can carry so much.  Easy to clean and store.  And the price was good."
5.0,Really liked this. Only complaint is that the straps aren't adjustable and I have a long torso so it is a bit of a squeeze on and if it had adjustable straps it would be adjusted for a slightly better fit and a loser waist top
5.0,I loved that my best friend loved it
5.0,Great product. Good seller.
5.0,"These are not extremely fluffy. They are not pictured to be and so they are as pictured, it is what I was expecting. As pictured they do not go over any shoe of any type. They are quality made. I like the satin lining but outer fabric unfortunately does shed."
5.0,Great for frozen foods. Bigger than most reusable bags.  Lots of space and they fold up nicely.
5.0,Awesome!!! Highly recommend
5.0,I love this tank! It also has removable pads so if there is some wrinkling it can be adjusted.
5.0,Nice card holder. Well made!

5.0,"This dress is really nice. I was impressed by the quality. I ordered a 2XL because I have a large bust 38DDD, yet I'm not as big on the bottom. I love the color as well. I typically wear a size 12 and sometimes 14 in dresses."

5.0,"Got this as a gift for a family member and she has had it for a couple months now. She loves it and has gotten many compliments on it!! Like other wooden watches, this one is on the larger side. However, it was not too overwhelming for her smaller wrist. Not only is this a unique time piece, but it is also well-made, affordable, comes in eco-friendly packaging, and comes with additional bracelets. A great buy."

5.0,This is the cutest glasses holder!!!
5.0,These don't work on all jeans. The loops are sometimes too far apart but that's not this product's fault. These are ingenious I wish I had known about these years ago.
5.0,We bought this for our car line at school.  We will have different characters out front on the last day before the Christmas break. I can't wait to see this one out there! 😊

5.0,"Awesome shirt! Perfect size, and quality printing."
5.0,Hate when socks fall  - its uncomfortable and irritating to have to keep pulling them up. Great quality and brilliant. ONe day I forgot to wear them and spent all day pulling up socks - I had forgotten how irritating it was and didn't realize I had forgotten to put them on until I felt that sagging in my socks. Im going to get extra pairs and attach them to the socks in my drawer so they're ready to go!
5.0,"It looks perfectly fine, the sleeves are a bit long though which isn't much of a problem. Overall was a very good purchase and there aren't any issues with it."

5.0,"Love, love, love this stirrup pants! So comfortable and nicely tight! The fabric is thick enough that makes me feel comfortable to wear it with shorter tops. The waist band fits great and is not too low or to high, just perfect! The stirrup is comfortable as well. They run a bit longer on me (5'6'', 125 lb) but I actually like it:) Best yoga pants I've purchased so far!"
5.0,Couldn't be happier with it.
5.0,Love love love it! Very beautiful!

5.0,I’m 5’0 and 3 petite dress fits perfect very nice
5.0,Good quality fabric. Bright color. Comfortable. I love it.
5.0,"These are so cute and flattering on my 2-1/2 yr old granddaughter, I ordered another pair for her to keep at home this summer. They're well-made, sturdy case included is great for throwing into a bag/backpack, but she also loves to use the case as her ""purse"" when we go to ''market.""  She can break and throw things on a whim, but these are not fragile like others and she likes them so much that she's being careful so far. Most importantly, she hates the sun in her eyes in the car and I've tried many window light blockers without much help. These glasses help a lot with the bright sun! I may get another pair to keep in the car."
5.0,"My son loves Flash, he runs around the house talking about how fast he is.  I can not get him to take off his shoes because his feet are like lightning because of how fast he moves!"
5.0,I like that it fits and is the right length and the price was affordable
5.0,My 5 year old loves his first watch. Only minor complaint is that my finger is too big and it is difficult to adjust date and time. Once that's done he enjoyed it.
5.0,I like a taller and thicker pair of socks for mountain biking and these have done the trick!
5.0,Purchased this robe as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He loves it.  It washes like a dream and it feels wonderful against the skin.  The long length is great for keeping legs warm and toasty.  I found myself wearing it and am now about to get one for myself!  Great product!
5.0,Smartwool socks are the best but there standard design way too tight even on my skinny legs. These are not thankfully.
5.0,I like the color and the price which I consider a bargain.  I have washed them several times and they come out looking like new!  No more sweat running down the face!
5.0,original sunglasses. love it
5.0,for a cocktail party its cool
5.0,"Great quality, style and good price, not expensive. Best shoes!"
5.0,Super cute!! I usually wear between a L and XL so I sized up and got the XL since I like my off-shoulder shirts to be kind of baggy. It's a little too big for my liking but it's still super cute! Wish I would have ordered the large instead.
5.0,The  NYfashion101 tattoo leggings are so cute. They are lightweight and comfortable. The leggings are perfect to wear under long shirts. I have had many compliments on them. I have worn and washed them a few times and they still look great. They have not faded any.<br />I received the tattoo leggings at a discount or free for my honest review.
5.0,The settings on this ring are beautiful. The pictures does not do it justice. I would definitely recommend this ring it is elegant but can a<br />So be worn with jeans.
5.0,"The tummy control portion isn’t accurate, but the material is very soft and super comfortable! I’ll definitely buy more!"
5.0,It was a prefect gift for a Disney fan.
5.0,Very comfy and cute.
5.0,"Bought these Cute Disney PJ's for Granny's birthday.  She absolutely adored them.  She's going to wear them on the Fourth of July , as they red white and blue."
5.0,"After looking at other reviews on how to get the perfect fitted onesie...it definitely was worth looking at! I really appreciate the comments on how to get the appropriate size onesie; whether it depends on your height, weight, and the material. I can not stop wearing it! It's warm, comfy, and just nice to chill in after a long day or a day to not do anything. A+ Material ;)"
5.0,Love love love this ring. It is prettier than in the picture. I have received several compliments on it. I highly recommend this item.
5.0,"Purchased for a gift for a male friend of mine who previously had resorted to throwing all his cards into his pocket without any rhyme or reason. Felt like it would keep him better organized and possible not losing cards due to haphazard handling. So far he raves about it and loves the customization features which makes the “wallet” more tailor made for his needs. And it’s not big and bulky like a traditional fold wallet. Anyway, highly recommend!!"
5.0,"This hat is perfect, it has elastic so I don't have to Bobby pin it, really thick, great for this winter!"
5.0,Sturdy eye glass case
5.0,Love it! Very soft
5.0,"I bought this for my Halloween costume this year as Alice in Wonderland and it was great. I am very tall, and this dress was the perfect height for me, and it fit perfectly everywhere else. I got many compliments on this dress. It made my Halloween so wonderful. :)"
5.0,Works well for work. Defntly what I was looking for.
5.0,My great niece loved this set....arrived on time for her 10th bday
5.0,beautiful and well-made. I really like it and get lots of compliments.
5.0,"Just received these sweaters today.  Had to write this review immediately!  Ordered 3 colors (red, white & black).  They are gorgeous!!! So very soft, perfect fit, fabulous material.  Colors are exactly as shown.  I am ordering at least 2 more.  Love these sweaters!!"
5.0,"Have had this shirt for a little over a year now and it is holding up wonderfully. The fit seems to be pretty true to size, and there was minimal (if any) shrinking when I first washed it. Neither the colors nor the screen have faded or flaked. Just a good quality T with a great Hockey Team's logo!"
5.0,"This was slow to come but well worth it from an aesthetic standpoint. I just got it so cannot judge about the EMF side of it but it does look nice. The chord that came with it looks and feels like braided brown plastic. Not the greatest. I would would suggest a black cotton string myself. I plan on using a black string or a silver chain to wear it. Seller was kind enough to let me know of a shipping delay so I have no real complain there. It is big, bigger than I expected in diameter but again it looks really nice and anyway it will go under my shirt. It is light so no problem.<br /><br />In conclusion, it is really a nice piece of jewelry and I would recommend it. People are bound to ask you about your new pendant and it is an awesome conversation piece."
5.0,"DURABLE, EASY TO CARE FOR."
5.0,It’s a high quality shirt. Very well made.
5.0,"Soft and comfortable, keeps glasses secure"
5.0,I ordered a size up per reviews. This dress looks so nice on. I love the pockets. The fabric is so light perfect for summer.
5.0,They are a nivel size and great quality
5.0,When I ordered these I got the wrong color but the seller contacted me back the same day and got it taken care of immediately. These are great glasses. I use them as my everyday driving classes and get some cool looks from people at stop lights haha
5.0,I love how comfortable and supportive these pants are! Only wish they were at least .5-1.5 inches shorter. But I am definitely buying these again! For reference I have a 32 inch waist and 45 inch hips.
5.0,"Ok so my honest opinion is, Although they aren't as pictured as far as the Sole being displayed as white, In the pic. Yet they are actually cream in actual life. Lol I think it gives the shoe long gevity. Vs trying to care for a white bottom. Although I neglected to read the description. (It may actually say not white as pictured)<br /> This could be considered false advertising. However I'm totally satisfied. They aren't the most comfortable, They're cute for what they were bought for. I like they enough to get them in black."
5.0,I like the fit of that top thank's
5.0,Love these shorts. True to size and I have received several compliments on them. Comfortable and stylish.
5.0,"I've been an Amazon customer for over 10 years but rarely leave feedback unless I'm either truly impressed or truly disappointed with a product. I was so pleasantly surprised at the quality of the fabric! The top is soft and stretchy, yet thick enough so it is not see-through at all. I also purchased another top (a sweater) from this seller and was not disappointed. The fabrics they use seem to be very good quality. I will definitely be buying from them again."
5.0,This is a casual sexy shirt. It fits as expected. I wear it with shores and cute sandals.
5.0,The material of this dress is very soft and flowing. It fits really well and is just a really beautiful dress in general and is made out of a nice material. I’m definitely going to buy another one in a different color
5.0,"Nice, bright colors. Very cute."
5.0,Really pretty and match with lots of outfits. Not too heavy either
5.0,"I was so excited to receive these pants. The material is beautiful and so is the cut. Unfortunately, with a girthy buttocks and long torso, the pants only came up to my hips."
5.0,Very pleased with item and price! Fits true to size.
5.0,Nice shirt. Nice and lightweight. The fit of this shirt was spot on. The printing in the shirt is on heavy enough it should last many washes. Fabric feels light so there is no worry of overheating in this shirt. Overall I feel this is a nice product. I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.
5.0,I’m 5”3 and weigh around 215. I ordered the XXL and it was a snug fit but still breathable.. such an easy outfit on the go.. I got tons of compliments on it..
5.0,"This wig is more beautiful than the picture, if you can imagine that. And for the price I'm really not sure how they did it. This wig came beautifully, perfectly curled straight out of the bag. The dusty antique rose color is lovely and it brushes well (I would never recommend brushing the curls though!) It reaches my butt and it's super thick and soft. I highly recommend this wig. (Here's a picture of it on my stand)<br />[...]"
5.0,Non-polarized is key for my use in aircraft.
5.0,Bought it for my wife as a anniversary gift and she loved it. Very nice
5.0,Beautiful and looks great
5.0,"Very good looking shoe and in my opinion more f a very lightweight hiking shoe than a hiking boot.  Will be great for walking in most conditions though probably will add a waterproof coating to it for damp situations.  Nice grippy tread, really nice leather with minimal synthetic accents to make it less athletic shoe looking than other 710 styles. As always New Balance is a narrow foot company so if you have wide feet (like I do!) you might consider sizing up.  This shoe looks small on my feet so if you are used to a beefier looking shoe, give it a chance, it feels great on even with heavy socks and is light.  A keeper!"
5.0,Peefect!
5.0,"Dress is accurate in sizing, nice material, perfect for the price."
5.0,Fits me good. I wear this for workout and it’s comfortable
5.0,Sizes run small. I wear a medium so I had to return for a large. It was reship quickly and I love it. My husband got the Voodoo Dr costume and I was the Doll and we won best costume award.
5.0,"Bought this outfit on a whim for my birthday dinner with family. Bought a large. It was a great Fall rust color, material had enough stretch and was thick enough for me. Loved the slits on the sides and that it had a zipper to the side. Great purchase and would definitely recommend! I felt cute ❤️"
5.0,Purchased for my daughter and she says it is very comfortable and light.
5.0,Love the earrings.  I like the looks and the length of the stems.
5.0,Love it fits perfect and goes great with my dress
5.0,Really nice dress for the price! I got a X- large and my size is a large.
5.0,"Beautiful. I bought a size L, I usually wear a size 8.It fit great, and looks beautiful. It goes perfect with my wedding dress.Matches the color perfectly."
5.0,This is so cute and comfortable and fits great! I plan on buying in different colors. The material is soft and stretchy and flattering by pulling you in the right places. I really like the high waist as well!
5.0,it is absolutely beautiful however the size chart is not correct runs small and i even bought it a size larger than i wear mostly in the sleeves
5.0,Great product. Will order more
5.0,One of husband's faves to wear! Fit is perfect
5.0,"I'm using this dress to go on a cruise and the fabric is great for packing, doesn't seem to wrinkle easily and is comfortable and breathable.  Fits true."
5.0,"I bought a scarf for a gift, but my husband liked it so much, I ordered two more for him. They are exactly as I imagined, large, lightweight, and gauzy.  The colors I ordered (wine red and blue) are true to the samples.  Even in a Northwest US winter, they provide warmth around the neck, without the weight of a wool scarf.  They are large enough to be used as a wrap or sarong in warm weather."
5.0,Used this item as part of bridesmaids gifts and it came out super cute!
5.0,I own 6 pair of glasses and this is my new favorite.
5.0,This was a gift and my friend really likes them.
5.0,"Get a half size up and you’ll be fine. I put 295 miles on my last pair and they still had plenty of life. The appliqués (ie the lines and the other little “stickers” around the shoe) do come off after a few runs, but who cares, they are running shoes. Over all great shoe to run in. Nice color way!"
5.0,"Muy buena tela y confección,  solo que tuvimos que hacer un cambio de talla porque corre un poco más grande! Por lo demás todo excelente 👌"
5.0,"Beautiful, fit perfectly, just what I wanted."
5.0,Love love love had to exchange for smaller size. Order a medium sent back for a small. Perfect full fit. 5’2 and half. 34 DDD/ 160lbs (a little chunky) but the small is Plenty big. My go to item!!
5.0,"This is my 2nd Monterey Cabana mesh hat in 5 years. I love this hat I purchased my 1st one at the California State Fair for $50 at that time I thought $50 OMG, when the guy in the booth soaked the hat and put it on my head in 103 degree temps, ya I bought one. That was the best hat purchase I ever made. I wore that hat every ware, love this hat I wear it on the gun range with very degrees of hot in the summer, I throw it in my trunk of my motorcycle, crush it in a suite case and the hat just bounces back. I think when it start showing ware that gives the hat a little class. I looked for months to find another vender even went back to the fair trying to find one to no avail. I finally found a vender at a small festival on the river still $50."
5.0,"I love the colors and the fit of these, not binding but they make my legs feel good.  This is the first time I have been instructed to wear compression stockings."
5.0,The fit is perfect and the quality is wonderful. Our little one couldn't wait to put it on and dance around the house.
5.0,Very functional!
5.0,I like the quality of the bracelet.  It is a little hard to get on and off.
5.0,"This is the perfect cover-up for summer! It's long enough that I can wear it at work, but sporty enough I can wear it to the beach or to work out without worrying about messing it up. I loved the first one I got so much I bought another!"
5.0,"Love these earrings. Exactly what I wanted. Shipping takes a little while, though."
5.0,looks good and good price
5.0,Love this item! They are absolutely beautiful!
5.0,"Fits good,  looks good, great price"
5.0,FANTASTIC
5.0,"I am very pleased with these socks. They are thick, warm, soft and comfortable. They fit my feet size 6.5 just right. No bunching up in either the toe or heel. But they are very slippery on hard wood floors so be careful when walking with just the socks on slick surfaces.  Also very happy that I got 4 pairs of socks with this order. The description says 4 pack, but the photo only shows 4 individual socks, so I thought I was only getting 2 pairs."
5.0,I love this tunic! It's beautiful for a casual evening out over black fleece lined leggings and booties! Feels really sleek and soft and the drape is excellent! This is not one of those thin cheap materials that cling in all the wrong places! You'll like this one! And the colors are just lovely!
5.0,Purchased two pairs for gifts and they are beautiful. The men loved them
5.0,Product is exactly the same as shown. Good gift choice. Would recommend! Wish there is a cat option as well!
5.0,"While my wife is only 5'6"", we ordered a large of this item because another review claimed this shirt runs ""really small"".  We both thought it ran pretty true to size (see attached pics).  In fact, it actually had a bit of room to shrink, if needed.<br /><br />The shirt looks/fits exactly as described, it's soft, has no ""new shirt smell"" so you could wear it right out of the packaging.  For around $15, it's also a really great deal.  My wife (is a teacher and) ""loves"" the shirt.  If you have a teacher in your family, this would also make a great (yet affordable) gift.<br /><br />In short, we highly recommend this shirt!"
5.0,Good product at a reasonable price
5.0,"If you are in doubt, trust me, dont be!<br />They are better than what i expected. They have an amazing build up quality, and the lenses are the real ones (NOT the plastic cheap ones that you buy in the street). The wood style is unique, and the color, is not washed as it looks in the image, its a bit more woody (?) but i love it. And you DONT have that feeling that the arms will break.<br />I have a RayBan Wayfarer black pair, but this last time im mostly used this new ones.<br />I was in doubt my self in the moment, but now i dont regret it. I definitely recommend them.<br /><br />And also i didnt even know they sent them from Germany until i saw it in the package. It arrived perfectly in time.<br /><br />Also, GREAT customer service. I sent them an email about the sizing prior to purchase and the response was quick and very well explained."
5.0,son love the fit
5.0,I really like this shirt! It does fit on the loose side due to the style. The arm detail is so cute. No complaints so far and cute for the price.
5.0,I got this gift for my mom and she wore it for a week straight. She still likes it but it got misplaced. The quality is good. The actual pendant itself is the size of a dime its light weight and the rays are a bit pokey if you have a big chest. Other than that its youthful and I personally would wear it myself they had one that was more masculine.
5.0,"They were just a tiny bit too small, but my old ones are probably stretched out, so I gave it 5 stars. Very comfortable."
5.0,These look adorable and so festive for the holidays.
5.0,Great shoes for kids to run around in and play in the garden. Runs big.
5.0,High quality bifocal sunglasses.  This is the second purchase of these glasses.  Worth the cost.
5.0,Love these socks. I wear them around the house and they ate just great.
5.0,"The cotton bandana's arrived promptly, were 27&#34; x 27&#34;, and otherwise as described.  So far the bandanas are holding up well and have softened with washing."
5.0,Love this dress!<br />So slimming and super comfy! Can't wait to order more!!
5.0,The message
5.0,Great for all black because only wanted black
5.0,"I made the right decision when I bought this brand of socks. They not only provide my calves, heels, and arches support they are pretty comfortable at a reasonable price. They also offer different style but I prefer solid black. I will definitely buy more pairs."
5.0,"Top quality, can't find anything bad about the product"
5.0,I purchased this for my Galaxy Active 2 watch. It fitted very well and it looks great.
5.0,"I was really pleased by how great these fit and how good they felt. I've gotten quite a few compliments too, and they look like boots that cost twice the price. And so far, they wearing really well. Go for it!"
5.0,"I've always been a heavy sleeper. Since starting to use this device for a shock alarm, I've actually been waking up early. Best part is that you can do vibration and then shock. No more 30 alarm clocks, no more bothering my wife. I just wake up with the vibration and know that if I don't get to my phone to turn it off, I'll get shocked. Works like a charm."
5.0,Perfect fit.  After reading reviews I went with a large.
5.0,Well made and nicely made.
5.0,"Solid well made,looks great.Hope it woks as well as the other watches from LIGE"
5.0,Love it well made fits perfect
5.0,Perfect for our deck!
5.0,"I read the reviews where some people weren't pleased with the size, but for me it was perfect. I didn't want large charms, but something small, eye-catching, understated and tasteful. I couldn't be more pleased. I did purchase a different silver chain for the charm, but I was planning on doing that anyway just to dress it up a bit."
5.0,"The dainty bracelet is dainty and cute, fits a small wrist - I purchased it for my oldest granddaughter for her High School graduation.  I had purchased a graduation teddy bear and what I did I placed the bracelet around the neck of the teddy bear and when she saw the bracelet on the teddy bear, she felt in love with it.  She was so proud in wearing it."
5.0,Great fit and style
5.0,The titanium earrings  are a perfect addition to my wardrobe.  I love them!
5.0,Excellent underwear. I bought these to replace Jockey Midways  since they started making them shorter.<br />They are a great replacement for a great price.<br />Has the right support & covers upper thighs well to prevent chaffing.<br />So far they lasted very well for almost  2 months with no sign of wear.
5.0,These are awesome!
5.0,"These earrings are just stunning and they complete my trio of having red, white and blue.  I have gotten so many complements on how awesome these earrings are."
5.0,Me gustó y el precio ni se diga
5.0,Finally stopped my wife's leg pains
5.0,Good quality and very comfortable. The size was correct and accurate to my size. Very happy with this sweatshirt.
5.0,"I was looking for a brooch for my ivory wool winter coat when I stumbled across this gem. I love the way it looks on the lapel of the coat. I docked one star due to the overall look coming across as cheap. It's a totally subjective assessment, I realize. But, the tie-in to the Harry Potter canon was a huge selling point, and I regret nothing in purchasing it."
5.0,"Love the color, soft material, and true fit."
5.0,although it is snug I LOVE the Angel Wings on the back! (:
5.0,nice looks good  fix well love it nice an cool
5.0,"For the price, this hat is very well made and definitely a good buy!"
5.0,Works well to touch up silver ornaments around Christmas time.
5.0,I’m in love!!
5.0,"I LOVE the way these feel! They were a tad too short in the back (at the top), but that's ok, it's not too bad. Overall these are my favorite!!!"
5.0,I love this case and it holds a lot for trips and just to carry around
5.0,Good lightweight shirt for the summer.  Be sure to wash it first though as the color can rub off on white pants the first wear.
5.0,This shirt is beautiful. It's like wearing a work of art. Troy Polamalu was a work of art and my favorite Steeler. I brought several. The shirt is soft stretchy and they even suggest how to wash so as not to ruin the print. I will buy more .
5.0,Daughter likes this dress.
5.0,They are cool. Loose and ver very comfortable. Getting more
5.0,Very soft slippers. Nice sole. Roomy at toe and stays put at heel. I thought the color would be a lighter shade of pink. These are more rose pink not pastel.
5.0,So much better than expected. Super soft and comfy. I need more colors.
5.0,"Our granddaughter went to England, so the pink Union Jack design made these an instant favorite!"
5.0,"Nice shirt, good price. I recommend."
5.0,"I love these shades. They are darker than in the photo, but they fit perfectly and I love the shape. I love these Tom Ford shades and the seller got the shades to me in a timely manner. I am very happy with the purchase at an amazing price!"
5.0,The dress was wonderful. fit was great.  I will continue to buy from them.
5.0,"What did you like or dislike?<br />  Like: The stone is great and I love it.<br />  Dislike: The cord is kinda cheap but it works.<br />What did you use this product for?<br />Uh..... I wear it around my neck, Amazon."
5.0,I bought these for my granddaughter. She loved them.  The shoes are beautiful. I bought the pink and gold. Very happy with the shoes.
5.0,I love it. I was surprised when I opened the box and seen how big the pendent was.The one I had before was so small you could barely see it.
5.0,Love them. Nice sparkle and chunky look
5.0,"Love them, very comfortable."
5.0,I didn't know the &#34;Wine&#34; moved A+
5.0,"Love these earrings! I have several pair and they are all beautiful and the best quality, I have sensitive ears and have worn them months now with no issues."
5.0,I bought this as a replacement when my Vera Bradley weekender bag strap suddenly broke.  It works perfectly!!  I might even like it better than the original strap....it seems to stay on my shoulder better than the old one.
5.0,These fit perfectly and are very pretty. I bought two different colors and am thinking about buying more.  They are easy to put on.  They make my fitbit more like a beautiful bracelet.
5.0,Definitely recommend for work attire. Felt beautiful in this. Not tight at all. I purchased a size L and it’s true to size.
5.0,Purchased for a &#34;sensory seeker&#34;. She hasn't it gone a day without one since their arrival.
5.0,La bata es super cómoda la pedí  tamaño  mediano. Corre un poco grande. Pero super fresca y comoda

5.0,I still can’t believe I got this for $60 bucks! It’s perfect.
5.0,"He had no problem adjusting it (He's wearing it now, and he has at least 30 hats.) He says it keeps the sun out of his eyes, and it's comfortable. We're both proud he's retired Air Force Special Operations Command. (Not all special operations are done by SEALS...) AF Spec Ops are quite formidable in their own right.<br />He did say the insignia and lettering are fine, but would be too small for any kind of advertising. As it is, within social distancing, a person can clearly see the AFSOC shield, and the lettering. It's a nice hat, and I was very surprised and pleased to find it! AF Spec Ops don't get TV time, or book deals. Because they don't brag or advertise. They just go, accomplish their mission, and come back. This hat is about as much and as flashy as you'll find for them."
5.0,Love these.  I give them as gifts to special people.  Especially those who need an angel by their side
5.0,"Perfect fit, adorable"
5.0,Super cute!! And the kids loved them.
5.0,Hat is a little large.
5.0,My kids love the jackets
5.0,"Fast shipping, great product! Thank you so much!!! :)"
5.0,"Good watch for the price! Only had for a week tho, I'll update this post if it breaks in the next couple days"
5.0,Just got this and had to try it on. It fits perfectly. The fabric is thick and it hugs curves perfectly. I adore the high/low cut.
5.0,"The only downside to this dress is the length, but I'm also only 4'9&#34; so every dress is almost too long unless I shop in the kids department. I found this dress at my local boutique and bought it in the steel gray which is almost a navy/gray, very interesting color but I love it. I paid $28 for the dress so the price is right although I was able to snag the heather gray for $14.99 which is a steal! This dress is so soft and washes so easy, tag says hand wash but I use a garment bag and delicate cycle in my washer then hang to dry and it's still perfect. Easy to transition from day to night and snug in the right places and loose in the others. I highly recommend these for any occasion, I will be stocking up on more when the price drops!"
5.0,Fit as expected and very comfortable to wear.  This dress is so flattering absolutely love it!
5.0,So far so good. Fast Shipping
5.0,This dress is beautiful through and through.
5.0,Bought this as a birthday present for myself.  I'm obsessed.  High quality feeling. Stiff bag that won't sag after months of use.  I prefer this bag over my $250 Michael Kors bag.
5.0,Works as described.  Definitely helps the band feel more secure.
5.0,Great jacket at awesome price!
5.0,This cloth is amazingly amazing  honestly I couldn't find enough things to buff and shine I almost couldn't  recognize my own jewelry...Oh yeah  and I didn't  Loose any diamonds that seems to happen every time i send my things  to the jewelry cleaner they always use power steamer witch work but looses the diamonds
5.0,I bought these for studs I never really wore... now wear them almost everyday.  Super sparkly and look expensive.  Great shipping and customer service.  Saving this seller!
5.0,High quality; great fit
5.0,"Love these pants, so comfortable and do not wrinkle easy which is great for me. I have gotten compliments the few times I have worn them. I would recommend and they are true to size."
5.0,"Ya it’s good and so cute , I bought this for my son and he’s very happy"

5.0,So cute and well made
5.0,Ordered these for a concert next month and they're perfect!  When they came in I was surprised to find that they came in a nice case.  I wasn't expecting that. I'm very pleased!  Would definitely recommend these!!
5.0,Such a beautiful and elegant accessory<br />Definitely a statement outfit with this necklace<br />A bit heavy than other necklaces I have but good quality.
5.0,Thank you I love it
5.0,"Very pretty dress for summer or island vacation. I was concerned about ordering my regular size (medium) because most of the time these types of dresses run small. I didn't want to have to do any alterations to the top so I took a chance and the dress fits perfect. I am 5,3 and wear a 34D. The top fits perfect, snug but not tight. My hips are 41 which would lend toward the size large. But because the dress is not fitted it still fits just fine. The length hits right at my ankles.  Very happy with my purchase especially for the price 👍"
5.0,"This was a gift for my daughter...It was beautiful and she loved it!...but after a few short months, the lettering is wearing off...can anything be done about this?"
5.0,It fits perfect. I love it and the shape. Highly recommended. Thanks
5.0,my son-in-law was thrilled with this case.  He has his autographed hat in it and it is now protected and visible.  good purchase
5.0,Super cute! Good pieces of jewelry.
5.0,i like it very much
5.0,Love these shoes! Super cute and fit perfectly :)
5.0,I'm sometimes weary of 3rd party companies on amazon but this one was excellent. The glasses are UV protected and look cool on my kid (He's 2.5)
5.0,"This dress is beautiful. It came remarkably quick and it is well made. The fabric is good quality and the skirt is full like the picture.  The only problem we had was that the top was made incorrectly. I contacted the seller, Lisa Dress, and they were amazing to work. They responded quickly and rectified the problem.  Thank you!"
5.0,Super great product no complaints at all
5.0,Lightweight and cute. This item was especially helpful when I was traveling in the middle east and needed to cover my arms to enter religious sites. I also used it to keep the sun off my head on those hot summer Cairo days! Good value for the price.
5.0,Really worth the price! Absolutely loved the colour of the pearls
5.0,"Great pants really long pant leg I’m 65 inches tall and I had to hem off about four inches. Fabric is so soft stitching seems good. I wear a US size sixteen (mostly belly, not a lot of butt) and these XXL were big, I had to roll the hem over once. I'm buying them again and will try an XL or even Large next time.  I washed and dried them and didn't find their to be a much shrinkage."
5.0,"I used these in place of a Christmas basket for goodies, everyone loved them"
5.0,Very nice necklace. Rec'd many compliments.
5.0,Little chip on both but fit well
5.0,It is so comfortable and stylish.
5.0,Extremely comfortable and fashionable!
5.0,The shirt fits perfectly as sized!! It washes nicely too!
5.0,"I love this set of earrings.  I am giving some of them for upcoming gifts, and it's hard to pick which ones I don't need!  The value is great, and the packaging makes it easy to split up the sets of earrings.  I would recommend this purchase very highly!!!"
5.0,Love these so much. Well made and super cute.
5.0,Got these for my Mom and she wears them all the time. Very pretty!
5.0,"Get compliments every time I wear these shoes. Comfortable, cute, and well made for the price."
5.0,Very good manufacturing!
5.0,"I ordered an XL and found it fit pretty well in the chest (I'm a 38C), but was very long in the torso. I was using it for stage, so a little two sided tape fixed it proper- I'll probably order a L in the future- cause I want one in every color come summertime!"
5.0,"Would buy again, wish they had it in black."
5.0,"I love this necklace. It’s fairly heavy and chunky, but it is rather unique and eye catching. It seems fairly well constructed. Great deal for the price."
5.0,This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />This is a great little tank top. It is loose and flowy. I really liked it and would purchase it again.<br /><br />I take leaving reviews seriously. I read customer reviews to help me decide what purchases to make. I only leave positive reviews for good products. If you find this review helpful please let me know by selecting “YES” where asked below “Was this review helpful to you?”
5.0,"This band was cute and because it's magnetic, it was able to easily be adjusted to fit my wrist without sliding around throughout the day. It did sometimes get caught on my fuzzier shirts, but otherwise I really liked it and would get again!"
5.0,Very durable and cozy.
5.0,Dope
5.0,"Omg! I've suffered uncomfortable toe rings that slip, pinch don't fit right. These toe rings are amazing! I don't even know I'm wearing them, keep checking to see I haven't lost them. Super pretty, super stylish. Love. Love. Love. Love 💖"
5.0,"Really pretty color (lollipop red) and the material is so soft, and very lightweight.  The packaging leaves a lot to be desired, so if you are buying this as a gift, have it sent to you first so you can present it to the recipient properly."
5.0,Got one for each of my sisters and myself. Cheap little gift but well made for the cost. Think chain links. This isnt going to fall apart.
5.0,"Nice hat. Quality seems nice, hole for a pony tail helps keep your neck cooler. Provides shade without being too hot"
5.0,Thank you for these amazing pants!!
5.0,"Beautiful, well made and fits perfectly! Nice deep brick red color a bit translucid."
5.0,Hands down the best pajamas I’ve ever owned! I have multiple sets because I can’t be without them. They’re cozy but not too hot. I can wear them around my house even in the Houston summer heat. Heads up that the pant legs are very long (which I like) but I am 5’7’’ and a size small drags the floor on me.
5.0,The beads are very pretty. They fit pandora perfectly
5.0,They are very pretty and the lining is so soft. They seem to be thick enough to protect me b
5.0,Great looking beanie.  My husband loves it!
5.0,"When I ordered these gloves, I thought they would be like the heavy yellow gloves I get at the hardware store.<br />When I received the gloves, I was very pleasantly surprised on the quality. (Very light, Very durable just like the heavy ones)<br />On an added note, they put in a fragrance somehow. Every time I put them on, I get a waft of sweet flower smell.<br />It surprises me every time, and puts a smile on my face.<br />I LOVE THESE GLOVES! I will definitely by these again.....and again...."
5.0,"OMG These Boots are killer! I would love to have one in every color they make. The fit is perfect, cushion and warm on the inside .....this Boot is a must-have"
5.0,I like these shirts.. I should have went one size smaller but I like them.
5.0,Good and cheap.
5.0,"This dress is amazing !! So cute, just like the pictures. I wore it to a wedding and got so many compliments on it. Perfect dress!"
5.0,"Bought these for my little nephew, he is a year and a half old and is obsessed with Thomas and Friends, so it made his day! They look like they keep his feet very warm."
5.0,These are great compression socks. Don’t hesitate to purchase.
5.0,My grandson really liked this.  It's cute and works as described.
5.0,Arrived on time and fit as expected.
5.0,"Fit well, excellent quality"
5.0,"wife loved it, shipping said a month, received it within the week."
5.0,I ordered this for my husband. The zipper broke in his other one.  This one was a little heavier than expected but that’s fine it will wear down over the years with all the washing it will get.  It fit perfectly.
5.0,Love these- super pretty!
5.0,I am obsessed with this scrub cap! I tried it on with my mask and i felt a sudden relief behind my ears. It is adjustable and comfortable. I highly recommend!
5.0,This jacket is a fantastic find. My husband loves it. It keeps him warm which is why I bought it! He gets compliments everywhere he goes.  Highly recommend it.
5.0,Fit and comfort excellent
5.0,"Bought them for my little girl because she's always losing her glasses. She loves her ""old lady chains"" to Keri up with her glasses. She likes all of the choices"
5.0,"I bought these earrings for myself, I thought they were cute.  What a steal for $8 and some change. I only wish I could find these in 24 karat gold or at least 925 silver. I have sensitive skin but so far no problems."
5.0,"Loved the little bags the earring sets came in, made cute gifts for my teenage daughters"
5.0,Came fast and exactly as described.
5.0,Birthday gift for my sister and she loves it!
5.0,"Gift for graduation. Had a little card, room for cash plus a little gift."
5.0,Perfect replacement ! just like my first one.
5.0,"Ok.. I'm short.  I have that impossible to fit long torso, short leg ""situation"" Add in the over 40 stress ""B"" shape tummy and shopping can be dreadful. I cannot remember why I ordered this size exactly.. But I'm glad I did!<br />Here's the reason, they're super big but in a hip and cute way! Almost like a classy, harlem chic look. I roll the waist band down a couple of times, the very nice synching at the ankle, up a couple of times. Throw on a bat wing T or even a fitted T.  My Fav flip flops, grab a matching bag and I have a super comfy, casual but chic outfit. I love the creamy off white color. The material has substance but is still wearable in the HOT, humid Florida weather. I'm very impressed and happy with these pants.  ...That I'll be wearing literally year round.<br />So to sum it up, they run big but thats definitely not a bad thing. I will be buying at least one other pair."
5.0,It took me one day to get used to these and now I love them and can't get along without them.  They are made very well.
5.0,Bought for my grandson who is a huge Dragonball Z Fan. He loves the shirt!
5.0,Soft stretchy comfortable love it
5.0,Fun size fits all!
5.0,"Very nice watch band.  Well made and they actually give you a nice tool that helps remove the old  band, and assists in putting on the new band."
5.0,"Rain poncho not used yet, but removed from the bag for fitting purpose. Nice fitting (5’6”) and looks from good quality. Maybe the bag is to small after unpack the poncho (difficult to fold in same initial way). In overall, is a nice buy."
5.0,Runs small but love
5.0,Really bright lights for the price and longer lasting than expected.  The ring (rubber bands do break easily).  I would rather step on a lego than on this light.
5.0,Item is as described. It arrived on yime.<br />We sent it as a gift and it was loved.
5.0,"This is a very nice, quality made dress. I'm so happy I bought this dress!"
5.0,"One of the best masks I've used. The adjustable strap means I can get a tight fit, and less fogging on my glasses"
5.0,Super cute!! Get them!!
5.0,️Beautiful snap ons but didn't look as expected on my shoes.
5.0,"I'm a free the girls advocate and these tank tops provide the perfect amount of support! The fabric is thick, not see through, and soft. Its thick enough to wear by itself and not feel exposed - or to layer on cold days for extra warmth. The white is BRIGHT white, black is very dark, and the grey is basically right in between. I was happily surprised by the quality considering the price.<br /><br />I measure 32C, shoulders 15.5"" waist 27"" hips 37"", and I'm a short-waisted 5'2"".  I got a M and they fit perfectly."
5.0,"Works great, very easy to use. I am not great at doing my own hair but with this product its simple!!!"
5.0,"My wife looks twenty years younger in these, I recommend them"
5.0,It’s on the small side but soft and comfortable.
5.0,"The product is what I was expecting, good quality n and good look"
5.0,"Gorgeous!  They're heavier than I thought, but very well made.  Love them!"
5.0,the way I want it is heavy
5.0,This hat worked out perfectly for our trip to Utah and Arizona!
5.0,I like this shirt.  I bought it for my beach trip and enjoyed wearing it on the beach.
5.0,I love the fit of this dress. I’m 53 years old. I felt confident and skinny in this beautiful made dress. It is definitely a must have in anyone’s wardrobe ❣️❣️❣️
5.0,"I really liked this dress, made well and nice and light for summer."
5.0,This is a great blouse. Really like the style and fit.
5.0,This dress hugs you in all of the right places! Definitely a dress worth conversation. Great price and excellent fit.
5.0,Um $7 love it!! Yes it’s short!  But you could wear shorts.  Even make it a shirt.  But for the money… great buy! Will it last? We shall see but for $7 who cares!
5.0,"Absolutely love these pants. I got a small in both green and grey and definitely going to buy more. The perfect pant for when jeans feel too constricting but leggings feel too pajama like. They are so freakin comfortable, the material is super stretchy but thicker than I expected, very nice quality. I might get a medium in my next ones just to get a baggier look but the small fit perfect."
5.0,"I purchased this for $8.00. One of those lucky finds I accidentally stumbled upon. I didn’t expect much for the price, but I was pleasantly surprised. It does run on the big side. I got a small and it fits more like a typical medium on me."
5.0,"These earrings are just so BEAUTIFUL! Prettier than the photo! So Happy with them, and proud to recommend these! They are so different and get plenty of compliments!<br />Arrived on time and packaged well!"
5.0,Nice and colorful
5.0,Love the watches is just perfect for my style a
5.0,Great fit. Great strap.
5.0,A little big but love it
5.0,I love this chain! I have no complaints and the delivery was super speedy. It saved me the trouble of making one!
5.0,It was a fun costume this past Halloween.  It was easy to wear and a lot of fun.
5.0,Love this suit. Well constructed. Size is tricky as you all know. Finding a suit that fits well for top and bottom is not easy. The cup size was too big I added padding to take up the extra room. The rest of the suit fits great.
5.0,"Easy to put on and take off, not easy to breath during sports takes time to get used to like all masks."
5.0,I bought this for my beautiful girlfriend and it fit her perfectly. I got the small and it looks great on her! Thank you!
5.0,"This dress was a perfect fit! I'm 5'7&#34; and 140 lbs. I usually wear medium. The only thing I would have different is that it is a little short for me. It hangs above the ground. But it feels good and it is a perfect, simple dress."
5.0,These are awesome. The grandkids love them!
5.0,"Ok so this is by far my favorite of all my bands. I have over 20 different bands yet I've worn this one pretty much every day since I got it.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the weight. I was expecting something flimsy and sorta weightless for the price. I couldn't have been more wrong and pleasantly surprised! This thing is weighty. Not so heavy as to be uncomfortable, but it's definitely not cheap by any means. I have medium sized wrists and have to remove 2 links and now it fits perfect. Changing the length was easy and it's neatly packaged with easy to understand instructions AND all the tools you'll need to adjust to fit.<br /><br />I've owned a few high end watches in my time and I can honestly say this band is as good as anything I've ever paid a lot of money to wear. I'll be ordering it again in Black this time."
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my son.  He really enjoys it!
5.0,Beautiful.  Stunning piece of jewelry. See
5.0,"This is the first, and I mean first sports bra, that really supports extra large twins! It is not too hot, not too tight, has adjustable straps that do not rub.  This is a great design for a sports bra, with full snug support.  I ALWAYS NEED to modify my bra purchases, with other wider straps, longer straps, because I am a swimmer who has large shoulders.  Not one other bra design I have found accommodates a girl with a broad shoulders and back.  This company has some other designs, and I had to modify one of their other designs but tried them again with this model.  Great success. Please make more models with this design and you will end up with bigger sales in the future."
5.0,cómodos
5.0,I’m always hesitant about buying pants/jeans in general because the way society took a turn with slim & skinny fit jeans. I’m 29 years old and love the regular or relaxed fit. I decided to buy these in XL since I’m 6’2 185 and boy did they have a perfect fit! My fiancé loved them and told me to order more colors and that’s what I’ll be doing. I like the length and opening pant legs to kind of overlap on shoes.
5.0,I got these in all they colors they have wish they had other styles as well.
5.0,Love love love.  Leather is soft  very efficient compartments
5.0,"This is a gorgeous dress, perfect length and fits like a glove. I’m 5’2 135 lbs I got the size 7"
5.0,Great quality. Cute design.  Well-worth the price.
5.0,"Its so beautiful. I love it. Its actually heavy, not cheap at all."
5.0,"These shoes are very comfortable, I am wide and they really fit me very well."
5.0,"Fits just write left space for my temporary ileostomy... And the sleeves are sooo sophisticated!!! Though I’m short the medium looked well it felt a little bit ast the knee wasn’t m so re I ncentue ileostomy/surgery is done a cute boot with a sexy help will really make it pop!!! Because for the first  debut I wore a majorly cute flat knee boot, I threw on jeans and it was an A++ ****star hit this past thanksgiving!!!! Surgeries over can’t wait to hook up with stiletto boot... the material is great thick warm comfortable I wish there were more colors!!"
5.0,"So very pretty, comfortable and fits really well. I plan to use when driving or riding in the car or truck. I hate having my hair blow in my face  this works well."
5.0,"Love this sweater so much. It’s a finer weave and isn’t prone to pilling or stretching out, and it’s thick and warm but not bulky at all. I honestly and not a big fan of the little neck tie, but you can wear with or without depending on your taste. I get compliments all the time and I like it so much I got it in black too. I am 5’8”/130 and small fits perfectly."
5.0,Fit perfectly very pretty and came early.
5.0,Easy to hang
5.0,wife order it
5.0,My husband loves it and wears it all the time
5.0,"So I ordered this as a V day gift for my boyfriend. And when it arrived this hat is NICE as hell. The logo, the colors, the fabric. It's all very well made. I'm about to order me one and I'm not even a ManUnited fan. It was just a super hat."
5.0,good quality!
5.0,Cozy and comfortable pj's. Material looks and feels nice. A bit pricey but the material is a higher quality than my wal-mart pajama bottoms for sure.
5.0,Great gifts for the important women in my life!
5.0,"It arrived on time, and completed my outfit!"
5.0,these are so heavy on my ears but are so cool!
5.0,Lovely necklace. It is the sane as shown. Looks great with any top and jeans. Cute to go out with!
5.0,"Good fit, flattering, mixed media, upgraded version to a sweatshirt. Can be worn as both a jacket and a top with a tank underneath it. My only improvement recommendation is for a gold vs silver zipper. Gold would elevate the look even more."
5.0,Light white clear vision works really well
5.0,This is just super cute. It looks exactly like the picture and it is very well made. I LOVE IT!! Now as soon as I lose some more baby weight I can't wait to wear it in the summer. Might be a little see through but not horrible. Fabric is nice and waist around the dress is stretchy and has a zipper as well.
5.0,Beautiful beautiful pink & I am not a pink person! For the price and quality you’ll appreciate!
5.0,With COVID-19 and the requirement for wearing masks regardless of what they are made of we decided to get a bunch of these and give them a try.  Some will say expensive for a COVID-19 mask but we find them to be much more convenient and comfortable than the other masks that we have around.  I'd highly recommend them.  Wash really well too..
5.0,Love this romper! My daughter is 5’9 size 2 and it fit her perfectly!
5.0,This bag has been fantastic for me. Very well made and the leather is great quality.
5.0,Good quality looks good
5.0,"It was as described, came in a timely manner, and the ease and comfort when wearing it is great! Washing it is fine. Holds it's color. Plus I am a big Mandalorian fan. I have received compliments on it. I would recommend buying it."
5.0,"One of those innovative designs that keeps me warmer on those colder days. I used rechargeable batteries to save on battery cost and pretty long lasting as well. I used to apply heating pads on my under layers for warmth in the wintertime, now with this I can skip that. Fits great on me as well"
5.0,Absolutely looks and feels like a high end bag!! Perfect for a carry on on the plane!!! Love this bag!
5.0,Very thing ever
5.0,"I can't believe these are only twenty bucks. They come with a mini screwdriver for your glasses, a pollinator test &#34;kit&#34;, a case, a bag &#34;case&#34;, and to top it all off a slick pair of glasses!<br />The only downside is when looking at any screen, the screen becomes a rainbow of colors."
5.0,The material was soft and flowing
5.0,"My daughter loves lol. When I gave her the lol watch, she went crazy in love with it."
5.0,Absolutely great watch.  Perfect size and even better price.  If you are looking for a watch that does the basics and does it well then this is the one.  Has a retro look that looks great.  Doesn't look like a flimsy or cheap watch.  Simple to set up and easy to read.  Can't go wrong with buying this.
5.0,"I bought these to make remembrance gifts for woman who have lost their babies. They are perfect and have worked wonderfully with my little baby bracelets! Quick shipping, faster than expected. Very happy!"
5.0,My only compliant is that the cup inserts come out every time they are washed.  They are pretty and well made.  The cup size could be a bit larger.
5.0,Cute hat for a low price! My nephew loved it!!!
5.0,"Love this coat. I am 5’ 6” and weigh 125. I bought the medium so I could relax and wear whatever layering I wanted under. It’s very flattering, warm ( I’m in MN) and comfy."
5.0,When these first arrived I immediately tried them with jeans and a button down shirt. One clamp kept sliding off of the shirt and I had to continue to put it back on. I tried to see if it just needed a minor adjustment but no luck. I had already received an email from the company asking if I received them and if they were working as advertised. I replied to their email as instructed telling them about the minor problem. The next day I received a reply from them telling me that they had another model with different &#34;teeth&#34; and that they had contacted Amazon on my behalf to send me the second pair. How is that for customer service!!! I'm waiting for the new pair to arrive but I also have been using my current pair with my uniform. They are working great with my uniform and have not fallen off. I imagine the current teeth are for thicker shirts while the new teeth are for thin button down shirts.<br />Great customer service and even a free second pair! One for work and one for home. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would gladly recommend them to anyone looking to keep their shirts tucked in.
5.0,"I purchased this dress (and shoes) on amazon last minute for a formal event I’m going to tonight. The dress fits great!! As other reviewers have noted the lighter colors are a little see-through but nothing that can’t be resolved with a nude bra and underwear. For reference I’m 5’9” and about 165 lbs., typically a size M in tops and 8-12 in bottoms. I ordered a Medium in the dress and it fits perfect, just a bit short but not a deal breaker and I expected that since I’m tall.<br /><br />I was worried I’d have to do some emergency sewing to avoid any coochie slips but this dress is really well designed, unless I spread my legs and squat nobody’s going to be seeing my ladybits.<br /><br />The sparkles really don’t itch or scratch once the dress is on. Only thing is it’s a little tight at the shoulders so that’s the only place where it’s itchy.<br /><br />This dress is a hard YES from me! It’s budget friendly and I think it looks good on, so I’d youre on the fence I say go for it! Really excentuates your curves in a nice way"
5.0,"It came off all the time before, Has not come loose once with the safty band."
5.0,I wanted this bathing suit so if I get burnt on my shoulders or chest I can still go to the beach and pool. Works perfect. Super cute.
5.0,Great buy! Many compliments
5.0,"I was hoping for a great 'winter' ring for my husband (his regular wedding ring fits in the summer but in the cold MN winter fingers shrink).  This ring is solid, heavy and very good quality!"
5.0,Exactly like the original .
5.0,Fits great!!
5.0,"Perfect, strong Velcro, they last about 2 yrs, durable, secure!"
5.0,"These earrings are beautiful. It is lovely how they catch the light & they are pretty color green.  I will say they are a little smaller than I thought they would be in person. I somehow interpreted the picture as larger. They are a nice size. They are a style that would dress something up or could be worn casually as well. They would make a lovely gift too. Very pretty, I would definitely recommend."
5.0,Just what I expected great fit.
5.0,"The size fit as expected and the material was soft and very comfortable.  It was packaged well in sealed, plastic wrapping.  The sizing and texture remained the same after washing. Overall, I recommend these cute pajamas set for your family!"
5.0,"This was a cute and sexy tshirt. The material is alright, but the price is great"
5.0,"When I first opened the package, I didn't like this top.  It's made of a rayon-type material, and I was expecting more of a cotton blend (my fault for not reading the description). It didn't seem to be of a very great quality either.  However, I tried it on before deciding whether or not to return it.  It fit nicely, draped well, and looked surprisingly good on! I liked it! I wore it to work the next day and got more compliments on this top than on any other piece of clothing I've ever worn! It is extremely flattering! A couple people even asked if I had lost weight! I even ordered two more in different designs and colors!  I've gotten tons of compliments on those tops, too!  I'm actually thinking of ordering a couple more! Love these tops!  (Note: This review is for the top with the buttons down the front that drapes out from the pleated front, not the one with the elastic waist.  There are 2 different styles, so be careful which one you're choosing at checkout. I didn't try the one with the elastic in the waist.)"
5.0,I love it!  One of my favorite shirts!!; I bought the green and the peach.
5.0,"When looking for new glasses I came across these and fell in love! Just the right amount of ""bling"" and the blue color is really pretty. It's darker then the picture but very pretty. They fit my face well and I'm really looking forward to getting my new prescription put in them. Ed at IT Glasses was great to work with. Recommend these glasses and this seller!"
5.0,"I received so many compliments when I wore this dress, I have more in my cart to order.  Love this product."
5.0,Perfect for all out door activities. My guys love them. Keep in mind they are knitted so they stretch
5.0,Great bag... Very sturdy and we'll constructed.
5.0,Beautiful little piece of jewelry.
5.0,Perfect for our 5year old. Fits well and are very nice. Softer texture than expected but still a great toddler boot.
5.0,"it was the right size for my combat belt and so far they are doing what they are design to do , when i wear them i don't notice them they don't get hang up on anything as in the jeans i wear or get in the way of the pockets an excellent product."
5.0,it looks very nice and good quality
5.0,yes it did take a while to ship it but 2 bucks for something cool like this?!?! totally worth the month i waited  it fits my ear somewhat even though mine are far larger than those of the model in the pic  its tuff to get it on at first but once you fig it out  its no prob at all
5.0,Very good quality and valuable product.
5.0,cute soft & warm shirt
5.0,Hat arrived quicker than expected and fits like a charm. Colors are accurate to the picture and the quality is top notch. 12/10 reccomend
5.0,"My little boy loves Mickey Mouse. We got a smaller size of this outfit yay goodwill which he has since outgrown and being that his little spirit was wounded at the fact that he could no longer wear his Mickey Mouse jammies, I found a larger size on Amazon. I get them big so that he has time to wear them before they get too little but the quality is exceptional. Beautiful packaging and brand new. I can’t wait for him to see them this Christmas."
5.0,Reasonable and has held up! Great!
5.0,Soft and usueful
5.0,It was a great deal
5.0,Love this dress. True to size.
5.0,Was only slightly too tight at the waist on me.  There is little stretch with a pencil skirt so I did return.  I will order the next size up when it’s available!  The pattern is great. Can pair it with a blouse for work or something sexier for night or a date.
5.0,Worked out perfect for my son in his time of need!
5.0,"High quality, excellent craftsmanship, beautiful hardware, professional packaging, great price, tremendous value."
5.0,"If you go up at least one size you should be very happy with the fit.  It's attractive and comfortable and modest.  The perfect lightweight feminine pajamas,  The green is more like aqua (blue), so be advised the color I received is very attractive but not green.  I also got the blue which had a navy floral print."
5.0,Let me start of with saying that I didn't get this expecting it to fit like a swim cover and actually use this as a top to wear with colored tanks underneath it.<br /><br />I'm a plus size woman (usually wear 1-2X depending on the brand) and the top is fits me long enough to be a mini dress. I would say it's true to the depiction of the model wearing the swim cover in the pic. But I will say that it doesn't look as solid when you're actually wearing it. The white is very thin and completely see through. So if you're looking for a solid and not see through cover then go with another one. I'm not bothered by it cause again I got this to wear as a top over under shirts/tanks. Since I'm a 1-2X this cover is snug and hugs all of my curves and lady bumps. It'll most likely be more loose on someone who's say a size X-Small to Medium in U.S. sizing.<br /><br />Also the cover is lightweight and the feel of the material used to make it is similar to what under armor is made of. This gives me reason to believe that it truly does dry fast due to its material.<br /><br />All in all of recommend this to anyone looking for a lightweight swim suit cover or lightweight top to go over tank tops in the summer time.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
5.0,Exactly what we wanted and very excellent service. Thank you!!
5.0,Christmas gift for son it was really nice a big hit will be back again this holiday
5.0,Adorable perfect fit love this suit!
5.0,Super cute and functional.  I bought it for my mom. The clip on it is not as sturdy as I would like... but still a good buy.
5.0,"This is such a great bag. The color was right on, it's very roomy and trendy looking too! Not only that, but a STEAL at only $20!!!"
5.0,expected what I paid for and got it thanks!
5.0,"Beautiful dress, the lenth is perfect, i am 5 ft. tall and like my dress not too short but not too long, it's the perfect lenth, till the knee.<br />Is very well sewing and the material is good. It's the second i buy in a different color. Perfect for any occasion. Highly recomended."

5.0,"My husband loves it. Fits him perfectly, thank you!"
5.0,"When I'm at the grocery store, the checkers and packers loading the groceries into my containers tell me they're they easiest to use of any they've worked with.  And since these are insulated, the food stays hot or cold until I get them home."
5.0,"Nice shirt, fits true to size. I bought an XL, but probably should have gotten a L."
5.0,"Cute, I like it for the price."
5.0,Absolutely what I needed. Exactly like the description
5.0,"Really lovely set. Colors are light baby blues and light aquamarines. It looks much more expensive than the price. The gold color chains are awesome. The delicate paid of matching earrings are perfect. I had bought the set in black and came back for the set in blue, too."
5.0,Very happy with this purchase. Only wondered why it took so long to receive. Glad I ordered in plenty of time to decorate.
5.0,Item was just as pictured! Looked adorable on my daughter!
5.0,Bought for my 3 year old daughter. she wears a size 7 shoe. they fit perfectly and she loves the smiling faces on her feet!
5.0,I don’t know what else to say aside from that I love the dress it has a very nice fitting both cute but yet have some class to it :)
5.0,Super cute and fun dress.
5.0,"This swimsuit is gorgeous and flattering! I was a little wary, but I had a gift card to blow and was really hoping for something I felt comfortable in this year.<br /><br />I have three children and went from going to the gym nearly every day to not having stepped foot in there in the past 6 months. My kids LOVE to swim - and so do I - so I desperately wanted a suit that would make me want to get out and do that. This. Is. The. Suit. It's gorgeous! It's flattering. It's comfortable. Price is on point.<br /><br />My only complaint, and I didn't even dock a star for it bc it's not the manufacturer's fault I'm a pear, is that you can't buy different sized top and bottom. The top is a little too big for me because I needed to size up to fit my butt. But, I mean, it's such a good price point. Most individual pieces cost around this much at any major retailer.<br /><br />Anyway, this suit is incredible and I'm actually excited to get on the water this year! My kids are going to be so happy that mama is comfortable in her own skin!<br /><br />I'm between 5'4 and 5'5. I weigh 153 lbs and carry most of it in my hips/butt. I got a size large and it was a good call! I might buy another one in a size down just so I have a better fitting top. The price is low enough that I don't have a problem with doing that.<br /><br />Update 7/26/16:  I have worn this suit everywhere. To the beach, to the lake, to the pool. I get compliments on it all the time, I always feel comfortable, AND it has held up so well. I never wound up buying a smaller top because there's a good amount of structure in this one and it's not so big that it causes any issues."
5.0,We used them for our students dinner dance they were lighted the entire even and days after student will wore them and they still lighted up.
5.0,Love love love this charm. It's unique in every way. Fits my pandora perfectly and  for a lot less money. Would recommend this brand to anyone
5.0,They were nicer than I anticipated.  Great gift for my students.  They loved them.
5.0,"Fit perfectly and looked great,  many people positive complements"
5.0,Work better than no show hose.
5.0,"During the cold weather, this scarf came in handy with its soft material around the neck and kept my neck plenty warm! Strongly recommend this & matches the color description on the screen!"
5.0,My daughter adores the socks. Fit perfectly
5.0,I've been wearing it all day and it's a really comfortable band. I like how easily it installed on the watch - I've bought other bands that I had to fight but this slid right on.
5.0,"Thanks so much for this brand of skirt! Easy and fabulous fit, and great make for easy travel because they don't crease easy!"
5.0,"I got my first Taxi wallet about 15 years ago, and now I'll use nothing else. The quality of these wallets is exceptional, my first one lasted about 12 years. The compact size of these wallets forces you to adopt a minimalistic attitude to what you carry, and the design helps you to keep the load light. I've had this new Taxi wallet for several years, and the exceptional quality has not diminished.Try one of these wallets sometime, I promise you that you won't be sorry. I highly recommend this item."
5.0,Very happy with this band for my versa 2 fitbit. It doesn't irritate my skin at all like the silicone ones do. Adds more of a feminine touch which I like too!
5.0,"Exactly as pictured, my daughter loves it, and it worked great while she was on vacation. Simple black hat with opening in the back for ponytail or messy bun."
5.0,I love this lil top so much. I like to wear it alone or underneath maxidresses as pictured. I wish I had more like this...! maybe short sleeved too!<br /><br />the fabric is like raw cotton or a heavy linen type.
5.0,Especially cute little shoe. Great value for the money.
5.0,"Wonderful product with color, style sparkel I recommend thia item. I love it"
5.0,It's beautiful & I love it!
5.0,Beautiful watch looks and feels expensive...  excellent price..i already bought 4..  definitely buy
5.0,"This is a perfect entry level automatic watch. The movement, detail, functionality, and ability to fit it exactly to your wrist size is an all around best buy for your money. You actually get more than your monies worth in my opinion. This will not be my last Orient watch, the Japanese care taken even for this &#34;cheaper&#34; end watch is superb."
5.0,Used of lifting and workouts. Shirts fit well
5.0,They’re amazing! Just had my baby 6 days ago and they’re so soft comfy and the perfect tightness for my stomach!
5.0,"My nephew absolutely love this item. I think I won the best Aunt award for making this purchase. Quality was perfect,cost friendly."

5.0,Great case. Used it on a trip to Mexico and nothing fell out. It even passed customs (didn’t take the passport out the case).
5.0,Perfect top for leggings. Ordered my usual size and it's a great fit. The pockets are a fun bonus too! I need this top in every color
5.0,Beautiful.big and great price!
5.0,"Got this as a gift for my mama.  She's 5' tall and 135lbs and the L fit perfectly!  She loves that the skirt is adjustable and that she can be covered but still feel cute.  For the price, you can't go wrong!!!"
5.0,got it for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it!  Not only did he look good in it but He used it everywhere.  He used it while he worked was able to call me and talk with while he was working and I heard him crystal clear. He listened to music too and he got a lot of compliments from his coworkers.  Great investment totally worth it!
5.0,Unique and I get lots of compliments.
5.0,These glasses are really well built and work fine. They are comfortable to wear and very durable. I couldn't be more pleased!

5.0,Love it! Elephants are my favorite 🐘
5.0,"When my wife first put these on, she thought they were elegant wedding gloves. She loves them, they fit sleek to the form of her hands. She operates the touch screen in her Silverado with ease."
5.0,"Not super bright in the dark, but it fits good and just looks kool!"
5.0,"I want to live in these pajamas!<br />I only wish I would have bought them a size smaller. I opted to buy them a size bigger because I don’t mind my pajamas being lose fitting, and also I was thinking they would shrink a bit when washed (it says in the reviews that they do) but even after being washed they were a little bigger than I like. But they feel like heaven, I seriously wish I could get away with wearing them like pants lol. Sleeps so good in these.<br />If your skin is sensitive to textures like mine is especially at night to fall asleep, these are amazing.<br />It’s winter now and they keep me warm we will see what they are like in summertime...<br />Bottom line, I recommend these pajamas"
5.0,got a pair for myself and one for a friend they are very cute we both loved them
5.0,Great sticker earrings!! Perfect for my toddler!
5.0,A beautiful fit and so gorgeous on my little granddaughter's first Birthday!
5.0,"Very nice, perfect for a gift"
5.0,My daughter absolutely loves this suit. The head band that came with it is adorable. It is a little baggy in the tummy but my daughter is also very thin for her age so I expect that in most everything we buy for her.
5.0,"I love them but got th3 wrong size. I didnt realize there was so many sized I between 1/2'and 1"" lol so these are huge. I will exchange for the same ones just smaller lol"
5.0,"I bought these bracelets for me and my love as Christmas gifts. My babe was truly surprised and loved his gift especially cause it was a set. We never take them off. So far no scratches, no tarnishing and no spotting. Great price and I recommend this for couples. 🥰"
5.0,"Comfortable, warm and sturdy!"
5.0,These are comfortable!  Nicely stitched and I like the softness of the fabric they used.
5.0,"Liked the pendant very much, the 'necklace' was not to my liking but I have an alternate chain for it anyhow!"
5.0,It’s a Great shape and kids loved it
5.0,Happy costumer here
5.0,"This bag is amazing! I love the material,the space for carrying items and it's comfort to carry. I love that I can carry it over the shoulder or crossbody carry. This bag is extremely durable, pretty lightweight. It's exactly as it said when I read about it, and my husband has one similar but bigger. I've gotten multiple compliments on it every day since I got it. Everyone asks where I got it, and etc."
5.0,Fast service and great value!
5.0,"Size up a half size. These are my favorite shoes. They’re versatile and supportive. I’m on my feet at work, but not the sneaker or clog type, these have saved my feet, knees, and back while allowing me to have a bit of style.<br />Do allow a couple of weeks for their comfort to reveal itself. They’re a bit stiff (not like other boots though!) at first, but soften a lot and become very comfortable."
5.0,"Loved this dress! Well-made. Perfect fit. Very flattering. Vibrant colors. Comfortable. Lots of compliments. I thought the neckline may not work for me, but It was great! I’d like to purchasethis dress in another pattern."
5.0,Is the back see through
5.0,I got the mittens for my mother. Her hands are always cold.She loves them.
5.0,Very strong
5.0,True to size. Exactly what I expected. Will buy again.
5.0,"I bought this shirt in size Small and it fits my daughter perfectly.  She normally wears a girls size 10.  The shirt is fitted for a girl, not boxy like many other Tshirts.  She loves it and wears it all the time.  The color is a dark gray.  We are happy with the purchase and quality of the shirt."
5.0,The bracelet is very attractive and well made.  The person who received it liked it very much.
5.0,"These earrings are simply gorgeous.  They are well made without being too heavy.  The pearls are as pictured in color with only very minor blemishes.  I recieved them super fast.  All in all, very happy with this purchase."
5.0,"It runs big and long, but i'm short so needed a petite size.  Dress is good quality.  Return is tricky."
5.0,nice product- very slow delivery.
5.0,I ordered these scrub caps since a coworker recommended them. BEST DECISION! These caps fit my head so well and do not shift around like many others! The buttons are also very sturdy and hold both my kN95 and level 3 surgical mask.
5.0,I love this mini backpack! It has a pocket on the inside with a zipper. I own other bags like this and my stuff In the smaller inside pocket always falls out. Looking forward to sporting this one!
5.0,These shipped fast! Extremely cute and we'll made. Only thing is an XL in women's it's quite bigger than I thought. My husband and I are using them for Halloween :) definitely worth the money!
5.0,Love the color but defiantly size up. Runs small. May be better for shorter people
5.0,Just what I excepted. I love the watch
5.0,Excellent fit!!
5.0,The color is gorgeous and the headband matches perfectly. Very cute!!!!
5.0,This is truly a beautifully made praye rope.  I bought this and the bracelet to remind me to try and pray always.  This was much better than I imagined.  The beads are soft and handmade and the quality is fantastic.  Very satisfied.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:4feb4048ac408bcba0174eb7a823a704]] This set is beautiful. It includes a nice gift bag. The box is decorative with a real, and beautiful, preserved rose.  The bottom pulls out and you see the beautiful necklace on black velvet lining.  The necklace itself is the perfect length and the pendant is so beautiful. Amethyst colored crystal heart with a rhinestone bow and butterflies. It is beautiful and I love wearing it. I also love the rose. The only thing I would do different is that I will seal it up to keep it looking beautiful forever because the acrylic cover is not airtight and comes off. Other than that, it is a beautiful set and very giftable."
5.0,Another great piece of jewelry. This necklace has it's own personality. Each silver layer has a different texture and you can see it. It hangs very nicely from the neck. A great piece.
5.0,Earrings are fun and something different to wear to the park.
5.0,This shirt is very comfy and styish. it fits a tad loose around the tummy which is perfect. I got the grey and it looks awesome. I wish they were still on sale I would be them all!!!
5.0,Cute and sensitive skin friendly
5.0,Runs a little small on the bottom. Other then that it looks great 👍🏽
5.0,very nice earrings.  they feel substantial in your hand and nice and smooth  I love them
5.0,"For those who are familiar with neck gaiters, balaclavas or, for viewers of the TV show Survivor, the “Buff”, you know what to expect from a neck gaiter.  This product is very similar but with some subtle differences that make it unique.  First, it is much thicker than the typical balaclava, and because of that it is not quite as stretchy and flexible.  It is also not as long as a typical balaclava, and lastly, it has an adjustable cord on one end.  The combination of these three things makes this somewhat different in how you use it.  For the life of me I couldn’t figure out what the purpose of the adjustable cord was and now I know!  This product is very soft, very warm (yet breathable) and feels good against the skin.  So, wearing it as a true neck gaiter is comfortable and functional.  Pull it up over your mouth, nose and ears and you have even more warmth.  Very nice in cold conditions, and especially if it is also windy.  Using it in this manner it fulfills the role of neck gaiter/warmer as well as earmuffs and face mask.  Ahh... but wait... there is more.  Instead of wearing it around your neck and pulling up, you can sort of fold it and wear it around your forehead and ears (sort of like a combo headband and earmuffs).  Ahhh... but wait... there is more, and this is where that adjustable cord comes in!  Pull it over the top of your head and cinch the cord and you have a slouchy beanie hat!  I have two slouchy beanie hats that I love wearing but one is TOO warm and I only wear it if it is extremely cold.  The other one I have is lighter in weight but is still pretty thick and heavy.  This neck gaiter, worn like I just described, is the perfect weight for this purpose - very lightweight, yet warm and breathable too, and it looks great as well.  While I got this product for pure functionality, I am very impressed with the different ways I can use it, and how good it feels (and looks).  $11 bucks for two is a deal and I have no hesitation in giving this 5 stars as it far exceeded my expectations.  Hope this helps!"
5.0,"excellent price, good product, have purchased before"
5.0,"A beautiful, well made piece. I easily adjusted the knots to fit my wrist comfortably. I would recommend this watch to any of my friends, and if lost, will definitely buy another."
5.0,Realistic
5.0,"Love it, color, durability"
5.0,"Very nice scarf and well made. Love the colors, I have two !"
5.0,"I was skeptical about this actually fitting but I ordered in both colors because I guess I was feeling optimistic that day! The XL is a good fit which is unusual for non Euro/US sizing. I'm 5'8 and 165 and have to accommodate the girls that live in 36E and this does. Also, these are a daily undergarment for me so they're delicate and pretty but have enough spandex content to keep them from being too fragile. I would definitely buy again."
5.0,"My Dad watched TopGun a million times when I was a kid, so when I saw this shirt, I knew it would be a perfect Father's Day gift. It arrived exactly on time, fit as expected. It is a good quality cotton tshirt and a decent print size. He loved it!"
5.0,We bought this as part of an end of year gift for a teacher who loves sloths. She loved it! It was very cute.
5.0,Worth every penny. Such a adorable outfit.
5.0,"Light weight but sturdy.  Such an elegant and classy set that you won't understand the reasonable price.  This inexpensive set will make everyone that sees you think that you paid much, much more."
5.0,Pretty ring.  Wear it all the time.
5.0,"I bought these shades so I had sunglasses that I wouldn't be too worried about if they got lost or damaged when traveling, and then keep my identical-looking and 10x more expensive Ray Bans for special occasions. Well... I have to admit I haven't worn my Ray Bans in a couple of months since these shades both look good and function really well. The polarization is just right and the tinting is just right for driving and general walking around."
5.0,"Love it, works perfect as an addition to my silver  watch.  I had to adjust the lock a bit, but only once as it had opened on its own, but it's done easily and it hasn't open since."
5.0,This was my first time purchasing from this brand. For the price and length it is worth buying. I love the weight and the style with my charm attached. Would recommend to anyone.
5.0,"These leggings are AWESOME! I did not feel sweaty or sticky in them. They are so soft, comfortable, and stay in place. I got several components too! Very stretchy fabric."
5.0,I love these petite little earrings. They're not too long of a hoop its just barely noticeable but you could wear them everyday. So cute!
5.0,"gift, the little boy loves it"
5.0,Great quality and perfect fit
5.0,Great heavy pendants.
5.0,Just received products and very satisfied. My daughter needs them for AFOs. She is in elementary school and I decided to get the larger size (to have room to grow) for her and am pleased. Our first pair was purchased from the orthopedist for about $2 more. She really likes the fact that there is no seem. Some days she wears them all the way up and some days rolls them down over the braces. They are holding up much better than the super thin long socks I was buying at Target.
5.0,Received earlier then expected. I love it!
5.0,Great buy... no color fading... easy wash... correct sizing
5.0,I find myself wearing this even more than I expected. It is lovely and perfect for a Dr Who fan!
5.0,"I love everything about this bag! It looks just as pictured, and seems like good quality.<br />I bought this bag specifically as a beach bag, nothing is ever big enough and I always have to bring multiple bags. Not anymore! I can fit 5 beach towels, toys and and extra clothes and I still have plenty of space.<br />I have read reviews of the handles breaking, I have not witnessed anything like this yet. I will update if there is an issue, as I've only used mine 3 times."
5.0,"I love this dress and the way it looks on me. It's very flattering especially if you are curvy. Even if you aren't, the flare at the bottom with the off the shoulder neckline creates the illusion of curves being wider at the top and bottom. My only criticism is that it does ride up so I had to keep pulling it down. I got a lot of compliments at the party. Highly recommend. I normally wear a size 12 and got a medium. The large was too big I had to return it."
5.0,"Love the fit of this dress and if this seller would provide it in solid colors (magenta, purple, turquoise, black, blue...), I would buy them all! The elastic part at the waist gives this dress great shape without need of a belt. The elastic at the shoulders Is not tight like other off shoulder dresses....So it stays in place, does t roll up the shoulders and  doesn’t cause any shoulder or neck pain either. I will keep fingers crossed and hope new colors arrive...."
5.0,10 year old loved it!!
5.0,Does exactly what it should - keep you dry and warm before and after swim. It’s nice and snuggle and keeps me warm even below 50F<br /><br />- the zipper can be sometimes harder to close<br />- I wish there would be a Napoleon style inseam pocket for car keys and a phone
5.0,"Very nice, looked great on grand daughter charm bracelet."
5.0,The print (unicorn and mermaid) is adorable! We've only had the leotard for about 2 weeks but my daughter doesn't want to take it off.  No complaints so far!
5.0,Beautiful.  Well made.  Love it.
5.0,"I bought this for a cook who has a small head.  Her old hat was disgusting, this thing fits well."
5.0,Came 4 days early!!! Its beautiful!  Nice and big fits lots of stuff. I am in love!
5.0,Love the dress but an XL was too long so I ordered it again in a L.
5.0,"Normally, this style of dress is proportioned all wrong. Thankfully this one is perfect! It fits in the shoulders while being loose and swingy everywhere else. The colorblock design is very flattering and keeps it from looking like you're wearing a tent. Quality fabric. Not see through. It will take some work to get the wrinkles out, but that's hardly a deal-breaker. I liked this so much, I bought one for a friend. Unfortunately, it didn't fit, but we'll both be looking at other items from this brand."
5.0,"So far so good. They're a Christmas gift for my daughter. I'll update my rating if they turn out not so good! But, a really cute color and comes with a nice case I know my 2.5 yo will love!"
5.0,I literally just received this so if the ere are any issues I will update my review. But the colors are exactly as described. They are soft and way more lightweight than the Velcro apple straps mine came with. Uploaded a picture because I mixed and matched the colors and was presently surprised at how well it came out. I took me a few tries to slide in the first band but once you get use to it it’s easy peasy.
5.0,"This is THE watch. Tells time. Looks retro. Tons of compliments. &lt;$15. If it breaks, buy another one."
5.0,Smart design and perfect for any car or James Bond enthusiast
5.0,"I am 5' tall and this dress could be worn without leggings - it would be a flirty length, but would work. Instead, I have worn this dress twice so far, both times with black leggings.  It is comfy, stitching is even, great value - makes a great travel dress or basic black dress when you want to show up a special accessory."
5.0,Timely transaction.  Love the belt.
5.0,I was a little unsure when I took it out of the packaging but after hanging it and all the wrinkle fell out I layered it with a cream dress extender and added a long pearl necklace - lots of compliments- I would buy again
5.0,"Cute, easy to slip into, great fit,"
5.0,My boy loves this little set. He is a little bit on the skinnier side so it fit him really well.
5.0,I like these shorts as they are long enough but don't look crazy baggy.  They aren't too tight around the leg either which was a fear I had as well since I do a lot of biking and have thigh muscles.
5.0,"Just what I was looking for. They are stylish, fit well, and provide protection at the same time. ."
5.0,Very cute top. True to size. Lots of stretch.
5.0,"The suit fits pretty good.  Material is nice and comfortable, not a thin product."
5.0,The are nice and soft.
5.0,I would give 10 stars if I could.. just awesome and very fast shipping
5.0,It gives you that good feeling and it fits perfect. I thought I would never wear a one piece until I bought this one and wore it since I was in highschool
5.0,"I ordered three different colors of this dress - red, yellow and gray - and kept the yellow and gray. The red, unfortunately, was different than in the picture. In the picture it looks like a bright neutral red, but in person it's too cool-toned to be flattering with my complexion and hair. Bummer. Luckily Amazon makes returns so easy, and the yellow and gray colors are both great. The yellow is brighter than mustard and very flattering to my warm skin and red hair. And gray looks good on everyone! As others have noted and the description makes clear, the gray lacks the stretch of the other colors. I think it might also run a little smaller than the other colors too, even apart from the difference in fabric content. Both the red and yellow fit me perfectly across the bust with no stretching at all, while the gray was too tight for me to button fully. But it's still cute and neutral and lovely so I'm keeping it!<br /><br />In terms of cut and quality, the pictures definitely don't lie. The fabric is smooth and has a nice weight, and all the seams are perfectly finished with no hanging threads. My one complaint would be the cap sleeves. They're loose on my arms but still puff out strangely? I might try bringing them in or something because they look a little awkward... As all cap sleeves tend to look on me, anyway. Personally I'd have preferred no sleeves or regular short sleeves. Still, it's a minor quibble with such a cute dress at such a great price! I'm probably going to buy at least one more color."
5.0,Excellent quality for what I paid. It's adorable and I get so many compliments.
5.0,glasses are great. Work perfect
5.0,Worked out perfectly. Fast shipping
5.0,Fun socks for teen
5.0,"Such a pretty piece to add to the Pocahantas costume. It's a little heavy on my 7 year old's head, but it doesn't seem to bother her and it lends to a better quality I think."
5.0,"this is one of the most flattering dresses i have received! love the flare at the bottom. the length of the sleeve and the neckline is also beautiful, a little hard to tie but it's gorgeous. i hope they would do a pre-made bow so that we don't struggle to make it because it is frustrating if you can't tie a bow and  you're in a hurry but when you do it right, it is a gorgeous dress. the color is not as vibrant as the photo of the seller but not as teal as my photo either, the poor lighting affected the color.<br /><br />also, i recommend wearing a slip.<br /><br />i am 5'2"", 36B, 160 lbs - i usually wear a medium and i ordered a medium. size up if you have bigger chest area<br /><br />length could be longer but still ok to wear with leggings in the winter."
5.0,Exactly as described in the listing. Pajamas are exactly as pictured on the model.  What I love most about these pajamas is they are 100% cotton which is hard to find and the price is reasonable.  The bonus is it was available in time for Christmas and it arrived on time!  Thank you for making this item available!
5.0,"Wife got me this as a surprise, for how much it was the quality was amazing! I love it!"
5.0,I paid about 6$.<br /><br />Overall its pretty good. Not sure I like the fit too much but its all preference I guess.

5.0,Loved everything about it
5.0,"Allegra K makes beautiful dresses,I'm a very satisfied customer, I also like the prices of their dresses."
5.0,I love my smoothie blender. I use it at work where I access to crushed ice.
5.0,Daughter loves it!!!
5.0,I used it for my hand purse.
5.0,"I really like this &#34;wallet&#34;.  It is only slightly bulkier than the Columbia front pocket wallet, a more traditional leather wallet with an interior cash clip, it replaced.  But I really like the way the cards are separated and displayed in the aluminum SHARKK.  And they are so well protected from bending.  I've only been using it for a couple of weeks now, but I'm certain I'll be using it from here on out for a long time."
5.0,"The product was a but large.  I bought a small and I usually wear a US 4.  However, I love how it flows and I love the non wrinkle fabric"
5.0,Super cute. My teen and I split the set. Very sparkly but too much. Would buy again. Looks more expensive than it was.
5.0,These glasses are beautiful and classy. I love them and they look good on me.
5.0,Ordered for a &#34;Disney Day&#34; at school.  It was great for a 9-year old.  Fit was true to size.  Nice quality fabric.
5.0,This bag is huge! It was a lot bigger than I expected it would be. I LOVE THE COLOR. I also like that there is clip on the bag to hold the excess strap.  Super functional and highly recommend.
5.0,I purchased these for my son who is a huge Rolling Stone fan.  They were perfect.
5.0,"These gloves are of very good quality , and an excellent value. The leather is soft and the lining is warm, perfect for a cold winter day. Received the product within 2 days. I had ordered the wrong size glove my mistake, and the company iGotTech was completely customer satisfaction focused, something rarely encountered these days. Highly recommend."
5.0,"they come with stoppers and they are very cute, i would buy for friends as a gift"
5.0,very nice 😍
5.0,"Had pretty low expectation given the price but I've taken this chain on 100-mike bike rides and ocean swims, and it still looks great."
5.0,The ring is beautiful and the size I ordered was a perfect fit.
5.0,"Fits great, I love the style, flowy, but not big."
5.0,"If you love the Christmas movie, ""Elf"" you are going to love this costume.  The overall quality of the costume is film-quality with the exception of the shoes, but that's to be expected.  The fit is great for a 5'11 inch person.  I'd definitely recommend this costume to bring some extra Christmas cheer!"
5.0,These are very light-weight which makes it easy to wear them for long periods of time without bothering you. Design is also super cute.
5.0,Nice and soft. Goes well with a lot of my clothes. Certain to keep the chill off my neck this winter.
5.0,"My husband loves the hat, though wearing glasses while wearing the hat makes the hat too tight (and his breath within the hat fogs his glasses).  He does love it though."
5.0,Look great. Heavy and well made. Will look excellent on my uniform.
5.0,This frame is gorgeous. I called the vendor to check about the delivery time and they were so kind.<br />I’m really happy with my new glasses.<br />Thank you Frames Network!! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
5.0,"Super cute and very flexible fabric. These are not thick stiff jeans, but almost cotton soft and very stretchy. They look amazing on!"
5.0,"I love this pendant.  It is a good size, well made, and I am very happy with this purchase."
5.0,"It works just great, and it really pretty. It has a loop for my keys, and a clip for things you might want to detach. It is very well-made too. Sturdy, but not clunky at all. It was a little spendy by my standards, but I am very satisfied with it, and use it daily, so felt the spend was justified."
5.0,Beautiful Cufflinks!
5.0,Still sexy and cute to wear but it's small. Oh well..
5.0,I hate wearing socks but these are so comfortable and adorable I wear a diff pair every day around the house bc we have wood floors everywhere. The different color eyes are so gorgeous and such a great touch.

5.0,My grandson can’t wait for traveling to open up !<br />In the mean time we uses it to .travel’ from room to room
5.0,"Just as I expected, good quality item and reasonably priced!"
5.0,I love it!!:)
5.0,"I was very pleased when this dress arrived. I'm 5'3&#34; and debated if I should get it. I did and it's a perfect fit. I wore it with flats today and it didn't drag. It would definitely work with a pair of wedges, too. The adjustable waist provides a customizable fit and I can even get away with wearing it even on bloated days. The only negative is that its thin so you have to be careful what you wear under it. The blue color is very pretty! I received so many compliments the first time I wore it."
5.0,I've received many compliments. I love it.
5.0,"My wrist are very little. It's fit perfectly. Looks very beautiful, fine."
5.0,"I love it! It is a bit hard to open, just use tweezers. I got a 16g 8mm and it fits my septum perfectly."

5.0,Es hermoso me encanta volveré a comprar en negro
5.0,"Good fit, comfortable fabric."
5.0,So cute and petite. Just perfect. Only thing is…..the stems are entirely too long. I easily handled that with snips and cut off the excess. No complaints.
5.0,perfect for once a year wear.
5.0,My pain in my v left arch is gone. Love 'em!
5.0,"This tank is very stretchy and cute! I probably could have sized down, but I wasn't sure, and I didn't want anything too sheer. The red is vibrant and looks great. I would get another color in this tank. It's perfect for layering. The length is long enough to go over the waist. This shirt is a little thin but doesn't show anything in the red color. I recommend this tank."
5.0,Comfortable and safer for my job as a psych nurse
5.0,Used it for our engagement photos. They are not uncomfortable and they are super cute

5.0,It's simply wow! Ordered 2. This color and the pink. Have pants linen pants from Zara but this fits even better than zara.!!!!
5.0,"Having “short” legs(29)these shorts are the perfect length.  With a 6” inseam these shorts don’t make you look like your wearing Cool Lots. Moisture wicking material keeps you cool and dry with breathable construction that has great ventilation keeping moisture away from the body. A small pocket in the back with a zipper, provide convenient storage for a key or a few $$. An elastic waistband with adjustable drawstring gives you a custom fit and feel that isn't too tight but stays on your waist.  To sum it up...good looking, good fit & good length."
5.0,Mom loved them
5.0,"sent as a gift, was appreciated"
5.0,"Color is good, made well, packaged professionally and fits as expected. Very cute pattern and several colors for any wardrobe style. I wear the one I got here open and loosely as an over shirt. I would recommend for something simple to add to any wardrobe."
5.0,These definitely keep you toasty warm. I sweat a little. I plan to use them while ice fishing to look like I belong like the rest of these locals instead of shivering like I've been since I've moved out of my element.
5.0,I havent worn this piece yet because its just been too hot in my area for something this heavy but I was sooo impressed with it! Looks much more expensive than I thought it would. And such a great price. Very happy!

5.0,It fits right. It is perfect.

5.0,These are great! They fit my big-headed 2nd grader. And I like that they don't squeeze in too hard on the sides and that the arms are rubberized. I can wear them too.
5.0,It fits perfectly and is really warm.
5.0,"My son loves these so much, when he wore out his first pair, I bought him another pair!"
5.0,Fit the ticket for our grandson when he was the ring bearer in my son's wedding.

5.0,She loves her snoozes! It was a gift that went over well!
5.0,"Beautiful, love the quality for the price!"
5.0,"Awesome boots! They definitely run one size small, I didn't read the reviews when I ordered and ended up having to return the size 13 pair for a size 1 pair. Will be using them for my daughters first trip to the snow next week."
5.0,"Brought for my 11yr old son who loves Family Guy. Great fit and bright colors, didn’t fade when I washed."

5.0,STARTED OUT A LITTLE TIGHT BUT EXPANDED NICELY..

5.0,as listed and on time
5.0,I must wear arch support due to an injury and often wear a supportive &#34;band&#34; around that foot. There is no need to wear it with these sandals! They are comfy and quite adorable!
5.0,Great product and as described!
5.0,"love these socks!! Very warm and soft, and your feet don't get sweaty. Elastic is very soft, but they don't slide down. I got them to wear with boots for work and it's been great. Washed them and hang dry . And they look great. Will buy another package for sure."
5.0,I love this little guy! He holds my badge for work and I always get complements on him! The magnet is nice and strong and holds really well. However I have bumped into metal doors and he stuck! So just be careful where your going
5.0,Item worked out great for sand protection in desert. Affordable nice design. Fast shipping
5.0,These yoga socks have very nice grip at the bottom. I've been using them for yoga and regular exercise in the house. Better than the other yoga socks i bought in the past!
5.0,"I really love this purse.  It is small which I like but still carries all the items I need.  The gray color goes with everything.  I'm very happy with my purse.  If you want a small purse without a million pockets, this is the one for you."
5.0,Had to exchange for a size smaller than size chart sugested ... the suit is great quality ... and the company was easy to deal with for the return
5.0,"My husband loves them.  He immediately attached one to his backpack as soon as he got it.  However, he said that it will be much cooler if the Silver Star was also on the helmet.  Thank you!"

5.0,Excellent quality and great fit
5.0,This purse is as gorgeous as it appeas in the pictures. I can't wait to accessorize an outfit with it.
5.0,"Cute dress, beautiful detail and colors"
5.0,"This dress reminds me of a silk trench coat, it looks very expensive. Once received - needs a good steaming. It looks really sophisticated on and can be worn as a dress or as a thin summer trench. It is really well made, and I love the color of creamy beige silky satin - it looks gorgeous. Really beautiful dress, and priced right."
5.0,"The material is the best,I need to order another color"
5.0,For the price yes yes yes currently had a baby I’m 5’3 160lbs the L fit good.
5.0,IT HAS POCKETS!
5.0,Very cute and good price!
5.0,"Nice lightweight and moderately tinted sunglasses with readers. Better for reading poolside than driving. Non polarized, but comes with a handsome protective case and microfiber cleaning cloth"
5.0,"I love the look and fit of these boots. I wear a women’s 6.5 US, 37 EU, and 4 UK so I got the size 4 UK (women’s 6) and they fit perfectly. They are bulky, but they are steel toes, so that is to be expected. They are made in China, and I must say my UK made Docs are far superior and lasted me over 10 years before the soles completely wore out. However, these held up for a week in a steelmaking melt shop environment, and they are now nice and broken in (and quite dirty as the photos show). After about the third day of wear, I wasn’t fond of the original inserts so I replaced them with size 6 UGG sheepskin inserts and WOW they are so much more comfortable now! The thicker insert also balanced out that bulkiness at the toe. I highly recommend these boots, but it’s worth replacing the inserts with one of your preference for a more comfortable fit. Photos show original inserts removed, and close up of how perfectly the women’s Ugg insert fits."
5.0,Love these...match any outfit or occasion and made well.
5.0,Fuzzy and comfortable. Great to just wear
5.0,Fabric is soft and fit perfect. I will buy other!

5.0,This hat is very comfortable and looks great. It is hard to pick which style without trying them on but im happy. Going to get a straw one for summer
5.0,This one fit me perfect! The color is so beautiful. My favorite thing about this is the cross straps! The top part is well made and cute! It's also very comfortable. This would be a great gift for your wife or self!
5.0,This a great bag for the price. I love the soft slouchy feel and the two zipper pockets. It is just the perfect size for an all around handbag!
5.0,Strongly constructed good quality
5.0,Cute eyes
5.0,"This top is really cute. I love the neutral cream color and how flowy it is. The material isn't stretchy, but the style makes it fit very loosely. I wear a size small in tops and an 8 in bottoms, and this could fit much larger sizes too.  Im 5'2&#34; and this could be worn as a dress, but the material is too see-through. It would look really cute as a tunic with a pair of leggings. I wear mine as a coverup to the beach and it provides the perfect coverage.<br /><br />I received a discount during a promotional period in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,Bracelet looks much more expensive than it is. Will fit at least 8&#34; wrist. Very nice.
5.0,Very pleased with fit
5.0,My daughter wore this dress to our local ComicCon. It was a huge hit. The fit was great and the hoop shirt was a great addition and it really added to the look. Had to adjust the crown and attach it to a headband but it was a super easy fix. Loved the item one happy little Princess Peach.
5.0,"Most comfortable slippers ever! Feel like wearing regular supportive shoes just lighter weight & quicker to remove. Very supportive to arches & heals. My husband has lifelong issues with his ankles & barefoot on wood floor causes him pain in his ankles, knees & lower back. Since getting these a week ago he has had no pain at all while wearing them. They look extremely well made & we have high hopes they will last many many years. I hop they do because the cost is nothing to sneeze at for a pair of slippers!!!"
5.0,"I contacted the company with a minor issue with this bracelet. Since I NEVER took it off after I received it, the lettering had started to rub off a bit after many months of continuous wear.Still readable but missing the colour in some spots. They immediately contacted me and offered a brand new replacement. I took a couple of months to return it since I needed the bracelet's message as a reminder to get me thru some medical tests. Sent it back finally and today, I was thrilled to receive my new bracelet. No problems dealing with these wonderful people at all. They kept in touch and held a bracelet aside for me until the old one was returned. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM! Thank you, Jewelry Brothers!!!!"
5.0,These key chain wrist bracelets are most useful and adapt well to use as gifts for friends and family.
5.0,"Wear these all the time! Have in many colors. I stopped ordering expensive glasses and just order a bunch off Amazon every couple months or more, whenever I feel like they've done their job or get scratched, and I don't care b/c they don't break the bank! Get so many compliments on every pair I wear!"
5.0,This shirt is so comfy. Fit perfectly. Love.
5.0,This shirt fit perfect! True to size and comfortable. It is really flattering and got compliments. The material is comfortable too.
5.0,Awesome quality yoga pants!  I have now purchased 8 pairs of these. They are super high quality yoga pants for the price and fit perfectly. They don’t lose their shape or fit either. They are good quality material.  I would recommend these.  They’re great for exercising and also for traveling as well.
5.0,"Super lightweight, well made, comfortable... my wife loves it!"

5.0,Very Beautiful. Can't wait to wear on my wedding day! I just wish it doesn't twist...
5.0,"Great shorts. I had to exchange sizes to XL. I’m 5’10” 205 lbs. Their sizing chart showed me a large, but the XL fits great. Quick drying for the southern summers"
5.0,"LOVED THIS COVERUp! The picture- Im in the<br />Blue!<br /><br />Flattering, dries quickly, covers for restaurants and walk up bars, could double as a little beach dress.<br /><br />I ordered one size up and I am glad I did. Not a ton of give and will beach and wet swimsuits i was happy to have a little room and still totally flattering.<br /><br />I ordered black, white and royal blue! The blue is my favorite!"
5.0,"I got 2 sets, one for me and my boyfriend and a set for his best friend and girlfriend. I love it!!"
5.0,"Awesome. I actually ordered the Red Scapular but was sent the five-fold scapular, which is even better considering only the brown scapular requires enrollment. Let the Grace's flow!"
5.0,Love the fit & the comfort!
5.0,Well made & very beautiful!
5.0,Nice quality and vibrant color. I usually wear size 0 and the size of this scarf is just right for me. The red one comes with two different designs on each side. The bright orange one is my fav! Nicely wrapped and fast delivery.
5.0,It was not good. I’ve decided I will give up on this company. Every dress I ordered I had to give to family or friend. Price seems good until you wash it and then it’s all over!!!
5.0,"Like another reviewer stated, this can be COSC grade accuracy.  Mine is +1 sec per day, which is awesome for an automatic.  Get 2 or more, then sync them with the US atomic clock, throw them on a winder, check daily, and keep the accurate one.  One was +1 fast per day, the other -35 secs per day.  These GL224 movements are ETA 2824, and can be very precise/accurate.  If I would have known this before, then I wouldn't have wasted my money on a Tissot PRC 200, with the cheap C01.211 movement (which is doesn't even work now)."
5.0,Super adorable purse and it holds more than I thought it would! The sparkles and colors are so cute. The strap is long enough for an adult to wear cross-body.
5.0,This is so cute..My new favorite
5.0,"I've had a few of these.  The watch itself is pretty reliable.  I've had a few problems in the past with bands and batteries (which are hard to replace, at least for me); otherwise, they're great, or else I wouldn't keep buying them.  :)"
5.0,Good product. Repeat buy.
5.0,Tutus can sometimes have too much tulle at the top and it sticks at weirdly but this fit mug daughter perfectly!
5.0,"These rock! I bought the matching sports bra for my daughter.  Bought several sets of each in pink, black, grey  camel, blue. Now if I could only find DKNY socks!"

5.0,"Original Chuck's that my granddaughter loved so much, she hasn't worn any other shoe since Christmas.  Same well constructed, high quality Converse shoe."
5.0,This is big enough to fit my iphone 7 Plus with case and pop socket in the zipper part. As long as there is not to much change in the change compartment.
5.0,I love  to change out my bands for my watch!! This was perfect band for those date night out. Ppl thought  I had purchased a new watch.  One of the best accessories  I own for my active fit watch
5.0,Surprisingly beautiful!
5.0,love the dress - i got many compliments on it. it was a bit longer than expected but worked out when wearing heels
5.0,"Second item I've purchased from this seller! Super dress, beautiful expensive feel to the material. I got navy to wear to a early fall outdoor wedding. It fits a slight bit larger than I thought but better than tight... The secret to fit with the seller READ the sizes I am 5'4 137 lbs a size 8-10 US. But I order large or XL depending on the size chart - works every time !!! Love the product and will order again."
5.0,"Even though this is an attractive picture, it does not do it justice.<br /><br />My wife had started wearing more scarves last year and I thought this one looked really nice.  When she got it, she absolutely loved it and then went to try it on with a few outfits. My daughter saw her trying it on and said &#34;No fair, I want one&#34;.<br /><br />When you get it, it comes in a plastic bag and is flat.  The way it's shown here isn't what it looks like. the only reason I mention that is that it can be worn several different ways with different folks and you can adjust it. It's long enough that if you don't use a tight know you'll still have a good bit of length but it can be made to do adjust to several different lengths.<br /><br />If you look at the picture you can see it a little bit, but it almost looks like it's electric when it's worn. Especially if you wear it with earth tones or white, when the light shines on it,it shimmers.  It's as soft as any fabric you have probably felt which makes it all the more comfortable.  Obviously, I'm biased but my wife looked absolutely stunning with this one and your lady will too."
5.0,"This is a beautiful scarf, it is exactly what I was expecting and the price was great! Remember it's a BLANKET scarf, and could 100% be used as a throw blanket, especially for the 7 year old at home! She loves it as much as I do! Can't wait for fall to wear it with thick sweaters and then a peacoat!"
5.0,"Cute dress at a reasonable price. I ordered a medium and it was perfect for my 5'1"" frame. I usually wear a size 6 dress, if that helps."
5.0,Omg I love it just like the picture looks very classy. The good thing is I received a bonus with it my 🇭🇹
5.0,"Love this dress. Easy, breezy and good to wear to the office or out in the city"
5.0,"I ordered two sizes up from normal. I am 5'8&#34;, less than 160 pounds, and curvy. Based on reviews, I ordered an xxl. Really, an xl would have been big enough. I advise ordering one size up from normal. Definitely a lot of room up top. I have a large chest, so that worked to my advantage, but this is NOT the suit for everyone. For me, this suit's color has not faded as one other reviewer had happen."
5.0,Good quality material. Great bag!
5.0,Love these!!! Bought them to wear for Halloween for a 1950's costume. Looked great!
5.0,"Product is well made, good fit, fast delivery.  Also good price."
5.0,It's beautiful and love it.
5.0,This is seriously adorable and extremely well made for the price. I have a feeling this will be my summer go to piece! Love it!

5.0,Quality fabric.  Washes well. my kid wears this shirt every day.
5.0,"Good Material, Nicely made"
5.0,"First I want to say OUTSTANDING to my DELIVERY DRIVER!!! ☺👍🏼🤩<br />My coat was running a day late & I was so worried it wouldn't arrive in time. We were attending Christmas in the Oaks in City Park in New Orleans that night and I so wanted to wear my new coat to this event.<br />Well it got here in time! WAY TO GO AMAZON!!!!<br />Secondly, the coat is just lovely! It fit perfect, it's warm, not to heavy and the cut is very flattering! I couldn't be happier!  LOVE MY BEAUTIFUL COAT!"
5.0,It was what I expected. Good quality.
5.0,Great little gift for the nurse in your life
5.0,"Fit comfortably, love how the color changes."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:a88485eba02ad935171f84e3caf54dc2]] Me agrado el material de la mochila..La maleta me costo un precio y me gusto pero apenas recivo la caja donde me la mandaron me costo mucho mas plata el envio que el producto me costo el doble...
5.0,"it is beautiful and great quality. It fits as expected. As for the size, it was tricky… I think i figure out how… make sure the shoulder and bust line fit me comfortably- give it like an inch or so extra, you'll be in great shape. This meant to fit a bit loose anyway. I ordered xl and my size is petite s/m. Color is even nicer than in photo."
5.0,Big roomy and easy to store between travels!  You can fit your tablet and lunch to easily board a plane .  Throughly recommend
5.0,Super simple dress that can be dressed up or down.  I love the cut.  If you are in between I would suggest sizing down.  I am a very athletic 5’8 215# and the large was to big in the chest area.  A medium would have been perfect.  I just reordered a new color.  This will be great for summer!
5.0,Just received my watch and I love it
5.0,New favorite socks. These are so comfy! I have thin long legs and they go up a few inches above the knee! perfect :D bought them in dark grey and loved them so much I went back for the black ones too!
5.0,Beautiful dress! I am 5.5” and 140 pounds and ordered size M. It fits perfectly!
5.0,Love the Retro look and the glass look awesome.
5.0,The dress is super comfy
5.0,"The Tactical Backpack in ACU Digital Camo is the quality that I expect from Aircee. This pack is well made and of the same quality as my more expensive packs. The zippers work rather smoothly and the stitching is done well. The padded shoulder straps tighten good and stay in place when I carry a full load. I like the small zippered compartments on either side for quick access items like flashlight, knife, bug spray, keys and my phone. I recommend this pack for those day hikes and outdoor outings. I was delighted to have had the opportunity to purchase this item at a reduced price for my use and evaluation in exchange for my honest and un-biased review."
5.0,Beautiful; good workmanship; priced much better than retailers and other competitors.
5.0,it is so adorable I loved it
5.0,love love love this!!!
5.0,"Great design  Really shows off the white metal color of silver.  Fit is adjustable, starts at about a 9"
5.0,what I expected. nice shirt
5.0,I put this on my birthday Wish List because it had a light so I could read it at night.  It turns out that it has many more functions than I realized.  I am going to enjoy this watch.
5.0,"My daughter loves this flannel! Bought it Christmas and wasn’t sure about the length as it is not as long as I wanted, but she has worn it several times!!!!!"
5.0,I thought it was great at blocking and it fits very snug.
5.0,Todo me encanto
5.0,Perfect love the color and style comfortable would recommend
5.0,For Halloween costume.  Seemed fine.
5.0,"Comfortable and stylish scrub cap, fits my head perfectly. The side buttons are a must these days to keep the pressure off my ears, wearing a mask for a 12 hour shift!"
5.0,Works for us big girls
5.0,These are sooooo comfortable.
5.0,"Nice fit and feel. REALLY comfortable and light material. Fit is as shown, snug on hips but a gentle flare at just below hips so it's a flattering look I think. Can be dressed up or look more casual. I ordered an XL and I am about a size 14 in pants."
5.0,"Worth the money. They are super pretty! If you are sensitive, I don't advise getting these as they are not high quality metal."
5.0,"This seller scores again, with exceptional quality and price.  Thanks."
5.0,Love these..Started a collection!
5.0,"Love this thing. Very high quality. I am athletic build. 5'11, 190lbs, 32 inch waist and 44 suit jacket to give you an idea. Got the L. Fits well but I did get the mid section tailored in because its a bit wide. Other than that, awesome jacket. Will definitely purchase more from this company!"
5.0,"I got this on a whim, and I’m glad that I did.<br /><br />I really like the way it looks on me - the “two tone” look is very nice - and it’s particularly useful now that the weather has turned cooler.  The “fur” lining makes it very comfortable and keeps me comfortably warm in cool conditions.<br /><br />It fits well, and was true to size."
5.0,I love this blouse.. it fits great and I have gotten a lot of compliments on it.
5.0,"DESCLEAMER AND UNBIASED REVIEW I GOT THESE PRODUCTWITH THE DESCOUNT IN EXCHANGE OF MY HONEST REVIEW FIST OF ALL IGIVE 5 STAR OF THESE PRODUCT WHY,. ONE OF THE THING I LIKE ABOUT IT IS NOT EACHY TO WEAR mean that even though you wear it dry or wet the swim dress are good for our skin specially me,. I like the color navy blue with strip so cuter, I also like the under cause kind a sexy but good to wear . I also wear these one around the house cause I like it not hot nor uncomfortable which is good and cool to wear,. over all of these swim dress are good quality and its really fit for any size accordance to your sizes is,. material are good and its make satisfaction for he customer like me."
5.0,The pictures on the site do not do these shoes justice. They are wonderfully sparkly without having to deal with glitter and it falling off everywhere. They are well made and higher quality than normal shoes and my daughter absolutely loves them. We bought for a Halloween costume but she’ll be wearing them a lot more than that
5.0,Q dress you get a lot of compliments on well made great deal for the pros and
5.0,"Amazing, great quality and fits perfectly."
5.0,I have wide feet and they were snug trying to slip on but once I got my fat foot in the boot it felt great! Now I want all the colors!
5.0,The alloy used is fairly light so the pins don’t weigh down the fabric as much as some pins might. They are well crafted and cute as can be ❤️. I love the four pack of hearts I bought a couple years ago. I just lost one (my own carelessness) and felt like I needed some more. The six pack is very nicely done too. I wish for more designs to add to my collection.
5.0,Will make for a great easter pic.
5.0,These are very nice keychain holders. I brought them to hold the airpod case and my usb drives.
5.0,A gift for my son who LOVES it!  Keeps time well.  A classic beauty.
5.0,My husband loves it. Great product for the price

5.0,This is a nice shirt for the price. Thick shirt and warm.
5.0,Very cute tops and good value. You may want to go one size up.
5.0,Earmuffs worked great!! Took our 3 month old to a journey concert and it was a success!! He slept through the whole thing =) They were a little tight at first but my husband wore them for awhile to give them a little stretch!!
5.0,Would buy again a great jacket alternative
5.0,"This is probably the best band for MOTO 360 in terms of the price, it is very high quality I am really surprised."
5.0,"Product was lost in my mail room, but I found it. Once I did, and tried it on, the fit was perfect! Thank you!"
5.0,"nice shorts, great value, but fit was too big"

5.0,"Good material, good color, good size, i loved!"
5.0,Great dress . I ordered olive and it's beautiful w pockets . Will order more
5.0,Lightweight and ideal for summer rides. Much cooler than any jacket I tried.
5.0,WHAT SIZE IS THIS WATCH?  Everyone goes on and on and NObody tells you the exact size.  Even the descriptions of the manufactures don't give the sizes.  People want to know the size of the watch  not if it is too large for you or too small for you.  What size is the watch.
5.0,"Great product, shipping was even better. Fit perfectly to my frames. Recommend 100%!  I am sure I will buy all my replacement lenses from MRY Lenses!"
5.0,Wish I knew about this product sooner! It's awesome for cleaning up my Hunter rain boots. I use them on my daughter's rubber rain boots as well.
5.0,Battery is what to be expected for AA
5.0,Got these for me mum to wear at her job that involves her staring at small type on a computer screen. These helped a lot. Didn't help her not get laid off cuz of stupid covid but I can't hold that against them.
5.0,So perfect for my child’s dress up day
5.0,Fits great. awesome cap
5.0,"Awesome Value for the Money . Light weight , Great fabric used . Very comfy and fits well. Im a medium and medium fits perfect. Definitely recommend 👍👍"
5.0,After I wore it I ordered a 2nd set.  The clip adjusts to my tiny ear and stays on.  Love them
5.0,"Muy hermosas, volveré a comprar otra  vez. Se miran de buena calidad, no pesan nada.  Vienen 3 de cada uno, total 36. Recomendado."
5.0,It has 8 stitches which is usually a sign of a good quality hat.
5.0,"Just what I needed to keep my wraps from slipping off while moving around. This is perfect, and I like that it has plastic grips over the metal clips so it won’t damage the material. Easily repositionable, too, to wear many ways with any wraps (or cardigans, or whatever)."
5.0,My son was so happy to get these!
5.0,"My 5 year old is so picky about shoes and complains easily.  She wears these without complaint, and they are super cute with her church dresses!<br /><br />Only giving 4 stars on durability because they are easily scuffed."
5.0,"Very pleased with the quality of the product, price, and shipping."
5.0,The best solar watch I have ever purchased. For the price you cannot beat it. It has gone through a lot of beating up in it still works perfectly. I took it with me during military training in the field and get pretty beat up and it still works very well. I get compliments on it all the time and I am so surprised.
5.0,"I like all about the top,"
5.0,"Silky feeling shirt, son loves it, washes well."
5.0,"I purchased these to replace the lenses with prescription lenses.  They arrived really quickly. They are packaged in a nice case, with a cleaning cloth and should protect the glasses. The styling of the glasses are bigger than I have worn previously - so they should be good for sunglasses. They seem to be well made and fit well. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these glasses.  I received this item at a discount for my fair and honest review. Like everyone else, I rely on these reviews before making a purchase. The discount does not influence my review."
5.0,"Bought this for my fiance, he looked great in it, and loved it :) it couldn't of been better, just perfect."
5.0,Well Made...Nice and Heavy Mens Watch...
5.0,"Loving this thing so far. It has lots of pockets for all of my cards and other small items. There's also room to put a phone in one of the large pockets. There's a handy loop inside you can clip your pen on. I'm sure there are fancier wallets out there, but for the price, I'm happy with this one."
5.0,"I work for UPS loading and unloading trailers. I must say these boots are the best out there and the price is also awesome. I have plantar fasciitis, and they are super comfortable, I didn't have to put my ""special"" insoles. Weights and heavy items have drop on my toes and the boots remain intact and they are non-slip. Also they are super light. I would recommend this boots to anyone and I will definitely buy them again."
5.0,These glasses sit perfectly on my face and fit me properly.
5.0,Oh so pretty. I love these bracelets and I am getting my daughter hooked on them too. Prefect accent to any outfit for a flair of color.
5.0,Fits to size!! Very soft and comfy
5.0,Is goed.  Geen commentaar
5.0,"Just wish I could've pick what kinds of colors to include. Loved half, wouldn't have picked the other half. Cant complain, such a good deal!"
5.0,"These are the best sunglasses I have ever owned..the lens color is perfect!!! Not too dark, optics amazing..thease are spot on...thank you. SA106 MELA BRAND!!! ❤"
5.0,Nice but I didn't use it yet
5.0,It fit perfectly.
5.0,"I have poor circulation in my lower legs. Wearing compression stockings helps to keep blood moving as it should back UP my legs, instead of pooling in my lower legs and causing swelling. I wear these stockings not just for travel and exercise, but actually ANY time I wear slacks/the weather is not 90+ degrees! Some compression stockings are more compressive than these are... but they can become uncomfortable, especially around the elastic near the knee, because of that. These stockings are compressive enough to help circulation — AND comfortable enough to forget you’re wearing them. AND THEY’RE CUTE! They look like they’re part of your outfit!"
5.0,"Perfect size, and price. They look more expensive than they are. They are not the same size though, the ones with more strands is a bit longer. Still great though."
5.0,"Bought this for my mom to hold her Rand McNally Large Scale World Atlas to keep it neat and clean, and it fit perfectly. It came in handy during her road trip and we both think the star design on the outside of the bag is beautiful!"
5.0,Worked like it should
5.0,thank you soo much Boyfriend LOVED IT.: )
5.0,"These earrings are fun, pretty and I always get a compliment on them.  😇"
5.0,"I read the reviews.  I ordered XXL, because I am short waisted, and wanted a looser blouse. I should have just sized XL.  If you are a 40 D, a XL will still fit looser. I recommend XL"
5.0,"Like most Patty Boutik items, this does not disappoint. Great fit, soft material, stylish cut."
5.0,"Sturdy and durable luggage tags. I like that there is a selection of very bright primary colors. Even though I use ribbons and stickers to make my bag look different, this is great as well.  The steel ring that attaches to the luggage is also a great feature of this luggage tag."
5.0,"Looks just as pictured. As with all off-branded charms, they don't screw onto the Pandora bracelets, but don't be worried; just buy the Pandora spacer and put it on last, and it will keep those pesky &#34;screw-less&#34; style charms on while you remove and apply the bracelet to your wrist."
5.0,Very cute and my daughter loves them. She is 2 and they are a little big but she can and does wear them.
5.0,love the look and material.  well priced and good quality
5.0,This item is amazing it's very shiny fits well looks great thank you so much I will definitely buy items from this seller in the very near future thank you
5.0,I ordered these thinking they would be too short for my pregnant belly but I was wrong! I am currently 32 weeks and 4 days and they cover my belly plus more! They are a bit thin but I love them!
5.0,Love these shirts
5.0,This hat fits and looks great. Have problems sometimes having hats not fit or look right on my head and this is perfect.
5.0,me gusta mucho y muy barato y buena marca
5.0,Super cute for my daughter's 5th Birthday!!
5.0,Nice cotton!
5.0,Trendy and it is Not heavy . My son has type of “loaf feet” and the Velcro makes it easier to wear it.
5.0,Super comfortable and warm. Excited to stuff these in some gift bags for Christmas!
5.0,Ideal
5.0,"For the price, they are great!  I would be happy to buy another pair, and probably will."
5.0,"Comfortable, soft material for delicate baby skin. Cute dress!"
5.0,This key chain is so cute and well made!!! Its real leather and it really doesn't look cheap. Maybe its a little smaller then I expected but it doesn't bother me at all. Really love it!!!
5.0,Perfect belt for my husband. He loves having the extra holes as it stretches out.
5.0,Glasses finished off the costume.
5.0,"AWESOME PRODUCT, HOLD UO GOOD,"
5.0,I didn’t have high expectations but it’s actually really pretty and sturdy lol I got lots of compliments
5.0,Thank you would buy again!
5.0,"Helps my daughter regulate, has a calming effect."
5.0,"I love the glasses, but sadly have to return.  I take a +2.75 but this only comes in +2.50 or +3.00. I ordered the +3.0 and it is too strong.  It just doesn't work for me, although I found the glasses stylish and comfortable.  Will keep looking..."
5.0,Great for my pocket with out them breaking.
5.0,Perfect for my niece on the go.
5.0,Bought for Christmas. He lives Fortnite.
5.0,My camouflage janpanes safety steeltoe boots fits completely comfortably and cool thumps up I'm loving these boots
5.0,"Love this shirt so much! I'm 5'3"" 135lbs, B cup, and a small fit me perfectly. It's not snug and has a casual, looser fit to it. Colors are great and the twist in the front lays pretty flat and doesn't stick out too much. Love it so much I'm thinking about buying another color"
5.0,Love! Looks great on. Many compliments!
5.0,"I bought this skirt first in dusty blue, and loved it, so now I have the beige one. The fabric has a great texture, somewhere between linen and crinkle, if that makes sense, and is very opaque (but I still wouldn't wear black undies under the beige skirt). It is the opposite of clingy. It breathes, and the skirt sways as you walk.<br /><br /> I like the pockets a lot. Some reviewers complain that they stick out too much. I think that they are an interesting detail. Sort of French country. But they do change the silhouette. So I would like the option of having the pockets hang open OR closed. I bought some nice antique copper snaps from CraftMeMore and will add them. I believe that all I need is a hammer and a little patience. I'll come back with a photo when done. See the cool snaps at https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074Y8WZ7H/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />The elastic waist has enough give to feel very comfortable, but not loose. It feels like maybe an inch wide inside the hemmed &#34;pocket&#34;. I wear a size 16-18 bottom, depending on the cut, and size 14 on top. 5'6&#34;, 175 lbs. So I ordered an XL based on the reviews. (Yes, the Zeagoo label says XL, no matter what it says above my review.)<br /><br />If you like the look and feel of linen, this is a good buy, and a great, casual skirt that is also nice for work. I wear it with a white linen-weave shirt, tucked in, with a wide leather belt from Leatherock (the most pricey item so far) and little boots with cuban heels by Carlos Santana, at https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FFSG8HK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
5.0,"Very well laid out watch for children due to 5 minute/second increments displayed on bezel as well as all the hours on the face vs.12,3,6,9 only which is common. Hour and minute hand is clearly labeled. Grandson (6) likes it a lot and we will see how long it lasts."
5.0,"Nice fit. I am short 5'2&#34;. but they gather nicely at the ankles. I have had numerous compliments every time I wear them.  Even from a security guard at the airport wanted to know where he could get a pair for his wife.  I always wear a little longer shirt to always be appropriate, but so cute with flats or a strappy sandal. My husband says very sexy.  Don't think I will ever wear jeans again.  I love these so much! It's like going about your day in your pajamas. I wash then in cold water and never put them in my dryer.  They also make these leggings in Ultra Soft and the fleece lined is extra warm for winter!!  They are only $1.00 more but absolutely to die for.  I have atleast a dozen pairs and have given at least 6 pairs as gifts.  Everyone loved them and asked where they could get more.  By the way, I am 65 years old.  They make me feel young.  I think they look nice on even women who have a tummy going on, if worn with a loose shirt.  Can't go wrong. The quality is excellent.  Just make sure always from Leggings Depot!!"
5.0,"I’m not even sure where to start…<br /><br />This dress is quite possibly the best buyable item that the Internet has to offer, and yet I almost missed it, because it’s mislabeled. I get that there are copyright issues at play here, but listing this dress as “Paradise” Cartoon print is just wrong. This dress captures the ‘Earth’ or center panel of Hieronymus Bosch’s “The Garden of Earthly Delights”, and like the original, it is truly stunning. What’s even more exciting is that this item is also available in “Imagination” Cartoon print ([[ASIN:B01A0G0QFM Women's Cartoon Printed Stretchy Sleeveless Pleated Fit and Flare Skater Dress]]), otherwise known as the ‘Hell’ or right panel of the same masterpiece.<br /><br />I am 135 lbs. at 5'4&#34; and although this item is rather revealing for my 29-year-old self, I love it! The material is sort of silky feeling, and very stretchy.  It’s quite short, and pretty snug around my chest, shoulders, and arms, so others should be weary of the “One Size Fits All” tag.  Furthermore, I would suggest wearing something underneath this dress, as the material appears to be rather sheer.  All in all, I am really happy with this purchase, and am definitely going to order a second dress in the corresponding print ([[ASIN:B01A0G0QFM Women's Cartoon Printed Stretchy Sleeveless Pleated Fit and Flare Skater Dress]])."

5.0,They were too big but only because my two and a half year old is really tiny lol
5.0,"This bag is fantastic. Great materials inside and out, love the little velvty front pocket. The shoe compartment is fantastic, I teach indoor cycle so I have to bring my cycle shoes to class and they fit in here, even with clips on. Great pockets inside and very roomy! Like the air vents to the shoe part too!"
5.0,This is an adorable girls' maxi dress.  My daughter sees me wear them often and was convinced that she wanted one of her own.  She is 4'9&#34; and I ordered her the 12 years' size.  It hits the floor when wearing flat sandals and she loves it!  She always receives compliments when wearing it.  We have washed it several times and it has held up well.  I will purchase this again in other colors for her.
5.0,"Love this mask. Received tons of compliments, plus it's my favorite Super Hero group!! It has the pocket for the filter and comes with 1. Like the adjustable strings by your ears so its not too tight."
5.0,I was so pleasantly surprised with these earrings. They’re beautiful in color and just the right size. For the price they were exquisite. I just love them!
5.0,I have these in white and loved them so much I decided to get them in red as well. I love how sturdy they are.  They stay in so well. I like that they can be worn with jeans and a sweater or worn with a nice dress.  They are so versatile. I was offered these at a discounted rate for my honest review and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice pair of earrings that they can wear often with a variety of outfits.
5.0,Love this because they can fit my toes
5.0,"I love this necklace!  I am a crazy cat lady and just think the necklace is adorable!  It fits very well and doesn't seem to be flimsy. I don't get the impression that the chain will break at the slightest little tug, which is important to me."
5.0,Love the quality and look of this top.  Same top much more expensive at the Johnny Was store and Neiman Marcus.
5.0,Gifted these to my boyfriend for Christmas and her absolutely loves them!
5.0,great - handmade feel and look. daughter loves them.
5.0,"He loved it!<br />Super soft, fits as expected (5ft 10in) & warm. It washed well so far."
5.0,Perfect for my cindy lou who costume for my Christmas party!
5.0,Great product; nice quality.
5.0,"Beautiful pieces, I have not worn the set yet because of perfume irritation around my neck!!!  I can't wait to though!!"
5.0,"Great product, fast shipping!"
5.0,These have been amazing for our 4 year old nephew who is scared of loud noises. He was able to enjoy himself at a fireworks show as well as Monster trucks. These are thing he would have refused to attend without them. We bought some for our son but my husband has used them more. 😂 Great all around and I feel they are perfect size.
5.0,Used for 3 yo new skier.. Saves grandpa's back while training. Great for speed control and learning independence.
5.0,My daughter loved them!  They do have rubber bottoms.  Will be perfect for our rainy winters.
5.0,True to size. Bought it for a christmas present for my sister she loved it!
5.0,Very comfortable and the colors are great.
5.0,Fit perfectly on my daughter head
5.0,The glass is so shinny. It's very light & pretty.<br />I like it.
5.0,"Recipient says it is soft, and washes well.  Color is nice and fit is as expected."
5.0,It is so cute and shiny. Very beautiful
5.0,I love it...Fits true to size
5.0,I mistakenly ordered medium should have ordered large.  Excellent product.
5.0,Just like the pic ..fits perfect ..can't wait to wear it for next party
5.0,"Cute watch, its exactly what it looks like in the picture that is shown. Makes a good gift for anime fan."
5.0,"Kept some and gave some as gifts to coworkers! Love the designs, quality is great for the price, very pleasantly surprised!!!"
5.0,i love it. would buy again. good quality. fit perfectly.
5.0,Honestly one of my new favorite necklaces! It is the perfect length and looks really nice!
5.0,"The tie is just as it appears in the listing. The only issue we had with it, was that the tie is long enough for a full grown man. My daughter is tall for a 16 yr old, but we still had to fold up the excess tail end of the tie and tape it up out of sight. We were pleased with the look, and she received lots of compliments."
5.0,"It's pretty cute, fits me on the second out-most snap but my neck is fairly slender. My neck did begin to itch when I put it on, but it's some purplish residue on the choker itself that does this, and you can fix it and avoid the rash other people talk about by washing probably or scrubbing with an alcohol soaked cotton ball until it's saturated if you don't want to wait for it to dry from water, the higher the % the faster it will dry and it's also probably better for the material and metals."
5.0,"Exactly as described.  Colors aren't as vibrant as what's shown in the image, but they are cute anyway.  Exactly as described, sturdy, and a great value for the money."
5.0,"Love it!  I am hoping that the anklet will not tarnish in time.  Otherwise, I like how the anklet is linked together."
5.0,"I’m in the gym 5-6 days a weeks and I expect to be comfortable while working out. This product provides that for me, these workout sleeveless hoodies are extremely comfortable, as well as sweat resistant. I would highly recommend for any gym junkie, or casual goer."
5.0,I ordered this for myself to remember a friend who loved sunflowers. It is just a fun little ring.
5.0,"Love this set! It is so comfortable and would be perfect for breastfeeding Mamas!<br />I ordered a large but probably could get away with a medium, but I prefer my pajamas to be a little oversized"
5.0,Purchased this necklace for my husband as a gift for Christmas. Can't wait to give it to him - he'll really like it.<br /><br />Great design. Very happy.
5.0,Fits great.  Needs a shirt under it because it is cut so low.
5.0,Just as pictured! Nice quality! Exactly what I wanted.  Looks great!
5.0,"Love the pin! just what I wanted, thank you!"
5.0,"This band is a very good band , especially for the money."
5.0,Nice soft and comfortable. Fits well on guitar and on you.
5.0,So in love with this. I ended up getting this for my younger sister. It is so cute but I will say it was tight on her neck. And yes I know it’s suppose to be a chocker BUT it was tighter than that so we ended up having to add an extension on to the end of it but it’s still extremely cute!
5.0,"Much thinner than I expected, that’s the only draw back. Was hoping for a warmer winter outfit but it’s so cute and great for layering so I’m keeping it. Sizing was great ordered for my 21 month old there’s room to grow which I also like since winters where I live are long."
5.0,"Awesome hoodie for my husband, but its thin."
5.0,i like that they are adjustable and the sole is sturdy for good support.
5.0,This was great
5.0,"A perfect fit that goes with everything,  day or night! They are a ""stand out"" without being obvious!"
5.0,"Just what I expected. My goof, bought size too large but still feel good. Will buy again, good price, good quality, & fit."
5.0,This is absolutely beautiful. I have a couple of these and have used them on necklaces for myself and my granddaughters. This particular one is mine. I love the design and color of this charm. The blue stones are beautiful and the silver is the perfect contrast. I will enjoy this charm for years to come. Very pleased with this purchase.
5.0,"This dress is super flattering and it looks expensive. But it is a little too large on me, I could have sized down. It’s a beautiful loose fitting draped dress, but it needed to look a bit more tailored, that’s why I would have preferred to size down. I wore this dress to a broadway show, it was a stunner."
5.0,"I have been looking for this style of hat for a while. When I first got it, I put it on, and the fit was perfect."
5.0,"Soft, cozy and fit accurately. Affordable"
5.0,"I typically wear a medium and this in medium fits but its not drapey and baggy like on the model. So if you like the look of the pic order a size up.<br /><br />It is super cozy and warm and the soft fuzzy fleece is also on the INSIDE which is simply awesome. So many of these types of tops are only soft on the outside and then icky where they actually touch your skin. Not this shirt, its like wearing a fluffy cloud hug."
5.0,"Does run a little small as previous reviewers had suggested.  I ordered an XL to account for the size difference. I usually wear a large. It was still a little small.  But I love it.  The fabric is really lovely, the colors are bright and exciting, and don't come off when washed.  I hang my clothes on a line to dry so I can't speak to what would happen in the dryer.  It felt great when I was practicing.  It's nice and long so it didn't ride up when I was in poses.  The neckline is a nice low V and very flattering to my shape.  My husband said it looked great on me!"
5.0,"I love My Fun Colors and am so glad Amazon sells them.  I have these bracelets in many colors.  They are very light weight and good for travel, as you can mix them to match any colors you are wearing.  I receive more compliments on these bracelets  than I do on any of my expensive jewelry.  They are fun and a great product."
5.0,This blouse us very flattering and looks great even on a heavier person. It's very comfortable and warm. It has great stretch in all the places that it's needed without looking tight and unattractive. The blouse is made of a soft and comfy cotton blend that is breathable and moves with you. It's not restricting at all. It is true to size and normal size can be bought. It's machine washable and doesn't shrink in the dryer. Great price too !
5.0,"I received so many compliments when I wore this dress.  The material was different than I expected, but it was comfortable and looked great.  I did have to steam out wrinkles before I wore it."
5.0,Beautiful!Beautiful
5.0,Love it. True to size.
5.0,This dress lives up to the hype. I'm glad I followed suggestions to get a size up. I'm usually a 6 and the 8 fit perfectly! I got a lot of compliments on the dress and the quality is amazing for the price. I now own two and contemplating buying a third.
5.0,"I must say that i ended up buying more of this cardigan in other lovely colors. I was looking for a cardigan that i could wear over floral dresses and tank tops to give me a smart/business casual look. When searching, i was skeptical about getting a thick cardigan because i wanted one i could wear in all seasons. Not only is this cardigan light and soft, but it is also breathable.<br />The fit is also smart and true to manufacturer's size chart and the sleeve length is just nice. I am a US size 10/12 with ample bust, so I got a large and it fit well.<br />The colors were also as described, and they look just like the pictures.<br />I'm not sure if this cardigan will shrink or slack after washing but I'll come back with an update on this.<br />You can trust this review to be unbiased and as honest as can be, despite the fact that i received this product at a discount."
5.0,bought this for my son and it fits perfectly for rainy days in hawaii he can wear it and we are out in the rain having fun going to the stores.<br />it is not too long where it prevents my child from running
5.0,"Love the hat, fit is great not to bulky cool look!"
5.0,"It fit like a glove! Incredibly quality material, and very finely packaged. Exceeded my expectations. I'll definitely be ordering more in the future. I was hesitant about buying a suit through the web, but I'm very pleasantly surprised with how well this turned out."
5.0,No list wallet with my AirTag now!!
5.0,Perfect  size 3X for pants size 38-38
5.0,"Wow, pleasantly surprised with this dress considering it was very inexpensive. I ordered the XL and it is a very roomy XL! Soft material and very well stitched! Will look great with leggings and/or hose.<br />Thank You!"
5.0,I have one of each color relly eye catchers
5.0,"Originally when opening the package and viewing these earrings I was not happy, they looked nothing like the picture or what I expected but once trying them on I love them. They look amazing with just the right touch. I'm very satisfied."
5.0,It is an excellent choice. Good quality not very cheaply. It took a week to get home. It is soft cotton. If you like these kind of 1950’s dresses go for it you won’t be disappointed. You have the choice to wear it with or without a petticoat depends on your mood. It’s not very easy to find these kind of dresses. I have bought bad dresses but this one deserves a thumbs up...<br />It is super confortable . I use it for church and people believe it is super cute ..
5.0,"I love this! It takes a simple concept of rubber banding your credit cards together in your purse, and dresses it up a little I like that four different color bands are included. I hardly ever use cash anymore so I really don't need the weight and bulk of a wallet in my purse."
5.0,"Love it, fit my 2 year old perfect .. so cute!!"
5.0,This dress is comfortable and light and has a wonderful loose hang. It has pockets too!!
5.0,Will definitely be buying these when I need more!<br />I wear size 13 jeans and bought these in large and they fit perfect and they're so comfy
5.0,"Soft and comfy, my sons go to when he gets to pick out which pjs to wear"
5.0,Looks so much like my dog.  Black & White is hard to find.  Just wish it was secured a little differently.  It has already come loose once but I like it.
5.0,"Don't freak out when you open the package. Try it on! It's lovely, flattering,  and fun."
5.0,"I ordered this hair comb to add a little sparkle to my hair for the Marine Corps Ball. I was specifically looking for something that was not too big (I have a lot of hair but I also planned on wearing jewelry, so I did not want to look to blingy) and something that looked classy- sometimes the color of the metal or the rhinestones can look very cheap or crafty. I also wanted to stay away from something floral, as that can look a little juvenile and its also very common for hair combs.<br /><br />I found this comb which was the right size, about a couple inches across, which added just the right amount of drama. I also really like the pattern, this comb has a vintage quality about it. The comb itself looks high quality in person, that is the metal is very crisp and not too yellow etc. and the gems look very crisp and sparkly as well. I was able to find earrings that matched the same style. I am really happy with the purchase. I will also note the comb shipped out quickly.<br /><br />If you are looking for something classy and beautiful for your hair, I recommend this comb!"
5.0,They're so cute and the soles are great for nonslip
5.0,love it  holds a lot of my<br />stuff  which is a lot
5.0,"LOVE!!! ♥️♥️♥️ FINALLY found a dress in this pattern that is my size, been searching for this dress for awhile now, and unfortunately other brands don't make a size above 10 and even then a size 10 to them is considered xxl...... Really??? Love the material it's a silky stretchable material thats breathable which will be super comfortable for the outdoor wedding I'll be attending. It's not too tight and it's not too loose it's just perfect I'm 5'11&#34; and about 215 it almost touches the ground and to me it's the perfect length. I ordered the xxl just to be on the safe side best clothing purchase so far. 💙💙💙"
5.0,Perfect for my childs 1 year photos! My only complaint would be that the tool isn't as full as I would have liked it to be. Makes it hard to actually see but still very very cute.
5.0,Fits well and so adorable.
5.0,This dress was such a great deal. I am 5’7 and 150lbs. I purchased a Med and usually wear a size 6. My bust is a 36D and I loved not having to wear a bra with this dress because the material is thick and supportive! The only difficulty this dress has is the buttons at the nape of the neck. They were a little hard but with someone’s help you’ll be fine!
5.0,True to size. Sandel is extremely comfortable for wearing all day and standing on your feet for hours. Great support!
5.0,it looked adorable on my grand daughter for Easter and she can wear to to school. It is prettier in person!
5.0,Loved it 😊
5.0,I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she is very pleased with this scarf. The color and quality are excellent.
5.0,"Colors are nice, the fit is as expected and the price point is good."
5.0,My picky kid loves these shoes. Will be buying more of these in the future.
5.0,"Beautiful, better in person."
5.0,"These goggles are awesome. They also come with ear plugs and a nose plug which is great. There is no leakage when I go underwater and they don’t fog up like other goggles do.  I purchased the blue color goggles and the appearance is very nice.  The suction on the goggles are better than any other.  I only used them in a pool but I will definitely go snorkeling with these as well. If you are looking for goggle that don’t leak or fog, these are the goggles for you."
5.0,Absolutely love it I'm going to order more in different sizes
5.0,"Great quality, just as pictured!"
5.0,Very nice quality. Soft and would wrap comfortably around any size shoulders.
5.0,Super cute...
5.0,Very good quality and service!!!!
5.0,"Just an all around great hi-vis hat. Just keep in mind 100% polyester, so it might not be acceptable for certain work environments."
5.0,"Love it! Well made, really light but looks expensive and heavy. Arrived a couple weeks sooner than expected, overall very happy!"
5.0,"So easy to use this color purse,  goes with everything, and lightweight as leather to heavy for me.  Magnetic closure is great.  Stylish."
5.0,Same  as the other space shirt granddaughter loves it wore it for reading month at school the theme was space
5.0,I love this top! It’s comfy and adorable. It’s soft and fits great. I ordered based on the side chart and it fits well. The buttons on the shoulder are a nice touch and also POCKETS! I haven’t washed it yet but it seems to be of good quality so I feel as if it will wash well.
5.0,"Very comfortable, well made. Dry quickly. Will be ordering more."
5.0,"Love it! Well made, durable and stylish. I might buy one in another color."
5.0,These sweatshirts are very well made with great materials. I bought two of them and they wear them all the time. All their friends keep asking them where they got them.
5.0,"I mean Socks...<br /><br />I'm very pleased with these Wulf Wear socks.  I am a size 11 mens and these fit great.<br />Padded on the bottom, soft, and comfortable.<br />Great design and I like the wolf head logo.  Great socks that feel good on and are well made.<br />All you'd want a sock to be."
5.0,Just got these and wow!  They are perfect. The material is stretchy and soooo comfortable. I love the pocket for my phone as well. Will certainly be buying a few more pairs!
5.0,"While it doesn't work with the outfit I hoped it would, I have other things it will go well with."
5.0,Loved them so much I went back and bought them in pink--and those are equally as cute!!
5.0,Great combination. Especially love the long sleeve shirt.
5.0,Just as she wanted a shirt worn by Roseanne. Delivery was fast also.
5.0,I got so many compliments when I wore these earrings!! Love them light weight and great quality!!!
5.0,"Did a photo shoot with it, looks great"
5.0,"So cute and feminine. Lightweight, if you want something that is more like sweatshirt material."
5.0,No problem with these. Work just fine my brother even stole a pair.
5.0,Great product! My kids love it! Fast delivery!
5.0,Fits good. It definitely stretches! The color is just like the picture. I believe I got a medium and I have a 36 DD bra size. I would have sized up if I ordered it again. It’s a good staple piece and not see through.
5.0,They are adorable !! Will but again!
5.0,My wife ordered a small based on other reviews. It fits her 5'4&#34; 127 lbs frame perfectly. It is a nice material and can be causal or dressed up. She likes it so much she wants to order other colors. Good buy!
5.0,Great price and product.  The Baseball and Tball kids all wear these and they are $12 when you buy them at the games.  You wont be disappointed
5.0,"Excellent quality knit shorts that are super comfortable, look great and fit well!  Fabric is just the right thickness.  We need them in white and tropical colors!<br />Definitely want more after getting my first pair."
5.0,"I wear a size 8-10 in women’s and I’m 5’7’’ I got a size m. I was super scared they weren’t going to fit but, they fit like a glove!!!! So comfortable and sit right on my hips where I wanted them too. They cover my heal (I though they might be high waters) which being 5’7’’ I do not get a lot. I definitely recommend these pants and will be buying more myself!"
5.0,"I keep all my unused gift cards for various stores in this. I can get a couple of cards per &#34;window&#34; in it, so it's more than the number of slots that are directly quoted by the manufacturer. I love that it keeps the gift cards together but also separate from my credit card. The see-through nature of the material is also helpful."
5.0,Love themSo soft and cute
5.0,Bought this as a birthday gift for my husband whom wears pin on a vest at work. He LOVED it. He gets so many compliments from employees and customers all the time. Everyone loves it!
5.0,Love these jeans! I would buy every color if available. Made with light weight material which is good for most seasons in Ga.  I'm not a fan of heavy jeans so it's perfect for my taste. On really cold days I wear leggings underneath.
5.0,my mother loves it and it is timeless
5.0,These are my husbands favorite underwear.  He has a very difficult time finding flyless underwear that are 100% cotton. These were perfect.
5.0,"Very cute and comfortable dress, that’s perfect for summer!"
5.0,Everything I wanted at an excellent price.
5.0,"I was looking for something different to hang my ocean-theme prints, I saw these & they are perfect.  Love the different use"
5.0,"Easy to use and accurate, the two things you need in a food thermometer.  Additional things that make this a five star thermometer are that it comes with its own battery (I HATE it when you get an item, then have to go buy batteries to make it work!) and the screen is easy to read because it's display is nice and big.<br /><br />It comes with other bells and whistles, like being able to switch between C and F but honestly, in all my years of cooking, Ive never had to do that so I don't really use that feature at all and a place to hang the thermometer from (another feature I don't use because mine is stored in a drawer).<br /><br />Overall, a great thermometer.  I received a sample for review."
5.0,"My daughter loves this leotard. She states that it's comfortable, easy to put on and doesn't ride up. She has a few of them in different fabrics and believes that this one fits the best. My little one is 4' 4"" tall and 83 lbs."
5.0,Provided much needed comfort for use after hysterectomy...secure but not too tight.
5.0,"Budget ghillie suit. Made of a inexpensive mesh for basic practical use. Overall, it's very impressive and the pictures can speak for my description. I would definitely buy at a price point of less than $40. DIY would take much longer to create something of this quality.<br /><br /> If I wanted a more professional ghillie suit, I'd expect to pay $80+.<br /><br /> Not for heavy use, I wouldn't expect the stitching / fabric to hold up to rough play in the woods, like paintball, etc."
5.0,"This is a present for family member who has a tattoo of the same design, it fits perfectly"
5.0,Really love these keys.
5.0,"Holds very well and the release clamp works very well-no struggle opening, loosening and/or removing belt."
5.0,I love this suit!!! I am 5 ft tall and won't say weight but I got a medium and it looks AWESOME!! First full piece!!
5.0,great watch for the money
5.0,Teenage daughter loves it. Great quality.
5.0,My son loves his Heelys.
5.0,My daughter loved this set
5.0,I have to say it's great. It got here in time for the major winter storm here on the East coast and I am going to use it today and this winter.
5.0,Yes yes yes a must have
5.0,"I am extremely pleased with the fit and style of this blazer.  I am 5’4, 170lbs size 12 pants, size L tops.  I ordered XL due to my large “girls” and it fits perfect.  The fabric is lightweight perfect for spring and summer.  Exciting!!"
5.0,Perfect  just a depicted collectable tin and all thank you seller
5.0,"It was to short for me and I am 5,3 if I hade boots to match it I would have kept it because it fit good and it's very sexy.  So I did return it"
5.0,Purchased the red leotard. Very sturdy and pretty color!!  It's holding up nicely and the color is still vibrant.
5.0,these are great  warm in the winter months and Soo soft too  highly recomend
5.0,"This wintry hat and mittens set is perfect for a toddler and well worth the price of $11.99. The mittens are waterproof and lined with soft, polar fleece, as is the hat. It seems to be of a good quality and has been very durable, thus far.<br /><br />Note: because this set is designed for very cold weather, it is double lined. Thus, the mittens aren't very flexible or bendable. A toddler would have difficulty making a snowball or snowman but would enjoy just being outside, playing in the snow. This would make a perfect birthday present and looks extremely cute on a toddler!"
5.0,I love these. They actually stay on my foot. I can wear my ballet flats or Tom's and they stay hidden and on. I will be buying more of these for sure. Quality is decent. They may not last as long as some but for the price you can't beat it.
5.0,"Fits great,  just what I needed."
5.0,"I bought 2 of these skorts for my recent trip to Key West. I LOVED them, I brought all kinds of clothes with me and I just kept coming back to these. They are silky feeling and cool to wear for hot weather. I wore these on the beach, in the water, riding a scooter, and even dressed them up and walked around town in them. I got them in black and navy blue. And so universal with so many tops, even swim tops. These will definitely be something I’ll be wearing a lot come summer time in my area. Don’t hesitate BUY THEM!!!!"
5.0,"These fit as described. The material is more of a bathing suit material  (stretchy/shiny) than I expected. The straps are super thin so you can’t wear a bra. I used nipple covers bc without them, you could see the nipples pretty easily bc of the material. The white is not see through. Also, I am kinda tall (5’7”) and they were long enough for me compared to others where they are pulling or going up my crotch. Overall, I am happy and I think they are true to size."
5.0,Cute little Keychains for me and my bf. He likes his i think mine is cute... just like any other Keychain.
5.0,"Seen these glasses in a movie. Did some research and found these glasses on amazon.  Bought 2 pair more for the ""joke"" factor between my wife and myself.  Then I (we) put them on and the laughter turned into amazement to how well these work.  Suffering from 5 herniated disc in my back I never thought about the medical relief these glasses could provide.  They will take some getting use to and I suggest starting at 5 minutes and work up to long wear times. My wife abd I both got a little sick to our stomaches but that got better the more we eore them."
5.0,Super comfortable.
5.0,Too thin but to wear over another mask fixed the problem. It is nice for dress up.
5.0,"These are my favorite sports sunglasses and I have ordered many pairs over the last several years.the reason I have ordered many pairs is that I tend to lose them, and these come at a good price!"
5.0,I really loved it
5.0,Good sturdy slippers for 92 yr old fathet
5.0,"Unless you do mega physical work, it is perfect for getting your message across. It’s a thin chain so looks fragile. But it’s been on my wrist day and night the past month with no problem. I also show it to others so they are informed about my wishes."
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress, it’s perfect!! It fits so well, I love the material. It’s a lot better that I ever expected! 10/10 would buy again.  I am definitely thinking about buying another pattern/color as well."
5.0,A birthday present for my 2 year old grandson who loves paw patrol. He loved them. Helped him run faster his daddy said!

5.0,Love this tunic. Drapes well and looks so pretty on.had lots of compliments.
5.0,It was a nice purchase but it was a little see though but I loved it & it looked amazing....

5.0,beautiful I love it
5.0,Nice looking shoes. My son feels as fast as a cheetah in them.
5.0,"This was one awesome fascinator! I wore it to my friend's bachelorette party and was able to tuck the netting into the bow, at one point, and it still looked awesome!"
5.0,worked great for winter formal
5.0,These are so soft. Love the colors and grip on the bottom of them
5.0,We needed a face shield for our 7 month old and this was the perfect size. Others are so large that all he wants to do is play with them and shove them in his mouth. This one was the best we purchased and di the job well. The only problem was that the snaps are weak and can easily be undone by our son.
5.0,"My grand-nephew loves wolves, and this is exactly like his fav hoodie. No matter who wears it in his teen howl pack, I'm certain it will be a unique and special gift to him."
5.0,"Great purse, good deal.  Thank you!"
5.0,These are adorable! So delicate!

5.0,Love this t-shirt!  I sized up because I like to tie my t-shirts on the side.  It’s comfy and feels like good quality.  Only washed it once so far and it didn’t shrink in the dryer.
5.0,I got size 4-6 years based off size chart recommendations. They fit perfectly over the new shin guards I got. Not too tight and go right under her knee cap. I love the pink and purple stripes. They match her shoes and shin guards.
5.0,This is a nice dress.  I bought a medium but could have gotten a small.  Very sexy without showing much.  U can see your nipples but i bought adhesive nipple covers and they did the job.  The dress has a slip relly thin matwrial bit very nice an cool for the summer in this Texas heat.  # LOVE THIS DRESS..
5.0,Love these; fit perfectly and the pocket fits my phone. Definitely a must buy.
5.0,As seen
5.0,"These have become my go-to night driving wear over my glasses.  They give a slight yellow hue to everything, but I am no longer blinded by high beams or truck lights in my eyes traveling either behind or opposite direction on the roadways."
5.0,"They are super cute and for the price, you cant go wrong!"
5.0,Fits my wife like a glove
5.0,My Grandson loved these shorts.  M
5.0,Me gusto todo
5.0,Super soft!! Fits great! I usually wear a med/large and the L/XL works perfect.
5.0,"Very cute, heavier than I expected, but looks really nice."
5.0,Pack it up and carry it on to stow under the seat in front of you and fly away.  Very pleased with this bag!
5.0,Cut top!
5.0,Good quality product that I have used during my last three golf outings.
5.0,Great for my pre-teen.
5.0,Perfect in every way.
5.0,Great bag for going to ballgames
5.0,"The animal foot print at the bottom are soft and at the top, it has a comfortable rubber grip to keep them from falling as you move around."
5.0,Using for groceries. Good value for price. Seem to be very durable and roomy. I am pleased with product.
5.0,exactly what I wanted!! Am very happy!
5.0,Just what I was looking for. A mesh cap to wear showing my pride in the USAF
5.0,"This is a really nice Apple Watch Band.  It has some bling on the each side.  I thought it was metal but its not really a metal band.  Its lightweight yet it is really durable.  I wear it cutting grass and all kind of chores, even shoveling river rock in flower beds.  It has not scratched yet nor has a rhinestone fell out.  I definitely will be ordering me another style in this brand.  And I have already purchased a previouis band before this one.  This band is really nice for the price.  And I like that it had extra clasp so I did not have to remove links to make it fit.  The extra 2 clasps to remove instead was a great idea."
5.0,"Great quality, I typed our info on a label maker.. That worked perfect.."
5.0,"Here's the thing. I knew it may not fit like in the pictures....and it did not. If your boobs are hard as a rock and dont move, then itll fit as described. However, a few nips with my scissors and I have a perfectly acceptable two-piece that does fit."
5.0,Awesome. My girls love having their mom close to their heart
5.0,These sunglasses are definitely a buy.  Having had eye surgery they are my best friend when going outside.  Would<br />definitely recommend them.
5.0,I enjoy this Kevlar neck protector. I use it both in the shop and work. I wear it mostly in my Security work and it makes me feel safer.

5.0,This is super cute! Great quality and I love it!
5.0,"Good value, fitys very well"
5.0,All I can say is this is THE BEST moneyclip/wallet that I have ever owned.
5.0,Perfect!  Looked great on dressy cotton knit top.
5.0,"I love it.  It was inexpensive, it arrived sooner than expected, yes it has natural leather odor ot it, but I expected that.  Incredibly dorable, I've put mine through the ringer, I do wish it had an easier way to open it like push snap or something.  The unbuckling the little belt-like closure gets old if you have to get in nd out of your purse a lot to retrieve your cell and such."
5.0,So cute and comfortable
5.0,"Fit just like my old Orthaheels did -- perfectly. Wish they had a less shiny version, but these provide excellent support."
5.0,Good to use if regular metal ear posts cause allergic reaction.
5.0,bIG SYNTHETIC STONE BUT VERY ATTRACTIVE.
5.0,Not an expert on ties but it worked for me and looked no different to me than a mens store bow tie
5.0,"Good quality product, my daughter loves them"
5.0,Love these. Had them engraved as a gift.
5.0,It just works
5.0,"I picked up this hat for festivals, Burning Man in particular. I got it early enough to take to the bowl for the Polo and Pan show, and it was a hit.<br /><br />I like that the special effect is not noticeable until you turn it on. It looks like a normal hat, but when the lights go down and you power it up, it’s hard not to notice.<br /><br />I’m not exactly sure as to the length of the battery but it lasted a couple hours at the concert.<br /><br />It isn’t the most comfortable had I’ve ever had, as the band is a little stiff due to the wiring I’m sure. However, it is okay, and not difficult to wear."
5.0,"I ordered this mask a few months ago.  When reordering, I was pleased to see that it is now available in a 3-pack and is also available in a choice of sizes as opposed to the original one size fits most.  An exceptional mask is now even better. Comfortable, filter pocket, reusable."
5.0,Espectacular
5.0,"The set of adhesive bras work good.  The bra stayed in place and did not move even when I began to perspire. When I took the bra off at night, the bra was still very stuck and it pulled and tugged at my skin a little bit. Held my girls in place!"
5.0,I love this shirt--it is very lightweight and comfortable.
5.0,Perfect fit . Great quality.  Very comfortable and pretty. Love it
5.0,Great price for this hoodie.  Super soft and good quality!!

5.0,Great gift! The picture came out so clear and it’s so cute!
5.0,"I bought this dress for a red dress event. I’m 5’2 and hits right above by knee. Even though, I’m plus size(16), I think a large would have given me more definition. I totally recommend this dress for any occasion."
5.0,Just what wife needed in our sunny climate.Thanks
5.0,LOVE these! They are so comfortable I hunted for them online after purchasing one in a discount store that only had one available. Favorite new bra!

5.0,Just as pictured and a great price
5.0,"First off the color is grey, even though it looks like a light violet in the picture. Super cute. I bought it to store my sprocket plus printer and it fits great. Has 2 big pockets and one very small pocket in the middle of the two. It brings straps and they are detachable."

5.0,my daughter-in-law loves this watch. she says she gets compliments every time she wears it!
5.0,"Sweater is very nice. True to size- soft, sleeves are a little long and I'm tall ( 5'9"") but not too long. I'd buy it again."
5.0,"Been wearing them every day since I got them. Good fit and very comfortable, not to mention very stylish."
5.0,Very nice. Very helpful for my husband dwelling in his legs
5.0,Great it was a give and she loved it.

5.0,The bracelet is so beautiful! It’s delicate and chic. Also received a beautiful free gift that made our day!
5.0,"Got these as a stocking stuffer for my husband. They are now his favorite socks. The socks are thin, so don't get these if you're looking for something heavier like wool or cotton."
5.0,Better quality then I thought they would be. I will order more.
5.0,"I ordered the teal one but I guess I didn't read the color and was expecting the lighter color that it appears to be in the picture but it's definitely teal, which is fine I like that color too. It's super cute, love the fit, I will order more in different colors"
5.0,"Great price, cool styles, and for was prefect on my Fenix 6X. Has a more “slippery” feel to it than other silicone bands I have, including the factory Garmin, but this isn’t really a negative."
5.0,"These look like they may be cheap, but they really are made well. Look just like the photo!"
5.0,Showed up quick and is very nice.
5.0,"thank you very much, highly recommend this seller, I am happy with the product I purchased with him. every woman has to buy with them"

5.0,Nice and comfy.
5.0,So dainty and perfect. Just what I was wanting.
5.0,"I initially purchased the blue LIGE the same model as the one recently purchased in the pictures above. My husband was so happy with the watch, the quality and craftsmanship of the watch, the fact that it came with a 2-year warranty, pictured above is a somewhat of a gold card with a number and on the back of it you fill out your name model number and date purchase and if you carry that card with you and something were to occur with any of the links that card guarantees replacement for up to 2 years. I purchased the silver LIGE watch pictured above for my son for his 21st birthday. I am extremely happy with the company's craftsmanship, quality, warranty, and accessories provided all contained in a very high class box. This watch is very economical, shopper savvy, yet looks like you've spent a million dollars on it. No one would ever be able to tell the watch cost under $100. I would highly suggest if you're looking for a high-end economical sporty yet classy watch that you invest in a LIGE.. YOU HAVE ACTUALLY NOTHING TO LOSE AND A WONDERFUL WATCH TO GAIN."
5.0,"This is a great dress for the price. It's roomy and comfortable, and it can easily be dressed up or down."
5.0,"Sapphire blue laces 48"" on black trail running shoes. Very reflective with my camera flash. Highly recommend!"
5.0,Perfect for Christmas stocking
5.0,"I love this lace dress. It’s comfortable and fits as expected. For sizing reference- I am 5’1 and 110 pounds. I ordered an XS and Small. The XS fit perfectly, the small was too large around the hips."
5.0,"This is such a fantastic shirt and the shipping was really fast too, came about 2 weeks before the estimated date"
5.0,True to size. Excellent fit. Very comfortable.
5.0,Loved the look and feel. This cover up complimented my bathing suit and covered up all my flaws. Win-Win.
5.0,My granddaughter loved the socks.  The colors and the animals were cute.
5.0,Vers Very nice . And for the price you can’t beat it . Bought 3 pair
5.0,This bracelet looks so awesome in person! My daughter loves it! It's very pretty and very comfortable to wear. The colors are bright and the octopus looks amazing! I received this bracelet at a discounted rate in exchange for a unbiased review of the product.
5.0,nice looking ring fit good
5.0,They're perfect. I get compliments on the color all the time. I wear a size 7 and always go a size up when ordering uggs because I know all of the fur inside will make it a tight fit. I got a size 8 and they're perfectly comfortable.
5.0,I love this watch. I’ve had it for a few weeks and it is as accurate as my phone. Still on the same minute.  It has a wonderful fit and feel. I love the classic look and the fact that it is space rated makes it extra cool. Adjusting the band was fairly straightforward even though the screws are really small.  This thing comes in a huge box and the case inside is really nice with lots of documentation.  I’ve always wanted this watch since I was a kid and saw the astronauts wearing them. I forgot about it until the 50th anniversary of the moon landing.  I’m so glad I bought this and you can’t go wrong with this watch.
5.0,Like it way it fits  wore it to see Hamilton#Birthday
5.0,Good producr
5.0,Love this suit as its comfortable and flattering.
5.0,Beautiful perfect gem size I was looking for
5.0,"Super cute black bra. Can’t go wrong with a simple neutral color. Love the ruching detail in the front. Great coverage. Purchased size small and fits perfectly. For reference, i am a small normally."
5.0,Love this watch. Look great on my wrist also it can wear with any outfit.
5.0,He loved them. Matched his shirt. He wears them everything he rides. He said it fit him perfectly and the vents etc were all in the right place. He couldn’t believe I found it because he’d been looking! Great gift!
5.0,Super cute! They look great on my Jean jacket.
5.0,I Love it.  It compliments my bebe handbag I just purchased well.  Thanks
5.0,I bought this product in lots of different colors! They fit well and are sooo comfortable!
5.0,Ordered this as a photo prop for my Disney party. Was a big success. Everyone wanted to try it on.
5.0,This exactly what I was looking for. Small and easy to put together for a day in the office. It has so many pockets and has room for everything you need. I've also fit a water bottle in the side pockets.
5.0,I got this pretty bracelet as a gift for my dear friend. It came BEFORE I expected it.
5.0,"I get a lot of compliments on these fun earrings, very tasteful and pretty."
5.0,It’s adorable it holds everything I need and I’ve traveled with it since I got it
5.0,"These are so useful on key chains - to make them quickly separated or extended.  Unlike most lobster clasps I've found in stores - these have a good size clip - easy to open.  Small convenience, but sometimes the little things make life easier!"
5.0,very nice quality. size is exact. might use the grommets to lace bullets to make a Lemmy belt
5.0,"These earrings are lovely and very well made, I’ve bought two pairs."
5.0,"This is such a fun tank top as it is so going to look great on the fourth of July, but it won't be just for fourth of July I can wear it all year long as well. I can wear it underneath over shirts/sweat shirts as well. It is really long so it is perfect with leggings but also can be scrunched up just perfect to wear with jean shorts and it is cute however I wear it. I am 5 foot 9 inches and weigh 150 lbs and I bought the Large and it works perfect with a little extra wiggle room because I like shirts bigger then most people do. It is made out of strong fabric that I believe will last through many different washes and this shirt will be great for many years to come."
5.0,Love it .. fut just right
5.0,Fits perfect for my holiday pics
5.0,Cute cover-up piece
5.0,I love how flattering it is. Exactly what I was looking for!
5.0,Got these for my nephew in green which is his favorite color and now he asks constantly if he can go in the pool just so he can wear his goggles.
5.0,"My 7 year old finds them comfortable, and he is very picky and fusses about most shoes."
5.0,For the price - these shoes are great for little boys!
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised to find the bikini fit me incredibly well. I am 5'9&#34;, 160 lbs. Measurements: 35-28.5-36 Both the top and bottom are mediums. The top is kind of push up (if I could've I might have order a Large top with medium bottoms) and the bottoms fit perfectly with not too much butt hanging out, however my butt is on the smaller side. I like the bottoms both zipped and unzipped and the straps on the top are adjustable. The zipper the front is a little sticky at times. I'm very pleased with my bikini. A lot of compliments!"
5.0,"I thought it'd cone up higher, but I still love it!"
5.0,They fit very well and are really warm.
5.0,Cute for holiday pictures!
5.0,"Another few of my favorite things to wear, can't wait to get them and start wearing them, thanks so much!"
5.0,I bought this bracelet bc it is beautiful! It is very  comfortable and the perfect width! I highly recommend this item!
5.0,This is the ultimate cute hat for young infants!  I have been a fan of bonnets from my days of watching 'Little House on the Prairie'.  The doily design framing the bonnet makes my little girl look all the more adorable & girly.
5.0,Love these lightweight glasses and the small but firm leather case is a bonus.
5.0,Very warm and cozy.
5.0,"These are a lovey navy capri legging that is so soft, I'm amazed!  This fabric is silky!  It washed well, and dried well in the dryer, without issues.  I would suggest line drying them to make the quality last longer.  They do have a nice tummy control panel and elastic that is thicker than some of my yoga leggings.  These do not have any pockets, that is a down side for me, but not worthy of losing a star.  I don't like that they sewed in a tag on the left thigh, it really bugged me so much I had to cut that out!  I am 5'4"" and these capris go to 4 inches above my ankle.  Lastly, the big draw for me is the fabric, It could possibly have me coming back for another pair in the future."
5.0,These pants are so soft and comfortable! But they are soooo long. Upside I can use double sided tape. They are so cute too!
5.0,Wonderful. So many Compliments.
5.0,The neck Gaiter would of been perfect if I'd gotten the one I ordered. My daughter loved the soft material but we ordered an anchor one as her brother is in the Coast Guard so was a huge bonus! Down fall we received a very childish looking Dinosaur one. She's soon to be 12 no way that was going to work so I returned and will be purchasing an anchor one.
5.0,Love that it fits my iPhone with extra battery pack. Also has quick access zipper on back to find my go to credit card easily. Searched all designer brands and none make a good cell cross body purse. Price is great and quality is great too!
5.0,Awesome socks that are a great fit! My son loves them and they’re perfect for football season!
5.0,Prefect gift for daughter 16yrs
5.0,Haven’t used it yet but it is larger and thicker than the one I purchased from Walmart for the same price. Plus a hanger and cell phone protector came with it.
5.0,I love it!!! it arrived earlier than expected and I get a lot of compliments on it! :) &#60;3
5.0,My daughter loved it. It’s fairly decent quality we’ll buy another I’m sure.
5.0,Love them!! Compliments about them all the time. Will buy more later on
5.0,"I liked the ear studs, but they are a little big for my taste. Earrings look exactly like the picture.<br />I just wish they had smaller ones of same kind."
5.0,love the jewelry my body is having no problems with rejection which it has had with other jewelry in the past. absolutely amazing quality for the price
5.0,Its not super form fitting but it is nicely fitted. Not upset at all.
5.0,"I have it filled and I love the way everything I need has fit in there nicely. The whole thing is well built. I kind of struggled over this purchase, but I'm glad I pulled the trigger. My reservations are born of my massive collection of little bags from mostly makeup promotions, but other stuff too. Those bags never work for a sturdy, clear, neat place to keep your things. You have to dump everything out or rifle around in the bag aimlessly, losing precious travel time.<br />So, while I haven't actually used this bag yet for travel, I am a person that has travelled quite a lot and I believe this Magictodoor travel case will work out great!"
5.0,Great price and comfortable to wear. I get lots of compliments. Takes a while to arrive but worth the wait. Recommend!
5.0,I ordered this dress last minute for a fall wedding. It fit great but I will say the material was thin. Not see through though! It is pretty low cut if you have a larger chest area might need to wear something under it or use a safety pin. The one I got came with a button and thread attached to the tag to sew on in the chest area and help cover it a little more. Overall great dress especially for the price!
5.0,My wife is very happy with the product
5.0,My husband loves them!!
5.0,"Very soft, well made. Capri length for a short person."
5.0,"This cap is a quality made cap and has several options as to how you can wear it its well mafe like ive come to expect of surplus of this type from german, Austrian and Swiss manufacturers alot of detail and very warm! i would recommend it. For sure!"
5.0,Exactly what i expected
5.0,They feel great! Are cotton so that is a plus.
5.0,I took a chance on these glasses after looking at Ray Ban which are the glasses I already own. I have to say the Anglers are wonderful. They block out all the UV light and they frames are very light. I am able to place them over my face mask and they stay put even if they are slightly off my face. Love them and thrilled about how much money I saved.
5.0,This is my second pair. I wore out the soles on the first pair. These crocs are super comfortable.
5.0,Love these! My legs are longer fatigued after a long shift. Highly recommend these to anyone that is on their feet a lot.
5.0,"Good quality. Fits well, and is very soft."
5.0,Flattering and cozy
5.0,I needed a dress that I would be able to easily breastfeed in - and looked good of course! I was pleasantly surprised with this one and wore it to a friend's wedding.
5.0,My daughter loves these shoes and so does everyone who sees them. So happy I bought these for her.
5.0,I love the look and feel. It shipped and arrived on time. I can't wait for my little to try it on.
5.0,Exactly what we expected!  Great value!
5.0,"GREAT anti-theft purse!!!  This purse was recommended by a friend who has one, and I purchased it for an upcoming trip to Europe. It is just the right size to carry everything, including my camera. It has 2 side pockets that can carry a water bottle and umbrella. I looked specifically for this purse with the anti-pickpocket zippers that have a latch under the magnetic flap. I wanted a purse that covered the zippers, and all other travel bags I shopped for did not have a flap.  It is lightweight, sheds water and has the cut-proof shoulder strap, that can be made long enough to wear diagonally.  It is the absolute safest purse that you can but. I highly recommend this purse."
5.0,This suit fits perfectly and is adorable on my 13 year-old. So far it has lasted through one beach vacation. Would buy more in other patterns if they had the same bodice design.
5.0,"No dislikes, Fits well very comfortable. No"
5.0,I absolutely love this dress. I got several compliments. Love the color. Love the flowiness. All around great dress. I would purchase again in a different color
5.0,I like the lightweight fabric and taffeta apron strings.
5.0,"I adore this blouse. It's flattering, and I can loosen the tie if I need to. The colors are gorgeous. It's hard to iron, though."
5.0,"Bought for my girlfriend for her birthday, shes been wearing it and said its super nice quality and comfy. Though it is that meshy imported material used for most all over print clothing. It's a bit on the nicer side. The shorts are 1000% nicer than the top, but both are really good in terms of quality. We'll see how it holds up in the wash or long use, but so far so good. Worth a buy if you're worried about price to quality ratio.<br />Id also size up one to two sizes possibly three if you're a little thicker. One should be good if you're just normal average, but if you're plus sized I'd recommend going higher as most Asian import clothing is usually sized down. If you're a small, get a medium if you're skinny. If you're large, get a three XL and you should be good."
5.0,Great style and looks great
5.0,❤
5.0,This is a beautiful garment.  The material is soft and the lace is exquisite.  Highly recommend.
5.0,Great well made pair of sunglasses. If you are like me and hard on sunglasses this is a good pair for work. Durable material. Fit is as advertised.
5.0,My daughter loves this outfit
5.0,Perfect fit!!
5.0,"I love this bracelet and the shine on the scarabs are great. I just wish you used a lobster claw clasp inside of a spring clasp closure and the scarabs should be a little deeper cut. Nevertheless, it's nice a bracelet for the price."
5.0,Perfect for any couple. The back of the quarter looks a little odd but it looks and feels amazing overall.
5.0,Was a nice size earing.
5.0,Fits perfect! Warm nice material! Will definitely be buying more of these in different colors!
5.0,The company was wonderful to work with. It is a great accessory and I love infinity symbols! I recommend it.
5.0,"Beautiful purse! Great quality! Perfect color -- I have been long looking for a brown and black purse that fit my needs - now I have it!  Nice and roomy- holds my iPad, wallet, phone, personals, small paperback and more!  Additionally, the crossbody strap provides security of not dropping my purse while trying to navigate among crowds etc.  I hope to find a slash proof crossbody strap for added security!  Would definitely recommend!  A very pleased customer!"
5.0,Beautiful and better than expected!
5.0,"Love love love this dress.  So comfy and exactly like pictured.  Good enough material, stretchable & not see through.  Just what I wanted.  So happy 😀"
5.0,"broke a buckle, bought new ones.<br />Done."
5.0,better than I expected. Great material. Looks expensive! very stylish and cute not sure if it helps with my migraines as I'm currently doing a few things both holistic and western to deal with that... but I do love the necklace and believe in it so it shall be. Enjoy and definitely buy thumbs 👍
5.0,Perfecto en talla. Divino.
5.0,Really helps work up a sweat and also retains the sweat in the suit.
5.0,Replaced my plastic fitbit wristbands with these. They're more comfortable and snug fitting without the buckle to leave marks on my wrist.
5.0,Very pleased with this! Son's Halloween costume as Fig the Fox was a success!
5.0,Very pleased with these sweat bands. Use them when I go long distance walking daily and they help keep the sweat out of my eyes. Well worth getting them!
5.0,"I absolutely love these earrings. They are so beautiful. The pictures are very true to the actual product. The product is made very well. Since I have extremely sensitive ears, it’s hard for me to find a good pair of earrings. These don’t give me any issues whatsoever. I like that the items have a warranty as well."
5.0,So warm and comfortable. I have broad shoulders so a lot of coats feel restrictive on me but I had plenty of room and ROM in this.
5.0,Sexy well fitting and good price for what u get
5.0,These were very cute
5.0,A kind of dream...
5.0,Nice product. Came quickly

5.0,I love Russell products and they are difficult to find in many stores (they push some cheaper brands). When I found them on Amazon I was thrilled.  Highly recommend this hooded sweatshirt.

5.0,Cute and very nice quality.
5.0,Awsome Love them
5.0,"Fit perfect, blue matched perfectly, thin enough it doesn't cover-up anything on license plates. Sturdy feeling as well."
5.0,Literally this completed my roaring twenties look for a themed formal party. I felt glamorous and Mr. Gatsby would be proud! I did need a friend to help me put it on but it is adjustable in the back and it's amazing. No complaints here!

5.0,This is the first corset I've purchased and I'm not disappointed. Nice quality and good fit. I wasn't sure how corset sizing works but I was able to figure it out thanks to the sizing chart and other reviews. It must run a bit small because it fits and I planned for the smaller make of it. Def worth the money!

I didn't realize that the ""reversible"" thing meant that the purple one flips from plum to lilac, and the yellow one flips from gold to ivory. Cute! Wearing the purple one (plum side out) right now!"

5.0,I liked the price and quality.
5.0,"Used it on a hike to the tallest pass in the world: Thorong La Pass, Nepal 5417 meters, and it worked like a charm.  Breaks the wind and protects you from cold"
5.0,"I got the tiny ones & they are the perfect size for me! I like the look of the ring tight to my nose, but am still getting used to the feel. Super cute though. Just need to make sure they don't ever fall out. I do have a feeling that they would be much too small for most people though. I really only wear the silver and occasionally the rose gold, because I'm blonde with blue eyes, but for the price, that's okay! :-)"
5.0,My daughter loves her new gloves and gives them 2 thumbs up!
5.0,It matched my shoes perfectly!!!

5.0,"I bought this hoodie for my granddaughter, and she loves it! I was afraid it would be too thin after reading a couple of the other reviews, but it is not thin at all, it is just right. She is very happy! Shipping did run late but only by a few days."
5.0,The hat is great! Fits well and looks good
5.0,"I actually LOVE the shoe, it’s just that my foot doesn’t look right in it. I believe certain styles look better or different people. I’m very sad that this shoe didn’t look the way I would have liked it to. The color and size is PERFECT. I normally wear a 7 and I purchased a 6.5 and it fit perfectly, not snug at all!!! Maybe with a little more heel I could pull it off! I will definitely purchase again from them just a different style."
5.0,So trendy & chic!
5.0,ITs super cute
5.0,Love this Jacket! It goes with everything and is a great fit!
5.0,I love these T-shirts. I have been wearing these for years.  Soft and a little stretchy for a great fit. Good quality.

5.0,I like the feel of it
5.0,Great long tail T-shirt!
5.0,I loved this. Wore it for a wedding and got a lot of compliments. Only thing that was a bother was the shoulder kept slipping down. Other than that it for as expected.
5.0,"I bought it for my son on his 10th birthday, he always nagged to have g shock watch, but they are so big for his thin small wrist, so I bought this one instead as we all wear g shock or baby g, he was so happy with it, the right size for him, and colors are not at all feminine.<br /><br />Price is reasonable and fast shipping from amazon.<br />Thumbs up."
5.0,"I love these they fit just right and are very comfortable , I would definitely recommend them"
5.0,"Really nice outfit, and it came promptly."
5.0,It did its job
5.0,[[VIDEOID:f444e35454948800ad24212f4149f3b7]] It fits but the pants needs to either be a inch or 2 bigger or stretcher.  I got a 2xl but if I bend down the pants slide down.  Sleeves on the shirt fits good. I have a stomach so it's tight on my stomach but I guess that's expected.  Its a comfortable outfit love the colors
5.0,Great fit.  Not to tight on legs.  Material doesn't rip and shred.  Good quality.
5.0,My son was born 7 lbs 2 oz with his head being on the small size. Every hat I had was way too big ordered these and they fit awesome. They do have stretch so hopefully these will be good for the upcoming winter months
5.0,I like this dress... it's beautiful. I am 5’1 petite ASIAN and this 👗 fits me perfectly. How i wish they have more options in terms of colors.
5.0,Love these so much I’m on my third pair. They last about a year with use most days if not everyday. Quality is great for the price and I literally get compliments every time I wear them (which can actually get kind of tiring if I wear these everyday).
5.0,Im size 34 c 5’4” 130. Size medium fits perfectly. It looks grrat with the matching pants.
5.0,"Clearly Charming is now my go to seller for these charms. The item is exactly what I wanted, was packaged correctly, received on time, and was received in a timely fashion. :)"
5.0,Light weight and easy to breathe out of!
5.0,"Love it, got tons of compliments!"
5.0,"This skirt is adorable. I think it would work beautifully for most people. However, I returned it because it would’ve needed to be altered to fit my shape. My torso is long so the darts for butt were up too high in me, causing unnatural puffs of fabric. This happens often for me, so I think my shape is non-standard, not the skirt. I returned it only because I didn’t want to put the effort into tailoring."
5.0,Delighted with it.
5.0,My daughter adores this.  I got a 5t and it fitls like all other 5t items.  It's long - to my daughters ankles - and fits her arms perfectly.  She's 34lbs and 39 inches tall.  It's nice and soft and washes really well.
5.0,"Great, fits like normal!"
5.0,I love this sweatshirt.  I have worn it many times and washed if often with no issues at all.  The fit is really great and the fabric is so comfortable.
5.0,"I paired this big beauty with a rainbow band.  I really love this ring- highly recommend!  Its very comfortable, and the way its cuts makes it extra vibrant."
5.0,Piece of crap I've bought multiple times and they are crappy titanium would hold up way better than what thin alloy garbage bang ti makes its made in china so its going to be chinaaaaa thumbs down for me and this brand of garbage
5.0,Cheap and awesome.
5.0,Love the colors!!!
5.0,"I bought these pajamas as a gift for my MIL. She said they're super comfortable and was able to lounge in them all day. The only drawback is that the pants are a little short. However, she is on the tall side (5'9""), so she's used to that and it didn't bother her at all."
5.0,Love!!!!!
5.0,Very comfortable and very soft slippers. They fit as expected. I wear a nine and bought the large they are perfect.
5.0,This dress is the cutest! I ordered an XL and should have bought a L. I still wore it. I’m a teacher and it was a big hit!
5.0,Very nice workout shorts
5.0,Great gloves! They are soft and warm. I bought another pair in brown.
5.0,This is my every day belt with jeans. I've worn them for years and they last a very long time. The buckle can be removed and put on other webbing if you want to change it up.

5.0,"Nice sunglasses, well worth it for the price! The pink ones are pretty cute! They fit my face well."
5.0,These were a big hit at my recent Princess Tea Party with ages 3-9. Yes believe it or not even the 8-9 year olds liked the activity. Lots of variety in the crowns and the stick-on jewels. Some jewels didn’t stick perfectly but it was still way more convenient and tidy than having the kids use glue. I thought it was a nice kit and not a bad value for the price.
5.0,"Sturdy, well constructed - looks more expensive."
5.0,"Came in a plastic container, which I didn’t expect, just was a really nice surprise. They are really light, which is exactly what I wanted."
5.0,I was behind the ball getting things together for my son’s birthday this year. Planning his hungry caterpillar birthday party was very last minute and I scrambled to get all his supplies. I was going to not even worry about getting him a themed shirt until I came across this on amazon. It’s so adorable and I appreciate that it’s available with prime 2 day shipping. The shirt arrived quickly! It’s made well and fits perfectly! I highly recommend the seller and will not hesitate to purchase again from them if I need to.
5.0,"Great jacket, you will need multiple layers underneath as this is only a shell."
5.0,Great cleats wide for my sons foot
5.0,Perfect summer shoes for the water and playing outdoors in!
5.0,I loved it! Beautiful colors!!
5.0,Speedy delivery.  And batteries work really good!
5.0,Shipping was fast and necklace was beautiful!
5.0,"I was looking for something simple, with enough tread to maintain grip on some wet rocks and mud, and these have held up great! Just what I was looking for."
5.0,Color is exactly as pictured.  I love this shirt.  Provides the need UPF protection and looks great.
5.0,I like that it’s durable. The only thing i need to worry about is the sides where the strap holds onto. Seems like they dont have anything to really latch onto
5.0,"I am 5'3 and 230lbs and this fits nicely!! I bought it in pink and it's very vibrant and soft af! And better quality than I had imagined. I bought a 3xl demon slayer hoodie and it's snug and the graphics are cheap looking, so I was expecting that from this but I am so happy this is so much better lol 😊 I will from this company again! Oh also it came early so that was nice!"
5.0,I love this bathing suit. Fits perfectly as I am 5’2” and weight 125 lbs. I ordered a medium and was able to adjust the straps for a perfect fit. I am very happy with this suit!
5.0,"Awesome Product. Rubber is very sticky, stays in place under heavy sweating. Much better than Oakley's standard rubber. Highly reccomend."
5.0,"Purchased this for our trip to Maui. Great structured bag, but does not stand up on its own when placed on a surface. Perfect size and traveled well in my checked suitcase without getting damaged."
5.0,"Estoy muy conforme con este padido, cumplió 100% con las espectativas."
5.0,"They're socks NOT shoes. I don't know of any socks that provide good arch support, nor socks you can't wear all day. Dopey questions."
5.0,it's nice and fit with my hand.
5.0,"I have looked for a comfortable sports bra for awhile.I l love this one..comfort,quality and a perfect fit.I just ordered another one !"
5.0,"Bag is reasonably priced. It looks very elegant. Has a very sturdy weight to it.  Will be using for a formal wedding next month. Appears to have space for cell, compact ,lipstick, license,  credit card, cash and a flat comb and car and house key but that is all I carry to a formal affair anyway.<br />Came in a nice box and bag that can be used for storage. My only complaint is it comes with a long detachable over shoulder chain. I will be going to purchase a short chain at a craft/hobby store  to also carry on my wrist.  However my favorite look is as a clutch.  Arrived on time. Very satisfied."
5.0,"Based on the reviews, I ordered a medium and it did NOT disappoint. This dress is stunning. I’m short (4’11”), but top heavy (32H). The dress is a little snug on the top in a good way. The length hits me mid calf, but I don’t mind. A strappy pair of heels is all I need. I love this dress. The quality is excellent. I plan on wearing it many more times."
5.0,"When your hands need healing with lotion or salve or someone's face or other areas need protection from infection when skin is itching or bothering in some way, these gloves are the perfect choice.  Thank you."
5.0,i wore it to church and everyone wanted one
5.0,Dress fit perfect and true to size. I'm short so it was just above the knee for me. Would of liked it shorter though.
5.0,See every thing through rose color
5.0,The tie does NOT look the price. It’s BEAUTIFUL
5.0,Omg i had doubted it was gonna be good but its a thicker material not cheap at all sooooo perfect and its long so it hides my legs and its super flattering..
5.0,Very comfortable and cute.  Love the pockets!
5.0,"I was really pleased with this apron. It's made of good, sturdy cloth and the sewing was excellent."
5.0,"Fit well, and very soft"
5.0,"I love my Birkenstock! I need orthodics so for sandals,  these are my best alternatives!!"
5.0,Exactly as shown!! My daughter loved it!!
5.0,Good size for taking to a sporting event or concert. The pocket is perfect for your phone.
5.0,"I first bought a pair of Otomix back in 2015 when I saw how good they looked on a lady at my gym. Fast forward to 2022, I decided to purchase another pair. I’ve lifted pretty consistently 3-6x a week since 2013. So these shoes were kept in rotation for 7 years. I took good care of them, and they took care of me."
5.0,"The fit is great, the feel is wonderful,very comfortable to wear,good stitching. Washed well!"
5.0,Fantastic<br />Fit well<br />Came in on time
5.0,I love this night shirt. My second one. I love the fabric. Very comfortable to sleep in. I wore out the first one after about 4 years. Very durable.
5.0,"I bought this to use for rabbit hunting in Ohio. The blaze orange was a extra added safety bonus and it kept my face & ears warm, I plan on buying more."
5.0,It was everything I expected
5.0,"I love these pants and have several different colors and patterns. They’re wonderful for summer-so light and breezy you stay very comfortable, even in the humidity and heat of Southern Louisana. The cut is flattering, and I feel good about the company’s fair labor practices."
5.0,"These are perfect I ordered the 3 different sizes, which I recommend because they are very short the 10 doesn't seem like 10. So just to make sure $10 is not bad to be accurate on the size you need and or have extra on hand"
5.0,Need to get one size up
5.0,I have been forced to wear the same shoes for years because it was so hard to find a pair that fit without pain. This multidirectional shoe stretcher has opened up a new set of possibilities for me.
5.0,Love this bag! I’m ordering a second one in brown. Plenty of room and very sturdy. Definitely recommend.
5.0,I was worried these earrings would be flimsier and/or less colorful in reality than the pics/photos/advertisements — but the reality was better than my expectation and my fears were definitely unfounded. Very good quality and great coloring.
5.0,I bought these laces to replace fraying laces on my twisted X driving boots. They are a great product. They stay tied tight better than the original laces. I recommend them to anyone needing replacement laces.
5.0,Matched the dress perfectly
5.0,They worked exactly like supposed to. I had a heavy set of solitaire earrings and the magic backs lifted them right up on my lobe.
5.0,"I haven’t exposed this jacket to wet weather yet, but the fit is perfect. I love the pockets and hood. I’m sure it will hold up well in rainy conditions on the golf course next season."
5.0,"I was looking for a Murano style necklace that I could use with multiple tops.  This &#34;hit the mark&#34;, although i admit the black is predominant.  The blue seems to vary and coordinate with different shades of blue.  Don't know why, but it works."
5.0,I wear these for an hour before bed for watching TV or working on the computer and they seem to help me to sleep better. I wouldn't mind if they were a shade lighter but actually they aren't bad. As purchased they were bigger than the glasses I clipped them to and  dug into my nose somewhat. I had a pair of scissors  that I think are called EMT shears.  They worked great to trim these to not dig into my nose and not to hang so far below my glasses. I would buy them again if I needed to.
5.0,Fit perfectly and is very cute
5.0,My daughter loves it and wears it all the time.  The puffy sleeves are adorable.
5.0,Mi hija quedó encantada con este disfraz

5.0,I like them they are light for kids easy no falling from ears and soft material.
5.0,"Love the springback loop earrings. They are very comfortable, you forget that you're wearing them. The size is perfect for everyday wear or out on the town."
5.0,Super comfortable short! Fast shipping.
5.0,"My son has been wanting crocs for a long time but didn’t like the charms he’d seen, I found these and immediately knew he would flip! And he did! Great variety and lots to choose from"
5.0,Looks great and is the perfect length. I get lots of compliments on it.
5.0,"My husband has always worn Casio Digital watches like this one for yard work and other outdoor activities.  When his last one died, I was excited to find this one on Amazon for such a great price.  Usually the band dies and the watch is still running.  These are sturdy watches that just keeping on ticking!"
5.0,"I ordered this for my son's Halloween costume and it looked great! Very nice bow tie, and the shipping was super fast."
5.0,Amazing pants and fit great!
5.0,Super cute! I was afraid it might be a little too small as I tend to be between sizes depending on the maker (US dress size 14 to 18). I ordered the 2x and its perfect. The sleeves are just the right length and it hits just below the knee. Love it.
5.0,I love the texture of the material
5.0,"I'm Loving these Lisskolo Women's Bell Bottoms Stretch Flare Fringed Pants, which have a finished looking fringe at the bottoms that are very ""swingy"" when I walk, and that add a beautiful and unique accent to what would otherwise be just plain black pants with a bit of a flare at the bottom. The fringe is a separate material from the pants themselves, so it's not like they just frayed the edges like some other fringe pants I've seen. I really prefer these. These pants are made of a light elastic fabric, so you can just pull them up (no zippers, no ties no elastic band at top). These fit to my form well, and are very comfortable with no binding. I'd love to wear these everyday, but they are too unique to do so. I'll still be wearing them a lot tho!"
5.0,"Please ignore the bloody knee, only full length photo I had of this dress! It’s super comfy and versatile. I love it."
5.0,These are small but perfect for work etc.
5.0,"Great quality, fit & wash great!"
5.0,"How I love this poncho!  Let me count the ways:  It’s soft. It doesn’t look overly big on my thin frame. I’m tall at 5’9”, so I love that if doesn’t look look short on my frame  (it looks just like in the photo). It’s a vibrant, Rebellion orange. The gray rubber Rebellion logo on the back is a nice accent.  Looks great with black jeans and black boots and a white shirt.  I bought this amongst many of the other ponchos by Musterbrand and they’re all top notch. I hope they release even more of these types of ponchos because I know it will be high quality."
5.0,Son loved these socks
5.0,"These are quality modesty shorts! My daughter has two pairs and wears them daily with her school uniform and after school with dresses and skirts. They fit like boy shirt cut underwear, which she seems to prefer."
5.0,"This handbag was package very well and it is just what I ordered so worth it. It is a very beautiful handbag,lots of room like the videos say absolutely love it. Very satisfied with my purchase."
5.0,My daughter loves this! She's only 11 so we bought a small and it's huge on her but there isn't a child's size.
5.0,"So cute,"
5.0,"Very pleased with my purchase, the hat is very cool and is not the same kind of hat everyone else is sporting I couldn't be happier."
5.0,"Great belt. Has just a little stretch to it which is nice, but I could have probably ordered a size down."
5.0,Giftee loved it - great 75th gift
5.0,Absolutely love these glasses. I seen them and didn’t want to spend so much money. After a month of debating on ordering them I decided to and I get so many compliments.
5.0,It's super cute and looks exactly like the pic!
5.0,"I have always loved lockets since my mom gave me her gold locket when I was about 9, which I promptly lost. This is a lovely locket. Dainty.  Will, I am sure will attract some compliments over time. Nice piece. Beaded chain is nice as well, a fine bead, adds to the effect. Nice gift."
5.0,I like as I expected  beautiful  size
5.0,"Really pretty earrings, very sturdy. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and how nice they shine in the light. I've recieved many compliments on them. Would definitely recommend."
5.0,It can use for both excerise and going out.
5.0,"True to size, fit well. Very high-waisted, higher than my belly button. Material is strong, but not stiff. Still in great condition after several washes."
5.0,This shirt fits great. I will buy again.
5.0,These are awesome. If you have really long hair I wouldn’t recommend. I have shoulder length hair and it’s perfect. I wear them to work everyday. Make a boring uniform pop with color.
5.0,"Nike dri-fit is my go-to sock; no contest.<br /><br />the good:<br />-breathable<br />-moisture wicking<br />-comfortable without being bulky<br /><br />the bad:<br />...none to speak of, really...except availability :)"
5.0,This is awesome. True to length with a handy travel bag. So excited to use it.
5.0,Fits well and comfortable for my son
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for. They're a bit big, but they keep my hands much warmer than the gloves I had previously!"
5.0,"A little big, but that's ok.  Means she'll be able to wear it longer.  Great purchase!!"
5.0,my nephew liked it a lot
5.0,I tried so many different brands- from super cheap $10-20 pairs all the way up to Vuarnet’s that were $350+ and these have the best fit by far. A bit tough to see out if all the time bc if standard blu blocker lenses but style wise they’re perfect. For context I’m a male with a medium/large face but I think these would look great on near anyone. Not too wide/ not to narrow.
5.0,"This was my birthday present to my darling husband. He only has one pair of sunglasses so I figured another one won't be so bad. These are really nice-looking. The frame is solid, sturdy and has a great fit on him. He wore them as soon I gave them to him. The case it comes with is also very nice and stylish. Thanks for the fast shipping!"
5.0,"I bought this necklace to go along with my daughter's gorgeous prom dress.  It paired perfectly!  Absolutely stunning piece of jewelry.  Very heavy metal, good quality.  Sits perfect, she didn't have to constantly adjust it throughout the night.  And soooooo many compliments.  Would definitely purchase from this seller again."
5.0,I am so happy that I found this seller here on Amazon. They are a perfect compliment to my jewelry that I am making. I will be ordering more
5.0,Very happy with product. Just what I was looking for.
5.0,"i love this set so much. i had my doubts but it came just as it was shown and really complimented my body. i suggest you look at the measurements before ordering but either way, it's beautiful. i love it."
5.0,Came nicely packaged and felt very soft at first touch. No odd smells and washed easily. I let it hang dry. Fit my daughter very well and looked beautiful on. Very satisfied with this purchase. Will be purchasing again.
5.0,Very nicly made you cant tell they are compression socks got 3 pairs.
5.0,I love the multi-colors on the inside but it had a funny smell when I first got it had funky smell so I just opened it up and put it on a shelf in my garage for a couple of days.  The smell was gone and now I can use the adorable wallet.  The cost was minimal so when I tire of it in three weeks (like I do all my purses and wallets) I won't feel so bad that it will go to my wallet graveyard in my closet.  Adorable and well worth the money.
5.0,I’m so happy with the Scream dress. It is way better than I expected. Yay!
5.0,It’s comfortable to be in and has the right amount of stretch.
5.0,even prettier in person.  the picture looks yellowish green and they are greener than the little crystal on top.  i like them better that way.
5.0,Dress is comfortable and fit perfectly.
5.0,I bough this for wife. She dresses tom boyish and she loves it! It’s perfect for her size of wrists which are small so I would say it would be smaller on a larger wrist.
5.0,I have showered with it / washed dishes etc and it has never turned my finger green or rust. Such good quality for cheap!
5.0,I literally have a whole new wardrobe
5.0,Received my beautiful necklace just in time to charge for the Harvest Moon Thanks so much
5.0,A fun dress for lunch with friends or dashing about doing errands. Drapes nicely.
5.0,Just a very GREAT ring!! So pleased to share my AGGIE spirit!! GIG'EM . Great value and fits perfectly!! Greg 🖒🇺🇸
5.0,Absolutley LOVE this dress!!!! Amazing fit and feel😊❤️ Definitely reccomend👌
5.0,"I love this dress!!! I ordered it in black, it  arrived early and it is beautiful.  The fabric is very nice for the price and it holds you in.  I normally wear a US 12-14, so I ordered a XXL and it fits very comfortable on me.  I'm only 5'5&#34; so the length is long and perfect...  My only complaint is the bra pad inserts, but they never work for me in anything, so I just have to reposition them or remove them all together...."
5.0,Very Comfy great soft material
5.0,This is a very cute suit.The fit is good and it’s well made.
5.0,fit was perfect well made
5.0,"Love these sandals! Comfortable long wear! These would go along with a nice maxi dress or any kind of outfit. Also to note, that the sandals can be hard to put on."
5.0,My teenage daughter got these for her & her bf for Christmas. They love them.
5.0,The material is soft and of good quality.  The fabric also washes well in the machine. Very nice casual dress to wear to the supermarket and to do errands.
5.0,I love these boots looks just like photo was not expecting that but they are nice
5.0,Socks are comfortable
5.0,These are cute and comfortable! This pair was a bit too small but I ordered a larger pair and they were perfect! The elastic band is strong so be weary of that when ordering!
5.0,Beautiful and exactly what I was looking for. Looking forward to doing more business with this seller on more pieces.
5.0,Awesome great fit
5.0,Súper lindo
5.0,Comfortable to wear
5.0,"Smooth transaction,love it."
5.0,Nice charm.
5.0,This dress is very comfortable and looks/feel great.  Highly recommend it.
5.0,I get so many compliments! My favorite jeans!
5.0,"My wife loved this item!  it gets a little tangled so you have to work a bit to get it to lay right, but over all it looks amazing."
5.0,happy with item
5.0,"Perfect at the waist not long most shirts or sweaters I buy through Amazon are either too big or too long. This fits perfect, super soft and seems to be made great."
5.0,"Looks great! Material is on the cheaper side but it doesn't look that way. Also, it's $10 so I can't really complain. Will for sure buy other styles ."
5.0,Looked great but I ordered the wrong size.
5.0,They were all the correct size and seem to be quality material. I've been using these pairs for the last few months and have no complaints!
5.0,"Information: Gauging does take a lot of time but people are supposed to wait 2 weeks between sizing up to let your ears adjust and heal properly. Although, every person it different and that time can be a bit longer. The sizes provided are 1.6mm (14g) as that is about the size of a regular ear piercing. The sizes then get bigger: 2mm (12g), 2.4mm (10g), 3.2mm (8g), 4mm (6g), 5mm (4g), 6mm (2g), 8mm (0g), 10mm (00g), and 12mm. I’m each baggie, there are 2 tapers and 2 plugs. Silicone tunnels start at 3.2mm (8g) although I haven’t used them yet.<br /><br />Glow in the dark: They do glow in the dark but you do have to charge them in the light which means that most of the time, they will not glow.<br /><br />DO NOT SLEEP WITH TAPERS IN. Some of the tapers are sharp and long due to needing the length to fully size up from 1 gauge to another. Sleeping with them in can lead to a possibility of them breaking. I do not recommend it.<br /><br />Opinions: These are wonderful tapers and plugs. I’ve had them for a while now and am at 5mm. Which is just about half of the sidings provided in the set. If you are staying at a single size for more than 2 weeks, I do suggest waiting until your ears are fully healed then after, adding the tunnels in. They are acrylic! Which is actually really comfortable and easy to use.<br /><br />Conclusion: I do recommend this specific set as they are comfortable and nice to use. Do not forget to purchase jojoba oil, coconut or something similar and skin age to help you relax the skin to use the tapers."
5.0,"This is really cute!  I like the yellow,  with the black zipper ~~ looks sharp.  It's also lightweight,  so I don't anticipate sweating in it,  like the plastic disposable raincoats.  I'd definitely recommend it!!"
5.0,Very cute and my granddaughter loved them
5.0,I bought these as Xmas gifts and the ppl loved it. Said it was very comfty and would definitely recommend or purchase again
5.0,"Super sexy, loved how they looked. Nice quality"
5.0,"I just ordered more! High quality leggings, not sheer at all. They are snug and suck in EVERYTHING, but NOT restrictive, too tight, or uncomfortable. Would highly recommend!"
5.0,Very nice. Prompt service. Thank you
5.0,Very nice looking hat but did not fit.
5.0,"I LOVE this dress.  I have ordered it in 3 different styles.  Granted, the hems are a mess (not the same length all the way around), however for the price, it is worth getting them hemmed to hang right.  I cut off the little tassels in front (they are just decorative - do not cinch the waist).  Traffic stoppers (at least in parking lots when you are trying to cross the street into the store).  :)"
5.0,Very comfortable shoe. All Skechers I have worn are very comfortable.
5.0,just as pictures and described so cute. love it
5.0,Like the way it looked on. Sliming & comfy
5.0,These came with a tester and a cute case! They work great!
5.0,"very soft, nice stretchy fabric. mid thigh length"
5.0,"It is absolutely beautiful, picture looks good but does it no justice. Must have for any NBC fan"
5.0,"These are very awesome! I hear that some people have trouble with the curvature and how the dragon headsets on their ear oh, I was a little nervous but mine seemed to have a great curve I got size 0 they look great and seem to be highly crafted. Very artistic"
5.0,"I didn't expect too much with the price but I was very pleasantly surprised with these. They do not look cheap at all, colors are good, and fairly easy to change out with a little patience."
5.0,"My husband has been wearing these slippers for almost a month. He loves them. He said it’s like walking on a mattress. A very good mattress, that is ;)<br /> A money well spent on my part."
5.0,My teenage daughter loves this bracelet!
5.0,"A little large but otherwise looks great. Showed it to a friend, she loved it and will be ordering one for herself. Only thing I don't like is the front flaps, so I tie and it works out better."
5.0,"Super cozy, stretchy, and cute crop"
5.0,nice material warm too
5.0,Great shirt all the way around
5.0,"Just the way it was described! The feel of the silk was so lustrous, the length and width, perfect. And the design with it's color combinations is gorgeous! Overall a good buy!!"
5.0,Love the way the rings fit and they can be worn at any time and they don't get damaged.
5.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVEEE! perfect for winter around the house!"
5.0,Love it...perfect fit
5.0,The velcro on the bands come unattached from the band
5.0,"I love this dress! It's ridiculously comfortable! I love the racer back and the POCKETS! I wish it were a touch longer. I'm 5'9"" and would have liked to wear wedges with it, but flats are fine too."
5.0,"So cute. Love this company. Second dress I've bought from them. Looked fantastic. Very long!!! I needed it hemmed up, but for price paid totally worth it."
5.0,I love this skirt however there is so much fabric that it was too bulky.
5.0,reasonably priced and perfect for this years Super Bowl
5.0,I bought these in a couple different colors. I received many compliments! True to size.
5.0,"I am very happy with these boot straps. They are very high quality and will probably last longer than me or my boots. If I had to do it all over again, I would buy them again. I love these boot straps. They are wonderful."
5.0,Loved the fit! I got a lot of compliments
5.0,"I worked as a commercial/industrial electrician. 3 days a week on a concrete floor at in a factory. Then 2-3 days a week outside at rock quarry’s and asphalt plants. I was tough on these boots to say the least and they held up.<br />Durability. After 2 years, the only thing that happened was one of the quick-wrap eye-holes spots for the laces broke. I just ran the lace through the hole and it was fixed.<br />I like to wear my boots loose, so the heel wore out of both of them quickly, but that was probably my fault.<br />Comfort was good, but I also always buy my own inserts.<br />Recently I had a tree fall on my  metal roof. I have been up and down the roof putting tarps on, taking pictures for insurance etc and most of it was in the rain. I had no issues with slipping. I mention this because I wore a different pair of boots up there once and couldn’t even make the initial climb. The pitch isn’t steep, but certainly not flat. Like I said, compared to my other boots, these Larnmerns are anti slip.<br />Great boot for the price. I will definitely buy another pair of these"
5.0,What's to dislike?
5.0,"This is a wonderful band! I love how it comes with all of the necessary tools to adjust the size, making it a breeze and a change that can be done within minutes! The band itself it's well constructed and looks great. I bought the Cognac version of the Moto 2 for $150 less than the Moto 2 Silver with a similar band to this one, and saved $150 and have the same style watch! This is truly a great product!"
5.0,"Exactly as pictured, very light weight and comfortable. A tad bit hard to read the time though through the scuffle cloud."
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress!! It fits as expected, I got the Khaki color and am obsessed but a few things to note. . .it shows everything! as in it hugs every curve shows every detail of your body so if you are insecure about anything it will show, but if you're like hell yeah, i worked hard for this body i want to show it off then this is the perfect dress for you :)<br /><br />As far as sizing, my body type is small waist (24 i think) but a very heavy bottom, I think my hips are 41 maybe and  36C/D cup and i ordered a small and it was perfect<br /><br />Also sweat stains will show only downfall."
5.0,I bought these for my son because they have hard wood floors at his daycare. He is not quite 2 and needs all the healp he can get keeping his balance. I wanted him to have good traction and his feet to stay warm. He loves them. He wants them on as soon as he gets there in the morning and leaves them on until he is picked up. He also has a lot less bumps and bruises because he is not falling as much.
5.0,I bought this dress for a work function and it was perfect. I was worried about the length but after I tried it on it came almost down to the top of my knees which was where I wanted it. It does flow when you walk so that was nice. The dress material is a little thick so it seems like the dress is heavy when you first put it on but overall I didn't mind it and didn't even notice after wearing it for a while. I will definitely be buying more dresses from them.
5.0,Product well made and comfortable to wear.
5.0,Great shirt I bought it for my boyfriend and he was very pleased with it!
5.0,Got what I wanted and expected for the price
5.0,"I'm 5'7&#34; 130 lb slender build and with this brand I can wear a small or medium.  The shirts I've bought have all been cotton and they do shrink, so I usually order a medium to allow for shrinkage and a loose fit.  For this shirt, the maroon color was only offered in a small so I bought it.  The shirt is snug but fits, and the sleeves are actually longer than most shirts, which I love.  Since this shirt is a small, I only hang dry because I don't want it to shrink.  Other than a longer drying process, I love this shirt and the color is as pictured."
5.0,Very nice product I am so happy now thanks😊👍
5.0,I feel like a celebrity in these glasses.
5.0,I gave this time stars because there is nothing wrong with them except one thing. They are made for a kid. They do not fit and adult.
5.0,I love that this jumpsuit has pockets! The length is just right and it’s perfect for fall just throw a cardigan on top. It does run a little big though I suggest creating an XS size.
5.0,Had to come up with an outfit for a black tie event. Went in search and wss not disappointed. Had many compliments.  Loved I didn't have to wear heels and had deep pokets to put everthing I needed.
5.0,It fits perfect and it is longer than most t-shirts. The material is so soft.
5.0,This was the greatest thing I got my wife who was looking for this
5.0,"Love them! So cute and fluffy. I was afraid they're going to be too small, but they fit perfectly (I'm US 7.5, woman) and could fit larger sizes as well."
5.0,I bought these gloves for my son-in-law.  He's a big deer hunter and these are made from deer hide so I thought he'd think that was cool.  But what he really likes about these gloves is that they are much more flexible than any work gloves he's ever had.  He feels like they will enable him to use his hands much more efficiently than with other work gloves.  And they were so reasonable in price.
5.0,Super soft and well made ! My daughter looks so cute in it !
5.0,"Looks just like the picture. The bright aqua color caught my eye and it holds up to its vibrancy. Fits me well and is quite comfortable to lounge around in. Feels flowy while also not being too much and is flattering for my figure. I bought as a house dress but I definitely would recommend wearing it as a beach dress too! The tassel comes separate in a bag and unknotted, you tie it around yourself so you can adjust the position and style as you like it. The headband it comes with is very cute, I've been wearing it for a few hours and feel no tightness around my head, and that's including while I'm wearing a headset. For the accessories you get with it along with the dress itself, I'd highly recommend it as I was pleased with the whole set."
5.0,"I bought this dress for prom my sophomore year and it was absolutely stunning! Everyone complimented on it and I felt like a princess. Being 5'3, it was super long so I had it hemmed but other than that, perfect fit and definitely worth the price."
5.0,I use these in my classroom for students who need less distracton and they work perfectly for that.
5.0,"These were too unique and inexpensive to pass up. They are very sparkly, and the cut of the baguettes paired with the curve of the disc setting make them very light catching. I received compliments the very first day I wore them because they really do have a nice look.<br />Again, these are not flat, they curve slightly so they are tilted a little up on the ear lobe. It's actually nice, because usually earrings tilt downward making my lobe look droopy or stretched. These don't do that, plus they arrive with an earring back that has the support plastic, which helps keep them pushed forward.<br />I chose the rose gold setting, and it's sturdy, no loose stones!<br />While these are very night out worthy when you want a little extra bling, they are gorgeous and I wear them to work often."
5.0,My son loves these. One of his favorites.
5.0,Got them as a gift for a coworker. She has hand/wrist pain quite frequently. No word yet on if it takes away the pain but either way it is a lovely bracelet.
5.0,Sturdy angle chain with detailed work and very beautiful!
5.0,It’s very soft. I’m glad I found this!
5.0,Amazing colors and good delivery
5.0,"Really works well as a phone case, good quality for the price"
5.0,great for many a small job
5.0,These were a stocking stuffer. She had never been to a Badger game before meeting me. Can't let her go without proper earrings.
5.0,Nice for baseball games
5.0,I love it!!!! It’s actually bigger than what I thought but I’m in love and recommend
5.0,"Very nice. I realize this is a men's bracelet, but I am a woman with small wrists & I like it layered with my other silver colored bracelets. It's a little bit heavier than my other bracelets, which is neither a positive or a negative. Just how it is. The bracelet came in a small pouch which I was gong to throw away, but my husband has decided to use it to store ear buds. One other point to mention is that the bracelet is very smooth & comfortable. It does not catch on my clothing and is very comfortable to wear."
5.0,Gorgeous skirt!
5.0,great product-fit well-great polarization-highly recommended.
5.0,I love it much so lovely!!!
5.0,Love them.. so comfortable!
5.0,Fits good has a longer back so butt crack stays out of view
5.0,Theses earring are just what I was looking for. They are delicate and minimalistic yet noticeable.  I love that they are  comfortable enough to wear overnight. Perfect!
5.0,Awesome goggles! Worked great in the Gulf. The snap release on the back of the band if very handy.
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful!!! Great quality, well made."
5.0,WELL MADE
5.0,"This stuff works great to make a too large hat fit.  The tape is sticky and won't mover once set, but allows for a bit of adjustment as you apply it. As it is under the head band, you aren't even aware it's there, except your hat fits!"
5.0,"This product is exactly what I'd hoped. What you see in the photos is what you will get in the mail. I expected this from the photos, but due to the shape notice that the sleeves will be a bit shorter fit. It's high quality and very warm! I love some of the detail work near the bottom. I will definitely order from them again!"
5.0,"Great Retro '50s Rockabilly dress, and at a great price!"
5.0,This key chain is high quality. I was delighted when I opened the package.
5.0,"This little night gown is so incredibly cute and comfy for my little girl! I did order a size up since she likes her pajama’s a bit loose, but that’s not a problem. Highly recommend!"
5.0,just like the picture.  No surprises and perfect fit
5.0,My husband is a 70 Chevelle guy! It's a good quality shirt which makes me happy & he gets to wear a Chevelle Win! Win!
5.0,"Really cute purse, it's small and useful. It has 2 pockets and 1 middle small one. You can fit an iPhone 6+ . It had a few threads hanging out but it's easy to cut. Cute and useful for its price."
5.0,So comfy and pretty and pockets. Love love love 💗
5.0,This pewter pendant is nice and well made. My friend will be so happy with it.<br />I will order one for myself. Thank you!
5.0,Nice fit and pretty
5.0,"So cute and light weight.  I have an allergy to nickel and had no problem after  a long day.  Also, got lots of compliments."
5.0,I love that this shirt is true to size.
5.0,"I love the way this sweater fits. The material is soft and smooth. I wore it straight from the package and it didn’t itch my skin at all nor did it have any fowl smell. I got a few compliments in this sweater. The color, the style, the quality……A1"
5.0,I purchased this for my hubby. He travels weekly and loves to listen to his music.  Being able to answer his phone and speak hands free was a major reason I decided to surprise him with it.  He loves it!
5.0,"Great value, easy set up"
5.0,exactly as pictured.  speedy delivery
5.0,Dress has nice prints and good fitting.one thing I don’t like is the not having sufficient lining inside. I can say it is transparent.<br />I know most of them will have the white and black slip under the dress but for this we have to wear the red only because to keep the prettiness of the dress.<br />Good dress for summer and very light.
5.0,Came quickly and super cute!
5.0,"The watch has a nice looking black dial with good design elements but because it is black the design etched into the dial is not readily seen until the dial is closely examined. Burberry is a well-known shop, especially in Britain, though not so well known in the US., but they are not watchmakers, any more than Calvin Klein or Christian Dior. I believe this watch is made by Fossil. This is not a collectable watch as its mechanism is battery-powered crystal quartz, but for everyday wear, it is quite nice. I've not owned it long enough to give any opinion on its reliability or accuracy, but generally quartz watches hold up quite well."
5.0,Great item I gets comments every time I wear them.
5.0,"Great dress for work, very comfortable fit"
5.0,I love this band! I usually wear my rubber one that came with the watch but it doesn’t fit with my outfits. This is simple and cute. It’s also very secure. Would definitely recommend!
5.0,Held me in place all day long! Super compfy.
5.0,great quality! Never thougth it was going to be so good for that price.
5.0,It's warm  and from a nice material.
5.0,I love this jumpsuit! It's just what I was looking for
5.0,"Love love love these!! My ear lobes are externalities sensitive for some reason, and these are perfect. They are super cute and comfortable!"
5.0,"This vegan leather water resistant cross body purse has an adjustable strap, gold accents, looks very stylish, I zipper pocket on back and 2 in front with tassels on the zipper. Measures 10.5"" across, 10"" tall and 2"" wide. Great value!"
5.0,"These were a big hit for my 12 year old son!  They are a tad too big, but he will grow into them.  They are well made."
5.0,Absolutely perfect! I receive compliments everytime I wear them!
5.0,Cover the whole face perfect!Keep save at the special time.
5.0,I am so tickled I have found a nightgown reasonably priced.  Cool and relaxing with soft feel and a little bit of sexy.  Thank  you Zexxxy :) for this nice product.
5.0,This crown was a gift for my grand daughter. She loved it.
5.0,"It's kind of a workout just to get this on, but once it is there it fits awesome."
5.0,I was searching for a black and pink scarf to wear with a new coat. The only one I found in the stores was a $438. cashmere. More than I paid for the coat! I decided to take my chances and ordered this one for way less money! I was pleasantly surprised. The scarf is soft and comfy. The colors are perfect for my new coat. The online description was accurate and I received my order as promised. You can’t lose with this one for price and quality!
5.0,"Love it, last time I ordered a twitch sweatshirt I got a large which is what I normally wear but it was too small. Got an xl this time and fits perfect"
5.0,"This bra/top is an amazing value for the price.  The material is not cheap and thin at all.  It is thick and smooth, and feels much more high quality than you would guess.  The fabric does not have a ton of stretch, so there is not much wiggle room in sizing.<br /><br />I got both a small and a medium (5'1"", 117, pear shaped with a small A cup bust).  The small feels almost too snug on my ribcage--very slightly constricting.  The medium is loose, however, with a couple inch gap at the bottom edge in the back.  So I use the small for working out, and the medium for fashion (no bulges or rolls).<br /><br />The style is very current.  I wish it was 1 inch longer; it is definitely more bra than top.  I also wish it came in some fun colors!  I would buy this in something like an emerald, turquoise, berry, fuschia, etc."
5.0,The unique Black color o the earring
5.0,Cute shirt for a good price.
5.0,These are the perfect size for work/
5.0,Purchased this for my wife. She is 5' 10&#34; and about 170 and these fit her perfectly. She loves this dress and wears it all the time. Great spring and summer dress. The material is nice and light and soft and the colors are vibrant!
5.0,This is the perfect beanie! It's cute and cozy but also doesn't mess up your hair if you want to pull it off once you're inside and starting to get warm. The poof is big and fluffy and also removable for packing so it doesn't get flattened out.
5.0,I loved this product. My son is very picky about his shoes. He's 16. This product is very satisfying. I recommend purchasing this product.
5.0,Wow these boots are so hot. Be careful you might get proposals that you might not care for. Lol Over all LOVE them.
5.0,I love them and they don't disappoint
5.0,Soft and comfortable. Ordered a medium for my daughter. She’s 5’6 and weighs about 135 pounds.
5.0,"This sunglasses case was a good fit for my wrap-around sunglasses. It seems pretty sturdy and I haven't managed to damage it yet. I also like the fact that it came with a cleaning cloth. Overall, I'm confident that it will protect my sunglasses from destruction. I am a clutz and haven't been too good to my glasses in the past."
5.0,Very soft and comfortable.  I bought these for working in. I'll order more if they wash well. I work with a toddler so I'm constantly washing my leggings.
5.0,Special thanks from my mom because my dad was snoring like a plane :))
5.0,"Fits great on my wife, now she is searching the web for more Hell Bunny clothes. I can tell the material is high quality and the designs are cute to boot."
5.0,"I got them for bodysurfing, however more for sun protection rather than to be able to see under water.<br />They stick very well to the face, with no leakage.  At high speed they may pop out, not a problem for me because they only need to protect my eyes when waiting the perfect wave"
5.0,"this is such a cute sweater.  Size was great for what I was looking for, not bulky at all and while the material could be a little softer for my taste it is super comfortable.  Glad I got it"
5.0,"Perfect for my daughter.  I bought one in pink and one in black and they are great, and such a great price!"
5.0,Really comfortable top. Ordered one size up (normally wear a medium) because I like a little extra space. Fits as expected!
5.0,"I am so in love with this sweater. I had one very similar that I bought maybe 8 years or so ago, and it was my go-to favorite, but eventually, it just got too worn & had to be tossed. :-( I've been looking for something exactly like that ever since, and believe me, it's hard to find! I know this is a &#34;dress&#34;, but for me, that means it wears like a tunic over leggings or jeans - which is perfect! The weight is comfortable - not too heavy & not too light. There's lots of stretch, too, but it's substantial enough that it doesn't seem too revealing. The knit is dense, so even where it's stretched, there's no noticeable thinning of the weave. I mean, this sweater (ok, dress, whatever) is EXACTLY what I was looking for. Heck, I loved it so much, i already have 2! My only wish is that it came in a wider variety of colors, actually. I was a little worried about this &#34;one size fits all&#34; business, especially since I'm short, with an hourglass shape, and ordering online can be tricky, as you can't try things on or feel the quality beforehand. I'm seriously impressed with this, and I may even get another. Yeah, I actually mean that! Shipping was very fast, the packaging was secure, and even at list price, it's a good deal. I did receive a discount in order to try one of these and leave a review but I really did order one at full price, too... totally worth it!"
5.0,These masks arrive super quick. Customer service was wonderful. I love the wire nosed piece adjustable arms and the pocket for the extra filter. This will be really great for back to school
5.0,"This was sturdy, easy to install and fits a man's wrist well."
5.0,"I never thought a substantial historical dress could be made available through Amazon and come from halfway around the world. This dress is beautiful, it makes me feel beautiful. The purple fabric is shimmery, and the lace accents are well-sewn into the dress. Make sure you buy ""panniers"" to wear on your hips; not a hoop skirt. This dress flares out of the waist/hips on the sides only, not front and back. I can't wait to wear for Halloween!"
5.0,"I have super good, I like the only thing in the instep fits me a bit but I think I'm going to use enlarging more and more until I run right.<br />the color is great, I love it, it is a boot that I always wanted and now I have it, it hurts width foot did not get a chance to measure it well, but for the next time I'll buy bigger a number 8 for you about something and can use it with socks"
5.0,My group purchased this vest for a black and gold event and we loved the fit and the look. It looks good on us.
5.0,I love my bling Apple Watch Gold Case Insert Bezel!  It compliments my Apple Watch!
5.0,I bought this swimsuit for my daughter.  She loves it and it fits perfect!
5.0,I bought 3 of these as Christmas gifts and all 3 men loved them!! They are very nice quality and I expect them to last a long time.
5.0,Picture online does not do it justice. Much more beautiful in hand.
5.0,"Very nice and well designed product  , easy to place filter inside.<br />I think price is a little high"
5.0,"Really pretty and u can use it with different outfits, not just for gothic look; I like wearing it with some of my lace dresses and blouses"
5.0,"Perfect for a doll I have been working on, boy dolls are hard to find cute outfits for and this hat finished his look of tractor overalls ....quick delivery and super quality."
5.0,This is a great veil. Not to expensive. Did the job it needed to do. Good accessory to any wedding day.
5.0,Well made. Not disappointed.
5.0,"The quality and size is amazing! I don’t love the back pieces for some of them but that’s an easy fix! Purchase them, you will not regret it!"
5.0,"This has the Indian version of AA prayer.  Rather than 10 year chip for birthday, I thought this better, as it applies to her personally. I was right, she loved it."
5.0,We used this as a brides maids dress in my sisters wedding. It fit 3 very different body styles well.
5.0,"I love this lanyard!  It looks just like a necklace, and you can change the style and color any time you like.  It doesn’t damage my shirts or sweaters in any way.  I would definitely buy again."
5.0,"Great pair of attractive glasses and I get complimented frequently. I needed a new pair after my last ones I had for several years of this exact same frame came apart at the upper rim and were no longer available at the store we originally purchased them from. I was able to pop in my lenses from the old pair without an issue. (I mention this because we first asked the store if they could simply reorder the frames but they told us they wouldn't and I should just order completely different frames from them because they said my lenses may not fit properly in the frames of the same model due of potential manufacturing discrepancies. That made absolutely no sense to me and I felt like they were just trying to get an addional sale so we ordered them from here.)<br /><br />The nose pads that came with these are actually much nicer than the ones we purchased originally several years ago in store.<br /><br />The only word of advice I would give is be mindful of where you are placing the strain when you are cleaning, removing or occasionally readjusting the ear rests. These frames were actually assembled from separate pieces that were attached together at the upper part of the rims for the lenses and the frames. It has the potential of separating at where the area of the rim of the lenses connect with the upper and outer part of the frames after years of abuse."
5.0,Great quality material
5.0,Gorgeous.  Well made.
5.0,"It's really good material, my daughter has tugged on it with force trying to free herself, she has stretched it as far as it goes and it hasn't ripped or broken and I've used it several times. My daughter tends to run away,  she thinks it's funny and that it's a game, she's only 3 so she doesn't understand the dangers of getting lost, running into oncoming traffic,  etc.<br />I love it because I can shop in peace without worrying about where she's at, plus we can go outdoors in peace now."
5.0,Beautiful necklace and well with the price!
5.0,I think it’s beautiful. It’s comfortable and easy to put on. Really dresses up your watch.
5.0,"Excellent rain jacket. Inside front zipper tends to catch on the flaps, but with practice it's not a problem."
5.0,This is my second purse and I love it.  Adding to my collection.
5.0,I purchased this for a teenager and she loves it.
5.0,Very full and well made! The crown I received looks exactly like what's pictured.
5.0,"These were the hit of the party. They are very stretchy and feel nice. I was afraid they might not fit, but they did!"
5.0,"This is a great walk to work shoe - 2 people have stopped me on the street to say they like them. Took a couple of weeks to wear them in, so ease into them!"
5.0,"Very durable and looks very nice! I will order the other colors next month, I want them all!!!"
5.0,I love the velcro strap that holds the mask on as it does not slip off or<br />move once you put it in place plus the breathers make it way more comfortable<br />to wear than the standard masks. I also think they look cool which is hard<br />to do while staying safe!
5.0,A bit big but great quality.
5.0,Was adorable on my girl. She got lots of compliments on the shirt.
5.0,"Can't live without these shoes! Much better than going barefoot. I've always had a pair available to wear for the last 25 years, at least. They are the best."
5.0,Pretty dress. Flattering fit.
5.0,"Nice - and so old fashioned, retro and pretty for Easter!"
5.0,"This bag is a perfect medium bag. It holds a wallet, a few assessories and my small laptop."
5.0,"I am plus size, I normally wear a size 20 in pants. my hips are 52"" and my waist is about 44"" or so.  The pants are great, they are made well and are very cute and I was so hoping they would fit me but they were too tight; I ordered the XL or the largest size.  So if you are smaller than I am you will love the pants."
5.0,Received many compliments on this dress.<br />Wore a white short sleeved shrug with it and a white belt.<br />Very comfortable and loved that it had pockets.<br />Recommending this dress for sure.
5.0,"I like the way it looks. I was a little worried before I ordered it, but it’s actually been the best band I have ordered. I’ve used it for a week now using it everyday, it’s comfortable. I wear it often and the band is not showing any wear and tear, I am extremely satisfied with this watch band."
5.0,They are nice socks
5.0,"My daughter loved these boots so much, she gave her other new ones away. Comfortable and reasonable price."
5.0,"Very, very pretty! Sparkly. Perfect length. Sturdy clasp."
5.0,These are so great!  There are so many sizes and styles and they look even better in person.  Will buy again.
5.0,"Fast delivery and band/strap is as described.<br />Comfortable and fitment (size) is as it should be. Quality & feel a step above those cheaper straps I've tried.<br />Nice they throw the extra's in (although I didn't need them, but nice).<br />Everything about it seems well done - for the quality and price, get rid of the factory bands that are stiff, thick or just don't feel right and give one of these a try. Not much money and give that watch a fresh look and get the wrist a break from uncomfortable bands, or worn out bands.<br />I ordered a few Ritche straps and have no complaints about any of them."
5.0,Exactly as we expected from a Pandora charm. Was also delivered extremely fast and a day earlier than initially expected.
5.0,"I love these pants,  they make great weekend on the go pants.  They are comfortable and stylish.  I have 3 pair,  this purchase making 4, each pair I find the sizes are not the same,  this particular pair ran a little small in the waist.  They have plenty of stretch so I will be keeping them."
5.0,"Great shoes, and I love how light they are! They are not heavy feeling at all. I definitely recommend."
5.0,My son absolutely loves this robe! Nice and soft also warm!
5.0,These are super comfy to sleep in or lounge around the house in. Easy to adjust the padding.
5.0,Easy to put on and very cute
5.0,Nítidos
5.0,Super cute and well made.
5.0,These fit perfectly there long enough and they don't ride up.
5.0,Great gift for my brother. Durable and clean.
5.0,I got these for skiing they will be perfect under my ski jacket they're thin but will be warming along with the jacket I typically wear medium or small but according to the size chart I went with a large and it fits perfectly a little tiny bit loose in the Torso area tight around my chest but perfectly fine I would definitely size up the medium would have been really snug
5.0,"Beautiful, luxurious material! Fit as expected, I'm usually  size 14/16 curvy bottom...this fit like a dream! You have to wear spanx or something to prevent the lumps, but when you are larger than a 2, that's to be expected. Overall, great purchase! I'm ready to buy in every single color!"
5.0,Fit my Seiko sportura SNL15.<br />I do not know if it is genuine or not but seems good quality and very close to the original band so overall a bit pricey but a good purchase.
5.0,Stylish jeans in a nice dark wash. “Rips” are subtle.
5.0,Love these light weight glasses that stay in place!
5.0,I love everything about this bag! the handles and the strap are great!
5.0,Real Polo
5.0,Great scrub cap! Fits and washes well.
5.0,"Love these pants!! They are so vibrant in color and light weight which is perfect for me because I get so hot. I'm going to get a 3rd pair for sure. Wish there were more patterns to choose from. I would definitely buy more. If you appreciate flowy wide leg pants, you will love these."
5.0,It took just a bit for it to arrive. But definitely worth the wait. Is stainless steel which I love. It's a great piece. I'm actually going to be ordering another one. Thank you very much guys for the great product and price.
5.0,"Very pretty chain . It is lightweight , but holds my smaller pendants with no problem ."
5.0,Very pretty. I have had my eyes on these for a while and decided to buy they for myself for Christmas.  I really like the earring hook instead of a possibility of a post falling off and loosing the earring.
5.0,I love how these fit. I bought many more in navy & black. Most leggings don't fit my bottom & go too low in the back. These fit perfectly. I love how they go right above the knee to cover all the thigh fat.
5.0,Purchased as a gift. Recipient loved it. It is a nice hat and I was impressed with the quality of it. Nice stitching and it fit them well when they tried it on.
5.0,I love it! The material could be thicker but I like the feel!

5.0,I loved this dress. I purchased it for my daughter's wedding. The fact that it was soft and was a perfect fit made my day.
5.0,I purchased these for my daughter as a birthday gift and she really likes the way they look and feel.
5.0,"I would give it 4 stars just because fuzz come off of it once in a while but for the price for alpaca wool, and the warmth,, I just have to give it five!<br />It's a great product with nice long length !"
5.0,"I Liked it, its fitted in a perfect way.  The color and the cloth are so beautiful."
5.0,"This is a great watchband.  It's leather, looks nice & shiny, fits perfectly on my watch, and was very easy to put on using the best tool I've ever seen for installing watchbands that was included with the band.  I have no hesitation recommending this watchband for purchase."
5.0,"This was for my son's 9th birthday. We were able to adjust it to fit him. He loves ready player one and loves this hat. All of the little boys at his party thought it was super cool. It's a very nice, high quality hat that will last. I highly recommend this hat for any adult or child who loves ready player one1"
5.0,Was a great Christmas gift both me and my wife loved it great gift highly recommended for couples looking for gifts
5.0,I love these they were perfect and work as described.
5.0,I ordered a size up because I like kimonos to fit loosely. This is now one of my favorites. Looks super cute on and I've gotten a lot of compliments.
5.0,Very soft and comfy!
5.0,"I brought earrings and Pendant - I really like it, I have it on today.  Matches my orange top and it will look great with my black top too."
5.0,"My husband stays cold so he is always wearing a flannel shirt over his ""regular"" shirt and I wanted something that would look a but nicer.  This sweater fits that description to a ""T"".  The instructions are to hand wash but I believe that washing in the machine on gentle cycle and hanging or lying flat to dry will work just as well.  The Navy Blue is a great color and will blend in with any color of clothing.  Nice product that you need to order for that special man in your life!"
5.0,It's constructed well. The color is very nice. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
5.0,"I love this top. I got the size L, since I'm a 36D and it fit very nicely. Good support, and just so cute. It sits right on top of your navel, with just enough cleavage."
5.0,Love this Cross. It is just what I wanted for my rear view mirror. Will buy from this seller again.
5.0,5star
5.0,"The price is amazing for 3 of them! They might not be thick but they don’t need to be they keep you very warm not the best of you wear glasses but if it’s cold out like it is here in Michigan lately, you make it work"
5.0,Holds well for my 38d boobs can run and jog thread mill and don't have to worry about bounce.
5.0,Love the earrings !!!!!! :)
5.0,Christmas gift for my grandson
5.0,"I Love these sweaters - the look, the quality,  the comfort, and the warmth allows for no coat in the winter here in Michigan and still is comfy and not too hot to keep on while inside. One tip tho, size wise, buy at least one size larger then your normal size. I have bought 3 of these so trust me for maximum use and comfort buy one size up on this item :) youll Love this heavy and thick quality. And no....it is not ichy, not at all...these sweaters are almost perfect :) enjoy and Live Life out loud ! Joshua Aspiranti"
5.0,Cutest shirt ever and amazing pricing!!<br />The print is super vibrant & the shirt design is perfect!
5.0,"This turned out to be really nice looking on my thumb. I am rough on jewelry but this ring is taking it like a pro! Still shining, no dents. I love it!"
5.0,This will be perfect for our Tear Drop camper!  We can hang it from a corner and have ventilation for the clothes.  Just what we needed; not too big!
5.0,It was beautiful and just what my sister-in-law wanted. Good looking tote.
5.0,"This is a very soft and light weight sweater. Being a short and plus size woman, I love the irregular hem. It's a great addition to my fall wardrobe."
5.0,But i know sometimes some size doesnt really fit exactlybut the design is perfect
5.0,"Total knock off of a Kickstarter campaign, but it’s a GREAT knockoff. It’s not cheap, Chinese, crap. They actually improved on the Kickstarter model by adding hydration pouch hook and zippers for the tube. I carry this as my daypack during travels, work, and home.<br /><br />Cons: 1) the chest strap clip falls off easily. I even lost it once in Europe and managed to find it by back tracking on the street. Now I keep it clipped when not in use, off the strap. 2) pouch is a bit small and hard to pack properly 3) makes your back sweat<br /><br />But it’s the bag I use the most for all my trips. I love it."
5.0,"Great item for swing/flare dresses,  PERFECT!!"
5.0,"This works very well. Because of its elastic top, it holds your fold perfectly all day without the repetitive adjustments. It is not visible in the pocket, and even better, it has a pocket built in that will hold business cards or credit cards. Well designed."
5.0,"I put this in right when it came in the mail and I love it! Its perfect for those days you just want to throw you hair in a ponytail but still look very put together. It gave my ponytail the perfect amount if extra length and volume for a full ponytail. It's really secure, it have three clips, velcro wrap, and then the part for the hair to wrap around and cover. It's so cute, I actually got a complement at the store about my hair. I got the dark brown and it matches my hair seamlessly."
5.0,"Perfect fit, true to size"
5.0,"This dress is so lovely in person.... quality fabric, nice stretch to it, medium weight, a very soft lining,  really nicely made, and very comfortable to wear! Most importantly, it has a very flattering fit! I’m 5’2”, and the dress comes just past my knees. It’s a modest length, but you can make the top part a little more sexy if you want by opening the V up  more.... or you can pin it for work so it doesn’t show off the girls too much. This is a really great day to evening option! It’s one of my favorite dresses."
5.0,"Color is good, fit good, quality good, hood so so, but it is removable. I have worn it both ways. Already have a different color in my wish list."
5.0,I like these and so far have only have had to use one. I was going through others very quickly. The string is thicker and it winds back up like it did on the first day. The dial is large - I put a cute sticker on it to make it fun.
5.0,I love it and can't wait to give it to her.
5.0,"I love this sweater.  It fits perfectly and very soft.  I am a medium, and the medium fit nicely, long sleeves and long torso, but not too long."
5.0,I love ring......it's gorgeous I get so many complaints on it.
5.0,bought for groomsmen at wedding，The real thing looks better than the photo. I strongly recommend buying it. I think it’s worth it.
5.0,Bought this robe for my husband as a Christmas present and he just loves it! He couldn't be happier. The quality is very good.
5.0,These are a must have for anyone travelling with carry-on only.
5.0,Good looking men’s pullover
5.0,"Very effective, well made"
5.0,I wasn’t sure what to expect when I ordered this. I’ve been seeing tennis skirts really trending lately and wanted to try one out. It’s so cute and comfortable! The shorts beneath it fit very comfortably! I can’t wait to wear it!
5.0,Love Love Love this nightgown.  So soft and slinky.  Very Sexy feeling.  I bought 2 more.  Just LOVE It.<br /><br />Donna<br />.
5.0,Bought these for my boyfriend who must love them cause he won't stop wearing them
5.0,"I was able to fit<br /><br />-water bottle<br />-phone<br />-battery pack<br />-powder compact/balm<br />-money, credit cards, vax card<br />- some snacks/gum<br />- Kleenex<br />- extra masks<br />- hand sanitizer<br /><br />Worked perfectly for The Permission to Dance Sofi concert."
5.0,Good sturdy strap and can be easily adjusted based on desired length and/or size or height of person carrying the mat.
5.0,that way I don't look like I have pockets full of rocks!
5.0,"I like this because it came with so many styles, colors and different piercings. Some of the stuff is goofy looking but it's alot more good stuff than bad so it's well worth the money."
5.0,Beautiful top for summer. Love it:)
5.0,It is beautiful!
5.0,Nice quality and good looking.  Nice value and my husband and loved it!
5.0,I like the shirts but not the kind of material i thought they were.

5.0,Love it does not come out easily
5.0,Beautiful dress Runs a little small
5.0,Love these headbands. I have bought multiple colors and patterns. They work really well when I'm running and lifting weights. Will continue to buy these.
5.0,"Like the thousands of reviews on here, I was absolutely blown away with how quickly and well this product worked. I’m finally able to wear the jewelry that I had stopped wearing because I was too lazy to polish the silver. A few minutes in front of the TV and voilà: perfectly polished!<br /><br />The one thing I would caution was if you have sensitive skin (as I do) wear gloves. As I was sitting there polishing away, my skin began to burn a bit. I quickly washed my hands, put on some thin gardening gloves, and happily continued."
5.0,it's sturdy and holds lots of things and it has a bunch of pockets. sometimes it's hard to fit cards into some slots but I think with time it'll get better.
5.0,Gorgeous product. Love the texture. Has a delightful slimming effect. Would purchase this again. Love it.
5.0,I used it for my Iceland trip. The inner micro fleece is excellent in keeping warm. With a wind breaker as outer layer is able to withstand 0 deg C.
5.0,Great and tells time too.
5.0,"Item was as described, small and cute which is perfect for my keys."
5.0,"I'm autistic and have multiple chronic illnesses that leave me in constant pain, so I'm really picky about what I wear. This dress is amazing. It's really soft and kinda bouncy/stretchy and just the perfect length (I'm 5'4"")."
5.0,Perfect- worn all of the time for a year and a half and finally need new pair
5.0,"I love this shirt dress!! It's loose, comfy, and cute. It's warm and cozy. It runs large. I typically where a large or extra large (5'3&quot;; 190 lbs), but I had to exchange the large for a medium. The medium is still plenty roomy. I'd buy more if it were offered in more colors."
5.0,The top is amazing cute and everyone loves it . The bottoms are like Capri and a little big around the waste. The outfit is adorable.
5.0,"Great Slippers. Nice color, soft inside and exactly what they look like in the description."
5.0,My granddaughter was very happy with her present.
5.0,excellent ear loop adjusters help give a great fit. Instructions as to what to use as a filter would help though.
5.0,My son is a die hard Flash fan and wanted this ring. It's pretty solid for the price.  I think he will love it!
5.0,Very nice jacket. Pleased! Beautiful colors!
5.0,"Bought these leggings with matching thermal top to wear on a holiday to Iceland in January. They were amazing. Warm, soft, lightweight, and not itchy! Highly recommended."
5.0,"Love this dress!  The bottom at the ground is not quite as flowy as I would normally like, it’s a little tight when walking. But overall very pretty dress! Nice material. Love the pockets!"
5.0,Very soft and comfortable. Also surprisingly stretchy.
5.0,I absolutely love this bracelet.  It is easy to latch and it looks great.  Everytime I look at this bracelet I think about the meaning of it. Whoever created it did a great job.
5.0,I got many compliments on these at my wedding. Not too heavy and perfect for an up-do hairstyle!
5.0,Husband loves this necklace. It's stainless steal so it won't fade. Im not worried about it changing colors on his neck. I got the 24 inch and it's perfect length. Sort of looks like a bike chain. It's kinda heavy but I expected it to be.<br /><br />I received this at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased opinion
5.0,"Love these for car keys, no weight on the ignition."
5.0,"Normally I wear size 8.5 in shoes do S/M good perfectly for me.<br />I do spend quite bit if time sitting and walking at work so decided to give compression socks a try. What i have noticed is that my legs feel less heavy or tired at the end of the day.<br />Those socks do not like like typical compression socks that you can buy at the pharmacy. They look like normal socks so no one will know if you're wearing them.<br />Those socks stretch appropriately, and are ready to put in - just slide them up from your foot.<br />In my case they for just below the knee.<br />Overall I'm very happy with them.<br /><br />These socks have perfect enough of elasticity and compression (it’s definitely tighter than just simple socks) as it is the standard starter pressure of 20-30mmHg. Also these don’t feel cheap at all. It has compression around calfs and the mid foot region. The color is very nice and I recommend them for anyone having issues with your feet."
5.0,"Im a tall girl... 5'10 about 180 pounds. These fit perfect. I wouldn't work out in them, but they stretch. They aren't the super tight material, you can breath. They are good. They arrived quick, good price!"
5.0,I love these bras. I am a 38C and the Large fit me just right. They are a little hard to zip up but def easier than having to pull over your head and over your boobs like with regular sports bras.
5.0,Really nice for price
5.0,Dress is beautiful as is the material.  My sister ordered it in another color because mine was so pretty.
5.0,"The stitching on the dress, quality of fabric, and durability has already passed the test. My daughter put it on immediately after we got it and wore it the rest of the day. The crown is wonderful and the bobby pins to hold it in place perfectly. The hoop skirt is perfect as well."
5.0,My Son in Law Love This Gift 🎁  ❤️
5.0,"Beautiful, warm slippers."
5.0,"The wallets is a tad bigger than what I expected but it is still way smaller and manageable than your dad's wallet.<br />Material is durable, I've been using it everyday for a few months and nothing has come apart."
5.0,"For the super inexpensive price, these are a great value.  The colors are great, and they are super versatile.  Today, I'm wearing the black pair so that the stitched button trim is folded over the top of a black pair of boots.  Yesterday, I wore the brown pair with the plain side up (so the stitched button trim was hidden inside my boot).  They aren't super elastic-y, in that when they stretch, they take a while to retract.  Ultimately, I think they won't be super durable, but for the price - they are an awesome little accessory."
5.0,"After seeing all kinds of horror stories about dresses purchased in the internet I was very skeptical to order. I was completely shocked when this dress arrived. It is beautiful, fits perfectly and was a total win!!!"
5.0,My wife love the item.
5.0,Was pleased to see this was of such good quality. I only wish it came with two insert filters rather than one and information of ordering more when needed.
5.0,I purchased these because I work in the service industry and oftentimes are on my feet for 8+ hours. Compression socks are great for decreasing foot pain at the end of the night. They aren't necessarily comfortable and you do have to get used to wearing them however they are a great investment if you are on your feet for extended periods of time.
5.0,very please with the shirt

5.0,"My son loves these.  He attends a forest school, so he is outside 4 hours/day in the winter in Minnesota.  Depending on the temperature, we've used these as a base or mid-layer.  They are stretchy and come up pretty high on his waist, and fold over several inches at the ankles, so I think they will fit him for a few years, which is fantastic.  He often chooses to wear these!"

5.0,Great stuff from Amazon.
5.0,Exactly as stated
5.0,My husband wears these when he's working outside for any length of time and it keeps his ears protected. Put a hat on top and you're set!
5.0,Great full length high quality apron.
5.0,"I loved it! The top wouldn’t stay up very well, but that’s okay"
5.0,It is a little see thru so you have to put a tank top under it. I'm wearing it with leggings.
5.0,"These are an amazing find. I’m 6’ and these fit perfectly and as pictured. Not sure why, but I was on the hunt for the perfect pair of sweats to wear around town. All I could find were oversized pairs and those horrible ultra tapered sweats the you’d see on the Beibs. These are exactly what I wanted. A modern fit. These are the best out there and such a great deal."

5.0,Loved this dress. Was sceptical at first about purchasing a dress online  with a cut out area but was so pleasantly surprised at the quality and for for the price! Zipper was a little cheap and took a little extra effort and care to zip without causing any issues or hang ups but other than that it was an awesome lbd!
5.0,I have been wearing these Pearl's since the day I received them. They are beautiful and really comfortable to wear
5.0,Cured my Turf toe while rolling (Jiu Jistu)
5.0,Bought this as a present for my friend and she loves it!

They are so comfortable I forget I'm wearing jeans and think I'm wearing my pajamas!!

5.0,They only bad part that one of the ears won’t stay up
5.0,Such a cute dress. I ordered my normal size medium and it fit beautifully. For reference I am 180lbs with a 38c chest.
5.0,I didn't think I would love it as much as I do.  I am kind of nuts about blue and it's a hard color to find.  This wallet is exceptional in it's compartments and I find I like it a lot.

5.0,Lovvvvvveeee!!!!

5.0,Very light and great size for 10yr old to carry.
5.0,I like this product...
5.0,"Love these boots, I wear them with skinny jeans or with bootcut jeans.  The boots are comfortable to walk in all day.  They can be a little hard to get on at first.  They run a little tight so if you want to wear thicker socks I would recommend ordering a half size up.  Overall I would buy again and recommend to others."
5.0,The lab coat was a big hit with our grandson! Has not been washed yet
5.0,So cute! Came in on time .
5.0,Well made and the picture in is a lot better then I expected.

5.0,Great quality product!
5.0,Beautiful hide. However I do worry this is from a fur farm. The markings are too perfect on the fox pelt to not have been intentionally breed for the patterns. Foxes are beautiful creatures and I will do more research in the future for more ethically sorced hides.<br />The top of the head has oil on it from what I believe was from the hook it was stored on to not rust the metal. Again it is a beautiful pelt.
5.0,"I love this dress! So flattering and pretty. Good material. It’s a tad short on me. I’m 5’7 & 135lb. I ordered a small.  Ignore the wrinkles in the pic, I tried it on as soon as it came. I love it &lt;3"

5.0,"Amazing, high quality. Great gift."
5.0,"Great fit, very durable, nice little shoe that doesn't cost a fortune on feet that will quickly grow out of them."

5.0,"So pretty and dainty still and fits like a glove, forget it’s even on :)"
5.0,"This was a great purchase! The arms are a little more fitted than the body which I love, so you don’t feel like you just have on a really big sweater. The pockets are great too. It’s medium weight, so it provides a little warmth, but not hot. I can dress it down with leggings and black slip on sneakers or dress it up with boots. Just get it!"
5.0,"Product has good quality, fits well, exactly as described. I recommend it."
5.0,Generous fit. The material they are made out of is so comfortable.

5.0,"I am 5'4"" 210lbs and a size 18/20. The 4x fits nicely and the length is perfect. I have ordered six pair of these leggings in the past year. The fabric is light add breathable, the fit is good, and they are extremely comfortable on the hottest summer days.  They may be a bit sheer depending on the color, so I recommend wearing similar colored underwear, and perhaps a longer shirt to hide panty lines."
5.0,"The material used was nice quality, stitching was done well.  Size M fit like a glove (135lbs, 5'7"", 34, 27, 37)"

5.0,"It looked like it might be a bit small when it came, but he put it on and it fits great and he loves the coat a lot!"

5.0,"My daughter has been having allergic reactions to every earring since getting her ears pierced a year ago. We were ready to let them close up and I read about titanium earrings, they worked like magic! Her ears her completely healed, no issue."

5.0,"I honestly bought this belt because it had a sci-fi look to the buckle, which I'll be using it for a Guardians of the Galaxy Star Lord belt to actually go through my pants' belt loops and then the regular looking Star Lord belt to go over it.  For the price, this is a good belt and is great for just normal casual or dress pants as well.<br /><br />And my wife likes it, so there's that.  :)"

5.0,Beautiful and good quality!!
5.0,"So at first the product seemed as of it weren't going to last sticked to the breast. First of, 1) it is seamless[you need to put it just how instructed, if not you will have a 1920 bra look], 2) it give you a nice cleavage 3) it definitely last on! Once you leave it on, it is SOO ON!<br />So I give it a 5 star. It has exceeded my expectations! I love it."

5.0,Awesome product at a great price!
5.0,"Fantastic product, very durable, easy to read and fun colors. Only  thing I would improve about this watch is the scroll time between functions. Highly recommended for ages above 8yrs old. Some functions of the watch are too advanced. If it is given to a younger person express to them the importance of not taking it off because a sibling will permanently &#34;borrow&#34; it. I would recommend this product to others."
5.0,"I like the color. The light blue color is as depicted in the description. The size is on point. The fit is nice and comfortable (large). The quality is good. I haven’t washed it yet, so I’m hoping it holds up well. All in all, it’s a nice shirt for those sun rays."

5.0,Easy to use and place vinly designs on
5.0,This coin purse has a sturdy clasp. It has two compartments side by side. One side will be for euros and one side will be for the other currency. It is a purse to have handy for small change and a few bills so I don't have to go digging into my big fat wallet to buy small things when shopping around markets. I got the off white floral one. The inside compartments are lined with off white floral in a smaller floral pattern. It is cute and I like it.
5.0,Everything was Great.
5.0,It's much longer than other brands that I've purchased.
5.0,Just adorable for 2nd grade play
5.0,just perfect.  Love the fact that it is tiny and still holds all I need it to.
5.0,"I loved the fit of this dress and how it accentuates my chest without putting it on display. I wish it had pockets because we all need and love a dress with pockets! I am 5’2 and wish it was a bit shorter, however I love the dress and will wear it often just with higher heels, I guess. It was not the material/feel I expected but I love the feel and comfort of the dress."
5.0,"[[ASIN:B06Y17RLWJ TINYHI Women's Short Sleeve Pocket Casual Loose T-Shirt Basic Cotton Tunic Dress Purple]] Love this top, too short for me to wear as a dress. Looks far more expensive than what I paid for it.  Ordered in purple and it is very pretty. Plan to order more before they sell out!"
5.0,"I am in love with my new Sterling Silver Crystal Fireball Stud Earrings! My ears are very sensitive, so these are fantastic! These earrings a small and shiny studs and they are so flattering.

5.0,I love the material and the fit of the waistband.
5.0,"Prettier in person, i wanted something that wasnt going to be tiny but at the same time not cotty. The size is perfect as well as the length of the chain. Very well made. Im very pleased."
5.0,A gift for my daughter who has 4 Chows.
5.0,Looks bad ass on my American made Ford Ricers move over when you see this yankee coming!!
5.0,I run at the gym and I did better with this mask than I did any other because of the loop ear wholes. If sweat a lot than your mask will get soaked pretty quickly and might be uncomfortable bring 2 and switch them out if you want.
5.0,Great buy gives you the Ray Ban style for a great price.
5.0,grandson loved it!
5.0,This dress has the ability to be a great nursing dress… the cross-cross front pattern can be secretly pulled up to review nursing access!!  🙌🏽
5.0,I purchased this key chain for my Kindergartener son to give to his bus driver. It came in a little velvet pouch. We purchased a gift card holder tin with a little card in it. My son wrote a message to her and we placed everything in the tin with a bow. She loved the bus driver key chain. It was a perfect for a little trinket type gift and it didnt cost a fortune.
5.0,Nice color and fit!
5.0,Love the slim design! I have enough to carry with kids and diapers. I just wanted something thin and simple. Its still easy to find in the mess of my bag. Super cute so I can carry when I don't have my messy bag. Just wish I had a slimmer phone because the side pocket would be perfect to hold a phone.
5.0,Cutest Dress EVERR
5.0,"With its puff sleeves, this was so sweet.<br /><br />This is a cute dress. I liked it. I thought it was flattering. I thought the fit was pretty good. I thought that it was unique and looked good.<br /><br />The dress was relatively comfortable. The fit was okay. It wasn't too hot, which for me is important since we live in Florida.<br /><br />It wasn't too hard to clean. I thought it seemed trendy. It felt durable and the fabric was relatively soft. It would work in a wide variety of settings.<br /><br />It was as described and I would recommend it."
5.0,"These are my son's favorite . They are very soft and light weight. We were sent the wrong size, but customer service was amazing at sending us the correct size in a timely manner with good communication."
5.0,Its a beautiful  sweater my granny loved it
5.0,Bought as a gift and the recipient loved them!
5.0,"Just what I wanted.  It is lightweight and fits great.  I'm a size 6-8 on the top and it fits just as hoped.  I wanted something that would be great to wrap up in while I blow dry hair, put on makeup etc. during the warm summer months.  Having a pocket is a nice bonus for keeping phone handy etc."
5.0,Perfect co for table fit
5.0,"Love this shirt!  I bought 2 different shirts from 2 different sellers.  Not only is this shirt pretty cool, it is good quality.  The other shirt had a hole in the armpit after first wash."

5.0,I love em! Nice fit .. nice sayings
5.0,This was a gift for my mom and she loves it. She’s constantly telling me about the compliments she gets.
5.0,The colors are not as pictured. I ordered in August and received the pair with the Red. Had a friend receive the correct color so tried again and got the right ones. Other than that they are very cute and light.
5.0,Less expensive for the watch than the replacement watch band and the expected Casio quality for their inexpensive digital watch
5.0,"But the first wash makes it look like it's so old,"
5.0,Comfy and love this style.<br />It runs true to to size ordered.
5.0,Comfortable and sleek.
5.0,Bought for my elderly husband as he is always cold.  Very nice and well made.  Lined and cozy.  He loves it.  This would make a perfect gift for a loved one in a nursing home as warm and very nice looking.
5.0,I bought these for a review on my instagram Beckandbabes. It was so flowy and adorable. It's a great dress for the days when you don't want to actually dress up but want  a little more than shorts and tee. Pefect!
5.0,"Best sunglasses I ever had. My goodness , love it!"
5.0,Good fit and great price

5.0,Good build quality too
5.0,Loved it! Went great with my costume!
5.0,Awesome bag for $50 never mind $11.99.
5.0,Super cute earrings that my daughter LOVES and such a good price point. Lots of different options for my 4 year old. A few of the pairs were a little larger than I thought but they still looked cute on my daughter - just looked more like a dangly earring.  My daughters favorite were the Christmas trees.
5.0,"these are good ,exept the belts are very short"
5.0,"Really nice shirt-a bit expensive, but if you are a Formula 1 fan-a must have! My husband wears it when he takes out the motorcycle."
5.0,Super cute and well worth the $6.  Fits my 7 year old well.
5.0,Fit perfectly to my 3 and 5 years old sons. Perfect for hot summer day. Very light materials so kids’ heads won’t get heated!
5.0,Perfect condition. Just what I expected.
5.0,I needed to replace an old pair of dock/boat shoe laces.  Saw a Sperry YT on how to do it using this kind of tool.  Then on their site-saw a similar video and decided this was the tool I needed to re-thread.  Works well.  Saved me $25 labor if I had taken the shoes to a shoe repair place.  Glad I could do it myself.
5.0,"Comfortable and washes well, seems to run a bit on the smaller side. Would purchase again."
5.0,They are beautiful. Haven’t put them in yet. Since I just gauged up. Looking forward to wearing them.
5.0,Have ordered two pair. Very happy with them and have worked great with my daughters sensitive ears.
5.0,"Perfect coat! Fits well, and it seems to be really warm. I’m hoping it’ll keep me warm for a winter trip to Paris"
5.0,"Really soft, warm, and pretty. I think for the cost it is really good quality. It fits loose, but not too loose. The zipper is a nice touch for extra style!"
5.0,Perfect for my kids ears!! They loved them.
5.0,Very similar to Lululemon Aline joggers. Super cozy to lounge in and practical to work out in.
5.0,Super soft and perfectly made
5.0,"Adorable, fashionable earrings! Great price! I get compliments every time I wear them!"
5.0,Decently high quality leather material. Excellent embroidery stitching; no signs of wear and tear anywhere despite frequent use. Looks just like the one in the movie. Plenty of pockets and material space. Excellent wallet in general.
5.0,Very pleased with the items!
5.0,These fit nicely and don't slip off. They keep the cold wind out of my ears.
5.0,These pajamas are so cute. And very comfortable! Not as stiff as I expected.  Would definitely buy again!!
5.0,Loved it! soft and comfy
5.0,It is awesome!
5.0,"I like very much this bottom, it's really cute and extremely well made.<br />It fits very well, it's comfortable and doesn't ride up.<br />I'm happy with the coverage: lower rise with the right amount of coverage from the back.<br />I would recommend"
5.0,Pretty and the adjustable clasp allows you to make it as tight or loose as you'd like.
5.0,Its true to size.
5.0,I had noticed a necklace on a nurse and asked her where she bought it.  She told me and I ordered.  Very nice and very pleased.
5.0,I use this belt for everyday casual wear. I highly suggest this.
5.0,"Love them so much , am ordering in three other colors!"
5.0,"My son wasn't thrilled that it was a playstation remote and not an xbox remote ... I didn't realize it mattered. But he likes it, it seems like good quality."
5.0,I love this belt
5.0,It is super comfortable especially for a good workout.
5.0,"I've bought this gown before, maybe 5 years ago. I love it & will buy it again even though I consider it to be expensive. I like that the bottom is not confining & the fabric is cool."
5.0,Beautiful crystallinity. really a good product.
5.0,The fabric is so soft and cozy! Great quality and my Angel was delighted!
5.0,My kid was happy they fit so no complaints
5.0,"Very well made, soft and comfortable!<br />I bought it for a costume party. I was Mary Ann of Gilligand's Island!"
5.0,"This is the second order I've made from this company. Their work is fantastic! The earrings have always looked high-end without the high-end pricetag. They are lightweight, simple, medium sized statements with great colors and hardware that looks classy (antique feel to the metal used).  I really try to not buy or wear leather products (you just don't know the ethics of where they come from) and these are PU so that is great, but truly look and feel like the real deal that you would easily pay 20$ per pair for. I recommend to everyone. I will definitely be ordering more sets from this company- for myself and as gifts. 5 STARS all the way! Do not hesitate! (I was not given any discount or item for a review, this is completely unbiased and my true feeling for this product/company."
5.0,"Very cute and fit exactly as expected.  I'm 5'3'&#34; and the length was perfect (grazing ankle).  I ordered the &#34;coffee 16&#34; and it's a true size 16, (with a little bit to spare), which makes it nice when moving around, kneeling, etc..  Total teacher outfit,and perfect for teaching Kindergarten!"
5.0,"Very soft and made well. We have paid a lot more for name brand knit hats like this that weren't half as nice. When I saw it in person I wrapped it quick because it made the stocking stuffer criteria. Nonetheless, I wear it just as much as my husband but it has that impressive quality that makes for a nice gift. I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased personal review."
5.0,Bought these for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves them and has gotten quite a few compliments when wearing them. Several of her friends want them too.
5.0,Super cute! Lots of compliments!
5.0,I bought this for my wife and she loves it.
5.0,My favorite glasses.  Great seller great quality.
5.0,Got these for my son and son in law for Christmas.  My son in law wears all the time.  He loves it.
5.0,"To please the Ancient God(s) I had to order this to bring a full effect with wardrobe to preform Ceremony ritual, respectfully. This as is, it's large just the way I expected, arrived on Time and fits perfectly. I do recommend"
5.0,Used for a photo booth at a wedding 😊
5.0,I bought this for all my outdoor hangers for the bird feeders . These are stainless steel so no more rust. The only way to hang them.  My keys rings I had used got rusty. Price vs no more rust works for me.
5.0,"It was so much prettier than I thought it going to be! There was so details that I didn't notice originaly in the photos that make it look absolutely amazing! The flowers seem like good quality too! Especially for the great price! I have a different flower crown that cost me more than this one, and it's not even half the quality. I'm so glad I got this and I look forward to wearing it"
5.0,GOOD HAT TO WEAR OUT AND THE STYLE IS GOOD
5.0,"All four pairs are GREAT, sturdy, stay on well, and have their own unique characteristics. Sometimes if you buy bulk earrings they are very similar, but these are not. They have different personalities, weights, sizes, & textures. Two of the pairs are quite casual, and can be worn from the mom’s day out to casual work environment. The other two, mostly because they are larger & flashier,  are more date night/dressy. The pair with the stones is gorgeous. I was concerned that this pair would be too heavy, and I CAN NOT DEAL with that. My earring holes are super low, and I guess I actually have pretty small earlobes, so when people see me with heavy earrings they are more concerned that my earring will rip out than looking at the accessorising.  I decided to do a test run of the stone dangles to my mom’s house (a 30 minute trip) to see if I needed to give them away.<br />My mom immediately noticed them and asked if I got them at Chico’s or Nordstrom. HA! No I didn’t. Perhaps she should learn to shop Amazon. I did not think about them until 3 hours later when I laid my head down on a pillow. Phew. Keepers. And attention grabbers. All of them are particularly great with blue eyes (or hair) since blue is a dominant color."
5.0,"I love this dress!  It is exactly as described, has two pockets, flows nicely, adjustable straps.  I am 5’9”, weigh 152 lbs, and chose size large.  A medium probably would have worked, but i like it roomy, and wanted the length.  The hem is uneven, which gives it a graceful, flowing look.<br />Such a bargain!"
5.0,"Bought this for the holidays. Very cute and as expected, not for keeping your head warm, but it did a fair job of that."
5.0,"A week before my October cruise I realized that I needed a new bathing suit but stores were not selling them at that time of year. I turned to Amazon and found a wide selection. Most were $100 or more, and I didn't want to spend that kind of money on something that might not fit, and I certainly didn't need anything fancy; just something to put on in case I used the pool. This suit was so inexpensive compared to the others that I was afraid it would be very cheap looking but to my delight it was not at all. It fit very well, looked cute with the skirt, and was perfect for my needs. The bust area is a little small but that was not really a problem for me. I am extremely pleased with this purchase."
5.0,"These are dramatic and modern, and yet I can wear them with just about anything. (I would not suggest ruffly, romantic stuff, although I DO love that, too.)  I thought the crystal part would be clear all through the stone, but the crystals have a solid silvery back on them. That is not a problem, unless you don't like stones with opaque settings. The solid backing does not appear to negatively affect the sparkle of the earrings.  These were a gift for Mother's Day. I like them very much. They would work for the office or a date, but I wouldn't wear them to Target. ;-)"
5.0,My daughter LOVED it.  She said it was much better and shinier than the ones in the store.  It fit her perfect and the material is stretchy.
5.0,"You need to get the right two part epoxy. Loctite plastics bonding system ""fuses hard-to-bond plastics"".  Other epoxys might not work. Good luck."
5.0,I have been looking for a full coverage 2-piece. Thank you for considering some people aren't trying to let it all hang out.
5.0,"I was blown away buy how well this dress fit. It's really cute, looks like the images, and was a decent quality. Shipping from Asia was faster than expected (~10 days). It's not perfect, the pleats on the bust are wonky on mine, and the soft cups in them shift around a lot. However, the seams and zipper are all well assembled, it survived its initial wash/dry fine, and was incredibly comfortable to wear. It has a bit of stretch so sitting and moving around don't pinch. I ordered an XL based on reviews and it fit great for me as a size 16, 40DD, 5'2&#34;. I plan on ordering other styles!"
5.0,My daughter looked so cute in this dress! Wish the shirt was a onesie to make it easier to keep shirt down but not a huge issue .
5.0,Matches description on the web. Glad I bought 2.
5.0,Ivan wear it without worry to work
5.0,[[VIDEOID:42ce075cec64edd8537de040d7578087]] :)
5.0,"Cute pure, just as pictured.  It did not have a weird smell at all.  Smells just like patent leather is supposed to smell.  Roomy.  I recommend this more for a younger woman.  It's very youthful looking, meaning college, or young career."
5.0,I absolutely love these charms! My favorite color is purple and now I feel like my bracelet is complete! Great deal and wonderful quality!
5.0,"Very good. It help my legs to run ，to walk and to stand, feel comfortable. Thanks!"
5.0,Allows others to know you have an epipen
5.0,Hold it in place. I have one bra that's always sliding down and it was very frustrated but it really does the job!
5.0,I bought this Bathing Suit for myself the Size you Order will actually be the right Size
5.0,"I really like these oversized polarized sunglasses with wooden arms. They weighs 24g which is the equivalent of a little over 9 pennies which is really lightweight in my book. They come with a nice, wooden case and well made. These take me back to the 90s!"
5.0,"Love the blouse. Fit was spot on. I am 5'4&#34;, 125 and the small was just right. It has a 3/4 sleeve option with the button flap, which I like. Looked like the photos!"
5.0,"This was such a cute shirt, I love the pop of cheetah"
5.0,💜💜💜
5.0,"I love the smell of leather, and this bag has a wonderful leather smell. I like the roomyness  of this bag. I can put all my things in here even my Kindle! It has a middle compartment for tablets and things like that. I also like the cross body strap that's  removable when you just want to use the handles. I very good buy"
5.0,"Great pant, thick material, i am 5’5 and 180, got the large and the waist is snug but pants fit great at hips elastic is wide. Only issue was wrinkles and elastic band flips when washing but they are a simple fix."
5.0,the perfect “wet leather-look” but just try not to actually get them wet since the material isn’t meant for getting soaked - i loved them tho very much worth buying
5.0,"Nice lanyard, legit NCAA authorized product as well. Great looks and length using my to hang in locker just to hold my work keys and several UK fans have already seen it and asked where I got it. Amazon where else!"
5.0,nice charm
5.0,"I'm about 5ft tall, wear a D cup, and weigh about 105 lbs. This fits perfectly (and is a very nice white)."
5.0,perfect for gogo dancing and really sturdy. not like wearing heels the platform makes you stand on a flat surface
5.0,I have a large cranium and these actually a little big. Fast delivery
5.0,Good it worked fine
5.0,"I LOVE this dress, I get many compliments on it. It fits great mostly, but it's a heavy-ish dress and the smocking isn't very firm so it drops a bit, but I had little belt loops sewn in so I can add a ribbon to add support."
5.0,Excellent arrived on time and as pictured
5.0,Adorable and super comfy.
5.0,It's a classic
5.0,"Had a blast adding these to our night out. The added visual effects made for some interesting beautiful lights. Also durable, not easily torn and wasted."
5.0,I have a small face and the glasses are very comfortable. This is a great product.
5.0,Fits as expected. Very well made shorts
5.0,great watch
5.0,was a gift for a friend
5.0,looks better than in picture
5.0,Funny. Great quality
5.0,"Love these socks.  The colors are perfect, exactly as they look"
5.0,"This piece “ We Are His Diamonds“ it’s a stunning all silver piece centered with a bouquet of frangipani‘s. Janyl, is an exceptional designer. Her attention to detail every detail is unmatched.  This is a must have to add to your collection."
5.0,"Didn't get better than that! I have ordered other plantar fasciitis inserts, so now I have two insoles for men's shoes, i don't need to replace it every time. Compared other shoe insoles i bought before, I prefer this one, because the foot insoles provide effective arch support, but with satisfying price. Although i forgot to use 2 dollars promotion, it still worth it."
5.0,I really love my new sun glasses!
5.0,My daughter absolutely loves it!  Great craftsmanship and quick delivery.  She's 11 1/2 and the small fit her perfectly.  Will definitely purchase again.
5.0,Purchased these for a friend and he is sold on them. He has circulation problems and walks miles each day and now doesn’t want to be without them. He said they fit well and work for his issue.
5.0,"Shipped quickly, and looks like the picture."
5.0,"I am new to purchasing clothes on Amazon, but definitely hit the jackpot with this dress! I wore it to a fall wedding and received lots of compliments! It was very flattering and super comfortable! Love the belle sleeves!"
5.0,"OMG great hat!  Classic, classy.  Came with a colorful feather, but that isn't my style... plucked it out."
5.0,"So far the bag has been great for heavy use. It's well designed, both in look and durability. For a heavy use and heavy wear kinda guy this has been a great choice. I'm sure it's going to last a good long while. Veryyyy pleased."
5.0,"My son loves American Flag items. So he loves these, and they are comfortable."
5.0,My wife loves it and actually will will make anyone think it's worth hundreds.Beautiful
5.0,"These are great. I wear a 5-1/2 shoe and these fit perfectly. When I took them out of the package they seemed rough, not the silky texture I was expecting. But once you put them on, you can't tell the difference other than my foot doesn't slide around in my shoe as much when I wear these. Also they are very run resistant. I've been wearing them daily for about 3 weeks and wash the 5 pair at the end of the week and I haven't had any runs or snags in them. I have never had a pair of nylons last more than 1 usage."
5.0,Great bang for your buck. My daughter loved it!!
5.0,Not happy at all about the Daisy Air Rifle branding on the ear pieces and lenses. I would not have purchased if I'd known that. Don't see Daisy any place in the description. Any how as far as riding glasses go I give them a solid 5. I did a 300 plus mile ride with them and took a decent sized pebble to the right lens at 70mph and a few decent sized bugs. No damage. I wear contacts. Eyes were fine. Not to sweaty or dried out feeling.  Just hate the Daisy Logo. It's on the strap to .
5.0,I love this...i am plus size and this fits me just right...i feel and look stylish and sexy on the beach
5.0,Very cute top great quality stretch material true to size
5.0,Gorgeous bag! And such a lovely lightweight leather.
5.0,I love these pants!  Washed up good and wear great..  Would love to find the exact ones in black and gray.
5.0,My son Love it and it's very soft and warm.
5.0,I have horrible neuropathy in my feet and legs .. also a arthritic spine.  I have tile floors throughout my house and walking barefoot exacerbates the pain .. now I wear these as soon as my feet hit the ground in the morning until I go<br />To bed.  They have eased my back<br />Pain and throbbing burning feet.  I have a 10.5 foot but I got the sz 11 and they fit perfectly
5.0,"really like these earrings, as crawlers or just hanging..."
5.0,Live the patriotic shirts.
5.0,Great item!! I love it!!
5.0,Wow it feels like a good quality and a xlarge fits like small
5.0,My son (14) lives it.
5.0,Just the right size. Very comfortable and love turtles.
5.0,I bought a large and they fit like a medium after a few washings. I'm a small. They are cute and comfy. Just size up.
5.0,Soft material. Good hat.
5.0,"They work great, look good and exceed my expectations!  Thank you!"
5.0,"I purchased every color after I received this one, although I downsized to a medium. Well made, washes great, I don't put them in the dryer."
5.0,Twas great :)
5.0,"Colors are gorgeous, the outer material is nice, seems to be put together decent for the price.  The only problem with this product is that the interior material is not tight at all so it does not add to make this a more flattering piece.  In fact, I am not even sure if the internal material will hold up that well after a few washes because the material is super thin, almost like panty hose material.  That is not the case with the outer material however.  The outer material is really nice.<br /><br />The skirt part of the dress is super flattering, the top does not offer a ton of support and for me, unfortunately, I don't need that much but for a woman that is more &#34;blessed&#34; than me, that may be an issue.<br /><br />The back of the swimsuit is flattering, goes up pretty high so you don't have to worry about not being covered up.  The neckline of the swimsuit is my favorite type of cut, the v that shows just the right amount of cleavage but is not too flashy.  I will be wearing this in Punta Cana this week with a white cover up that I purchased and I am super excited about receiving the product before my trip.<br /><br />At least this is a true one piece.  Some of the swim dresses are a two piece and those fit super awkward for the most part, this one is more smooth and then you don't have to worry about anything strange when you get into the pool and the skirt flies up.<br /><br />I will update this review after I have worn the outfit a few times and am able to say if it held up.<br /><br />I received this product for a discount in return for an honest and unbiased review that in no way altered my dissertation of this product."
5.0,My sons love it wish they had it for adults too
5.0,Best rain booties!<br />Highly recommended!<br />True to size and comfortable! Cute too.
5.0,Nice fitting. It is just  as described. It felt tight when I just put it in but after 10 minutes working out i just felt comfortable. It is a good fit for me.
5.0,🤩
5.0,Bought for my boyfriend and he's very happy with this product! He's showing this to everyone!!
5.0,"Its the perfect little dress. My three year old loves it. Got  complements , told them umm Amazon lol."
5.0,My grandson loves this hoodie! Very comfortable and he can see well through the material 😊
5.0,Beautiful and well made. Truly designed like expensive jewelry. Bright
5.0,I'm happy with this strap. Looks good. Easily installed.
5.0,Jacket is great. Just what I wanted.
5.0,"I absolutely love these dresses and have ordered almost every color. They are well made, not flimsy, not see-through and come in beautiful, bright colors. The fabric is baby soft and the fit is perfect - just enough stretch!"
5.0,This jogger pant keeps my son warms this winter season! Thanks so much!
5.0,Socks for perfectly for a seven year with room to grow!
5.0,Nice stocking gift for Tin Tin fan!
5.0,This product will fit small. I’m chunky and my arms...well I prefer not to show off my angel wings to just anyone! I love that it’s 3/4 sleeve.  I read previous reviews and ordered a size up and it fits great. I am normally a XL-1X so I ordered the 2X. Color is pretty much identical to the picture. Material is thin so don’t buy it expecting it to keep you warm but it serves well over a tank top or to dress up a t-shirt. You will have to steam it to get out the wrinkles as the washing instructions say not to iron. Double stitching on all seams so it looks fairly well made.  I really like it.
5.0,""" I received my wallet/kit yesterday and I am impressed by several things:<br />obviously the smaller size; the smooth finished edges; multiple skins; multiple bands; all the accessories; and the money clip which doesn't stick out so much as to put a hole in your pants pocket.  And last, but not least, the PRICE! I have switched over from the Ridge wallet and loaded about 12 cards and money to my new Fidelo wallet.  I have had to make some adjustment in how I feed the cards to make sure the chips are RFID protected and so they ""sit flusher"" due to the raised credit card numbers. But this was easily solved by flipping them front to back. I do like the longitudinal card extraction better than the lateral extraction of the Ridge wallet.  I haven't yet decided how I want to configure things, but that will come as I try out the many options. "" "
5.0,"Great material, great shirt."
5.0,shoes were great my feet are not
5.0,"These are very cute, and very well made.<br /><br />To the sleep deprived parents out there trying to gift shop for your kids while working long hours and juggling pandemic chaos - Just make sure you're aware that these stickers are for the anime ""Stray Dogs"" and have nothing to do with the Kpop band ""Stray Kids"". Your 14 year old Kpop fangirl daughter will probably not be happy with these.<br /><br />Now, to try to convince my daughter to start watching ""Stray Dogs"" before Christmas so I don't have to return them 🤦🏽‍♀️"
5.0,When we bought the Luminators Nollies.  We didn't know where they lit up.  When we got them we realized that they lite up on the toungish part of the shoes.  My nephew is pleased.  May the force be with you.
5.0,this is jus a little  bigger then the normal size o an ear ring but its ok. they look  VERY real.
5.0,The material is nice and comfortable. The style is simple. I use it for yoga class as well as underwear. Both works out well.
5.0,This is the perfect comfy sweater
5.0,It fit lust like I needed it too. I am short so it wasn’t too long for me.
5.0,My daughter loves it. Cute design. Fits well. No leaking. Pretty good at anti-fogging.
5.0,"I am a pharmacist and am on my feet all day, and  have been wearing compression socks for years.  I wore these socks to work for the first time today and I am impressed. My legs feel great! The socks have a high percentage of merino wool and are soft and comfortable, and smell great even after a full day in my clogs. They are not too thick or too thin in the foot part of the sock.  And best of all they fit really well!  For reference I am a female, size 10 1/2 shoe women's, 5'8"" and have relatively thin ankles but wider muscular calves from riding my bike a lot.  I bought these in large and it is like they were custom made for me. Usually I have to size up in compression socks to get them to fit my calves and make sure they are high enough, but then I am left with the problem of the socks being too large in the foot, and too loose in the ankle. But these fit perfectly!  The only downside to these socks is the size chart is a little off, and you may need to size up.  Also they might not fit men with really large feet, say a size 11 or larger mens shoe size. I wish this company made an XL sock for these men so that they can enjoy these socks  too!"
5.0,I’ve had it since Jan 2018 and rarely take this necklace off. It’s held up wonderfully and I always get compliments on it!
5.0,Just what I was looking for...simple and pretty. Came with a small bag to store them in also.
5.0,"Just what I wanted, but didn't know existed."
5.0,"I bought this bag because it was vegan, worried it might look cheap, but it doesn't!"
5.0,One of my favorite dresses I own!
5.0,Got these socks for my husband for Christmas...he loved them.  Came in a very nice box so even if you don't give/get these as a gift the packaging was very appealing.
5.0,Very nice in person! Good quality!
5.0,Lovely bracelet from a reputable company!
5.0,Hi quality great looking
5.0,Light was a bit dim but it was still easu enough for me to read the time. Weak wristband s.
5.0,Very Nice Quality
5.0,"I can't say enough good things about these rubber rain boots. I walk my dog everyday and while both Hunter and Ugg rubber knee high rain boots got damaged in a year or so, these things are iron clad and going strong. The only complaint I have is the insoles do not stay intact after a while of heavy use. I wear heavy socks and live in an area that is not too cold, so this has not been a problem (I just took the insoles out)."
5.0,Loved the fit. Made me look better!
5.0,"For how cheep these are they are actually very nice, absolutely would recommend."
5.0,These are beautiful
5.0,Way more bigger then expected but still cute
5.0,I'll definitely buy again in a different colour
5.0,This is a beautiful heirloom piece. It's very well made. I love the adjustable chain.
5.0,I love the look of it and the fit is perfect
5.0,I liked so much
5.0,Prompt service and as described:D
5.0,My fiancée loves this hat.  He’s a picky hat collector too.
5.0,"I can remove my car key easily when it is serviced. When I walk, all I need is my car key and a house key. It's so easy to remove the other keys. Seems sturdy so far."
5.0,"Me encantan, muy femeninos, me recuerda como si fueran los lentes de Barbie pero para adulto 😝.  Muy lindos."
5.0,Best
5.0,Kids only want to wear boots now! Very comfortable
5.0,Love the soft feel and the smell of the leather. There is a metal tube in it you should remove first or it will get stuck on your watch. 9ther than that it's fantastic.  Love it
5.0,I loved the dress
5.0,Such a simple yet beautiful necklace. Very special and sentimental. It adds interest without being cheesy at all.
5.0,"Bought this watch for my 83 year old father who can not see very well, and he just loves it, thanks"
5.0,I got so many compliments on these! they are a pumpkin neon orange. extremely lightweight and perfect fit. It was a little confusing to figure out how to put the backing on but it all ended up working out! I really loved this product! 10/10
5.0,"I ordered these as a present and they are absolutely perfect, they fit about 3/4 of the way across the tie, and the colors are very true to the picture."
5.0,Comfortable and easy to transition to - I like the buckle better because the snap-on band is easier to fall off.  I play golf and it's easy to pop off while carrying clubs.  I highly recommend these adjustable bracelets m.
5.0,"Very cute shoes, happy with my purchase"
5.0,"I like this bag. Same color as the picture. It's a medium sized bag, but not small. All of my stuff fits even my Nook. I am satisfied."
5.0,"I got these shirts for my husband and I to wear on our honeymoon. I wear a small, but I ordered a medium because I like my tees to be a little looser fit. The medium fits like a small, so I would definitely go up a size or two. My husband wears an XL and his shirt is true to fit. Can's wait to wear these on our honeymoon!"
5.0,Love these tank tops! Wear them all the time. Fits as expected.
5.0,Fits perfect!!  Extremely comfortable and super cute.

5.0,My 15 year old son loved them. Very stylish.
5.0,Fantastic quality and style. Fits perfectly and tight to your face. Awesome glasses for the price.
5.0,Loved highly recommend it.
5.0,"Thick and comfy for the price, cute."
5.0,"Don’t put in dryer, but good quality"
5.0,Used it for a crochet hat. Worked great
5.0,Took this on a backpacking trip to Malaysia and it was perfect. There are enough compartments so that everything can stay organized and the bottom has a gusset that zips open allowing you more space. This also seems to be theft-proof since the zippers of all the pockets are covered and they are close enough together that you can feel if someone were to put their hand in your bag.
5.0,"Good Fit, good quality"
5.0,I cannot tell you how much I love this scarf. Yeah its a little itchy but it just looks so good.
5.0,"This is my second one, and I love it!!!!"
5.0,Comfortable summer maxi dress.
5.0,"Love this bracelet, very well made with quality materials. Standard size. Comes in a beautiful bag, so would make a good present. I have ordered another one in blue."

5.0,So cute and fit able! I love it.
5.0,Love it. Very cute and comfortable. Became my go to weekend and around the house dress in summer.
5.0,Gifted this watch. Beautiful time piece. The picture is a true depiction of the item received. Was really happy with purchase and quality. I would purchase this watch again. Pop of color was a nice touch.
5.0,Love this dress! Nice fit and I’ve received so many compliments!
5.0,Love this suit!! Its flattering and comfortable. The too fits however the overlay part seems a little big. I wish you could order different sizes for too and bottom but other than that i love it.
5.0,It's fabulous!
5.0,"I usually wear Birkenstocks but there are times when you need a regular shoe/ie:business meetings. Tried this shoe,wore it all day and didn't get the foot pain that an one inch plus heel usually causes me. I also have wide feet. Like this sole style so much that I bought it in the mule. Finally a ""regular"" heeled shoe that fits like my Birki's. Price is comparable to Birki's. Wish I found this brand of shoe years ago; it would have saved by from having a humongous Birki collection."
5.0,I’m only 125 it’s an xs but it fits loose it’s very comfortable though so it’s not true to size but if you 130-135 oh I’m sure it will fit right
5.0,Very comfortable for my every day use.
5.0,"Bought for wife.  Nice heavy ring,  built well and the quality was better than I anticipated."
5.0,Loved this top! Went back and ordered in 2 more colors
5.0,Perfect size! Beautify color! Great quality!
5.0,Awesome little shoes for the price!
5.0,great price!
5.0,Works great. Compact easy to use. Pockets to make accessing items easy.
5.0,It looks amazing!!!!
5.0,"Super Sexy Costume!!!!! Like everyone loved it including me. The quality was great and it fit like a glove. Very low cut in the top part, but hey its a sexy Mrs. Claus! nice fabric doesn't look like a cheap costume. I wear a lot of costumes and this one was great, The brand Roma is always a good one for me. Doesn't disappoint in the quality department."
5.0,"Would purchase again, great fit"
5.0,"So at first was uncomfortable with claws being a first time home owner and new to gardening so I bought regular gloves but quickly realized that this was the go to gloves for everything outdoor. I use it for spreading mulch, replanting and also I killed a big patch of my lawn so this was a great help setting seeds. Love this glove happy it came with 2 pairs"
5.0,I’m very pleased with these plugs. I needed them for work and they are exactly what I wanted. They are accurate in size and good quality for the money.
5.0,Socks are very comfortable and keep the feet dry....my toddler loves them....only con is that they get lints easily
5.0,I loved it and it fits perfectly great color great
5.0,"Cute, fit well (6) , nice quality. Wish I liked the other designs as much."
5.0,Daughter wasn't crazy about them at first. Thought they looked cheap but now loves them.
5.0,"I love this. It's a little short in the torso, but overall it's beautiful!"
5.0,"This necklace is soo beau. Ive gotten so many compliments on it from every one. On me, it sits right on my clavicle line which really gets it noticed. Love it. Lobe Berricle Jewlery."

5.0,Item was perfect
5.0,sweet little earrings
5.0,Lovley great gift.
5.0,Used this as part of a Halloween outfit. “Bag of Jellybeans” won first prize.
5.0,This was a gift for my sister. She loves her owl backpack. Great price.
5.0,a beautiful piece..
5.0,I just received it today and love how there is no string to tie around..you just slip it on and thats it. very light weight and its simple and soft.  I will be buying more in different colors.
5.0,I love this dress. The reviews were excellent and they did the dress justice. I wore this to a funeral so I didn’t get any pictures but I did end up cutting the choker piece off because I felt it didn’t look very “conservative” for my grandpas funeral. I also sewed lace to the bottom of the dress for a little razzle dazzle since the choker got trimmed. I have a little bit of a pot belly and fat arms and this dress actually made me look taller and slimmer when wearing it! The fit just cannot be beat. 10/10
5.0,"I am only 5'4"" but, I have a large bust and for this reason, I bought the XXL and it fits like a dream. The shirt is very easy to wear, like you haven't got anything on!  It washes up nicely too. It was worth the $10.99 I paid for it!"
5.0,I gave these earrings as a gift to my daughter in law. As I heard she really likes them and they are easy to wear. The Murano glass is an art that many people treasure. I thought they were beautiful.
5.0,They are slippers for my grandson who is almost two he loves them
5.0,"These slides feel amazing!!! They really are PILLOW slides and have the soft, plush effect. I love them! I will be getting more colours."
5.0,Sturdy and comfortable sole.  Highly recommended cleats for those that like k-leather.
5.0,Super comfy! Exactly the same as the photo. I have a small chest and it fits perfectly. The best part about it is it’s adjustable and could fit bigger chest and those with bigger hips<br /><br />I’ll update my review after I put it through the wash a couple of times.
5.0,"Love it, had it for a couple months so far"
5.0,Dinner
5.0,Best sample of ships wheel which is my USCG Rating Badge.  Very nice and of good size.
5.0,Fast shipping. Cute to add to costume trunk.
5.0,Looks great but smaller than expected. Happy with 1st purchase but won’t buy again.
5.0,My stepdaughter luvs them.
5.0,Very well made..but it was too small...I had to return it. Quality was great...itwas just to small for what I needed
5.0,Just had my first child and looking for something comfortable and easy to put on but still look and feel good. Very comfortable! Can't wait to wear it more!
5.0,"I use this for keys and put it on my arm.  Keeps me from losing them from the pocket of athletic shorts.  Works best around the wrist or close to it.  It's too small to go around the upper arm if you do any exercise to strengthen biceps/triceps.  Can't speak about durability yet, but they seem sturdy enough."
5.0,"Superior customer service by Humble and Chic. My original pair was defective, they promptly sent me a replacement pair and the replacement is perfect. Love the earrings, would certainly recommend Humble and Chic for their customer service."
5.0,Loved this anklet it is not super fragile just dont go sprinting with it on.
5.0,"Small, sleek, sufficient. The picture is accurate. There's not a whole lot to say about this little credit card wallet, except that it fits pretty much anywhere, looks cool and modern, and is well made. You can slide it into a bigger purse, and then you can slip it out and into your pocket if you need to. (I might get a separate one just to store all the business cards I seem to accumulate.)"
5.0,Love it. So very cute. Can't wait to wear it!
5.0,The best thing ever! Great for anyone!
5.0,Warm and very comfortable.
5.0,"Even more beautiful in person! It feels very well made and the beads are heavy, they do not feel cheap at all!"
5.0,"I got here so fast, and it is so amazingly pretty. I love I wear it all the time. I am very happy with the service and plan on ordering similar thing for my family"
5.0,loved these jerseys i ordered them for my boys  ordered them a little late for Christmas but still come on time
5.0,Cure earrings arrived in time...was purchased as a gift.
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress, things can be hit or miss on Amazon but this is great quality and so stinking cute on, I’m buying another one!"
5.0,Just as pretty as the picture
5.0,"This hat came in just as ordered and looks even better than the picture, it totally made her costume."
5.0,Look great on:)
5.0,"Superb, durable and easy to operate. Amazing to own such a watch that requires absolutely no windings,  and it adjusts time anywhere in the world.  Furthermore, very aesthetic to the eyes."
5.0,These are amazing socks!  I wear a women’s size 8 shoe and have chunky calves and the medium fits perfectly!  The sock stays in place and the top doesn’t roll down - and bonus for me - the toe seam is virtually undetectable by my toes....something that would be a deal breaker for me.  I will be ordering more - I started with 4 pairs - I wear them everyday and can easily wear my work dress loafers with these socks.  Great item - better price!  Thanks!  (This might be TMI - but a very positive benefit for me wearing these socks during the day is - I am no longer waking up every 2 hours in the night to use the bathroom....I now go ‘normally’ throughout the day - and and what was three times per night is now once per night!)
5.0,"I love this dress! I wear a size small typically on top and medium on the bottom. I bought a medium and it fits perfectly. I am a 34b on top, small waist, and a sz 28 jeans. It is such a beautiful dress! I have gotten so many compliments on it. It's so comfortable. I like to wear a belt with it and roll up the sleeves. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"Bought because we needed a black leotard without skirt for ballet. Work great but fits my girl perfect at 4, range is 4-6. I will buy next size up before 6"
5.0,"My son loves it! It's well done, works good, totally recommend"
5.0,I wish more colors were offered. Crazy that half sizes are so much cheaper! But… instantly comfortable!!
5.0,I love the style of this toiletry bag especially that it lays flat in my carry-on.  The separate compartments really keep things organized and safe from spills. Great for travel size products not full size.
5.0,It exceeded my expectations
5.0,"Great summer hat. looks good , though i wish we could hide the know tightening thing. Especially if you wear it backwards.<br />I bought this on Amazon for $33. Do not pay more for it !!"
5.0,Great for working out. Be sure you order two to three sizes up. It will be too tight if you don’t.
5.0,"I received this yesterday! I love it!! Quality is superb, unlike the other review, the color on Amazon has it as a dark charcoal gray, but am beyond happy that it’s more gray( in the first picture is natural sunlight) ( second picture is in regular indoor light) sorry about my clothes lol, second picture shows strap at full length, third picture shows it at shortest length!! Straps are very well sturdy, and the sewing of purse is immaculate, couldn’t ask for a better made purse for 14.39$!!!! The structure is great and will hold alot!!! Two pockets at both sides of purse, one on back, two on front, inside the usual one on backside and two in front for lipstick, keys, or whatever<br />10/16/2020<br />Everytime I have gone out I have used the purse, the straps are still in tact, and it’s the perfect size for all my stuff!<br />Update<br />11/01/2020<br />Still in perfect condition!!"
5.0,"I love these chains. I have one in silver, one in gold and one in Rose. I highly recommend them."
5.0,"These were  a gift for my sister for Christmas, because she has chickens and she has to wear small studs for work. She loves them. They are vary small, only a few millimeters wide and tall, exactly as described. The chicken pattern is quite clear and vary cute. They seam to be well made, and appear to be solid/ continuous pieces of silver."
5.0,"I love this idea as a gift for someone far away, just to remind them you care!"
5.0,"Perfect for our kids- they are less likely to lose them as compared to other face masks, stays up well even on our 3 year olds face. They love the design and look forward to wearing them"
5.0,As described. My son loves them
5.0,I'm short (4'11) and 6 months preggo and this dress is flattering to my growing figure and comfortable
5.0,"These are, without doubt, the thinnest, smoothest, softest socks I have ever encountered. My daughter wears them for ""best"" as they are much too delicate for every day and/or play, but she absolutely loves them. She wears a 9/9.5 in Womens shoes, and they fit her perfectly. If you're looking for a thick or robust sock, you probably shouldn't order these, but for light, ""best"" wear, you can't go wrong."
5.0,Nice color options. I have a grandchild who is touch hypersensitive. She will happily wear this fabric!! I would love more styles and patterns! Thank you!
5.0,Good looking men's hankies
5.0,Very pretty dress!  Soft fabric and fit great.  I may order one in solid black!
5.0,These are great for my four year old. He enjoys wearing them. They are durable and fit well with a little room to grow. Highly recommend.
5.0,Beautiful Christmas gift
5.0,"Just as pictured ! It’s beautiful! But caution, I got caught in the rain and it got a little wet was showing rust the very next day."
5.0,"It is light and comfortable.  Maybe there are stronger magnets out there, but I have not had any problems whatsoever with it coming apart or disconnecting.  Also, it is a beautiful unique watch band."
5.0,A after this i order every pair I love them
5.0,"Love these pin backs for my daughters collectible Disney and Universal pins, among others. I was frustrated by the price of most others - these are a tremendous value. Have them book-marked for future buy agains. Just hope they keep their price where it is at!!"
5.0,I love the color and the material is very stretchable
5.0,good choice
5.0,Love this ring! I wear it when on vacation when I don’t want to wear my 3kt diamond.
5.0,Great costume!! Glow is amazing!! Unfortunately my son ripped the wires out within 30 mins of our party😭
5.0,Feel super cute in these
5.0,"Fits well, very cute"
5.0,This dress is adorable! The colors are so pretty! Fits a little snug in the chest area but not an issue! Very flattering!
5.0,Bought these as a gift for a family member. She loves them!
5.0,"Extremely cute dress. made of a stretchy material. great quality. I wear a women's six or a petite 8. Im 5' 4&#34; and 160lb. I ordered the medium and it looks fabulous. I have bigger arms so I often will have snug fitting sleeves and this dress was no exception. If I size up to a large it would probably have been big but the sleeves would fit. If you tend be in between sizes and want a tighter fit, go down. If you prefer looser, size up."
5.0,"Got these to wear to work (it's a casual workplace but I like to dress business casual), they're sooo comfortable and stylish. I paired with a white sweater or a plain black shirt and it's one of my favorite outfits! Very soft, could also wear as pajama pants lol."
5.0,I love these! So great for the price.  They are cute and stylish while providing full coverage from the sun.  It doesn't peek in from the sides because they fit like a sports wrap style of sunglass.
5.0,"excellent product, highly recommended"
5.0,"I absolutely love, love, LOVE this Snap.  It's different, lovely, and just so eye-catching.  I get many compliments on it.  So pleased with this Snap, and seller!"
5.0,"High quality, unique design. Amazing!"
5.0,Very comfy and fits well! I love the pockets on them too! Great buy!
5.0,"My husband got these for his Harry Potter costume. Quality is superb and they even come with a little drawstring bag to keep them in. The small would have probably been more appropriate of a size, but they still served their purpose!"
5.0,This was priceless
5.0,I bought these for my one year old (size 4) and they fit perfectly and are the ONLY baby shoe that bends so he can actually walk! The other ones are usually so stiff but these form to his foot shape. I really love them and will probably buy another pair when he grows out of these!
5.0,&#34;Very pretty and soft scarves. Will be a wonderful gift for my family members. Colors were a bit different than pictured but are good anyway.&#34;
5.0,"One of my favorite bags ever! Honestly! And I paid full price, so that is my truthful opinion. I absolutely love it, the shape, silver hardware, many pockets that all zip, the feel - very soft, pliable not stiff. Yes, the first few days it smelt of pleather, rubber, oil.... But, I stuck it out and aired it out. Probably 2-3 days tops. Worth it, it gets more “broken in” every day.<br />As I said, this is a COMPLETELY honest and sincere review and no discounts were given. As a Prime junkie, I put a lot of time and faith in the MANY reviews that others write, good, bad or indifferent..."
5.0,Beautiful tshirts and very nice material.
5.0,Love this dress. Very flattering and a high quality material!
5.0,Awesome yoga pants! Fit well and perfect for stretching. Would definitely recommend!
5.0,"These studs are higher quality than they look on the pictures. The standard of machining is high, the threads are smooth, and the earrings are clean and free from burrs. I had no trouble screwing the earrings closed.The fit is a little tight (my ear was pierced with a gun), but not uncomfortably so. They measure 7mm from one point of the hexagon to its opposite, meaning that they look smaller than they do in the pictures. If you, like me, prefer more subtle earrings over the large, gaudy earrings normally marketed to men, then you'll likely find that the size is just right."
5.0,"This band/case is terrific both for protection and for look- it has a great sporty and tactical look to it and is my weekend &#34;Go To&#34; case/band to protect my new watch from damage.  Easy to use, fits great and while it's big, it's not too big and looks great.  Nice product- highly recommend it."
5.0,Gave as a gift & she loves it!
5.0,I Love this Flower it is Great!
5.0,"Very flattering & thick, quality materials. Runs a little large. Definitely worth the money. I've recommend this company to all my family & friends. I'll use them in the future which and I'm a very picky person!"
5.0,"They fit true to size. Laces cinch up tight with one pull. Laces are a tad long, but that could be the width of my foot. May be different for others. A little different, being that they have the curved heel part, but still comfortable to walk in. Very comfortable midsole with much cushion. Not a lot of arch support, but to me that’s okay. Not sure how they’ll handle the cold, as it’s 50 degrees out today. Will have to update the review once the snow comes back. All in all, these are great for the price. Extremely comfortable and lightweight, like tennis shoes, compared to traditional cold weather boots. The only issue I have is that the left boot material is wrinkled on top, where as the right boot looks just like the description pictures. Not a major deal breaker. May be able to steam, or work,  the wrinkles out."
5.0,llegaron a tiempo  muy bonitos
5.0,I would buy this again but it’s not the chunky knit you see in the picture. It’s much thinner but very soft.
5.0,"Received yesterday. I was looking for a red watch to combine with a particular attire. I'm very pleased, it is a beautiful watch. Red color is vibrant and still elegant."
5.0,Great value for 3 items...love the zip front...
5.0,"Bought several of these because though my husband needs a belt he refuses to wear a normal one because it's not flashy enough and the buckle is annoying. SO I got him these. Easy seat belt type snap and with his favorite Pokemon, the evelutions. He LOVES them. And I LOVE not seeing his but crack any more."
5.0,"This key chain looks nice and has a good heft. The key ring is a little difficult to get key on, but it is very sturdy."
5.0,Still good
5.0,The size fit right.
5.0,"Perfect cheap sunglasses for the summer. While they may not replace my usual pair, this is a great set to keep handy for guests or when I misplace the other ones.<br /><br />The colors are so cute and vibrant. They fit comfortably on the face. The actual lens was a bit thin but that's expected."
5.0,In love
5.0,Intacta
5.0,My granddaughter LOVES this dress.
5.0,I wear my north face hoodie for work since it's chilly at my job. It is very thick and warm so it works well for me. It came very quick and I love the fact that it came packaged descent and the north face logo is perfect and authentic!  No complaints and so I highly recommend grabbing one since it was inexpensive which is great for northface !

5.0,Nice Blazer Jacket
5.0,"The waist strap is extremely comfortable and will not dig into skin.  The strap has plenty of room to shorten.  The side pockets have zippers and the fabric is strong and will take a sweat beating.  The water bottle is fun to sip from and I love how easy it is to remove from the plastic holder.  This is the best water pack I have ever used.  I wish I had this years ago.  Oddly enough, I still have Ultimate Direction's dinosaur water pack from the early 1990's - the improvements are huge.  One last thing that is very important - it lays perfect on the body and will not jiggle during movement."

5.0,Fantastic ring for the price. Arrived exactly as described.
5.0,Over the course of a year tank top shrank in size and lost elasticity. Having a good proportionate body will be helpful because your almost shirtless in this thing.  And you’ll want to look your best when some skin and abs have to show.
5.0,This helmet is extremely comfortable and fits well.  Does not move around and has nice ventilation.  I normally have a little movement in the size small but this one does not.  Bought a second one for my husband.

5.0,Holy Smokes. I have never owned a pair of electronic shooting muffs before.  These are amazing and for a great price.  I have tried a friends and new I really wanted a pair just could not justify the price and continued to use my old muffs that were not electronic.  I found I had to yell to talk to others because I could not hear them easily.  With these muffs you can hear friends speaking just like you did not have any hearing protection on at all.  As soon as I pull the trigger the muffs microphones turn off and silence the loud noises over 85db.  A second later the microphones are back on and I can hear everything again.
5.0,"I had never seen a no show athletic sock with a heel tab and it hit me like a ton of bricks - I had to try these socks! I have often taken off my shoes and socks after an active day only to find that there was a definite red spot on the skin over my Achilles tendon that was quite uncomfortable. Most times it was one of those things that you don't notice until the damage had been done, so you just let it heal for a couple of days and go on. With these socks, that has been eliminated. What a great addition to an athletic sock! There are so many other good points too that I am really enjoying. The toe doesn't have an annoying seem for my toes to bump up against and the cushioning is wonderful on both the heel and toe. The material fits tightly around the instep so your sock stays in place as you move. The colors are pretty so when you have your shoes off, the socks still look attractive. The copper treated fabric helps to prevent bacteria and odors. This will certainly be my go to sock for an active day on the run this Summer. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."

5.0,My mom is all about LSU Football. We call this sweater her coach jacket. Provides excellent range of motion for her overt and exaggerated gestures that can only be provided by SEC football.
5.0,"The dress is absolutely gorgeous. I received soooooo many compliments. I am 4'11&#34; very voluptuous. I ordered a XL because I wanted to be safe. I could have gotten the L for a slimmer fit  but because I wore this to work, the XL works fine. The quality of the dress is good. This is a great buy."

5.0,Great covering doesn’t take away the beauty of the luggage
5.0,"This is such a comfy, cute dress! It's flowy and a little short (at least on me because I'm 5'6&#34; and have a rather large bottom), so I wouldn't wear this to a professional or windy setting. The dress is soft, the straps adjust, and it works with basically any accessories."

5.0,Perfect! I absolutely love this dress! The fitting is so comfortable! Nice and stretchy so it doesn’t feel like you are sucked in! Would definitely buy another!
5.0,"This is a really nice dress for the money. I got it to wear to a St. Patrick’s day party. It’s a perfect emerald green color, made of nice fabric and isn’t  see through . It’s a very nice dress to wear to a special event or a cocktail party. Im 5’6” and 133lbs. I usually wear a size 4 dress. I ordered the medium and it fit perfectly. I actually loved the fit so much that I ordered a second dress in black."
5.0,very comfortable.  Multi use. Unique design. Love it. Fits well.
5.0,Totally worth the money
5.0,"The watch description says it is small. I have small wrists so it fits well, however, it you don’t have small wrists, you will not care for the fit. It is very pretty."
5.0,These are the perfect hight for my short legs (I’m 5’ 2”) Good compression too
5.0,I loves his wrap. It’s bright and looks great on! It’s  pretty big so you have room to tie a cute knot. Also fits a big size range. Love it!
5.0,Very comfortable and durable!
5.0,M&eacute;dium iam 34D 1.60 cm perfect
5.0,"I am a 5 foot female that weighs approximately 115 pounds and I purchased these in a size small. I feel they fit perfectly. They are intended to be a little flowy and loose, so keep that in mind.<br /><br />I bought these because I do spin class and boxing a few times a week. As a result, I sweat like a maniac and needed something that provided a little more air flow, but also offered some coverage. I do not want to show up to these classes in just a sports bra. They are super comfortable and soft. I've washed them a few times now and they have not lost their softness and I've not noticed any shrinkage. I wash them in cold water.<br /><br />I did also try these for yoga, but you cannot tie these in a knot, as it is uncomfortable when lying on your back."
5.0,"Nice look, feel, and fit. And I can still text without getting frost bite!"
5.0,"This was scheduled to arrive October 3rd.  I contacted the seller and asked for expedited shipping due to needing it for a wedding on Sept 17th.  They shipped promptly and it arrived 4 weeks prior to scheduled arrival date.  Additionally, the dress is very good quality.  Nice thick material and the fit is perfect!"
5.0,"These are exactly what I wanted, They fit nicely and are the perfect little undershirts."
5.0,We love this mask. Very cute
5.0,This purse is so beautiful and great quality.
5.0,Purchased as a gift.  Recipient loved them so much she purchased for her two sets to give as gifts
5.0,"As I noted in a review of the Asolo Quadrant, the Asolo anatomical foot bed works very well for my feet.  The heels are a bit narrow and the toeboxes are nice and roomy.  The anatomical footbed seems to cradle the foot in such a way that extra cushioning is unnecessary. My only issue with the Restons is that I normally double tie boot laces and these are too short to do so.  I have ordered longer laces from the Asolo website as a result. I have four different Asolo styles and am definitely a fan."
5.0,Definitely great for a home HIIT or strength training session. Love!
5.0,If you’re trying not to catch or spread  any germs this is not the mask. It’s just optics!
5.0,"Courteous seller, Unbelievably fast shipping, Nice fit, Terrific experience!!"
5.0,I love this headband! I love the fabric it's so lightweight and stretchy!
5.0,Love this product. It works perfect on the new Alta Fitbit. Helps keep it secure on your wrist.
5.0,"Pretty nice, def. shows every lump and bump though, and I wish I got a larger size. I got Medium based on other reviews- I am 5'6&#34;, 160 lbs and 38&#34; D bust. Should have gone large. Product is as shown though, bright colors, fabric is nice."
5.0,"Every time I wear this, I get compliments."
5.0,"Can't say how long the boots or socks are comfortable. So far the longest wearings are for dog walks and it hasn't been cold enough for the liners yet. Thanks El Nino! As far as arch support, it's not a lot, but more than any other wellies I've had."
5.0,Just what I wanted for my niece.
5.0,"Very impressed with the strength and overall quality of this bag. Plan on ordering more and would definitely recommend. Excellent price, excellent quality, and excellent customer service and attention to detail."

5.0,"Great quality I will definitely buy again, Looks Great !!"
5.0,Quality was great and prayer shawl is very treasured.
5.0,I love this bag! It is soft and beautiful and it is the perfect size. It does have a slight smell but nothing overwhelming and it did wear off quickly.
5.0,It has arrived very quiclkly
5.0,Wish I could make it shorter but we love ours
5.0,This is the perfect fit for me. The color and fabric are great.
5.0,"I was looking for a few casual, everyday dresses and this was one of them. The fabric is really great, although it does wrinkle easier than expected. But the fit and style is ideal for a full figured 5'3 woman like myself. This could work as a semi-formal or casual occasion."
5.0,Really cute for my Wedding Party favor line.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:5e322d5fcc99b85776c3b3e3575dce51]] I bought this two-pack of Fozono sunglasses because I got a contact lens prescription - my only other sunglasses were prescription, so now I needed a no-prescription pair.<br /><br />My favorite glasses that I've had forever are a pair of Wayfarers (me and Bob Dylan) so I liked the look of these. They have a very similar look, and I'd say the major difference is they are a lot lighter, less weight on your ears.<br /><br />The package includes a few extras, a carrying pouch, a micro-fiber cloth for keeping them clean, and a teeny-tiny screwdriver suitable for tightening the screws on these and any other glasses - very handy to have.<br /><br />It also includes a funny little card you can use to verify that the lenses are polarized.<br /><br />These glasses have a super-low price, I love the way they look, and I am glad I picked them. I'd give them five stars even without the screwdriver!"
5.0,liked it so much I brought two gave the other one to a friend
5.0,"I liked it, as described and expected"
5.0,"[[ASIN:B01FQOKC8E Cat Eye Jewels Virgo Zodiac Sign Constellation Horoscope Charm Red Garnet Birthstone 12mm Bead Stretch Bracelet(GH006)]] Absolutely love this bracelet!  The garnet beads and Virgo charm along with the Cat Eye Jewels medallion makes this bracelet look  stylish, and classy.  It is well made and stretchy so no problem with the fit and I have a small wrist, but it fits comfortably.  It comes in a gift box that gives the impression that you paid a lot of money for it. I'm keeping this one but will be ordering more for my female relatives. I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.  I give this bracelet 5 + stars because it deserves the rating."
5.0,"I bought these as a cotton option for my 501st stormtrooper. It's nicer to wear these rather than the accurate rubber gloves. I typically wear Large sized gloves due to my length of hands/fingers, not width. I'm average build, 5'11 175 and these fit great but there is no extra room, if you have shorter stubby fingers and very wide hands, these might be tight. They extend halfway up my forearm which works perfect for me. In fact at my last troop, I actually wore these underneath my black rubber chemical gloves - that was a snug fit, but I got them on and it made wearing the rubber gloves for 4 hours totally manageable. These were definitely wet with sweat when i removed them, but I just threw them in the wash and they're great again without shrinking.<br /><br />I wouldn't get these for cold weather, they're thin. They'd be fine if you just want something to go with your long-sleeve shirt, but I think these would be terrible in rain/snow or even a crisp wind. They're more for looks than warmth."
5.0,I bought about 5 items from this seller and they all arrived shortly in GREAT quality. I got 3 of these as gifts for my sisters and the words seem to be burned into the metal with a lazer. It looks really cute. One package shipped all my items together. I suggest looking at their shop to see if there is anything else you like.

5.0,These chapstick holders are amazing and quality wise they are perfect. Our customers love them.
5.0,Love this set!! Super cute and didn’t shrink when I washed it!! Fits perfectly
5.0,"I love the fit of this top however, the color is for sure NEON! It is a wild Orange Neon Color. if Neon and orange is your color you will completely rock this top.  It is true to size and even fits good under the arms . I always worry about shirts that are shaped this way but this fits very nicely and doesn't cling to the belly area. You can't see through it so if you choose to wear a cami like I do, its because that's what you like and not what you have to do."
5.0,"These are great, fit close to my face, keeps sun and glare from entering the side of my eyes , dark enough to keep me from squinting!!"
5.0,"I’m very happy with my purchase!<br />This sweater is really cute and comfy, it’s like a waffle knit but super soft and not see through at all.<br />I usually wear a small but this time I got a medium to have an oversize kind of look and what else to say I love it, it’s perfect!"

5.0,We love Turtle Fur! This is the second time ordering neck gators.  We go skiing every season and it is nice to have soft fleece next to your cheeks when you skin gets cold and dry.  We own lots of gators and by far Turtle Fur is the softest of all.  It washes great and stays soft.  The only reason I have to order more is because my 6 yr old loses them. Great quality my daughter has used the same one for 3 years and it still is so soft.

5.0,VERY GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.  LOOKS GOOD AND FITS WELL. I AM GOING TO ORDER MORE.<br />Good for price.
5.0,"When I first opened it I thought, its not so soft. After washing on normal and drying, it is MUCH softer. Was a little large but it’s a wearable blanket so I can’t really complain since it adds to coziness. Would recommend this product!"
5.0,These look terrific and the price is unbeatable. I wear them over my cowgirl boots and I get lots of compliments. They are very warm and cozy too.

5.0,"This is an awesome everyday bra.  Super comfortable and fits and wears exactly as pictured.<br />Until I got this one, Wacoal and Elomi were my favorite brands, but this one offers fine support for everday, has a smooth look under t-shirts and is super comfortable.  With a DDD cup, I appreciate the comfortable straps that do not dig into my shoulders."
5.0,Did not irritate my skin or fog up my glasses. Has an adjustment to fit properly. Nice mask.

5.0,"Fits ok, material isn’t awesome but it works"
5.0,Very good passport wallet. One problem…This passport while it held my end and then if Acacian passport and credit cards and money. Is very well-made and comfortable to carry around.  It is very thin and fit nicely in your hand or pocket. The only problem I had with it is that I use tile location devices to keep track of my wallet. And the construction of the wallet and blocked the reception of the tile device.  Let me know if this review was helpful at all.
5.0,My friend loved it.. very impressed.  She loves star wars..
5.0,"I bought this bathrobe for wearing in the communal bathrooms of my college dorm. It's more of a beach towel texture than a plush texture, but it absorbed well to towel dry. As a 5'1"" person the small fit me well. The neckline has a little loop where you can hook it to the shower door, which is great. And the color was dark enough that looked more nondescript in the dorm setting."
5.0,I'm very happy with this band.  The color and leather are exactly as pictured and it fits perfectly.  Very easy to install.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for another band. I put it on my watch and haven't changed for any other band since I got it.
5.0,I bought this for my God daughter. Her mom said that the quality of this snowsuit is the best. It keeps the little girl warm during winter without sweating and it doesn't get damaged during washing cycle.
5.0,"This is a great set of sweatbands, absorbant and attractive. Great value!"
5.0,"Oh my word, I love, love, love these flip flops.  My daughter in law had them and they were so cute and comfy I bought a pair.  Loved them so much I bought another color. Loved those so much I bought them for my granddaughter.<br />When I finish playing 4 hrs of Pickleball I put these on before I leave the courts. Have gotten many compliments and other gals have bought them too!<br />I have plantar fasciitis and Morton’s neuroma. Both these cause terrible foot pain. If you struggle with foot pain of any kind or just want comfortable well made flip flops  don’t hesitate to buy."
5.0,Good product.  Looks good and fits true to size.
5.0,"If you want a light jacket, choose it!"
5.0,Perfect addition to my Halloween Prince costume!!
5.0,"I got this to wear to a friend's party, and I wanted pink and fluffy. I certainly got pink and fluffy. It's longer than most dancing tutus but as a fun party skirt it's perfect. The netting is soft to wear and the effect is fun and feminine."
5.0,Soooo adorable. It is a bit big for my little sister but she is still small so it is understandable. If the buttons can be clip on or the ones that snap would be cool.
5.0,"Amazing! Love peacocks and this are an eye catcher! Love the blue color and everyone compliments on them! They are not as bright as I would like, but the color makes them more aged classy. They are very comfortable and lightweight. Awesome product with an awesome price!"
5.0,"I love the way it's crafted and the size was perfect, did have to remove any links!"
5.0,Great purchase overall but need better backs on earings. Already lost one 🙁
5.0,Great item my mom loved it!
5.0,"Just as good as my $200 glasses. Just above center on the lens I can read a 1440 screen at 27""; just below center a key board at about 12""; fine type in a magazine at the bottom of the lens at about 12"". It would be nice if they came in a slightly less heavy frames & in several colors for my wife."
5.0,"Ordered the black Plus size.  It has a front flap closure for phone. It also has a metal zipper area with three compartments.  The center one has a zipper for personal or smaller items , one has 12 slots for credit cards, driver license (and gift cards which I forget to use because they are not with my credit cards when I go to pay). This compartment also has two areas for your money or receipts. The last compartment is very good size also.  It comes with a removable wristlet strap and crossover strap for however you prefer to use. It appears very well constructed. I actually purchased to save to take on vacation but have started using it already."
5.0,I love these tops so much I bought three in different colors.
5.0,Fits great and is super cute! No stretch so keep that in mind when sizing. I tend to wear a size 3 in bottoms and the small fit great!
5.0,"I would buy again!<br />I have a tiny baby so I went with my gut to get the smaller size, and I’m glad I did. It’s perfect for what I was looking for! Can’t beat the price."
5.0,great cleaner
5.0,"Even with my fake nails, installing my new nosering only took about 3 seconds. It doesn’t pinch where the (nearly invisible) hinge/clasp is. It’s closure is a snug fit so it doesn’t come open. I will be buying more for my friends!"
5.0,Easu buy....
5.0,Will be purchasing more for sure!
5.0,"Great lightweight cardigan, very casual. Ordered another in black."
5.0,makes running less painful
5.0,I bought this for a wedding that had a 20's theme. It worked great and was a hit.
5.0,Love this tanking top!  My 36D’s were accommodated nicely.  The bottoms were teeny but I have others to wear with the top.
5.0,He uses to work out and loves them.
5.0,I haven't worn these slacks yet but when I tried them on they were just as I expected and liked the fit.
5.0,My wife loves the watch. The band was too large so instructions on how to remove links would have been helpful. I discovered by accident that the pins holding the links together were like cotter pins and not spring-loaded.
5.0,So I got this in like burgundy and black .. I love the black one it fits perfectly but the burgundy one is tiny lol both the same brand and style not sure why the sizing is so different .. I took the tags off so I can’t return it .. but the black I highly recommend
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:338c1e0b8ddb5c172269a64d767a0a33]] These are extremely fun! I purchased these for some summer fun with my kids and as soon as they arrived we were dancing in the dark. Many different color changing selections to go through, very hypnotizing. We've never owned a pair of rave gloves so I can't compare to any other but I can say I don't think we need to shop around. These fit a bit snug on my swollen hands because of the wiring that is inside each finger but as for normal (non swollen) hands they fit perfectly. There is a small button on the very top hidden inside the glove where you can push and change to whatever color group your interested in. The colors do not dim,always stay very bright and never did any wires show or come through. I would definitely purchase more for the rest of the family.<br />I purchased this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion. My opinion is 100% honest and unbiased after testing and using the product for this review."
5.0,Good quality but runs extremely small.
5.0,Beautiful! My mom love them

5.0,These are SO cute! Love them so much and the company was super awesome when I messaged them. Love love love
5.0,"Perfect fit, very comfortable and cool in hot conditions. I'm 6'2&#34; 190lbs and the large is perfect. Stretchy enough for rigorous exercise without chafing."
5.0,"Love the shirt, looks great and fits great too.<br />Warm though, like a thin sweater.  Should be great this winter."
5.0,Very cute addition to Halloween costume.
5.0,"Absolutely love these. Super comfortable. Per reviews, I ordered a size up and they fit perfectly. I only wish they offered them in solid colors as well. If so, I would be buying a bunch more"
5.0,I love the Greek key
5.0,"I love this little black dress. Comfortable, suitable for any occasion. I am small, 93lbs. and the size small dress fit me perfectly. I like the material. I love the price."
5.0,My little cousin loved these. She's 9 and they fit her great.
5.0,It's a beautiful purse. Love the color!
5.0,It fits perfectly and has a look that draws compliments. The material feels comfortable on the skin and the unique collar helps the circulation of air when the mercury rises.
5.0,"Here comes summer, me and my husband loves to take the kids to the beach.  Aside from making sure we are not too out of shape and embarrassed ourselves outside, I tend to get a new set of bath suit every year. This year I got the a black bikini swimsuit from Upopby.  It is a bikini, but love the subtleness of revealing.  With the padded bra it defines the area and also acts as a push up.  It makes my chest bigger and more defined than it actually is.  The neckline is unique with 2 straps that hugs around.  It makes my curve even more defined. Granted it is open in the middle of the bathing suit but the is very tight and so that I don’t have to be worry about being exposed to any big movement in the front.  But sometimes with the movement the inner white lining does review itself around the lower portion of the top.The back hook is a bit too easy to put on and take off, so I do get a bit worry.  The bottom piece is not too revealing but has it’s sexiness on the side.<br /> I was chosen to review this product at a discount  in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
5.0,"Good quality, great fit!"
5.0,"Beautiful,  shiny, lightweight. Clear bright blue topaz. Nice quality earrings."
5.0,OMG.... This shirt is EXACTLY as described which you don't see very often. It's a true to size got. I live love it so much I went back in the site to get the same one but different colors.
5.0,"It just looks like that in picture. :) Fabric is soft and it perfectly fits my size (5'6""/135lb).  it's also very comfortable and the prints are so cute. :)"
5.0,"This basket is almost exactly as expected.  The size is perfect for the number of chickens I have.  The only thing I expected different was the color, but hopefully mine will look like the one in the pictures in time and with use.  And it’s made in the USA! It’s perfect! Thank you!"
5.0,It's looks expensive and feels like great quality
5.0,"Awesome watch, I like it very much. Exactly was I was looking for, a watch that I can use daily."
5.0,These are perfect with heels and low-cut flats!  The little jelly piece that sits on the heel of the sock really does it's job to keep it in place.  Will buy more!
5.0,"Purchased this for an average size 2 year old. Only size available was a 4T, it fit her like a glove, glad it didn't come smaller because it would not have fit. Love cute elbow patches on sleeves."
5.0,I had to hem this about an inch but all is good
5.0,My wife and I both love wool slippers and these she really liked. They fit well and are warm and so comfortable. We really like this brand. We have had many pairs in the past few years.
5.0,"Great seamless leggings for the price! I bought these and the vital seamless leggings from gymshark this week to compare! I love both, but these are so cheap so I say go for it! The crotch is a little strange and can cause a camel toe but I was just conscious of it and didn’t have an issue."
5.0,"Didn’t even know these existed! Nice and soft, not stiff cotton (like scrubs). Easy excess, which you really, really want after shoulder surgery. 5 stars"
5.0,Bought for my two daughters they loved them!!
5.0,"Love this dress, many compliments"
5.0,"I bought this shirt to do chores outside in the sun.  I need to cover my skin to avoid sunburn.  This shirt did the job.  I needed a shirt very light and smooth because of a large recent surgical scar.  Other shirts rub on the scar, which is quite tender.  This shirt is much better.  It is very light weight and smooth fabric.  I wash it cold and dry it on a hanger.  It dries very quickly.  I like this shirt very much."
5.0,This is very comfortable. I highly recommend it.
5.0,Perfect fit. As advertised. Color very accurate. Would recommend as a casual option for weekend or weekday wear as a upscale version of cargo pants.  Will be ordering another pair.
5.0,This was my dream wedding dress. As a plus sized bride it can be really difficult to find a wedding dress in general not to mention one you love but this one was great!
5.0,Bought this for a friend he really liked it Good detail and quality for the price
5.0,Perfect fit!  Comfortable; just the right thickness.

5.0,beautiful dress love the color and style
5.0,"Very nice keychain. I've been buying TROIKA for several years now, as they are pretty, well made and last a long time."
5.0,"looks like the $150 pairs i used to buy.<br />plus, it'll hurt a lot less when i lose/break this pair."
5.0,"bought them to be a gift for 2 special women in my life.. These bracelets are super gorgeous! You can barely tell that they are not ""real""."
5.0,I'm a flight attendant & these are wonderful at helping make space and keeping everything organized.
5.0,"I ordered x-small, I am only 5'2&#34; 112 lbs, but I do have curves around the hip area. This fit snug (but not to snug) in all the right places.  It hit slightly lower (below the knee) than the model in the picture, but it works!  Very comfortable quality material not to slinky where you can see every imperfection either.  I've ordered several shirts from PattyBoutik, and I can hardly wait till my next dress arrives!"
5.0,I LOVE this bag!!! A conversation starter everywhereI go.
5.0,My husband loved the gift our children picked out for him. Best gift ever!
5.0,"Thin material but fit great, was very pleased with the knee socks. Also I had no slipping issues as a thicker girl sometimes thigh/knee socks and or stockings fall off or roll down these didn't."
5.0,Great fit! Love it
5.0,Came a little sharp at the bottom sides where it goes behind the ears can use a file to smooth out
5.0,"If you have been looking for comfortable leggings that look like professional pants, these are the one! I only wear leggings at work for comfort but wanted pant like leggings. I was hesitant because I usually get leggings for $10-15 a pair but I decided to spend more to get these. I normally wear a size small but XS fits better. I bought a second pair after trying out the first one."
5.0,Great for pool and beach
5.0,"It was a present for daughter, she loves it & says it fit well for the size I ordered."
5.0,This is a great sports bra for high impact sports such as running. It provides a high level of support while maintaining shape and doesn't flatten you out. It is amazing quality and is probably made better than some of my more expensive name brand sports bras. Definitely will be buying more.
5.0,Love it. Just as the picture showed
5.0,"It looks great, my husband like it"
5.0,Love them! The pattern is flattering for any figure. For reference I am 160 lbs and I'm 5 feet tall...I bought a medium...

5.0,This key 'spider' is exactly what I hoped it would be. The quality is good and the chain is just long enough.
5.0,Make a great addition to my frog jewelry collection.
5.0,Slip on is just a little loose.  Seems wider than most.
5.0,This is absolutely Beautiful and very delicate. And the fact that it was a gift for a 14-year-old girl really made the beauty and delicate attributes more appealing!  All in all this was a great gift!
5.0,"My cute jet ring is durable, stylish and I’ve had it now for several years and it looks just as good as the first day.  The crystals are shiny and still in place."
5.0,For the Wonderful Necklaces You Bring!<br />(yes I hate myself...)

5.0,All men's accessories should have some tacticool connection
5.0,"Nothing I didn't like - you can't buy turkey lacers in the stores in southern VA - so I had to order them - and then because of covid, we didn't have our gathering, and I didn't do a whole turkey - but I have them for the next time!"
5.0,Great items.
5.0,Fun - great wallet!
5.0,My niece loved these earrings!
5.0,"Cute dress. First off, it got to my house within a week! I was afraid it would take a whole month from China. Sleeves are kind of tight, my advice is to order a size up because of sleeve tightness. I am a size medium and I based on reviews I ordered up a size. I'm glad I did! Otherwise the sleeves would have been super tight."
5.0,"Cheap, waterproof, thin. As advertised. Strap will definitely break in the future; replace it with a better one."
5.0,they are lovelier than pictured
5.0,"Great Heavy Duty Cap, fits great with Velcro closer."
5.0,"I absolutely love this ring, EXCEPT  for the heartbeat has already started to come off and I've only worn the ring 2 separate times."
5.0,Very well made. Durable & sturdy sterling for charm bracelets. Love it!
5.0,"Stunning!!!!! Look like real diamonds and even shinier! See my pic attached! On the left side, it is my engagement ring (real diamond!). On the right side, it is this earring! They are definitely beautiful!"
5.0,"Glasses are sturdy and well built, and attractive. I have no idea how to measure the ""blue blocking"" so am trusting the manufacturer to be ethical."
5.0,Love this skirt… works perfectly for my daughters uniform and it shipped faster than direct from Lands End.
5.0,"Love the detailing on this top as it twists in front for a more flattering look - especially while wearing high waist leggings. This fits, feels , looks great on!"

5.0,It makes me smile
5.0,First of many Angry Bee 1320 items!!! Go Dodge
5.0,I love them and wear them daily. Good coverage to protect from the sun's rays.
5.0,"very nice for the price! i wear them all the time, they come with a sturdy case."
5.0,Really cute sneakers. They fit a tad small. I’m a size 9.5 so I ordered a size 10 and it’s a bit tight around my big toe but not too bad.
5.0,"Definitely runs small. But luckily I read reviews and sized up to an XL and it's so amazing (mentally trips me out that I'm an xl though lol) I'm 35in around for reference, could have gotten a large but it would have had to stretch to fit. The XL is perfect and so soft and wont roll up.<br /><br />Also the cups make my boobs look bigger but they probably arent big enough to cover anyone over a B"
5.0,Finally a company that sends good quality durags!
5.0,I love these black bamboo socks ! They are super soft and look pretty dressy . They are kinda thin since they are like dress socks . I would not wear them to keep warm .
5.0,"This is what as use as my wallet, it is amazing, I love the magnetic coin center area, plus everything is in sight as you unzip it... the quality is superb! Soft, yet strong."

5.0,I will be ordering more for sure.
5.0,They keep my arms from being scratched when working in the garden
5.0,"First of all, I'd like to applaud an independent seller on Amazon for having a better mask design tool than Vistaprint. These masks are comfortable, breathable, and well printed. Overall excellent purchase.<br /><br />The only thing to watch out for is that the upper and lower corners get cut with the natural fold of the mask. Make sure all important details are outside of corners, or they may be cut off. I've attached photos demonstrating this. This is mostly counteracting by spreading out the masks when drying.<br /><br />The metal atop helps shape the mask, but is very thin so sometimes it can be a little loose. It is very comfortable and has extra space on the ear string though. It stays on my face very easily and I have no issues wearing it all day.<br /><br />About to order more. Highly recommended!"
5.0,"Ordered these for a wedding party. Reviews said they were small, I don’t agree! They are perfect for adults!"
5.0,"Very cute, comfy, and as described."
5.0,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it.  The touch of turquoise makes it just a little different and looks very classy.  A fun and pretty bracelet.

5.0,Wonderful Comfortable Love Love Love it! Soft and luxurious feel. Wears like a dream. Got lots of compliments. What more can say!  You will love it too! Looking Good...Feeling Good!
5.0,"Super cute, with just a little diamond detail. It doesn't pinch my toes like other rings, and so far there's been no warping of the metal, or discoloration at all."
5.0,Super comfy. Cork foot bed & print on flip flops gives them a stylish look that will compliment many different outfits from maxi dresses to shorts or yoga pants. Love these!
5.0,Great Use Great Quality
5.0,I love this dress! Lace is of very good quality. This dress would compliment most body shapes and is definitely worth the price! Bought it for my daughters wedding in October on a beach! Will post picture later.
5.0,So perfect!
5.0,"I'm tired of boring ties, but I also don't want a tie that is in bad taste (at least not for everyday wear.) This is a good looking tie, it makes a nice knot. and it doesn't wrinkle easily."
5.0,Fits amazingly
5.0,It was exactly what I was looking for.  Easy to replace.
5.0,"I was surprised at tge great quality of this Hoodia! The colors were vibrant, the shipping was quick, and the price was right.... the size was also, fairly, accurate. A little hard for me to gage as my 11 year old son is in between sizes right now. I would recommend ordering a size up!"
5.0,Fit as expected. Tight fitting which is what I was wanting. Length is perfect. I’m 5’2” and 150lbs and a size medium was perfect.
5.0,This is the easiest thing ever for my child starting Kindergarten this year. She doesn’t have to worry about a belt buckle. Just pull the Velcro to undo it and Velcro it back!
5.0,I love it I'm short and round but look so hot and feel amazing in this! I'm 4'11 and 220 and got a size 2xl and I can't believe how amazing I look!!
5.0,"I have several tops from this company and have been very happy with all of them. This tunic top is no exception - it fits very well and true to size, it's well made, the fabric is soft and comfortable, and it's very pretty.<br /><br />This is a loose shirt that's very comfortable and lightweight. It's long enough to wear with leggings and looks great with jeans, too. Craftsmanship is excellent and the fabric is of very good quality, which I've always found with this company.<br /><br />This tunic top is very flattering and drapes just right along its pleats. You could dress this up or down and wear it just about anywhere.<br /><br />Excellent product, I've had such good luck with this company and this top is no exception. The top is well made, fabric is excellent and very soft, and the fit is true to size and flattering. Great with jeans or leggings. Good for work, casual wear, or leisure."

5.0,These are so cute.  Lightweight made well. They look great. May get a second pair just to have another in case.  Love them. 💕
5.0,Alittle to small around the bust and will need ironing
5.0,Love that I can match bands to my outfits. Very comfortable.  I’ll be interested to see how well they hold up after several uses but so far they seem fine.
5.0,I could have 25 pairs and would still appreciate them!
5.0,I bought my first apple watch and wanted another loop band. This is perfect.
5.0,"Fits great, made to last..get you one now"
5.0,Color and how it fits and looks amazing!!!

5.0,These are great and pretty leggings!
5.0,lovely and super comfortable bag
5.0,Item is great quality just like the picture the only thing is it runs a bit big. I would size down. 140lbs 5’1 I ordered a size Medium and wished I ordered a size small.
5.0,I bought these for my husband and I wasn't sure if you'd like them or not. He absolutely loves them and wants him to the gym almost every day!
5.0,Kids loved them
5.0,Perfect fit and so girly!!
5.0,Fantastic. Light weight. Easy to put on and workout in.
5.0,Love this bag. It looks and feels great. Nice size. Needs to air out when you first get it. It has a bad smell.
5.0,The mask is durable. Its been washed countless times and is still in perfect condition. I like that I can add a filter to it. My son was so excited to wear these he loves the designs :)
5.0,Everyone stop to tell me how realistic it looked and take my picture.
5.0,"The top does not adjust so it does not hold up the girls like I typically like, especially after the suit gets wet."
5.0,This is a great hat! The quality is amazing!
5.0,Worked well with my spider-web dress I purchased.
5.0,This outfit is too cute! Just received it and tried it on. The top is perfect. I do not have a butt so it’s a little loose in the back. I could of definitely order a smaller size (large) and been ok but I didn’t want to take that risk of having to send it back. I’m a seamstress so I will make the adjustments.
5.0,These thing work really good for the low price. Good quality
5.0,"Love these earrings! They r very pretty, the stone shows on both sides, they’re not too big or too small.. nice size, they’re nice in weight.. not too light to appear cheap n not  too heavy to bother my ears! Very nice! I will order more.. already have them picked out! 😉"
5.0,"I bought this because I needed a dress to wear to a wedding and hoped to flatter/hide my pear shaped figure. I also have quite a tummy, so I thought the built-in “waist band” and belt, A-line shape, and material would assist with that. It really did! The skirt stays out (meaning my large butt stays relatively hidden). So, you don’t have to use a petticoat unless you are going for a more flared look. I’ve never had a large bust (it’s a 40B now), so the top is just a tiny bit loose. I don’t know how it wears or washes and can update afterwards."
5.0,"I instantly fell in love with this dress upon receiving it! The fabric is excellent, thick, cotton-ish feel but stretchy. The buttons are securely fastened. There is nice black piping around the neckline. It fits PERFECTLY and is very flattering. I could not be happier with this!"
5.0,"Just absolutely stunning ,looks as described,high quality,and frankly one if my favorite jewelry pieces,a must have for all you butterfly lovers out their such as myself,."
5.0,Love this watch. It has a thin rich look to it. Like the face. Rasy to read. I definately recommend it.
5.0,Cute top and gorgeous mustard yellow color
5.0,GREAT we used these this summer when we took our son to Warped Tour. He Slept pretty much the whole day (he was 4 months old at the time)
5.0,Love this vest. Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,"Great quality!  They’re a decent weight, not thin.  I’ve washed them and they held up well although I did air dry them.  I bought them for my 10 yo daughter to wear for a spirit day at school.  Obviously since these are adult socks the footbed was a little long on her and they went up to her mid shin.  I’d buy them again."
5.0,"Large quantity for the price.  I wear them daily at about 15 of them at once. These will last for over a year. I wear them until they fall off my wrist. I mix them with my other bracelets. They do have a strong odor, perhaps from the silicone material. As time goes on, its fading."
5.0,"Great band, easy to swap out!!"
5.0,was easy for my daughter to manage and fit comfortably behind her ears.
5.0,These are really neat socks. We have washed them a dozen times in the last month because my daughter wants them as soon as they come out of the dryer. They just make her feel like a part of the story she loves. They have held up well over the month of constant wear/ washing.<br />They fit me at knee length. My daughter is 9 and they are over knee for her.
5.0,I love this necklace... what a perfect piece. ...beautiful...yet simple ... a touch of elegance.
5.0,"product as described, very good comfortable fit."
5.0,"Most comfortable top around.<br />I have ordered several colors, wish there some patterns and more colors available also.<br />Perfect for layering.<br />Not too thick and not too thin."
5.0,"For the money, great shirt.  I will buy more in different colors.  I live in FL and play tennis.  I've started wearing long sleeve shirts this summer for sun protection."
5.0,Great product and great company to deal with.  Will buy again as gifts!
5.0,Sturdy. Cheap. The most popular watch on earth. Worth it just to have around as a backup.
5.0,"Loose and comfy. IT HAS POCKETS!! It's a little longer than I had hoped, and the shade is lighter than it appears in the photo. But I love it. I tied a knot in the bottom to give it a little extra umph. When I untied the knot and laundered it, there was no extra stretching of the fabric like some garments get. I highly recommend this tunic! I love mine!<br /><br />For sizing: I am 5'1&#34; tall and it hits me just above the knee. (I weigh too much, so we'll skip that measurement.) I wear a size 16s in Levi's and a size XL in Hanes t-shirts. This top stretches nicely, but still hides everything I choose to hide."
5.0,Product has nice weight to it comes with a beautiful bag not bad for its price just takes too long to get here made in China
5.0,"Bought this for my teen son. He loves it! Soft, warm, and sized perfectly. May have to get him one in another color for Christmas."
5.0,"My daughter absolutely LOVED this dress for her Daddy/Daughter dance. She looked like a little princess. My only issue now is that she wants to wear it everywhere, lol. It photographs beautifully."

5.0,Look very cute with boots!
5.0,"I wasn't sure if it would fit all of my hair in it, but it did and was still comfortable and stylish may I add."
5.0,Knit gloves with 3M Thinsulate to keep your hands warm.  My wife loves these gloves and they fit both my large hands and her small hands.  Very versatile gloves for many different folks!<br /><br />They are warm and comfortable; they do not feel scratchy.
5.0,"Loved these for the little ones Halloween costume (we wanted something that would light up and be noticeable as we roamed.) they love them, can get in/or of them on their own and say that they’re comfy (haven’t had blisters or pain spots at all.)"
5.0,"They were a little painful for me the first time trying one on. The edges of the plastic were a little rough. Now I have the hang of them, I love them. They do not hurt my gums and are soooo much easier to take out. Cute too."
5.0,I have a little head and it came down a bit far over my brow. Super warm and windproof. Wore it under riding helmet.
5.0,I even got a size smaller :) and I Luv it!!!
5.0,"Bought this in the blue and black print in XXL. Fits great, it is not too long, neckline is low but not where you need a camisole. Purchased to wear on the weekends to run errands and for casual day Friday at work.<br /><br />Will buy more if they offer new colors...purple, olive green."
5.0,"Very pretty necklace, even the chain is unusual. Thank you."
5.0,The quality is great and I love that it’s reversible !!
5.0,"Purse is sturdy, thick material."
5.0,"Great earrings, great coloring and great detail.."
5.0,My daughter absolutely loved this!!  Great gift.
5.0,A tad larger than expected but super comfortable!!!
5.0,"It seems surreal to be writing about the amount of masks that I have, but I have many and this one is great.  Love the way fits and it looks great.  Hand washing is recommended if you want to keep it through pandemic times.  I hope this too shall pass, SOON!"
5.0,Perfect just what I’m wanted highly impressed forgot to put the wood ones in the picture along with the opalite but I have them just to lazy to take a new pic
5.0,"very nice jacket.<br />had to return because it is toddler size, not GIRLS size.<br />but it is made very well."
5.0,Its fits OK but I'm sure it will stretch in water. I didn't want too big I guess I could have went to a 4 . my granddaughter be 4 in June. Its very cute nice quality.
5.0,Cool bracelt good price looks cool clasp work well
5.0,This is the same product that my doctor gave me to wear after my surgery
5.0,Beautiful ring. Looks just like the picture. Fit true to size.
5.0,Exactly as pictured and comfortable. Work great.
5.0,I love these for their whimsy.  For hand knit socks they are also easy to wear (you can't feel the knit rows when you stand in them).  They are a bit tight at the top and getting them on was a challenge.
5.0,✔️
5.0,Super cute and useful when youre on the computer
5.0,pretty bracelet.  was my mothers day present from my daughter
5.0,Bought for my active outdoor loving 3 year old who has asthma. Warms up the air so he doesn’t cough as much and it is comfortable so he keeps it on. Fits great.
5.0,"Love, love, loved this wrap. I bought 2 for Christmas gifts."
5.0,"The knee-high length is far more comfortable than shorter ones. These have a comfortable band that stays in place and a roomy toe area, not too tight so it won’t bind but also not so large it wrinkles uncomfortably when you put your shoes on. The wool “breathes” better than polyester/nylon socks. They launder like a dream<br /><br />These are true compression stockings suitable for people who spend a lot of time standing, those with poor circulation or diabetic-type neuropathy."
5.0,Perfect little black dress!
5.0,"This canvas purse is everything promised and more. The style, sturdiness, large compartments, and durability all add up to this being a favorite for me. I normally will change purses every few weeks, but honestly, I'm still carrying this one since the day it was delivered. The dark cranberry is a complimenting hue and it fits &#34;me&#34; and my choice of purses."
5.0,"Exactly what you order is what you get, it’s great"
5.0,I love the dress! It is very comfortable and cute.
5.0,nice chain is little short
5.0,"A gift for my niece, on her 10th birthday. She loves the shirt. The fabric is soft and comfortable and the color is perfect, she tells me."
5.0,The quality is really great. The one thing I am complaining is they are too tight.
5.0,These earrings are great! They're light weight and super cute for the holidays! Well worth the price for four pairs of earrings..love em'
5.0,Cute and flirty
5.0,Super nice!!!
5.0,"Much nicer than I expected for less than $5 and free shipping. These nylons are silky and slightly glossy, and feel really nice. Careful if your hands are dry though, they seem to snag kind of easy, but I haven't noticed any runs yet. You can see the model doesn't have the waist pulled all the way up. I can pull them up a little higher, but not all the way to my belly button like regular pantyhose. I normally wear medium to large and ordered these in large. I'm 5'8&#34; and 145#. They shipped from Great Britain and arrived to me in the Midwest in 2 weeks."
5.0,Love this dress...so cute and comfortable!
5.0,My Daughter loves her dress
5.0,I’m 5 foot 5 inches and this was the perfect length. It brushes the ground a just little which is what I wanted and would still fit someone taller just fine. The fabric feels nice and it has some weight to it so it will be nice and warm. The hood is roomy and overall it’s a really great cape for the price point.
5.0,"Nice material with clean edges, solid attachment for for secure credential display. The bacon and eggs look too real and everyone is trying to eat my lanyard. Shipped fast ,would recommend."
5.0,Great product! Sturdy and stylish!
5.0,Somewhat large but super cute with leggings
5.0,"Loved, great for pool or beach. Colors don't bleed or anything, was very useful this aummer"
5.0,Bello y muy delicado gracias
5.0,My son looks adorable in it.
5.0,Super super cute!
5.0,Very happy with this dress. Fit is flattering and fabric nice quality. I bought two more in other colors.
5.0,"Definitely NOT WHITE! Not even close to being WHITE or even off white! It's clearly ivory, cream, antique beige but definitely  NOT WHITE! Very disappointed. It's SUPER CUTE though! Excellent quality fabric and fits nice. Im keeping it! Definitely  recommend"
5.0,Love to show off these cuties when wearing my see through Nike zoom running shoes!
5.0,"Wish is was a little looser, but I have hips so it fit exactly how Ii expected.  Love it and the love the colors, exactly like the picture."
5.0,Rate 5<br /><br />Brought this watch for my brother he love it.
5.0,I have only had this for a week or two but it seems that it will stand up to my active work/personal life. It really feels secure and comfortable.
5.0,Love these. I wear them for spinning and my head sweats a lot! They fully keep the sweat out of my eyes and are comfortable to wear.
5.0,Bought these to wear to a week long event where I’d be standing on concrete 95% of the time. Definitely helped keep my swelling down and will buy more as they wear out.
5.0,An excellent t-shirt. Good cotton material and the image is clear and detailed.
5.0,"Comfortable, fits well, nice color."
5.0,Gotgeous
5.0,Just what I wanted. Came quickly and as described. Thanks!!
5.0,Good strong laces.  Stay tied.
5.0,"Ordered both the woman's version and the men's based on the size chart sizing was accurate has exceeded our expectations for the price can't complain , extra large fits good without extra bulk. Used twice 38° no sun head and crosswinds and stayed comfortable with cotton base layer."
5.0,The glasses are great. The glare of headlights on dark country roads is usually worse than city streets that are already lite up. These glasses are really great for bright headlights coming at you.
5.0,Very comfortable soft to sleep with. I’m a hot sleeper
5.0,"This is a good quality beret for the price. I have a very large head, and this beret fits snugly, but not too tightly. Made in China, it appears well-made, and I expect it will last a number of years. It has enough material to hang slightly to the side, if desired."
5.0,Pretty little coin holder keeping change together!
5.0,The frame is small enough for my face so it doesn't slide down and is just dark enough ro reading on the beach.
5.0,A little bit but very comfy.  If you have socks on with the slippers they fit great.
5.0,Love the generous collar....figure flatering!
5.0,"I have to say this shirt is much better than I expected it to be.  The fit is perfect -- not too tight across the shoulders/back, and sufficiently long without being too long.  I was afraid the top puffy part would be too stiff or uncomfortable, but it's not.  You can snap it all the way up if you want to, or you can snap it partway and fold the neck part down so it's a collar.  I like it folded down.  The bottom part is very soft and cozy, and the pockets are great.  I would definitely recommend this if you're looking for a casual winter top that's a little out of the ordinary."
5.0,"I received my cap on time and in good condition.  I am a frontline healthcare worker and wanted something to cover my long hair at the hospital to shield from airborne pathogens so that I do not have to wash my hair every day.  This cap is well designed and came as described.  There is attention to detail and the seams and elastic are well constructed.  The packaging was extra special and thoughtful,  I look forward to trying it next week.  Keep up the good work!"
5.0,I like these headbands. They're comfortable and do the job for a decent price. Just wish my dog didn't like to eat them. :). Ps. It'd be great if there were more blue/green/purple options that didn't also include pink or a strange print.
5.0,Souper soft and warm. The colors match pics. Perfect for cold winter days.
5.0,"These glasses are perfect. Very clear on top portion for distance (where I don't need correction), and perfect for reading and any type of close work. They are comfortable and the spring hinges make them tight enough to stay securely on without being too tight. I highly recommend."
5.0,"This is a beautiful dress! Great fit, great quality."
5.0,"I love the fit, style, material, color, and length of this dress!!!💖💖 The price is good too. I ordered a small/Red😁"
5.0,good light shoe. flexible sole and good fit.
5.0,"Fits my daughter well and gets a lot of use, but doesn't fade in wash."
5.0,Cute as ever
5.0,"Perfect peach color, not orange at all. With a crinoline underneath it's going to be perfect. A little bit of stretch for some wiggle room or food baby, you pick."
5.0,"Arrived quickly. Beautiful glasses, they look as they do in the picture. Appears to be authentic as well. Customer service was prompt in their replies to my questions prior to placing my order. I would order from them again in a heartbeat."
5.0,Me encantaron
5.0,"I expected this to be metal.  Instead, it is a heavy plastic.  Still looks nice and seems to be good quality."
5.0,"Bought this bracelet for a friends birthday gift. It's very nice. The only<br />thing that is hard to tell, the birthstone part looks like a giant crown.<br />From the pictures it looked more flat. At any rate, it was a lovely gift, and<br />my friend loved it."
5.0,"Perfect.  Purchased as a bathing suit bottom, fits perfectly."
5.0,"Bought these for my 8 yr old daughter she's rough on shoes they seem like a great product, and she LOVES the zippers."

5.0,Great product.  Easy to get through security check points.
5.0,"I don't wear this blouse too often, because each time I wear it, I receive so much attention - positive attention. If you are in the market for an attractive blouse, I recommend you purchase this one. You won't be disappointed."
5.0,I purchased these bracelets in February of 2019 not expecting them to last more than a few months. Was I wrong!  To this day they still look as perfect as the day they arrived and I wear them at least twice a week!! These bracelets are AMAZING!  I hope they have them in silver because if they do I’m buying them!!!
5.0,"Love the setup, just wish it had a key ring within one of the pockets. Other than that it’s a great bag with the Molle sections. Descent quality and for the price it’s perfect."

5.0,They don't fall off! What else do you want....
5.0,Perfect for my four year old.
5.0,"The strings were already coming off, however if you hold the ends at same length, and loosen the nut, Then re-ty all. You have to add cloth glue or my favorite E-6000 glue at the nut. It will never come out. It sure is beautiful though. And definitely worth the price, minus the work."
5.0,I got the shirt for my grandson and he love it
5.0,"Love this bathing suit! I am 5'7, 148. I purchased a size 10. ( i normally wear a size 6-8) fit great! Im actually ordering another. Lots of support for chest. Very comfortable."
5.0,They look a lot better in person. They are so shiny and cute. Will try to get other colors as well
5.0,Exelent !!!!!
5.0,Nice fabric. It's soft and strong at the same time. My only concern is that the material is so soft that it rolls itself up at the ends. This isn't a real problem. It even had a pleasant smell right out of the package.
5.0,"I was worried about the color from the reviews cause I saw some negative ones....but bought it anyway I needed it for a flamingo parade(Spanish Towne shout out). It is perfect the color was just as expected, it came on time, like new, very soft and I'm excited to be warm tomorrow in my paf hoodie!!"

5.0,This shirt is so soft
5.0,"My daughter bought this for Halloween. It is remarkably good quality. Not a typical costume dress at all. It was beautifully sewn/hemmed, fitted, has a great quality zipper, etc just like any non-costume dress you might buy. The fabric is thick and durable. The skirt is full without a hoop skirt underneath... Very impressed!"
5.0,Better than the name brands...will be getting more
5.0,"Bought this last holiday season on a lark and girl so many positive compliments on it. A great alternative to the same ol' ugly sweater thing. Was super fun to wear.<br />Is a semi-satin, but a bit stretchy material. Not super loose, so would get if large busted. Bittom flairs enough to cover larger tummy, hip area.<br />Compliments galore from men & women."
5.0,I have bought about 6 pairs of these. Given these as gifts. These are amazing.
5.0,"Love this dress, with and without a belt."
5.0,In my opinion Strideline makes the works most comfortable socks.
5.0,Sadly in this crazy year we all got to know face masks all too well. Thanks to COVID this has become a common day task that we wear these at work or out and about on errands and such. For some tasks I prefer wearing washable cloth masks and for others I prefer using a disposable type. At work we are only allowed to use the disposable N95 type masks but thankfully those are supplied to us.<br /><br />This mask is super cute and comes with comfortale ear loops. It also has a nose clip that keeps it securly in place.<br /><br />You also get a matching bandana for your dog with this one. Super cute set and I really like it.
5.0,"They are not designed for people with prescription glasses, but they still fit, I just need to pair them with a hat or visor to prevent my nose from reflecting on the inside.<br /><br />Best sunglasses I have had though, I live where the uv rating is very high normally, and these block all of it so it doesn't hurt my eyes in the day at all."
5.0,Absolute perfect party favors for my daughter is Young wild and three Bohemian birthday party. The bracelets were a big hit for party favors.
5.0,I ordered these for my 19 yr old daughter. She put them on and wore them all day and even slept in them. She loves them. They are comfortable and cute. They run small. She is about 5'7&#34; and weighs about 130 and ordered the large. She said even the large is a bit snug- she normally takes a medium. I only hope they won't shrink! If they shrink a lot I may update this post but for now I give it 5 stars.
5.0,Beautiful bracelets! I also hope that they don't turn. I may apply some clear polish to preserve them!
5.0,"We've only used these once, but I was surprised by how much they hold, and their sturdiness. I am going to leave the set of 5 I bought in my husband's car, as we usually take that to the grocery, but I think I need a set in mine as well. Now to figure out what pattern to order!"
5.0,Three year old can't kill it. Wanted a watch like his daddy so we bought a kids watch at Wally World that didn't last a day. This was my first watch 20+ years ago so I ordered one for him. When he does kill it I'll update this review. So far still ticking.
5.0,I really like the dress and am considering some of the other colors.  It is a very flattering and forgiving.

5.0,This necklace is really quite nice.  The gold-plating is high quality and looks very nice against the skin.  The extender chain gives you a lot of versatility for wearing with different clothing.  It comes packaged<br />nicely for gift giving also.  Would be a fun item for anyone fond of the classic book.
5.0,We use is as a joke but it is not cheaply built
5.0,looks Good & works well

5.0,"I was very impressed with the quality and packaging. I ordered these at the last minute, as I could not find the right look for a formal ball that I was attending. I could not believe the sparkle and how expensive these earrings look in person, after taking a chance on an online purchase."

5.0,This fit the timex indigo watch perfectly and was very good quality. Came in a decorative box...I couldnt be more happy! Thank you.

5.0,"The material is out of this world!!! It is super soft and comfy and stretchy I dont even know how else to describe it, i have never had anything like it.<br /><br />It is snug but not tight on the sleeves, it really just hugs you. I love how it drapes down, it looks very flattering and it is super super warm.<br /><br />I wanted something in a fall color and this one did it! Its a must."
5.0,I was really scared to order this because I didn’t know how it would fit. But I went by the size chart and it fit perfectly. The Velcro is super strong so I can see this one lasting. And I get a great sweat with this. It stays in place and everything
5.0,The fit and fabric is extremely comfortable. I'm ordering another color today.
5.0,This brand I would buy any day. I wore this dress for a 20s Dinner Murder Mystery and it came in on time. The fit is true to size.  I wanted to dress different than everyone else and I was fabulous.
5.0,Best gift ever for a fisherman
5.0,My fiance said that these are the best compression socks he has used!
5.0,The ladies I gave them to absolutely loved them!  Some kept them as keychains and some decided to make it a necklace with the enclosed black cord or chain!  The quality was great too!  Very sturdy and the gemstones were beautiful!  I will definitely purchase them again the next time I teach this class...
5.0,Warmer than a baseball cap; great for outdoor chores at approximately 45 degrees F or less.  Looks good.  Hangs easily on wall hook in the garage.
5.0,My daughter LOVES ladybug and she wants to wear these pjs everyday! They fit great and are great quality!
5.0,"I am a hard to buy for person because of my size.  I was super happy when all I had to do is put it on.  So true to size, and absolutely beautiful.  I received a compliment for the colors :)"
5.0,"I bought this specifically to wear on a weekend away with my husband, and he LOVED IT. I felt so confident and sexy, I was a bit disappointed when the night was over and I had to take the makeup off and get back into pajamas, lol. It’s constructed well, and as long as you check your measurements, it will fit well."
5.0,Very nice. I like my new dress
5.0,"I have a question? I just received these (they look great) and looked at the test card sent with them as I understand, with the glasses on, the wearer should see a fish in the picture? Um, I don’t so what is that telling me about their effectiveness?"
5.0,OK I love this hat! Wasn't expensive and does the job. I live in the desert so having a hat is extremely important for yard work. Thank you!
5.0,They’re dainty they go with anything and they look good
5.0,This is a good choice to make and The hoodie is very comfortable and i love the color of it. It fits just right and I am so glad I made a good decision to get this 8 hoodie and it fits you just right this will be a good choice for you to make. Can't wait for Endgame
5.0,I keep an extra pair of sunglasses in my vehicle for my Dad who is always losing his -- and we both really like these great shades. They look sharp and function very well at blocking the UV rays. Last night we were able to watch a very bright sunset with no pain or stinging in our eyes thanks to these quality sunglasses. They are well designed and well constructed and should last a very long time.
5.0,I love these sunglasses was looking for something different and I found them. I have seen these for at other places much more expensive.
5.0,I like these bikes shorts they are a little bit longer than most bike shorts and soft to the touch. They have pockets on both sides that fit cell phones easily.
5.0,It fit my husband perfectly and was exactly what he wanted.
5.0,Love it. Soft and confortBle
5.0,"I love the color, and it has really held up! I will purchase a few more in different colors.  As others have said, it was a little stiff at first, but after a couple of days of use it softened up. The best part is that is doesn't seem to have the terrible odor the leather bands get after a few weeks of wear, and I have not gotten a rash from this band like I did from the original one that came with the device."
5.0,"This is a darling purse. It's small but rigid which is an important detail if you're thinking of packing it. Takes up space so be sure you're going to use it. I usually carry a backpack or larger bag when I travel, then use the crossbody for day trips or evening events. This bag is perfect for both. Can fit a full-size wallet, some doodads like lip gloss, hand cream, etc., a phone. A full service elegant looking crossbody."
5.0,"First, I must commend the service of these sellers. Initially, the sunglasses were sent to the incorrect address. After I contacted them, they were quick to have them resent to my correct address, and always kept in contact with me. Now I finally have them in my possession and I'm thrilled. For the price of these sunglasses, they're above my expectations. The pink hue is perfect, and it isn't as dull as I expected it to be. They came packaged in a small zip-lock bag, in a sturdy case too. I am so excited to wear this for my vacation!!!!! I'll just advise that you be careful when handling them, don't be too rough because they might break.<br /><br />2 thumbs up to ChezAbbey. I'm impressed, and I would purchase with you again."

5.0,Very cozy and special!
5.0,"I *hate* socks. I hate feeling like my toes are trapped and squished and hot — these are so light it's like wearing nothing but they're excellent for preventing blisters. Ive worn them rock wall climbing, hiking, in cute boots, on marathon errand trips, while working at a grocery store, and made an impromptu bootie for our pup when she hurt her paw. My husband and our dog have both stolen pairs. The only minor complaint is that the thin material can snag easily and develop holes sooner than I'd prefer; but the holes usually don't widen with wear."
5.0,"Good morning Amazon! This necklace is just lovely. No complaints. It's well made, has a bit of weight to it, it's understated but not boring. Very nice, wish I could find some other things like this."
5.0,"I go to quite a few various games and I've seen people on the street selling them. Never ask them because I knew they were probably going to ripped me off so I got this.  Feels pretty good for the price of it and has enough for what I need to bring. Overall, very durable."
5.0,Purfect
5.0,Beautiful bracelet. I wear it as a reminder to stay centered. I was able to easily adjust the size to fit my wrist.

5.0,"Never know about these things, but hat was perfect"

5.0,"I was a little nervous about buying this hat for my daughter's Christmas present without first having her try it on, since she has tried on many hats that just weren't quite right. But this hat is high quality and it fit her really well and looks very stylish. It didn't have too much poof on the top, like several of the lower quality hats we've seen in stores. It's perfect!"

The perfect scarf if you love Harry Potter as much as me! I ordered my friend a Ravenclaw one from the same company because this one is so great! I’m going to a Harry Potter event next weekend and wanted something warm to wear, but I will for sure wear this scarf all the time now. It’s really comfy and pretty warm. So happy with this purchase!"

5.0,My gf has the 42mm watch but uses the 38/40mm because she has a small wrist. It’s A very nice band
5.0,I loved this idea for a present instead of a plague or something that will just collect dust. It is well made and the card that goes with it is well done. We gave her this and a gift card for her hobby. Our coworker's favorite color is purple too. Highly recommend!
5.0,Very cozy and comfortable as well as flattering.  I had several complements when I wore it.

5.0,Beautiful! Bought this as a 12th wedding anniversary gift.
5.0,We workout daily and my wife always wears sneakers while I prefer a barefoot work out.  She has been having some ankle and Arch issues lately and decided to start doing more barefoot workouts as my arches are stronger now than when I was a teenager.  Her big problem is that she is constantly slipping on the carpeted living room where we do most of our workouts.  These socks off a great grip on the carpet with out causing her to stick to the floor in other areas of the house.  They fit perfect and are breathable and comfortable to wear.  She says don't wear them with shoes as they feel strange and are a bit uncomfortable in shoes.  These wash up just fine and no issues with shrinking.  These are great workout socks.
5.0,Love this jacket. Super cute & fits perfect
5.0,"i wear this blouse at least once a month. it has hold up nicely to GENTLE washing, and lost of wear. it is very thin, so its perfect under sweaters etc. I love it."
5.0,Great band for corporate work and just period
5.0,"Bought to put in gift bags for a Tween Aloha Themed Birthday Party!<br />Was very happy with quality, cost & quantity! The girls loved them. ❤️"

5.0,Fits great. Very comfortable!
5.0,"They are really comfortable and definitely a good deal, will order more in other colors!!"
5.0,I bought a few of these for work. The quality and design are great.😊
5.0,"I bought these for my husband to wear to bed, since his feet get cold.  Because they are lightweight and very stretchy, they don’t bind at all.  My only complaint is that they require hand washing and air drying only."
5.0,"I now have ordered three of these.  I find the dress to be perfect for around the house.  It is comfortable, warm but not hot and fits well.  Recommend to anyone who like casual, comfortable house wear."
5.0,"Great, especially for the price."
5.0,My niece loves her new scarf - she works in an office environment and adds this to her suits for a little color.
5.0,"After having oilskin products in the past, it is nice to finally discover something to reseal it with8"
5.0,I highly recommend people that if they're replacing the band for the first time to get one of these kits that includes everything that you will need.
5.0,great  price
5.0,Ordered for a pirate costume and it was not cheapy feeling or looking. Very good quality and so cute
5.0,"Purse holds all my travel essentails for the beach.  Easy to carry, wipe out spills and wipe off sand and moisture."
5.0,"Hey it's Princess Leia,  what could possible be wrong?"
5.0,"This is an awesome costume with an amazing mask! It fit my Grandson perfectly and was true to size. I love the material, seems like will be durable. I would recommend this costume for any Superhero Kids."
5.0,i wood buy more
5.0,"Unlike some of the other masks I've purchased, this one has small holes in it so breathing is much easier.  I work for a parcel delivery company and while in the warehouse it's required to wear a mask.....it's really hot (Arizona) in there so it's not too bad wearing this mask.  If you wear glasses you have to find the perfect position for the mask on your nose so as not to fog your glasses, but all in all, it's a really good mask.  You will however need to wash it every day if as it does tend to ""loosen up"" as the day progresses.  I'm very satisfied!"
5.0,"I just began a job that requires a lot of travel. I purchased this bag to use as a personal item on flights. So far I have used it for one trip and it worked excellent! I put my laptop, purse and other electronic items in it, along with some snacks, toiletries, and reading material. It is slightly larger than the airline requirements, but I did not have it full, so there was no problem and it easily fit under the seat. Then for the week I used it as a laptop bag to carry items to the client (including a pair of walking shoes to use on the walk back to the hotel). Worked like a charm and I highly recommend!"
5.0,"I'm in love with this hat. Originally, I thought this sparkling one is for younger girls. But it has been proven that pretty is not limited by age.<br />Also this hat is very functional and effective to shield from UV light. Materials, construction,  design, are all so good."
5.0,was a gift for my granddaughter...she loved it  :)
5.0,"This necklace is the perfect casual statement necklace for almost any occasion. It is very affordable and well-made. It is extremely cute and can be combined with any outfit to make even the most casual outfit have a little more style. It is a little on the heavy side for me personally to wear for an entire day, but just for a few hours here and there it is perfect. I plan to buy more colors in the future."
5.0,It looks elegant and fits perfectly. Great price.
5.0,Adorable tie for Father's Day.  My husband wears our darling dog proudly.<br />Thanks!
5.0,"beautiful item, great service"
5.0,Beautiful necklace. My daughter loves it. Would definitely buy again.
5.0,These pants are very soft and comfortable. I wanted something that was slightly loose for walking and these are perfect.
5.0,Very comfortable.  waist doesn't roll down.  My new daily uniform
5.0,"Got these for my wife, and she really likes them.  She's 5'6"" and 150lbs, and bought Medium both with and without pockets (Pictures are of the pocket leggings) - and the sizing is perfect.  The non-pocket leggings are a little long (28"" inseam), but she likes the look of them better than the pocket leggings.  The pocket ones fit better length wise, but she prefers them without all the side seams (shown in the picture).  The outside material is not nylon but it has that smooth feel.  It's matte with a little shine to it, and the interior is fleecy like the description says.  Overall, warm and very comfortable."
5.0,These Coach sunglasses were exactly as described; they arrived promptly and fit perfectly.
5.0,"To be perfectly honest, I wasn't expecting much from these jeggings because of the price. Not to mention, I had never worn jeggings before and had heard that they tended to crease around the crotch area or hang off of the buttocks as they stretched throughout the day. Fortunately, that was not the case with these. They're soft, comfortable, and flexible, all without falling down or hanging loose in areas where you want them to remain tight. They truly do look like jeans and unless someone were to walk up and touch them, they probably wouldn't know that it's not true denim.<br /><br />I ordered the Navy Blue in XXL because I wanted something that actually looked like true denim. My regular size is 16/18 and these fit perfectly. I like to wear them with my black knee-high boots because there is no bunching up at the bottom, so my boots slide right over them with ease.<br /><br />I wash my jeggings on the regular cycle and dry them on high. I didn't realize until the third wash that you're supposed to handwash them and tumble dry. Oops! Fortunately, I haven't noticed any shrinkage, damage, or color-fading. They're still in great shape with the same dark blue color.<br /><br />Because these are so versatile and comfortable, you can wear it with almost anything at any time. I highly recommend them.<br /><br />* I received this product at no cost in exchange for an unbiased review. All opinions are my own."
5.0,Real aquamarine. Delivered faster then expected. Absolutely satisfied. Thank you. By the way: already ordered the second one to use as chain
5.0,Drives the moonbats crazy
5.0,Good quality great price
5.0,"Beautiful I loved it!!..Only dwn side, it does run big...I usually wear Xl but being this dress is soft and that of stretchy material the Xl was too big...So gave I gave it to a friend but I will deff reorder but this time a Large 😊"
5.0,"Loved the hat when it came in. It is good and sturdy. We used it as the sign-in for my daughters baby shower, and she is now hanging it for decoration."
5.0,I love this nightgown!  It is so comfortable and perfect for summer!  It is very comfortable to sleep in too being that the fabric is soft and nonrestrictive.  It is not see through either! I am definitely going to order more in different colors!😀
5.0,Love these! I've never bought leggings online until I saw the reviews people were giving these. THEY ARE TRUE!  I run in them and there hasn't been any pilling or any problems. There is a small storage pocket in the waistband where I can store my key. They are super comfy and I wish I had 5 more pairs.
5.0,"Pair these with a suit or with jeans, and you will receive compliments no matter what. They are handsome, comfortable, and I would definitely recommend them."
5.0,"I happen to be petite with a larger bust so this fit me really well. However, for a normally proportionate person, this top would run large."
5.0,"I own numerous automatic watches and this is one of my favorites and the least expensive . The fit, finish and accuracy of this watch are really remarkable for the price..plus, I love the retro appearance."
5.0,nice sweatshirt  -  good quality fabric - good construction - good fit
5.0,The blue is beautiful! It catches a lot of attention.
5.0,I REALLY LIKE THIS. MY DAUGHTER WILL LOVE THEM THEY ARE CHRISTMAS GIFTS THANK YOU
5.0,Very special products from this seller ... for me it deserves more than 10 stars. Buy with it ... fast delivery and 100% original products
5.0,Bought them for my 5 year old. They are working great so far.
5.0,"So comfortable, they don't ride up at all and they look great for a great price. Will probably buy more and replace all of my underwear drawer"
5.0,"I LOVE this headphone.  It isn't the greatest quality of sound, but perfect to wear when I go to bed at night.  I can lay sideways with my head on the pillow comfortably. My husband can't even tell that I am listening to anything and it masks the sound of his snoring.  I don't like wearing sleep masks, but this acts as one and I don't even notice it being over my eyes."
5.0,"Good quality, wide mixture"
5.0,Great watch band. Very similar fit and feel to the ones that the Fitbit originally comes with. Love to cute design too!
5.0,"Good quality, and fits well on a large head"
5.0,Nice tie...looks great!  O-H-I-O! :)
5.0,"I bought this necklace for my teen daughter.  She loves it.  So many different colors, goes well with several outfits.  Casual to dressy.  It's on a hoop, not a chain, which is trendy right now.  Thank you."
5.0,I had purchased these sunsleeves in blue for my 10-year-old son whose medications make him very susceptible to sunburn.  He wears them on car rides when the sun is really strong.  He says they're soft and light.  He loves them & so do I!
5.0,Just what I expected and fast!
5.0,"Being a long distance runner, the one thing you need is foot care after a long hard run. I have been using Adidas Adissage slides for a while and thought to see how something with a high arch support would feel. I purchased this product Fanture couple of weeks back and i'm really enjoying it ! The arch support is so good, it's lite weight and yes, i feel like i'm walking on clouds. Only negative aspect is size - it runs pretty big ...but i'm still using it LOL"
5.0,"True to size, nice weight and color"
5.0,Very pretty polished finish and inspiring words have a nice font. It's also bold enough which I like in bracelets.
5.0,Love it. Holds through everything!!  :)
5.0,These ROCK!!! I agree with the other reviewer- “:..how much did you pay?” Stop your crying. I apologize on behalf of the negative Nancy’s out there: I’m 5’4” 36 C and wear these with leggings or lounging and for 1/2 the price of a Starbucks latte??? I’ll take it!!! 🙏
5.0,Sweet little necklace for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday.
5.0,Exactly what my nephew wanted. Sizing was perfect.
5.0,"An average key ring is a hassle to use, this is very easy to use and something everyone should have."
5.0,"It's so beautiful!!!  The beads are a dark red, not brownish red like common garnets.  The fit is comfortable.  I am pleased with this purchase."
5.0,Best gift ever
5.0,"These are very nice stylish men's socks that are made very well. They hold up all day, so your not pulling up your socks all day, that can be very annoying. These can be worn casually with Khakis or jeans. The stitching is done well. Not to thin. They wash up well. Average fit. I received these socks at a discounted price for my unbiased and honest review and I highly recommend them."
5.0,Quality & style
5.0,Very pretty. And arrived early.b
5.0,"I am absolutely in LOVE with this bag! It came in nice box, wrapped up in a &#34;cottonish&#34; bag. Had a nice touch of class. I unfolded and loved the three way divide it has (open, zipper section, open) so I can keep things nice and organized. It also has little &#34;feet&#34; on the bottom of the bag, so when sitting it on the floor it helps keep it from getting dirty. This bag reminds me of something Olivia Pope would use, I am huge lover of Scandal, so that makes the bag even better!  I have already told my mom about this bag and she plans on getting on soon!"
5.0,I love the color and it being v neck. I got this to wear with leggings and it is long enough to cover hips
5.0,my daughter LOVES ths!!
5.0,"So cute, and they don't leave marks on my little one's chubby legs like socks do!"
5.0,Goes well with solid scrubs for mix and match.  Only suggestion to the manufacturer is to add buttons on the sides for masks during this crazy pandemic.
5.0,Love them! Wearing them now!!
5.0,Loved these. Great for bathing my cat. He can try to scratch all he wants and won't get through. Very strong and stay in place.
5.0,I love Casio watches. I got this one for my husband and he loves the two tone element to the watch. Came in perfect condition.
5.0,"What adorable little earrings! I'm so excited by these. They just made my day, and they are really quite sweet."
5.0,This jacket is excellent. I should not have listened to the review that said it was small and order the next size up. I ordered the XXL and it is large on me although still fits some what. I wish I had ordered the XL and it would still have provided room for under garments for layering and better fit. I am impressed with the quality.
5.0,I bought these for my boyfriend. He's always been a fan of LOCS. They're pretty good quality for the price.
5.0,"I bought these for my 14 yr old daughter who is working on a vegetable farm this summer.  She is very fashion conscience (even while working in dirt) and she loved the look of the boot.  Score!  She usually wears a 6.5, but based on other reviews that said they ran big I got her the 6.  They are a little big, but she is happy with the fit.  They do well in rain, mud and gardening."
5.0,I have wore this necklace set many times and received several compliments
5.0,Very pretty and delicate. A bit smaller than I imagined though. Comes in a nice box with a soft pink cloth bag. Giving this as a gift.
5.0,"Look of ring is just gorgous! Especially for the price! It fits, it's cute, and the price is perfecto. I like the way the owl sorta &quot;lights up&quot; from the stones. This ring is a real treat to own, especially if you love owls. Happy w purchase! :)"
5.0,I'm 5' tall and 160lbs. I ordered a medium and it is so big but I kind of like the flow. Will work perfect for a nice hot summer day. And the mustard color is amazing.
5.0,"Great jacket! Perfect shoulders,sleevelength and look...if you have no boobs🤷🏻‍♀️"
5.0,"Beautiful design and fit. Very delicate looking style with the lace details on the right places to show some skin, yet cover the not so perfect areas we may have.  Excellent materials and workmanship."
5.0,Very very soft cozy and comfortable
5.0,Great T-shirt to wear while I am playing the game!
5.0,"Shipping was on time! Both of these bracelets are excellent! However, the sizing chart is a bit off. The bracelet will fit an 'Average' male on the last snaps (BARELY). They are kinda small if you are man, you would need a small wrist.  They fit women perfectly. The bracelets even came with a carrying case (you don't need it, but its cool )"
5.0,So comply and they don’t skip down
5.0,"I ordered this to go on a trip on a plane. I didn't want to carry a purse. As it turned out, security made me put it in my carry-on because I could only have 2 carry-on's ... I had my suitcase and a bag with my tablet in it. I just put it in the tablet bag. I got the blue and it's very pretty. The snap on the front works well and doesn't come undone. It's great for carrying a little $, drivers license and a couple credit cards. I even put a pen and small pack of gum in it. I'm not thrilled with it for everyday use, though. It's too compact for that. But I do like it and I would recommend it."
5.0,Was a gift for my boyfriend and he says it is perfect. As a glasses wearer he loves that it has a nose piece
5.0,Good quality ! Lots of compliments at the dog park.
5.0,"I have to say, I took a gamble on buying this hat for a costume. Cheap usually means crappy construction or a horrible fit. But this hat was a pleasant surprise. It fits very well, and it made of a sturdy felt material and actually is a great value. I recommend this hat."
5.0,Loved the fit of dress.  It's not clingy.
5.0,Very nice leggings.  Soft fabric.  Not thick.
5.0,My son was very happy with the bracelet.
5.0,"Bought for mother, she loves it."
5.0,"I really love these Bellbesson polarized sports sunglasses! They fit great, light weight and I just love them. The only thing I didn't like was that the lenses fell out every time I cleaned them, well after having them for about 3 months I've finally got the lenses  to pop in place correctly, I think..."
5.0,"I love these  bonnets. I can't find them in the store anymore.  I have use them for 25  years. I sweat in a closed bonnet but not in this one. These are soft ,cool and airy. They do run small  . I have shoulder lenght hair and a small head . It  is perfect for me. Hand wash, mild soap , cold water ,and air dry. My elastic held up for about 3years. The actual cap fabric never  wore out.Not bad for the price. Thank  you  Goody!"
5.0,really cute and light weight  fit well
5.0,"I really liked this, i  am 5'5 and 140lb and I ordered a small. Its comfortable and looks just like the photo."
5.0,I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. Her favorite color is green and this dress is so flattering. She's a large and it fit her very well.
5.0,"Looks just like picture. Bag is trapezoidal and measures 46cm across the top. Item I received has a matte chocolate brown lining that feels like thin cotton or polyester. Bag is fairly unstructured meaning it can fold, mold around your body rather than retaining its shape like another product I tried from Amazon with stiffer construction (Aibearty Oxford Nylon Tote). I prefer a softer shell since it doesn't feel big or cumbersome but has a lot of capacity when needed. Straps are flat, pliable. I cannot speak to durability yet as this is a new purchase though it appears neatly constructed."
5.0,Love this. I use this to hold all my work keys and have it clips on one of my belt loops. Very convenient when I have to use my keys. I just unclip them off and then clip them back on.
5.0,Great very dark glasses
5.0,love love love these pants
5.0,"They're linen, the colors are great and I've now bought them in two colors, which are as advertised.  Can't say enough good about them!"
5.0,"beautiful watch, my husband enjoys wearing it & very inexpensive."
5.0,Perfect fit for my 11 yr old! It for me too. Very cute.
5.0,"These are my most comfortable shoes. These are the model with laces. I will buy the ones with out laces for sure. I’ve had these for a year and a half and I love them still . I did need to sew one side since it opened up . But I’m a nurse and wear them all the time . They are great and sewing them was not a problem . They look really good being worn out guys. That feel of comfort is important . I had people say, wow !!! Those shoes look so old but comfy. I like the distressed look and these shoes have become my favorite"
5.0,"Amazing!!!! They are really sticky, will probably last long"
5.0,This dress was absolutely beautiful on my 9 year old daughter for father daughter dance! I ordered it on Thursday night and it arrived just in time Saturday to wear to the dance!
5.0,Loved it throw on and go washes great
5.0,This is my third pair of these earrings. They are not to big and not to small and they give you a little sparkle without being to flashy. They stay clasped quite well.
5.0,These are really great earrings I wear sterling silver these are perfect
5.0,AS DESCIBED
5.0,"My husband is 6' 5"" and the extra large fits him pretty well.  He's typically in between a large and an XL.  XL shirts are usually too short and wide in most men's shirts and this one was the same way.  He'll still wear in and he LOVES the graphic so overall it was a win.  Just not super impressed with the sizing/proportions."
5.0,"These don't cost much at all and are surprisingly quite well made. Mine has not broken or had any issue so far , worth buying!."
5.0,"This is a very pretty necklace that certainly looks more expensive than it is.  I really love it.  I haven't worn it yet, looking for right outfit, but it has a good wow factor.  Only one regret: no extender. Hard to expect more at this price point. I will buy my own extender and still come out ahead price-wise."
5.0,I'm 5'9&#34; and weigh 155 lbs. I wear a 36DD bra size and the medium fit perfectly! The sleeves are plenty long which is good for me because I have long arms. I bought this sweater in several colors because I like having a light sweater on at work...no matter what time of the year it is the office always seems to be just a little cold and this light sweater is perfect!
5.0,Super comfy- fit great.
5.0,Comfortable. Great fit. Quality feel. Using for Halloween.
5.0,This is a beautiful bra that fits very well! The plum color is very pretty and I absolutely love the little rhinestone detail! Big fan!
5.0,Pretty robe. Fast shipping
5.0,Cute and comfortable. I got a large. I’m always between a medium and large. Going off of the reviews I ordered a large and am glad I did. I’m 5’7 and close to 160.
5.0,Nice top for the price keeps me dry during a work out.
5.0,"My husband has always had problems with his feet and has surgery on one.  Since his feet are narrow, it is hard to find house shoes that fit and give support.  I ordered the slippers for him and just hoped they would fit and give the needed support.  He LOVES the shippers and tells me almost every day how much he enjoys them.  The slippers give him the orthopedic support he needs and since the width can be adjusted with the Velcro, he just tightens the slippers to adjust to his narrow feet.<br />A GREAT FIND!"
5.0,boyfriend love it
5.0,Only socks I buy for my kids to play soccer in. The other brands are to expensive. This material is amazing and is just as good for a better price.
5.0,"Terrific design, very practicle"
5.0,It was perfect fitting
5.0,"This my FAVORITE go-to dress. I have it in black too, but can’t find that color. I need another one. I will buy this in every color possible!  It conceals not so tan legs and upper arms."
5.0,I ordered this dressing to facilitate a workshop for my audience. I wanted something professional but comfortable. This dress came so quickly. The material was perfect and it fit my body perfectly. I felt very comfortable and could move around easily during the event. I didn't have a need for any adjustments. It was not super tight so I have some room in the event that I gain a little weight. I am 5'8 and 133 pounds and this was a perfect fit for me.  Thank you for this dress. A wonderful addition to my closet and for a great price too!
5.0,This necklace is just what I was looking for!  A great little treasure for D.R. lovers.
5.0,"These socks are adorable.  I have small feet, US youth 4, and they fit perfectly.  I'm definitely going to buy more in other styles."
5.0,Such a beautiful necklace and you can't beat the price. It's stainless steel so It doesn't tarnish or turn green. I never take it off to shower or sleep.
5.0,"In a time when many people do not feel safe from violence?  It’s nice to be a safe space.  It’s well made, good quality, and sends an important message."
5.0,My husband likes the design and the ease. Regular belts get the worn out look due to the holes and he is hoping these belts would stay in good shape and last longer. He has been using them ( he bought both black and brown) for about 3-4 days. The price is very reasonable. So far so good!
5.0,I love this ear cuff. It’s comfy and decorative.

5.0,Thank you! Very fast delivery overseas and dress exactly as described. Very satisfied and will order again!
5.0,Super cute! The only thing I didn’t like about it was the plastic snaps one the onesie. One of them broke off a few days after she wore it. Other than that i love it. It’s stretchy material so it’s comfortable and adorable
5.0,I bought it for my aunt and she loved how pretty it is.
5.0,Brought these for my granddaughter for school.  She loves them. Says they are very comfortable.
5.0,"I bought this for my wife because she always carries her glass case and her contact case and a little portable size moisturizer bottle, this puts everything into one and a great size and all the tools she needs were included."
5.0,"It came faster than expected and it came in a cute little box and even in a protective bag so it wouldn't get scratched during shipping. It is adorable and the perfect size for what I was looking for. It is exactly as described and even better in person and the photos online do not do it justice, as with most things. I LOVE IT!! I would definitely buy from this seller again."
5.0,I love this sweater!! It is so pretty and comfortable. I absolutley love it!
5.0,It is frustrating to install even after viewing the youtube instructions which were very good. It looks good.
5.0,"beautiful womens pajama set. I received the grey colored which was my favorite.  lets start by saying that it is extremely soft and cozy. you can use it to sleep and also around the house as lounge wear. its pretty chic and cute. However, for me at night it does make me sweat. almost too warm. but that may just be preference with Ac etc. another thing is that it does run larger than expected. I ordered the size small and it fits me like a medium. I have yet to wash this so I'm not sure how it holds upon but it is polyester so it should be ok. this is overall a nice set."
5.0,I am 5'3 and 129lbs I ordered a size medium and they fit perfect I was a little scared that they would be to long but they are exactly the length that I was wanting I will definitely buy again
5.0,Didn’t have to go through the pain for another hole life the look
5.0,Perfect fit. So comfy
5.0,"I am 5'4"" approximately 125lbs and I ordered a small based on others reviews. I love my sweaters baggy and I was not disappointed. I was considering ordering a medium just because I love baggy sweaters and I am glad I didnt. This is just right. Super soft. It says hand wash however I  will most likely wash on delicate in a special wash bag I use for other delicate clothes. It's really warm also!! I got this during cyber Monday because I am always concerned about buying online and try to get discounts in case I'm disappointed. I will totally be buying this in other colors. I am considering buying this as a gift for some friends and family.<br />Update: had for a few days now and use as my go to when I get chilly...it is by far the warmest article of clothing I own! If I ever move back to cold weather country I am no doubt buying this is more colors!! Love!"
5.0,I am not a fan of the thumb opening in the sleeve…so I just don’t use those on any shirts. The fabric feels wonderful against the skin. Will most likely be purchasing more in other colors.
5.0,Love the shirt. Gorgeous
5.0,much better than price would seem to indicate
5.0,"No complaints.  Beautiful, as expected.  Came in The pandora &#34;box&#34; with its tissue paper..."
5.0,"My favorite part about these pajamas are the soft and comfortable material. They are just the right amount of thickness and they stay in place if your child tosses and turns at night. My daughter is slimmer, but tall and about 77 lbs. The sizing was perfect. She was so excited about the matching face mask which was the icing on the cake. I am very happy and will be getting more. It would be a cute gift for someone else, or a great addition to your child's nighttime wardrobe. Hope that helps!"
5.0,I bought these for ease following an ankle fracture. They’re very soft and comfy but they feel two sizes too big.
5.0,I live these bras. They are so cute and comfortable. Fits true to size! I like to wear them with a short to go out as well as for working out.  I will buy more in different colors.  Definitely recommend!

5.0,"Overall a nice shirt, but runs small.  I ordered up a size and it fit perfectly.  Hey, Better Call Saul!"
5.0,This suit will keep me dry and warm throughout all Pacific Northwest seasons- rainy fall to icy winter.  I love the pockets and how they are lined  with warm fleece and so many of them! The print and colors are so pretty! It’s a staple in my outdoor gear now.

5.0,My Son loves his shirt! He has a beautiful beard!

5.0,"They were soooo beautiful , they glisten every way you turn."
5.0,it gives a perfect highlight to the wall behind my bar.  Easy to install and the changing lights create a beautiful ambiance.  Love it.
5.0,"I bougth the shoes because I've bought Carlos Santana's shoes before and I really liked them. For the price and the fact that they go with alot of the outfits I wear to work, I am happy with my purchase. Other reviewers stated that the zipper could be problematic and I would agree. Sometimes the zipper does get stuck but it's not something I would complain too much about."
5.0,Best sunglasses ever!
5.0,These glasses are amazing!! Love them!!
5.0,"My little 4lb 15oz 34 weeker came home in this outfit.  It was one of the few we could find that had feet, mittens, AND a zipper.  It was our favorite outfit for those reasons, and fit also fit him sooner than most others."
5.0,Amazing gift for my son. I kissed it with dark lipstick and gave it to him. It was special because I kissed a Kleenex for him to keep in his pocket when he started kindergarten.
5.0,"Es un cinturón muy lindo y coqueto!!! Es para chicas delgadas, porque es pequeñito. Talla muy bien y los acabados son hermosos. Me encanta cómo queda!"
5.0,"I'm 6'4&#34; and 210, I bought the L. The shirts are a very comfortable mesh fabric, not too thin (not sheer or see through). My only wish would be to have more colors like neon yellow and orange for running."
5.0,"The dress is pretty and could work for a flowy summer dress, but it was way too big for my daughter. Size down."
5.0,I love it. It's huge. It's the size of Dallas and just as gaudy. I must have been drunk when I bought it but I LOVE IT.
5.0,Beautiful love love love this necklace would recommend this to everyone.
5.0,"The v-neckline sits higher up which I was pleasantly surprised to see. The fabric is soft and thin, but not see-through. For reference I'm 135 lbs, 5'3"", 36DDD and apple-shaped -- I ordered the large. A great dress which looks better when wearing than on than the hanger."
5.0,"Beautiful! I will change them to lever-backs because I prefer that, but these are light and comfortable."
5.0,"Great quality, especially for the price.  With these amber lenses I can see trout when others can't.  My wife has trouble driving at sunrise, sunset and when headlights are in her eyes.  These are the best protective glasses she has found."
5.0,"Love them! Shopped around and found this to be the best deal! The style is great, I don't look like I'm wearing an ugly necklace, very stylish and light !"
5.0,"I received these as a birthday present from a lifelong friend, and I love them.  These socks are a wonderful gift, adorable,  cozy. and a special treat.  I literally smile when I wearing them, because they are so cute.  What could be better than that?"
5.0,I love this dress! Perfect lbd. The material was nice. I'm 5'6 and 198 pounds and I ordered an xl

5.0,"Really cute item, fits great~"
5.0,Gave these as party favors and had some left over. My kids still wear them and they havent broke a single pair yet. They are durable and I'd purchase again.
5.0,Love this purse. Just the right size and very well made
5.0,my favorite mens underwear. fits great
5.0,I purchased these socks as a means of dealing with painful shin splints. I have been very impressed to the degree to which they have alleviated the symptoms.  I recommend these for anyone who is suffering shin splints.
5.0,Wear it all the time.
5.0,"This is an incredibly cute top ^_^<br />It's very loose, and obviously you wear with no bra - well that's the idea anyway.<br />It's not very thin at all, it's actually pretty thick, the material feels good...I can't wait for the warm weather to return so I can wear it again!"
5.0,Looks like the real thing and is functional in the kitchen.  I've gotten plenty of compliments on it.
5.0,"We used this as part of our Teal Pumpkin offering this year.  Extremely detailed, and every sheet was different!  I'll be looking for a similar pack for next Halloween!"
5.0,"I've been trying this out for about a week now. I primarily use it as a gun belt but it could be used for anyone that needs a belt that can support some weight. Toolbags, etc.<br /><br />The leather is quite thick and seems to be of good quality. You can hold this belt out and it doesn't sag (see picture) which is a good indicator that it can support some weight. You cannot fold this belt in half along its length - another indicator of good support.<br /><br />The brown color is a nice and deep, their size suggestions are accurate, overall this is a quality product."
5.0,great product and made in the USA.  used for credit cards & pictures.  I suggest you could expand your selections!?
5.0,I bought this mask for a masquerade ball. It was perfect! It can be used for a man or woman. It is well-made and comfortable to wear. Highly recommend it.
5.0,"I am not sure why a laser perforated technique was necessary. This cap has holes in the back half, which allow your head to breathe, or your sweat to breathe, and if it is warm outside, that is pretty cool!<br /><br />IF it is cold outside, that is pretty cool, too, and so this hat is a hat you wear only when it is warm.<br /><br />It has a velco size adjuster that allows a perfect fit."
5.0,"Pretty, nice fabric"
5.0,I love my tags I will be ordering more an so will my friends when they see how cute they are
5.0,"These are great! The quality—very well made, the fabric is so soft, perfect for a little girl and the stitching is excellent. I could not be more please! I will be ordering more sets and highly recommend them. They are not the least expensive, but in this case, you truly get what you pay for!<br />And the tagless is another plus because i don't have to hear my daughter complain about it itching her<br />These tops make perfect undershirts or night shirts. They are very true to size and seem to be made well. Overall I have no complaints! Great tops!"
5.0,Love the oversize fit
5.0,These are small earrings that twirl into your ear. Nice for when you want a bit of bling or for second ear hole. They were kinda tricky to put in but do have some bend to the wire.
5.0,Fit my 10yr old perfectly.
5.0,Cute...great for my Rockabilly costume!
5.0,"Just received the KWLET apple watch band.  It's high quality, durable and very easy to adjust the size.  I would definitely buy again."

5.0,Perfect and as described!

5.0,Exactly as described.  Perfect for a teenager.
5.0,I've gotten a lot of compliments on this top. It fits perfectly. I ordered a medium and it fits like a medium.
5.0,"Perfection!  Chic, elegant and looks far more expensive than it is!  A fabulous fashion find!"
5.0,"These are a steal.  I don't expect cheap sunglasses to last so if these break or scratch, I don't care.  They are lightweight for outdoor activities and look and feel great.  Now why anyone would feel they can stick these in their pockets is beyond me.  I don't buy expensive activity sunglasses because they often will get lost so these are great alternative."
5.0,Love love love all these! So many for a good price
5.0,"Beautiful shawl, colors are perfect.  Well made"
5.0,"Cute body suit, but it's a bit smaller than I expected. I ripped some small holes in the back a bit, but if I had ordered a bigger size it probably wouldn't have. Overall, love it."
5.0,Better quality than I expected. Ordered up in size and it fits great
5.0,Color and closure.
5.0,I love Frida Khalo and was excited that I found exactly what I wanted!
5.0,I love it 10/10 would recommend
5.0,"I am 5'7'', 195lbs. The XL fit true to size, about 2"" above my ankles. It is gathered to look like a pleated skirt but is more relaxed. Very light material but not see through. The red is absolutely gorgeous! Will purchase more!"
5.0,Have rheumatoid arthritis and aching feet.  Have tile floors.  These are very comfortable.
5.0,Beautiful for my daughters
5.0,"The dress fits perfectly! I normally wear a medium, and  I ordered a medium.  The dress is very light, and feels like I am wearing nothing.  Great material for hot climates."
5.0,"I am a bug fan of Brooks, this is my second pair of this exact one. I wore my others out. Highly recommend"
5.0,"Great Quality.  Fits a little large, but very comfortable!  Color was true to the description.<br />I will be definitely be a return customer."
5.0,Got for my daughter she turned 13 and she loves it we couldn't be happier
5.0,Love the fabric. Top has a great cut for those who enjoy exercising
5.0,"I used the size guide when I ordered, instead of assuming it was ""American"" sized, very happy. Awesome material, and the pocket print matches the hoodie print perfectly."
5.0,"The dress is made of a quality, heavier material. It is a bit scratchy around the sleeves and skirt where the design is sewn in, but overall it is a flattering, pretty dress. I get compliments every time I wear it."
5.0,"Good quality, perfect in every way"
5.0,Very good product and great quality
5.0,Great looking!
5.0,This shirt fit my boyfriend really good. He usually wears a large but I took the time to look at the size chart and knew to get him am XL and it for great. It was a little long butt that was ok. He received so many compliments on this shirt. The quality of the fabric was really well made and thick. It wasn't cheaply and thinly made. Great buy.
5.0,I usually wear Large for dresses but I got a medium for this dress and it fits nicely. This dress is quite dressy yet so comfortable. I got a lot of compliments. I love love love this dress.
5.0,Comfortable although it’ll need hemmed
5.0,Giving this a five star as the belt is just peachy and the buckle fits just right
5.0,"I bought these to use as a prop when proposing to my fiance. They looked amazing out of the box, and you could not discern them from the real diamond/platinum engagement ring! In fact, my fiance liked these better because she thought the diamond was shinier. XD. At any rate, these do rust after a while, so for anyone looking to buy them as an actual engagement ring, I feel terribly bad for the fiance receiving it. If you're like me, and want to use these as a prop, then go for it -- just make sure you get a jewelry box to go along with the prop."
5.0,These exceeded expectations.  The packaging was exceptional.
5.0,"Love the print, the width, length and the light wispy texture of it. AND the price!!! Light enough to wear it any way you like it... flatters almost everything I wear. If it's not needed, I can just fold it to fit easily into a purse, and when I do need it, it's nice and big and warn enough... tho' I gotta admit, I live in Hawaii, so, can't say much for those living in the northern mainland. But during the spring, early summer and autumn... I'm sure you'd love it too! I loved it so much I got a white one as well!"
5.0,Had mine for about a 1yr now great buy
5.0,So cute on
5.0,Great for the price 2 were for my son ge ride his Sporster with his.
5.0,Great costume. The material is sturdy and well stitched. I didn’t want it to be too tight so I got and XL . And it fits like an XL. Should have stick with a large but it’s gonna work out just fine.
5.0,"These are cooler than others, and long enough"
5.0,Autistic son who can easily put on these shoes he picked out himself velcro at top of elastic shoe laces. Loves them. He uses colors to tell me what kind of day he is having. Wears when he feels great like superman!!!!!

5.0,"Reasonable price, bought 2 for my grandsons they really like them"
5.0,"This is a little on the tight side on the chest area I’m a 38c, 5”6 200lbs and got a XL. But still fits beautifully and goes to about mid calf.. wearing it for a wedding."

5.0,Complete Show stopper!!!!!!
5.0,"Love this hoodie! My son wanted a galaxy hoodie and this is now his favorite jacket . I ordered two so he  could give the other to his girlfriend. The Timemory unisex is well made. It is silky on the outside and hasn't pilled, faded or frayed at all after many washings. I highly recommend it and will look to them for our next hoodie purchase."
5.0,"I ordered 5 charms (3 bridesmaids, one maid of honor, and one mother of the bride). They arrived early and I could not be happier with my purchase. I can't wait to give these as Christmas presents!"

5.0,Great customer service! Comfy gloves.
5.0,The product of this brand is very good. Did not expect Amazon have discount
5.0,"At its price, its a steal in my opinion. The band feels nice on the wrist, and has many perforations in the band: which allows it to fit comfortability on most wrists. I like how this watch combines many different colors, the bright red contrasts quite nicely against the blue watch face. I would definitely recommend this to a friend."
5.0,These gloves are perfect mild temperature gloves for running. I use them for temps in the min 20's to mid 30's and they are great.

5.0,"This shirt is very soft and comfortable. I bought an XL and it fits perfectly and it's not clingy or tight, just like I like tee shirts. I love the design."
5.0,"Exactly as pictured. Material is like that climacool material you find with sportswear, it's soft and cool.<br />It's almost swimsuit material.<br />Fits fine, you can actually totally get away with wearing the top part out like a crop top."
5.0,"Nice product. Fabric has that buttery feel. Stretchy. True to size. Great neutral nude shade of pink. I thought it fit great. Support liner was enough for me. performed well during my workout. I’d wear it outside the gym too, I’d recommend! For reference I’m 36C, 28 waist"
5.0,So far - great looking watch for the money!
5.0,I have a Anushka wallet from many years ago.  It is very! worn but I still get compliments!!  The new wallet is just as beautiful but designed differently the card slots are not both  vertical but one is horizontal.  I measured the wallets and the old version is a tad longer.  The problem is getting credit cards in and out of slots it very difficult.  The vertical side works fine.  I would say go back to original design. I still rate a 5 because you cannot find quality construction like this at this price and I love the artwork. I would say still purchase it is a statement!!
5.0,Perfect for me! I have to cover all tattoos waist up for work. Doesn't make my wrist hot.
5.0,"My wife is 5'3"" and ~130lbs and typically wears Medium or a Size 6/8 and she states the fitment here is as expected for a Medium size.<br /><br />She likes the coloring and style and overall fitment. She LOVES the pockets here.<br /><br />(Sorry I have no idea why some of the pics are rotated) She stated she would wear spanx under this and she said it was a flattering dress to her."
5.0,We love them and they will be perfect for our honeymoon. . I'm not sure if the little one would serve as a carry-on but we shall see
5.0,3 year old granddaughter loves her birthday present
5.0,Worked color was great just wasn’t a good day put my son to rest
5.0,Very good quality and very nice looking. Not heavy at all.
5.0,Love color and style of this bracelet!
5.0,Fits well! You might have to fiddle with the straps for it to hold your chest in and have someone help you with the tie in the back but otherwise it's great!
5.0,A beautiful belt!!
5.0,Love the look feels great
5.0,I ordered these for my boyfriend as a gift - he wanted joggers for hiking and camping but he’s outstandingly fussy. We also live in Arizona so while it gets brisk - I didn’t want anything too thick or fleece-lined and these fit all of those requirements. He tried them on immediately and they fit like a glove. He was raving about how comfortable they are and hasn’t stopped praising them ever since!
5.0,"I absolutely love this top. I purchased white, and it’s sheer, which I love! I am buying the yellow too!"
5.0,"Umm... I love these leggings 😍!! They are super comfortable. They hold you in but don’t feel like most compression leggings, not too restrictive. I was able to bend, squat and move freely while not worrying if they are see through (they aren’t). I’m 5’4” 155pds. I typically wear a L bottom, which is what I ordered and they fit great."
5.0,These are just so cute! They are perfect to go with my fall wardrobe.  They came in a great case to protect the glasses.
5.0,"Big volume, good material - best value for money"
5.0,"I’ve had a few of these sweat vest before but non have been like this one. Love the fact that it’s barely noticeable under my shirt. The sweat doesn’t leak through so my shirt is not drenched in sweat. Very comfortable like wearing an under shirt. Definitely a great add on to any workout or cardio day. Buy it, you won’t be disappointed."
5.0,Perfect set for a 5 year old veterinarian. The material is soft and a little thin. The arms of the lab coat were slightly long. After a wash/dry they were the perfect length for my girl.
5.0,Brought them for my granddaughter. Good quality. Can't wait till she see's them on XMAS morning. I also ordered the robe and Hello Kitty slippers. HELLO KITTY is her HERO!!! LOL
5.0,"Their great can change out , love the price"

5.0,Love it! Fit me 34 D
5.0,Many compliments. Love the way it makes me feel. Wish it came in other colors.
5.0,"Women’s fit, flattering and well made swimsuit material. Exactly as pictured."
5.0,I like the pockets on both sides.
5.0,"Our daughter wanted ""fake"" collars to enhance her shirts.  She says they are really cute & will make her outfits more versatile.  One collar is rounded & the other is pointed.  This gives her a variety.  These are great when you don't want the extra heat of a collared shirt underneath a sweater/pullover."
5.0,Very dainty and nice. I gave it to a friend who wears it on her uniform. It's beautiful!
5.0,Bought the for my husband and he stayed dry.  He is retired and works as a car washer for a supplemental income.  Kept him 98% dry
5.0,My daughter is in love with these shoes and wears them when she plays dress up. They’re good quality but run small.

5.0,"I got this Innova shirt as a gift for a father-in-law in love with disc golf. He wears this shirt out to the course all the time. Looks like great quality, design printed well, would recommend this product to anyone who likes disc golf/Innova products/or buying a gift."
5.0,Love it!!!! Favorite swimsuit I've ever put on!!
5.0,great scarf!
5.0,Great! Thank you!
5.0,Kids loved this and was using till the batteries ran out during the Christmas break. Highly recommend it. A lot of fun for a small price.
5.0,"This came right on time, and it was exactly what I was looking for!"
5.0,"I wear a size 18,I ordered a size 5X,Shineya Women's Solid Color Pullover Hoodie Asymmetric Hem Sweatshirts Dress S-5XL in the wine color,it is perfect.exactly as stated,Nice heavy tee shirt material.It is sewn nicely and the pockets and thumb holes are how they should be...I am 5'5'' and weight 206....Love it!!."
5.0,"This shirt is so comfortable, lightweight, and flowy that it is one of my favorite shirts to wear on  warm summer nights. The material fits loosely and pulls in the cool air keeping you from getting hot and sticky. The colors on the shirt are second to none so bright and vibrant. If you like bright colors you will not be disappointed.  I am a big Guy and the 3 x is just about too big but I don't think if I went down a size, it would still fit as good as it does. I would not change anything about this shirt."
5.0,I bought this bag for a bug out bag it has proven its durability very pleased with it lots of pockets able to carry a large amount of gear seems to balance it out lots of storage perfect backpack for carrying Kel-Tec SUB-2000
5.0,Perfvect for the baby shower!  Thank you!
5.0,"This watch is everything. So sleek looking! At this price, I couldn't pass it up."
5.0,Nana stuff.
5.0,"Perfect for soccer and basketball. Keeps my daughters long hair out of her face, and stays in place."
5.0,"Well made, nice feel to the skin the fabric. I would order this item again. It covers up your bum really well, so no playing peek a boo with your bum and folks. Does not have the snaps on the shoulder, but it's ok. As no iv in at this time."
5.0,"Larger than I thought they’d be, but I’m perfectly okay with it. Was worried about skin sensitivity, but no issues after wearing for a bit — I took them out while showering."
5.0,Simple easy to install and looks great.
5.0,I bought this for my Grandson and he loves it
5.0,"What a difference, highly recommend"
5.0,Comfortable and the cotton is great for the tropics! I wear my usual size
5.0,"This dress is as gorgeous as it looks in the picture, it really accentuates your curves! I love the cut and flow of it. I wore it to my daughters graduation and got alot of compliments. My ONLY complaint with this beautiful dress is its length. Im kind of short, about 5ft 5 or 6 inches, and it drags the floor on me, and I have tripped on it and nearly fell down. I will have to find someone who can hem it up for me because I really love it and want to wear it regularly! But if youre tall, you wont have to worry about the length."
5.0,Fit as expected for my preemie girl (4 pounds).... now at 9 pounds she'll probably only fit into them for another month or so
5.0,"Love these leggings..great fit, washes easily.."
5.0,This was purchased for a family member. She loved it. Colors were bright just like in the picture.
5.0,Absolutely beautiful!!
5.0,"This is a cute mask, and the loops are made to be adjustable.  There is also a metal ""nose pincher"" in the top, and a filter pocket sewn in.  For some reason, the ""t"" is not crossed, but I think people will get the idea.  I just ordered two more.  It took awhile to get this one so hopefully they'll be here sooner in time for early voting, since I signed up for several shifts.  I see the question about the material, I'm no fabric expert but I'm guessing it's cotton, it's not heavy but it is soft and comfortable."
5.0,"used these to fix an old (10+ years) set of bolle vigilante's I also ordered a new set of vigilantes hoping that the ocular insert would fit...it di, So now I have two pair of vigilante's  :)"
5.0,Love that it is stretchy
5.0,I like it ✌🏻
5.0,Very pretty.  Exactly as described.
5.0,"the belt quality is very good, I completely happy what I got as I like the buckle and the soft leather, looks very cool and professional."
5.0,nice lightweigh thin watch.
5.0,FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS!  -CANCELLED!<br /><br />This poster is awesome!
5.0,Really soft. Great color on my skin tone. Cropped not too high. Shocked to see how cute it is
5.0,"The fit was true to size chart, it is a very comfortable dress, can be dressed up or casual look. Overall I really like this dress."
5.0,Very soft and comfortable. Wore them outside in 105 degree temps and didn't overheat like usual. Definitely helps!
5.0,"THEY LOOK SO AMAZING!!! they do have a weird shape though, my feet hurt after a night out in them, but well worth it for the look lol"
5.0,"Amazing tights!! I love the high waistband, material and overall fit. I'm 5'10""  and weigh 172 lbs so I purchased a size large. Excellent purchase!"
5.0,My friends and I had a superhero contest - everybody loved the socks
5.0,Super cute .
5.0,"They fit just a bit on the small side, but otherwise super adorable!!"
5.0,Love love this top. I wish there were more colors as I would buy every one! This is a staple in my closet as it goes with so many things. So pretty on and fits great.
5.0,"Great fitting and very warm. I wore it in -5 degree temps and it keep me nice and warm, but it doesn't feel bulky.  I love the magnetic buttons too."
5.0,"Nice weight to it. Just in case the description doesn't say, the top does not spin."
5.0,"Nice colors, fit properly. Grandson like it alot."
5.0,"It's the real thing, original porsche lenses, I'm so happy with my purchase, love the color and makes your sunglasses looks new 😎"
5.0,These are the cutest stockings ever!  They are a perfect match for my daughters sassy personality and a great fit.
5.0,"Comfortable, easy, OK."
5.0,Great pair of sunglasses and surprisingly comfortable.<br />This is definitely an excellent buy for the money and it is definitely much sturdier than I expected.
5.0,My husband has vein and knee pain he is very pleased with these socks
5.0,Thin but comfy and I’m pleasantly surprised with the embroidery quality.
5.0,"This dress is so pretty! After being disappointed with two other dresses I'd ordered from other sellers, I was pleasantly surprised that this dress matched its description. And it fit perfectly! For reference, I'm 5'4&#34; and about 125 lbs. The medium fit great, but it does lay on the floor. Nothing a pair of heels won't solve. The material may not be chiffon but it feels pretty close, and is a tad softer. I will definitely order other dresses from this brand and seller."
5.0,Absolutely loved this outfit for my daughters 1st birthday. Great quality. Had no issues. It does run big. My daughter is about 20lbs and it was a little big around her waist. The neck has a long ribbon so very adjustable. We didn’t use the leg warmers.
5.0,Good quality pair of sandals.
5.0,"I used this product to stretch leather ladies shoes that rubbed a blister  in my pinky toes, but we’re sooo cute. The product stretched my shoes and left the leather conditioned. The product was appropriately packaged. The delivery was prompt. Saved my pricey shoes and made me a happy customer!"
5.0,This mask is awesome.  Son loves it
5.0,"Great sweater .. comfortable , warm and looks good"
5.0,I absolutely love this necklace and have worn out at least once a week since I have gotten it!
5.0,"I use this as my overnight bag working graveyard at the hospital and it’s so pretty, always get comments on it, and everything fits into it, and then some. Lol"
5.0,BEAUTIFUL!!! LOOK GREAT!!
5.0,Soft n so pretty. My 2yr has grown out of it but she still want to squeeze herself into this sweater
5.0,Beautiful beads! And they arrived quickly!
5.0,I purchased these for my women’s club officers. I will be using them at the end of the year as a thank you. They’re actually quite nice and come with  giftable bags
5.0,Great bags I like the way they store in itself.
5.0,Love the feel and fit
5.0,This material/fabric is good a quality! Felt perfect as soon as I put it on. There’s no padding in it but it still had enough support and comfort.
5.0,Beautiful..
5.0,"I love them , fit perfect and very comfy :)"
5.0,mom loved it
5.0,"I thought I was done with polos until I saw this fabric and 3/4 sleeves on a polo.  Then I changed my mind. The fabric, the design, and the look of the shirt with its cute flowers is so cheerful and perfect for an Arizona Spring.  Thanks for offering it on Amazon. A size 2x is what fits me best"
5.0,Muy bueno me gusta
5.0,Love the fabric and fit. Not too short. Perfect
5.0,This watchband was just what I was looking for. Pretty watchband with plenty of room to expand if needed.
5.0,The red mudman rocks. IMHO this is the most appealing colour for mudman G-9300 type watches. I always wanted to add a mudman to my humble G Shock collection but the black colour never appealed finally found this Sep 2014 release mudman and bought it. I love it..
5.0,"Fits to size, soft and color as pictured."
5.0,"I love these shirts. They feel good to the skin, they fit comfortable, and they are true to size."
5.0,everything is great
5.0,"This dress is a trendy style and cut. It’s just sparkly enough to shimmer without being too loud. I love that it’s NOT a sequin dress, but sparkle right in the fabric. It’s very soft and comfortable.<br />The dress comes around mid-thigh for me. I’m about 5’4” and 140 for reference.<br />The dress seems like it would be see-through but it’s really not under any normal circumstances. Of course, if you wear super dark panties there might be a small hint of that, but I’m very pleased overall and feel no slip is needed.<br />It washes well and is decently priced for the quality and appearance."
5.0,Worked great for a Halloween costume. For my 14 month old perfectly.
5.0,Great shirt for a fan
5.0,definitely will buy from this seller. great product!
5.0,I recently bought this meter for the studio I work at on occasion.. I have owned other Sekonic meters over the years and the 308s does not disappoint. 5 stars !!
5.0,Sooo adorable. Fits great. Now only if they made adult sizes too!
5.0,It fits my husband perfectly!
5.0,It not to small and not to big just like one of the other post that for the necklace. I love it no matter what because I been trying find a cross and I found it. I appreciate the rate for this cross. So whoever buy this I hope you do not be disappoint because I love it
5.0,This is the perfect color. It’s so soft & comfortable!!
5.0,"Love 'em. Wonderful feel. Roomy comfort, and feels like the wicking wis working.  The cuff is snug, but it stays put with all-night fidgeting. Cute design, so all in all I'm sleeping easier."
5.0,I loved the quality of these joggers and it’s soft and comfortable.
5.0,It was really cute! I gave it to my sister in law as a Christmas gift!
5.0,GET COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME!
5.0,"I love the size, its big enough to hold all my work papers. Wish the wallet would hold my cards better."
5.0,Beautiful silk and lovely print! Great Quality for the price! Feels so soft on my skin !
5.0,I can see clearly now
5.0,My son had broken the original belt. With this was super easy to replace.
5.0,My son breakdances and the shoes he wears should not slip nor be open toes. These are perfect for wearing in the summer as they let his feet breathe.
5.0,"Very nice! All is good - fabric, design and it observes sweat very well and you don't even feel it on your head!"
5.0,Very good quality!  Meet all expectations!  10 star review in my book!!!!!
5.0,"After wearing these for a while, I can’t imagine going back to a standard belt. Really enjoy changing sizes by smaller increments and not having belts “die” because they are bent, and one hole is worn out. Btw, no one notices the difference  in this belt’s appearance."
5.0,Extremely comfortable and the material is thick enough that a slip isn't required.
5.0,Nice jersey for a knock off
5.0,Very nice! Fit true to size. Came very quickly!
5.0,"My daughter is 10, 61 inches tall and 96lbs and the size small is very roomy but that’s how she likes her pants to fit. She thinks the pants are comfortable and she loves the rainbow stripes down the side. These pants have been worn and washed often and they are holding up beautifully."
5.0,"This is a neat idea. My kid likes cuddly stuff toys so he doesn't even use it like a hoodie. So defeated to purpose of the purchase. Haha. However, great quality, fits well. A bit bulky in the hood part as the puppy fits in there when converted"
5.0,Perfect I love it
5.0,Runs a little tight but very cute and solid quality!
5.0,These are super comfy and perfect for me while at work. The mitten part buttons back very easily. Plus they're cute!
5.0,"I like my band and wear it for my everyday band and on trips. So reasonably priced, I’m not worried if I lose it."
5.0,"Great quality, looks good and feels good"
5.0,Have had these for about a couple weeks now and I have nothing to say but positive things. Great price for polarized glasses that float and look really great. Highly recommended.
5.0,I love my keychain it’s cute and made very well!!
5.0,This shirt is so soft. The vibrant colors are so pretty. It fits true to size. I did not size up or down and it fits fine. Can't wait for the weather to be cold enough to wear it.
5.0,"So far this wallet is awesome for me, its big, but I like my wallets big so it's okay. Although it is not the one on the picture though. It was actually a zipper one and had the card slots on the sides. I thought I was gonna have an issue with that but I ended up liking the wallet a lot."
5.0,These are pretty much to the sizing that they give in the chart. I ordered to their specs and to my surprise they actually fit me very well. I will say that the length of the shorts are just a bit shorter than what ii expected but then again i am taller than they more than likely make these for.
5.0,"I had heard about pickpockets when traveling especially in Rome and Florence and liked the idea of having my money or phone or keys close to me.  The color was great and looked good with black, white and (surprise!) wine colored tops.  It was warm and I especially when it was windy.  It was great to keep my phone close when I was using it to take pictures.  I spilled dark chocolate gelato on it and stains washed right out and it dried really fast.  My only suggestion is use a zipper that matches the fabric as the black zipper shows through the fabric and please please make this in other colors!  Black would be great or Black/white,  or Two tones of blue, like Turquoise and royal blue!  But this is a keeper!  Price was better than the shouldit brand."
5.0,Extremely Soft and Slinky to the touch!  5yr old LOVES them.  The supportive waist band keeps them up over the top of his backside!!!  No plumber's crack!  Medium length on legs.  Will buy again!!!
5.0,"The all metal construction and durability is great. For 6 months I've had a AAA flashlight and extra battery, small leatherman, ferro rod, small fixed blade, whistle, bottle opener and cabin key hanging from it with no problems. It's hanging on the outside of my travel bag and with me Tuesday thru Friday, in and out of the car each day. It's with me at my campsite on most weekends for the whole day. Each tool can be removed individually too, which is convenient using the leatherman, ferro rod and cabin key. I trust it holding over $100 of tools, loose on the outside of the bag so it's easy for me to recommend this keychain."
5.0,Cute dress. It fits nicely. The color doesn’t really match the picture but still attractive.
5.0,"I’ve owned these slippers for about 5 years, wear them constantly, and still love them. They’re worth every penny!!"
5.0,I love it!!!!!!
5.0,"Length was perfect, needed one longer than regular ties and this one did the trick! Plus loved the skull print and was well made."
5.0,"AWESOME JACKET!  It was 18 degrees out and it Kept me very warm!  Fit perfectly!  Very true to size.  I bought it in 2 colors to see which I preferred, Gold won but so easy to return the other one!  What you expect for a prime order- Fantastic customer support and excellent product!  Lots of compliments:)"
5.0,Love the look and the comfort.  These glasses really block the brightness without making everything so dark that I can't see to drive!
5.0,"I love this watch! Let me say first that no, it's not a Rolex but for under 100.00 it is far, far, superior to other Rolex &#34;tribute&#34; watches out there. This timepiece is very solid and substantial, you feel in on your wrist. The 40mm case, for me, is just the right size although if you want a bigger case the grand diver series is available. Very accurate but will loose a few seconds each day, but so what? for under a 100.00 bucks that is nothing! Totally waterproof...if there is water in it, you didn't screw the crown down. This is my third Invicta and I'll get a fourth. I have a Rolex submariner and wear it only very occasionally because I worry about damaging or loosing it...The first time you whack your Rolex against something and this happens in real life...It feels like you get punched in the face and you cringe upon finding that first small scratch! I don't have this issue with the Invicta. I wear the watch...it doesn't wear me! Some small gripes; The bracelet is rather cheap and the friction pins have come loose and move on one of my watches, causing the bracelet to separate and the watch to fall off...That sucked, but I caught it, pulled apart the pin a bit, and put it back together right at the table. It never happened again. I get as many compliments on this piece as on my Rolex...This will be your everyday go to piece with 99% of the Rolex aura and 0% of the Rolex angst."
5.0,Love love love! Not cheap! Not see through. The fabric is soft and thick. At first I thought i had ordered the wrong blouse but I realized I was wearing it the wrong way. The back is squared at the neck. It’s so flattering and really hides anything you don’t want to show. I went with an xl but I think a large would have worked out fine.
5.0,"I like the looks, fits my wishes"
5.0,"Only used one of them so far, but overall that was a good purchase; good quality."
5.0,This is a great dress that is great for night events and business. I wear small size and am 5.1 and this dress fit me perfectly. I was worried that it be too long for me but after wearing it I was it came right under my knees. The short slit bottom makes it very easy to sit and walk. I really like the short sleeves it makes it look really nice. The whole dress is very classy and stylish!
5.0,"I am 222lb with some weight more focused on my belly and thighs, 5'2&#34; tall, and bought 3x. I love them but they are really long because I bought the biggest size based on other reviews. I will definitely buy more but in a 1x next time. I love the ones I have despite how long they are on me. Very comfy and I love that they have adjustable straps."
5.0,Beautiful and useful bead
5.0,five star
5.0,I love the fit of this dress. It’s perfect and leaves room for growth.
5.0,Tal y como vienen excelente diseño y calidad
5.0,Love these!  Needed then to wear under my scrubs because I'm  always freezing. They ate perfect!
5.0,Love it. Has weight so nice. Thank you
5.0,"I love this dress, received a lot of compliments! My sister even bought this dress after seeing it on me."
5.0,love t
5.0,"I love this purse.  It is great looking, perfect color, enough pockets and compartments and I get more compliments on this purse.  I actually went looking for it because I saw someone else with it.  Their's was another color combination but I love my black and red.  Would definitely recommend."
5.0,This watch band is very nice
5.0,"Great clutch for daily use. My wife uses it to carry all her credit cards and cash as well as some small makeup items.<br />She likes it because it isn’t as bulky as many of her other purses and bags.<br />Comes with a strap to wear as a small purse.<br /><br />Hope this review was helpful, let me know if you have any questions."
5.0,This dress is adorable. I’m 5’7 and about 140lbs - the size small is perfect. I’m very happy with this dress. It hits me right above the knees. It’s comfotable and casual. Love it!
5.0,Great piece !
5.0,Fits great and very comfortable! My son was very happy with it.  Love it!
5.0,"As many know, the larger you stretch, the fewer cute earring options you have, especially at traditional retailers like Hottopic, which is where I generally get my plugs. I was a little apprehensive purchasing these - I worried they would be silver, or some weird material and not stainless steel at all. Boy, was I wrong. I purchased a few different pairs from Casvort and was super pleased with every pair! They are high quality, unique and alleviate what little bit of envy I had for people that could wear normal, cute dangly earrings! :] I highly recommend them!!!"
5.0,It’s comfortable and not as thick as normal apple bands.
5.0,kinda start to fall apart
5.0,"I bought this to wear to work, I don't like wearing my actual wedding ring (too big for the work I do). I work in surgery, so it isn't too big, doesn't hurt my finger while wearing gloves for many hours a day. Wear it every day and even with constantly washing my hands, it hasn't turned my finger green. It was very good priced and I am very pleased with this product. It looks real too! I have received many compliments on it."
5.0,"This fits perfectly, and the cut between the choker and the chest area is not too deep making it appropriate for work.  The material is of excellent quality but is a little too thick for the warmer seasons but is perfect for the fall and winter or even for a cold office environment."
5.0,Get more asap
5.0,"Perfect size for my smaller oval shaped face. Excellent clear lenses. It's my 2nd pair of Persol's , they are probably the best lenses of any of the high end sun glasses I own."
5.0,"Bought for my daughter! It is adorable on her, she really likes it! Good quality and comfy shirt!"
5.0,I order theses earnings for my baby but whenever they cam i loved them so much i kept them for me lol sorry baby girls
5.0,"In 2017, I bought this coat in a size M in blue and in tan. I also sized up and bought a size L in the blue (to allow for layering). I decided that I wanted to purchase the tan coat in a size L, in December 2018. The coat came, and I was super excited to see that the coat comes with a zipper! Last year, all of the coats were simply snap closures. The addition of the zipper makes the fit more streamlined. It's also warmer. I love it! Needless to say that I am going to purchase this 2018 version of the blue coat in a size L."
5.0,"Very stylish! The quality is great and the pattern is well printed, doesnt look cheap! I have a small waist compared to my butt, but the skirt didnt look like it was &#34;stretched&#34; when I wore it. The company needs to get more patterns available so i can buy more!"
5.0,"I love it, very simple yet elegant. Very delicate."
5.0,Very happy with t shirt.
5.0,"Purchased the light brown sweater, and the kids were fighting over it so I purchased the light pink sweater as well.  It looks so cute on them.  The buttons are hidden and gives it a upscale look.  Overall a beautiful product!!!"
5.0,"These are fun! Smaller than the typical pocket squares, but that's really not a problem. In fact, you an use 2 -3 at a time for an interesting effect. Good range of colors.  I get a lot of compliments when using them."
5.0,Mask is very pretty and fits nicely over my face. I love the tie feature cause it takes pressure off the ears make them much easier to wear for extended periods of time. These are also double layered so you but yet are still breathable. All in all very comfortable.
5.0,I love the infinity shape and the engraving.  I love this necklace.
5.0,Perfect fit and dress for a little girl

5.0,"Super comfy, sexy and a pleasure to wear."
5.0,"Love! These really fit any size. Hard to explain but they fall perfect and the waist somehow stretches to fit. I could be 30 lbs. bigger or smaller and they'd still fit awesome. Best part,  does NOT wrinkle no matter what."

5.0,I love my beautiful dress and it fits perfectly!!!
5.0,Fabric nice.
5.0,"Perfect for work or to dress up a skirt or jeans. Very nice top, very soft. It is baggy, so if not tucking in, will need to front tuck. Thick, 2 layers, so can't see through and see my bra. I got a Large so it would fit over my breasts. (F / 5'4"" / 155 lbs)."
5.0,Handsome piece of jewelry.  Wear everyday and still as beautiful as day one.
5.0,I received this glasses pretty quickly and I am impressed with how they look in person. I have had them for about a year and they're still in excellent condition. I'd definitely recommend these. I will be ordering more very soon.
5.0,Nice weight material for fall and winter - looks great with leggings - true to size - I'm 5 ft 4 in. and weight 114 - small frame - age 79.  It is made very well with nice stitching.  Would buy another if there were more colors.
5.0,Nice comfortable fitting dress
5.0,"These masks are really made for folks with GIANT heads. I’m a large guy, (6’1, over 350lbs) and these masks make me feel small. It’s awesome that they cover so much of my face. The only real issue I’ve had is with my glasses, but even that isn’t too bad. They feel great, wash really well and even do a good job filtering out smoke!  I’m buying more of these… just in a smaller size."
5.0,"PajamaJeans are the greatest!! I broke my arm and I am “one-handed”. I have to wear clothes that can pull on/off and I desperately wanted a pair of jeans that didn’t have to be buttoned and zipped. (All I had was sweat pants!!) My husband found PajamaJeans on Amazon so he ordered me one pair. I assumed they would be “ok” jeans that I would give away once my arm was healed. NOT SO!!! Not only are they comfortable, they look GREAT on me and people constantly ask if I have lost weight!! I now own 4 pairs of PajamaJeans and that’s another thing: they are affordable!! I love PajamaJeans and plan to wear them now and long after my broken arm is healed!"
5.0,Perfect hoops for everyday wear!
5.0,Great bra but definitely handwash gently!

5.0,I love the quality of the material.  The size is true.  I love the length of the sleeves.
5.0,"I have purchased quite a few different pairs of yoga socks from different manufacturers over the years through Amazon. These are the best I have come across so far. They are soft, stretchy without creating holes or snags, and durable. I recommend this product."
5.0,"Perfect fit, washable, cute patterns, definitely high quality - i would highly recommend"
5.0,I love the dress! It doesn't look cheap at all. I got a lot of compliments!
5.0,"Guys usually don’t get to wear “beachy” clothes.  Women always have their bikinis and cover ups, but guys just a pair of swim trunks.  Well, that’s no longer true.  This flowy shirt will transform you into a beach boy the moment you put it on.  Great beachy style for men that’s been lacking for so long.  Nice find."

5.0,"Velcro strap on the back, nice hat. Got it for my 92 year old WW2 veteran father, he likes it."
5.0,"Love these, just note these are very much leggings though…which means they definitely hug your body. *A note for guys, if you’re on the upper end of average when flaccid..they can look explicit in brighter lighting without a cup. To be more specific, while I was wearing a thinner athletic type material boxer briefs under these, on a sunny day with lots of natural lighting, other people could literally see if I’m circumcised.<br />I didn’t want to wear the cup initially because the crotch bulge is more noticeable from a variety of angles, but that is definitely preferable to strangers being able to make out details of your anatomy. Trust me…wear the cup."
5.0,Very nice and love the style and quality. Will order more
5.0,"I had a lot of people asking where I got these!  I don't regularly wear heels, but these were comfortable and supportive enough for me to wear to two weddings with minimal discomfort.  They're a perfect mix of trendy and classic, which makes them super versatile.  Paired with a solid color dress and a statement necklace or earrings, you've got the perfect &#34;going out&#34; attire."
5.0,The fit great very comfortable washable
5.0,A bit too big but I still like it

5.0,I needed red necklace this is perfect
5.0,"I had to have this. Snake skin is in and i love this bag. I bought it at Macy's for $192.00 on sale.<br />This is like my black Julia bag. I always buy black bags or brown and needed to get out of my comfort zone.<br />I decided to go for it and i wasn't disappointed. Nice bag and the canvas material makes it unique. I thought it might look cheap but it<br />meshed quite well. Mk is so versatile,functional and fun!"
5.0,It's nice size bag. I like the pocket on the front. I really like the material

5.0,"Cute if you are into camo, as my son is. Arrived quickly and was packaged nicely. Would recommend."
5.0,"I bought two of these for my daughter's birthday presents. I ended up keeping one and giving one to my best friend so had to buy two more. So cute, fancy and feels pretty fancy on my wrist. Love it for sure and you can't beat the price! Will definitely look for more of their creations."
5.0,very stylish
5.0,loved it! but no box provided
5.0,"This coat is fantastic! I was skeptical that such an inexpensive piece could really look good and fit well, but it’s a keeper. The fabric has a bit of stretch so it’s easy to wear and fits well. For reference, I’m 5’8” and about 150 lbs and I got a medium."
5.0,"Solid, and the clip spring is strong."
5.0,I love it fit that I expect thank you so much
5.0,Love this necklace! It came packaged in a pretty velvet pouch delivery was fast and its the perfect size heart to wear stacked with other necklaces and look just right but also alone for a more delicate look ordered it in the green color but will definitely be purchasing the other colors too!

5.0,Great material and came with a bunch of sticker
5.0,"I purchased this item as a gift for a friend who tattoos. The leather is genuine and the construction is quite sturdy and well made, its easy to clean and doesn't get in the way or feel overly heavy like a welding apron. The adjustable straps make it easy to size to fit as well and features multiple pockets with steel rings to hang such tools as a hammer. Overall im quite pleased with this purchase as it was exactly as advertised, arrived on the correct date and met my own personal expectations. I would do buisness again here and if your in the market for a similar apron id personally suggest this one for your consideration for the forementioned reasons."

5.0,Shipped fast. Love this product very good price.
5.0,Absolutely in love! It is so delicate and pretty!
5.0,Got these for my granddaughters so their earrings won’t fall off so easily. The screw backs are perfect. The first two of the largest earrings are too big for them so I kept them for myself. They’re very nice quality.
5.0,"I usually wear a small in leggings, I’m 5’3 115 lbs. I decide to go with an XS in these leggings and they are perfect! No pulling up, even in a cardio class! Love the color"
5.0,I'm in LOVE with this dress!!!! It's very well made and fits like a dream! I wore it to a wedding and got so many compliments. I can't wait to wear it again.
5.0,"I had to come on here and post a review. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this item. I was prepared for disappoint due to previous experience with other brands. 8 just reviewed this item today, so I'm not sure about the long term. But it is thick, it is comfortable, and the clip attaches securely. The only left to do now is find and order this brand in more colors!!!"
5.0,Not supported but didn't expect that after reading reviews. Still love the top. 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻

5.0,"Truly love this shokers, they are exactly what I wanted and expected, very happy with it."
5.0,"I have size 5.5 feet, so I washed and dried before wearing otherwise they would have been too big."
5.0,"So many things about these 90 Degree leggings that make them a terrific buy!  Overnight they became my favorite leggings!  1. The length and fit are flattering -- long capri.  2. The weight is really substantial!  No chance of any see-through misadventures with these.  3.  The fabric stays lint-free.  I have some other Amazon leggings that, while they're a good price and are very flattering, pick up lint.  So I use a lint roller on them.  Which is a bit of a drag.  But not these 90 Degrees leggings.  4.  Beautiful color -- Blue Moon.  5.  Wash super well.  I got olive oil on them last night and just chucked them into the washer along with other items and they came out beautifully.  6.  Finally, they're a great workout pant.  I cannot be more pleased.  I'm 5.3, 125 lbs., and bought size XS."
5.0,Love the look and the way it feels on my arm. Very versatile and can wear with pretty much anything.
5.0,Love this outfit. Very cute and fits great.

5.0,perfect jewelry set so pretty
5.0,LOVE these leggings! Ordered more and they are arriving Monday. Have worn long and cuffed into capris. These are buttery soft and I am a legging snob :) GET THEM! You won't be disappointed.
5.0,Baby girl was 7lbs and they fit her perfect.
5.0,Got it a week earlier than suggested arrival date. I'm 5'7. My legs are super long and bigger so I got large and it fits perfectly! Also good material. Not see through like I thought it would be!
5.0,Beautiful dress. I got so many compliments. I wore it to a wedding. I would recommend. I wore a large.
5.0,Great T shirt! Awesome gamer design logo.....
5.0,"LOVE this watch band! it’s stretchy and cute AND SIZE ADJUSTABLE!! my watch bands stretch a lot because i constantly take it off and put it back on, so this feature is a GAME CHANGER. love this product and can’t wait to get more in more colors!!"
5.0,Wearing these as I write this. At first I didn't believe they were going to fit but obviously the spandex made me a believer. They fit great and look nice.
5.0,"My wife said: I was surprised by the reliability of these sticky bras. They stayed on very well, and you don't have that sticky feeling afterwards. It comes with two bras for different coverage and shape needs. They were the solution all those clothing items in my closet that are not bra friendly. This way I feel more confident with the sticky bras then not wearing a bra at all."
5.0,nice gift for my self
5.0,Nice quality fabric
5.0,Adorable. Well made and not cheap looking.
5.0,fantastic shirt
5.0,"I’m going to start by saying I did NOT receive a discount on this product in return for a review.<br />I asked for this purse as a gift for Christmas as a transition from my diaper bag backpack to a purse backpack.<br />It’s beautiful and I love it!<br />I can fit my wallet, a small bottle of hand lotion, my lip balm and other various small items, along with a full pack of wipes, 3-4 diapers, 3 pacifiers, a toddler snack, my keys, and phone, without it looking like it’s over-stuffed. It’s perfect!<br />It also feels and looks more expensive than it actually is.<br />My only gripe, which is a small one, is that my iPhone 8 plus in a slim Incipio case fits a little too snuggly in the back zippered pocket, so I’ll have to keep it in the front pocket or inside the purse. It’s not a big deal though because I didn’t even realize there would be a back zippered pocket.<br />I really like how the inside is divided in half by another zipped pocket, so I can keep it in there to keep the screen protected from rubbing up against other purse items.<br />I was pleasantly surprised to find a card in the purse, from the company, claiming there’s a one year warranty on the purse. So that’s nice.<br />I’m definitely happy with this purchase/gift and would purchase from this company again."
5.0,Arrived in a timely matter and the quality of the earrings are great.<br />And got a free extra pair of earrings.
5.0,So comfy and cute!
5.0,"The materials, leather and stitching, are high quality.  Other reviewers have reported that their stitching is coming apart (?)  Really?!  I'm not a particularly gentle guy and I can't imagine a scenario where this thing doesn't last 10 years.<br /><br />Very comfy in my front pocket of my pants or suit jacket.<br /><br />Cards stay accessible and don't disappear down in the wallet -  so you can grab them, even a fudge finger like me has no trouble.  Never going back to a traditional bifold.<br /><br />EDIT After a year, still going strong."
5.0,Great Item! Delivered on time
5.0,very warm!
5.0,Bought it for wife who loves size and comfort of it
5.0,"Great comfortable bra, great price."
5.0,I cannot reiterate how much I love this dress. I bought it to propose to my husband in and it still fits fantastically a year later. The picture makes it look like it flares out but without anything under it it just hangs. However it looks great even just hanging. If I can dig up a pictureI will post it.<br /><br />I am 5'2 and it goes down to my knees. I am a larger lady and it forms nicely to my chest and just really enhances my figure. I use to worry about buying clothes online but I have had better experiences online than in person at this point.<br /><br />Just be careful ironing it! It may have just been user error but when I ironed it apparently I did not move fast enough and it left an iron mark. I wear it as a badge of honor and a reminder of an amazing day. Luckily the mark does not stand out too much but if you look at it closely you can see the iron print completely.
5.0,"It's like a picture. Somewhat large, but beautiful."
5.0,Bought these for my husband when the insoles in his boots went out. He says these are extremely comfortable.
5.0,"Use at work, lots of compliments"
5.0,It was great and a gift for my grandson
5.0,These are the most comfortable disposable masks I’ve found with tons of fun patterns
5.0,This was adorable.  Also a gift for a 13 year old.  She loved it and immediately clipped it to her backpack
5.0,"This top is thicker than you would think. I can wear a regular bra with the top, which is good for me, but I can also wear a racerback. It has a nice look to it and I like the cold shoulder look."
5.0,Shipped fast. As advertised
5.0,These are great! Think material and fit nice! Love the high rise. I ordered large and x-large and both fit really well!
5.0,"Update - After posting my original review, I was contacted by Jason at Tillak right away. He assured me that the hat had a manufacturing issue as he was able to review the photos I posted and offered to send out a replacement right away. Since this happened to 2 different hats, he sent out 2 new ones of the latest model, which had a better quality design. We got the replacement hats quickly and my son loves them.  We are 4 months in and they have held up very well. I’ve also put it in the wash and they still look brand new. The new design has mesh sides which my son loves.<br />Jason at Tillak was concerned, prompt and very genuine. So happy with the purchase and we will look at Tillak for their other products. Thank you.<br /><br />——————————————————<br /><br />Bought this for my son, as he loves 5 panel hats.<br />He wore it most days for about a month before the side started coming apart from the brim. Not sure if he was too hard on it or if it was poorly made. Regarless, the material is light and easy to clean and he loved the design. I bought a replacement hat for him. Still #1 Mom!<br />If it lasted longer, I would definitely rate 5 stars!"
5.0,"Can’t beat the price for the value!<br />They are very light weight and gift, the  colors are true to the pictures. They run a bit big."
5.0,Beautiful as well as funtional. Bought this Tallit as a gift 🎁 for a young man upon completion of his conversion. He was so proud when I presented this Tallit to him.
5.0,This mask really works great.
5.0,"The belt is really elegant, and thin, and it fits well. Love the design on the clasp, real easy to use, and a great addition to a dress. It is on the narrow side, as I'm a size 0/2 and it fits me snug."
5.0,Durable and warm
5.0,Daughter loved the shirt feel and weight of the shirt. Perfect fit also
5.0,Excited to have these for our guest. Thank you!

5.0,"Love it,,,nice and warm too !!"
5.0,"I love this shirt,i will get more.thank you"
5.0,"The price was great, shoes fit perfectly. Would recommend."
5.0,"Got these shirts for under my scrubs. Most of the other ones I found were cotton and I really didn’t want that. These are perfect! They’re lightweight and breathable. I typically wear smalls or mediums and I decided to get a medium in this to be a little bit looser & it’s perfect! It’s not too tight but it’s not too loose to look weird under my scrubs! The white is a little bit see through but since it’s going under my scrubs, I don’t really care."
5.0,"The dress fits very well, and I was told it was flattering!  It’s comfortable, too!  I need one in every color!"
5.0,"Looks great  The directions are seriously broken english on how to set up the date and time.  The date is real tiny and very hard to read.  It cheapens the overall product, HOWEVER, once set up ot has a good look and a nice heavier feel like you get with a good quality watch."
5.0,My granddaughter just loved them so I’m so happy
5.0,Item in perfect condition.  Worked as promised.  Arrived in a timely manner.
5.0,"These bracelets are made well, have a history meaning with them, and look nice on."
5.0,I love and found the perfect chain for it.
5.0,Very pleased with the wallet. It's high quality and just what I was expecting.
5.0,Exactly as expected. Love the breathable material. Size was a perfect fit.
5.0,"Fit as expected but didn't like how it fit me. My chest is a 38DD and it was a little too snug for comfort. Very good quality, rich color, nice material."
5.0,These party hats are sturdy and don’t break off like others do. So far I’ve used them for both my boys birthday parties. Great purchase!
5.0,"I really love this dress! I got the rainbow flower color, and the fit is perfectly comfortable, not tight, and the length is perfect, right at the knees. I'm 5'6 and 120 lbs. I got so many compliments at work and told them I got the dress on Amazon, and they all agreed it was a great find! I did pair it with a wide waist belt with tassels to give it some flair, and pink velvet shoes."
5.0,Very nice!  My friend loved it!
5.0,"Perfect, I love these shoes!"
5.0,"I love this dress. I brought the blue one.  I'm 5'3&#34; and about 150 lbs. And it fits me perfectly and comfortably! It falls below my knees, which I love. Also it has pockets! OMG! It's professional and bright. Which great cause I work with kids. I'd buy this again in a different color, I love it that much."
5.0,"nice quality, fits good"
5.0,"Great pack, comfortable, and easy to access everything you have packed.  The removable lid is easy to use also the removable hip pockets make this a very versatile pack."

5.0,Got this as a gift and she loves it. Wears it everyday
5.0,Purchased several for friends and one for me.  They are a beautiful way to express your faith.
5.0,"For the price, you can’t get any better than this.<br />It looks like leather, although feel is more like vinyl. It fits the watch perfectly, there’s no material sticking out. Very light weight.<br />It looks sleek enough to not stand out much, which is what I like. A subtle version of leather Apple Watch band.<br /><br />For what it’s worth, it’s good and very affordable option to have to keep your watch band interesting. I might get the other fabric surface watch band as well, just to have a couple to switch out to match color of outfit."
5.0,"I got this shirt for my son, who loves quirky shirts. Some of these MJORI shirts are a bit much, but this fits his style nicely.<br /><br />Basically, it's a smiley face with MJORI acting as the teeth. It's not just a smiley face though, it also is rainbow reflective, providing just enough weirdness to make the shirt stand out. I got him the black version, as the white version doesn't contrast enough to really show off the rainbow effect."
5.0,"This was a gift for my son, a computer programmer. He absolutely loves wearing this watch. He loves showing it off and the confusion on people's faces when they see it!"
5.0,Love the feel the look wearing it for a month and a half I unload trucks no changes didn't turn at all still look like I got it really love this chain.....yes I would get another one ....
5.0,Perfect for my Man City club fan.
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for. I wear it on left middle finger. Easy to adjust to any other finger.<br />Beautiful in person. I get a lot compliments.<br /><br />*****UPDATE****<br />Sadly this ring broke. It’s thin, it couldn’t handle daily wear.(sad face). Better for occasional wear, not daily."
5.0,My son loves his hat so much! Great buy!
5.0,Fit is perfect and the frames are very stylish.
5.0,"The purse is a perfect size for a large wallet, phone, keys, glasses and plenty of room for much more. I love that there’s a shoulder strap.  The purse and strap are of high quality."
5.0,Cute retro watch and extremely affordable price. This is a great as a fashion accessory.
5.0,Still using second season
5.0,Looks nice and has good polarization. Came with two cases as well!
5.0,Using this tough carryall bag to haul logs in from outside.  It can carry 8 or so logs.  it really cuts down on the mess in the house because all the wood chips are contained in this bag.  it is very sturdy.  really happy with purchase.
5.0,It fits good but only when I put a plastic cup type thing on under it but that mainly to breathe easier and have the mask on.
5.0,THEY WERE A GIFT FOR SOMEONE.SHE LOVED THEM!
5.0,"I have to be honest, I didn't pay attention, I thought everyone was coming, not just one. However, the one who arrived has excellent finishes."
5.0,Perfect Buy this was a hit for my daughter 2 year old party.
5.0,Item arrived REALLY FAST and was exactly what I wanted
5.0,"My wife loves these pants. They are a little thicker than the plaid pants from boxercraft, but the quality and fit is perfect. And they arelong in length which as a tall girl she loves. Only complained she has that they don't come in more colors."
5.0,My husband loves this thing for shoveling in Minnesota winters.
5.0,I love this sweater.  Had been looking for a lavender sweater & this one is perfect.  Fits perfectly & so soft.
5.0,I feel like the Terminator when I wear these shades.
5.0,"Bought these for my husband to wear under his work clothes because he wanted to keep from sweating into them and the plain white undershirts he was wearing just were not cutting it.  These shirts work like a charm.  It's like they absorb your sweat and help keep you cool and dry.  Not only does he wear them under his work clothes, he wears them other occasions too by themselves.  I would prefer that he wear a smaller size but he likes it when they're a bit loose. To each their own!"
5.0,"Fit well and look great! I have other glasses that cost more than double, and these are just as good. Great for partly cloudy days where the light changes."
5.0,"Purchased as a gift for a very beautiful girl, but it is probably a gift for her bedroom partner.  She has told me since that it is f***ing cute af. And to give this product 5 stars."
5.0,purchased for granddaughter's 18th birthday....she loved it!  appears to be good quality
5.0,"Love the dress, light weight and color was what I expected."
5.0,"I have ordered this set twice now simply because I lost all my hoops the first time. I really like the size of these. A lot of other brands that I have tried are smaller and fit closer to the nostril. It makes them nor stand out as much and I love my nose piercing so I want everyone to see it I mean, that is the point right? They are good quality as well I just have a big problem with &#34;misplacing&#34; them when I wash my face or sleep etc. I like the studs too they are great for when I ama at work, the stone is not too big to where it looks goddy it looks just right. Instead of buying something else when I lose all my hoops again I will probably just stick with these! I would prefer them over a dozen others that I have tried (:"
5.0,These are great.  Love the designs too.
5.0,Love these. Reminded me of the story &#34;The Mitten&#34;. I hope I don't loose One in the snow.
5.0,This is so much more comfortable than the regular band and still measures just as accurately.
5.0,I loved it. Bought it for my daughter. It fit comfortably and looked very pretty
5.0,"Such a wonderful surprise!  It fits perfect!  As a 48 year old mom, I appreciate the coverage this two piece offers!  Ok ordered a second suit immediately!"
5.0,I'm 5.3 125 lbs. the small fits perfect. The fabric is nice. I love them so much I bought 2 more packs.
5.0,"Awesome thanks! Heavy, seems well made. I like it"
5.0,"great buy, they are comfortable and pretty"
5.0,I loved this top so much that i bought it in another color.  I have not washed them yet so if there are issues I will update this review.  So far so good.
5.0,the blue buffing side made my gold sparkle
5.0,Unbelievable! The ring looks better than the pictures. It has some weight to it. The stone is clear and well cut.
5.0,"I liked this product because it met my expectations, it is precisely what I was looking for so that my whole family is ready for the summer since the sun can be very harmful and because I think that children should have extra sun protection and that protection is what gives me this bathing suit from head to toe."
5.0,It’s soft warm and fits good
5.0,"I purchased this watch on a Marine base in San Diego.  The reason I had to purchase a watch was that my Timex Helix (which was supposed to be water resistant) fogged up after running a mile and a half.  After getting in touch with Timex, I was told that it would cost $50 for them just to look at it.  Forget that! I wanted a rugged watch and found the features on this watch exceptional.  Atomic time setting is fantastic, it is within a second of my bedside atomic setting clock.  Solar powered and never having to replace batteries is great.  I travel alot and the World Time is a must.  When using the World Time the watch lets you know what time it is back home.  Yes, the buttons are hard to reach but maybe that helps in the protection.  It is a small price to pay for the great features of this watch!"
5.0,"Very cute and comfortable, material is soft, it’s stretchy but not enough to loose its form. It’s warm but not hot, I love the versatility of it whether I jus want to lounge or throw on some jeans with it. I ordered a size large and it fits perfectly. Arrived quickly with easy to open packaging."
5.0,"Super cute and comfortable, nice fabric! I was worried it would be too see through since it’s white but it doesn’t seem to be."
5.0,Great quality and a great Color in a good fit.
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous!  I went one size up from the size chart and it fits wonderfully!!  I was scared the arms would be snug because that is a problem area for me, but they fit grear. I will need to steam out the wrinkles but other than that it's perfect."
5.0,Cute and seems well made. It's very handy since I've clipped it to my house keys to keep me on time when I walk my dog.
5.0,Great running hat! I used it for a race in hot weather and it was very breathable. It's super lightweight and the folding brim is a nice bonus for transporting it.
5.0,This was ordered as part of a Halloween costume and it was perfect!  Love it!
5.0,This is a great fall and winter layer! It’s perfect for layering up on colder days or wearing on its own on a nicer day. The material is thin so it’s not too warm but protects from the cold. The sleeves where it fully buttons around your wrists is slightly tighter than I’d prefer and the buttons were very stiff to get together but I imagine that will become easier over time and use. The length is perfect and the hood is an added adorable touch. I ordered a large which is my normal in this type of clothing and it fit well as expected and true to size. Recently wore on a cold weather camping trip and it was the perfect layering piece for hiking and sitting by the fire.
5.0,These are so fun! There were several that did not survive shipping but the ones that did are perfect!
5.0,"I purchased this robe for my mom, she loved it. Great quality too!"
5.0,Ordered the XXL for a 5 foot 10 girl 160 lbs. Loves how it's a little too big. Comfy and looks stylish without being too abnormal. Got the dark blue which is true to the photo. I can see the first photo in the listing (where the sleeves are pushed up) are photo shopped.
5.0,The dress is comfortable and versatile. I absolutely love the fabric and design. Fits nicely and perfect match for my height. It provides perfect coverage and comes to my knees. This is a great dress for work.
5.0,Great case! It appears to be very well made and I love the floral design.
5.0,love these sandals.  this is the 2nd summer in a row that I have bought them for my son.
5.0,"I love that these pants had pockets, which is the reason I purchased them, but when they came I loved everything else about them as well. They fit very well, they don't become sheer if you bend over like other leggings can do, and they are soft/comfortable to wear around the house not just for workouts. Would recommend!"
5.0,I bought these for my direct reports at work as a part of a fun 4th of July themed goodie bag. These were by far the favorite by every person. The glasses were surprisingly good quality for the bulk price. Highly recommended.
5.0,I really like these compression socks. They are very tight and compress the leg very well. My legs did not feel fatigued when I took them off. I really like the grey band that wraps underneath the arch of my foot for support. There are ridges on the calf and Achilles area of the sock. They are easy to wash and dry with no shrinkage. They reach just beneath the knee cap. I would recommend these to anyone looking for quality compression socks.
5.0,Fit great very sexy
5.0,"Great dress, stretchy and breathable. You can dress it up or down and the detail at the bottom is really pretty."
5.0,good stuff!!!
5.0,"Amazing kit, fixed 6 watches so far."
5.0,Nice gifts for campers!
5.0,"Lovely coat, but I am 5’9” 135 lbs and it was too big.<br /><br />I returned it to you on March 6.  It was received on March 7th in Woodbridge,NJ by Cassidy at 3:12 p.m.  When will I get the refund and when will you update Amazon to reflect that you've received it?  Thanks."
5.0,This is a great product overall. Came exactly as described on the website.

5.0,"It’s super cute -and soft. The material is a bit thin yet not see through & I appreciate that it is light weight. Definitely, strictly pajamas though (I wouldn’t wear it out, lol)<br />But if you’re looking for light and comfy pjs, i definitely recommend"
5.0,Recently had cataract surgery and looking for sunglasses with reader magnification in order to be able to drive and still see cell phone. Ordered these. They delivered promptly and were as advertised. Stylish and work great. Only have had them for about a week but frames appear sturdy and lenses have not scratched yet. Will buy again from this company if the need arises.

5.0,"I love this shirt! On me, it fits just like the photo. I went a size up but I love loose-fitting clothing!"
5.0,"It's great, thanks!"
5.0,Good craftsmanship. Stainless steel is weighty & not flimsy.
5.0,"I gave these goggles to my husband since he needed a new pair.  He is still yet to test it out during the summer, since it hasn't gotten that hot yet.  But the packaging is very innovative. I like that you turn the knob and not slam the lid to close the case.  It makes it easier on the lenses.  They look durable, and looks like they'll hold up in the pool.  Will edit my review once the sun comes out to play! :)"
5.0,"I ordered a size 1 for my daughter and it is perfect sizing (size is same as regular shoe size)! Shoes are also as pictured and beautifully made. I have ordered this brand tap shoes before as well, so I've had a good experience ordering American Ballet products twice. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"for me i have wide feet, so the shoes do squeeze my feet a little bit. but in length  they fit nicely. also this is my very first pair of biking shoes so my range of shoes is little to none for biking. if you have wide feet then i would try shoes that people with more experience recommend  or go to a professional that can help you find the right shoe that fits the shape of your feet. my feet get a little tingle when i take them out of the shoe but i am getting used to the shoes and how they feel."
5.0,"This dress is exactly as pictured.  The black/grey/orange tie dye is the only one with a slit up one side and the only one that's mostly cotton.  If you notice in the description, they all have different fabrics.  Get compliments every time I wear it!  I bought a large and it's not skin tight and fits perfectly."
5.0,Look out twinkle toes! These boots are just as cute.
5.0,Wicked cute!
5.0,Cannot beat these!!! Great quality and fit is perfectly described. My daughter is 8 and 52’ inches and skinny! Bought her “large” and there is plenty of room for growth without looking too baggy. They have great stretch without saggy. Very strong! Love them!
5.0,"I love, love, love this. It was a great purchase that I’ll probably buy as gifts."
5.0,"Absolutely wonderful gift for Resident Evil fans, bought one for myself and plan to get more for my friends!!!"

5.0,These jeans were an emergency purchase when the pair I had got an unexpected hole in the seat. They arrived very fast and fit perfectly even though I was unable to try them on immediately before purchase. I definitely got my money's worth.
5.0,LOVE these earrings!  They are lightweight and have a silicone type backing so the backs don't fall off or slip.  They are exactly as pictured.
5.0,Beautiful earrings. High quality.
5.0,I love love this dress!! I should have sized down though. I’m 5’3 148 and got a medium.<br /><br />I sorta drown in the dress if I don’t tie the front tight.<br /><br />Still I love it and am fine with getting the dress fitted
5.0,They hold up pretty well. I used to wear these all the time as a kid.
5.0,Great for dress-up
5.0,Happy I ordered it.
5.0,One of the nicest sexiest nighty ever. Beautiful material and nice fit.
5.0,Bought these for bringing in wood in the winter. They are so warm too
5.0,"After trying them with another pair of loafers these socks were excellent. My first pair of loafers did not mix6wetll) mix well with these, but with my other 2 pair they are fantastic.<br />Very breathable and yet could feel warm in winter. Don't leave deep cut marks and are truly no show. Great price and product."
5.0,These butterflies are so delicate and shiny.  They are a real classic go to piece for day and night and just the right size.  The seller mailed and packaged them with care but my order some how got lost in transit for a few days. Amazon was right there to help with options including a full refund.  Hooray! These beautiful butterflies were in my mailbox today and they are lovely.  Buy them & you won't be disappointed.
5.0,Love it...fits well!!
5.0,"Great product, great price"

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:6ae908537faf4aeefae99572bdbee36a]] I just got this toddler kit hat knitted crochet owl beanie cap scarf set and it's really gorgeous! It came sooner than expected a nice package and exactly as described.<br /><br />First, I like the knitted crochet or beanie cap. It has very attractiv color as you can see in the slideshow. It fits well on my 28 months son's head. It covers all his hairlines as well as his ears. I like the design which is the lovely owl with beautiful eyes.<br /><br />Next, I also like the long knitted crochet scarf. It covers his whole neck as shown in the slideshow. The color is very bright and attractive which matches the cap.<br /><br />I really like and recommend this set! It's soft and smooth. It's very gentle on the skin while providing warmth to head and neck. It has been hand crafted well with good materials used.<br /><br />I was blessed to receive this product at a discounted price during its promotional period in exchange for an honest/unbiased opinion. This is my personal experience and I wasn’t obliged to give positive reviews. I will update my review if I encounter some problems with the product.<br />Thank you!"
5.0,"The band was very simple to install. I liked that the pins were pre-installed and ready to go.<br /><br />It's got a very nice, smooth feel to it. The bands snap easily and quickly together to keep it in place.<br /><br />Feel of good quality."
5.0,I always love the  powers that crystal emanates. The Raw Lapis is very beautiful..... the only issue I had with the product was the necklace..... it’s not sturdy enough ...... but no worries I purchased a more secured necklace. This will be the second crystal that I ordered from Ayana. Thank you
5.0,Love this! The colors are beautiful so I can wear with many outfits. Received many compliments
5.0,"Beautiful Sandals, it was too big for my son but I gave it to somebody else. The style is nice, I will recommended 100% so cute"
5.0,Super cute and comfy but bulky. I wear a 9.5 size and these fit great. Wouldn't recommend if you have smaller feet.
5.0,"Very Nice product, remarkable for the price paid.  Excellent customer service."
5.0,Great product! Very warm and thick! Fits great
5.0,I bought mine in a medium and it fits well with some extra room. It looks better in person and feels soft. Love that there's pockets on both sides! Great purchase!
5.0,Better than advertised….Great item!
5.0,"Bought as a gift, tried one on and it has some stretch to fit most. And they are cute. Other than that I don’t know how the touch panel in the finger for texting works. Fingers crossed that she likes them 🤞"
5.0,"I love these! They have 3 pockets! They are incredibly soft! They stay in place when I workout, they don’t roll even when I do stuff like Burpees. I love them. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍"
5.0,"Extraordinary design, great craftsmanship, hard to find so felt grateful that Amazon had these."
5.0,The quality is awesome. My husband loved his Father’s Day gift.
5.0,Good watch thanks you.
5.0,"My son and i were watching christmas vacation just b4 christmas. We both cracked up when clark said to his dad, thanks for teaching me all about exterior lighting... I had to get him this shirt."
5.0,"Extremely pretty, and for a good price! Inner lining was a bit shorter than I was expecting, but overall I still loved it. I can't wait to wear it again for halloween this year!"
5.0,Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves it.
5.0,I love all the compartments easy to organize
5.0,Absolutely love this scarf!
5.0,"Great quality and perfect size, it’s a fave bag for me now"
5.0,This dress is comfortable while flattering.
5.0,These are so comfortable and very warm
5.0,So cute and it’s the perfect gift.
5.0,As a teacher I stand all day and these shoes are great. Very comfortable. The red is bright and cheerful.
5.0,I wore this hat all winter and still love it. Very warm and the ponytail opening is great. Keeps my ears warm.
5.0,"I purchased this for my husband.  Since starting back to school after the summer, he now has to wear a mask in his classes all day. With a regular mask, his full beard starts curling up around the mask and he was always uncomfortable.  A friend told me about these neck scarves and I thought I would buy one for him.  After wearing it just one day, he had fallen in love.  He can wear it all day and his beard doesn’t do crazy things and it doesn’t hurt his beard.  When he doesn’t need it on his face, he can just pull it down like a scarf.  Definitely recommend for the full bearded man!"
5.0,STUNNING !! Turn the perfect attribute to any evening outfit!!!
5.0,I really love these shades. I suffer from migraines and live in the south. So these glasses were a blessing to find. They give full coverage to the eye--no light coming from sides; yet I have full peripheral sight. Just give me more!!
5.0,"I had bought this dress as a gift for my daughter's 9th birthday.<br />I originally purchased a size 8. When I received it, I loved the colors and the detail and the flow of the material, but I knew it was too big/long for my petite daughter. Luckily, I had enough time to return it for a size 7 (the smallest size available).<br />When she opened this present, she wanted to put the dress on right away and kept it on for the rest of the night. Yeah, I think it's a keeper!"
5.0,"Arghh I just wrote a long product review and my phone erased it! Long story short-the fit on this coat is extremely flattering and it is a beautiful coat. The problem for me is that it was too small, which is my fault because I should've taken measurements before ordering. I am normally about a size 8/9 and the medium fit like a 5/6. I could not get it to button and I have long arms so this did not work for me; I recommend taking careful measurements before ordering and if you are going by US sizes, order &#34;up&#34; not down. (If you are a size 7, order a large!!) shipping will take some time because it is shipping from China, so order now, before it gets cold! (Again, measure measure measure!! To avoid returning which cost $33! But the company was nice enough to credit me the $33 return shipping cost!) long story short, this coat is just as nice as the expensive coats I saw in the department stores (I actually ordered 3 different coats on Amazon, hoping that one would fit-one was too large, one fit and one was too small) all three were from China. This one was the too small one (again measure first!)<br /><br />P.S. I just finally took measurements for myself and it turns out I needed an XL - so... Again. Measure."
5.0,"I absolutely love it, it looks so much better in person, everything is good and strong and looks like it's going to last awhile"
5.0,Nice quality for little money
5.0,Beautiful peace of jewelry.  Very happy with this necklace.  Quick delivery and it looks exactly like I expected.  Thank you.
5.0,It’s very good on my daughter
5.0,"These are the cutest little slides. I got these a little bigger on purpose, so my son can grow into it. These are his house shoes, we recently remove all the the carpet in the house due to his allergy problems and changed it to hard wood, so the floor is cold. He’s a free soul and doesn’t like wearing shoes. But these are so cute he love wearing them. The slides is nice and soft, and there’s a good amount of traction on the bottom, so he don’t slip."
5.0,Love the feel of this dress
5.0,"Comfy 1st time I wore them, seem to be good quality. Hope they last and keep performing as good as 1st day."
5.0,Very good looking coin!
5.0,6 pairs for $11?! 🤑 Lightweight & Each have protective case and appear to be decent quality. Flip up feature means I don’t have to take on/off when I’m out & about- convenient !<br />Overall definitely two thumbs up 👍 👍
5.0,"This was a gift, they loved it"
5.0,When I saw this photo I just had to have it. It reminds me of being 12 years old. This is classic Michael and classic Billie Jean. This is a rare photo. It's a really nice glossy. It's been 7 months and I'm still not able to hang it. It's too painful. I miss Michael every moment of every day.
5.0,"I love the hat. Very stylish, and great for warmer weather.  The elastic on the inside of the hat at the back makes it a perfect fit.  I have a small head and often have trouble with that.  Thanks, Siggi!"
5.0,Pretty and made well.
5.0,Way better than sunscreen when swimming
5.0,"All of these look amazing and I'm super surprised and pleased with this purchase!<br /><br />Each ring is unique and I love how they all fit, these are definitely made to last! You won't regret this purchase at all!"
5.0,Received quickly! Love the fit! Comfortable and soft! Love the Watt design. Thank you!
5.0,Exactly what my son was looking for.
5.0,Muy bonito a mi esposa le encantó
5.0,"Super warm! Everyone around me kept telling me I look so soft. It's seriously the softest thing I've ever felt. The purple color is very rich and vibrant. I washed it with some bras that pulled out a lot of strings which I'm really upset about. Since then, I've washed it by itself because it's so stretchy and I didn't want to ruin it any more than I already did."
5.0,Good fit for a variety of sizes! The black is thicker than the cream one but both we’re nice.
5.0,Awesome presentation. Great quality. Recommend highly.
5.0,"I used these on flights from the east coast to Hawaii and back. They worked great - No swollen feet, legs, or toes. An added bonus was my legs and feet stayed warm on the flights!"
5.0,I reviewed another like these but again great for a tall thin child.  They are comfortable and durable.  Great pants for tall and skinny.
5.0,Fit is great. Darling pants.
5.0,"This product was exactly what I was looking for! As a fellow Gem, I am always looking for a way to express my sign and this necklace is defiantly eye candy. Super stylish, suttle and cute. Will buy more for my friends for thier bday and graduation!"
5.0,Love these caftenses.  I have purchased 2 and thinking of ordering another one.
5.0,I love this blouse. Fits great & looks great on. Wish I could find more like it. The neckline is a little deep but I put a couple of tac stitches in & its perfect
5.0,"I got the Long Biodegradable Latex Rubber Gloves (size large) as the skin on my hands has been drying out with the combination of washing dishes and cold weather and I want to protect my hands while washing dishes.  These gloves are great.  I got a large so that both myself and my husband could wear them (if he wanted to).  I am petite but the large was just a little big on me.  I wouldn't want them any smaller though as I like a little bit of extra room.  I like how long they are as they cover my forearms.  What I love the most is that they are biodegradable.  One thing to note is that the color of the gloves I received was not the bright yellow in the seller's photographs.  Mine are more of a light yellow, almost translucent.  However, I do not care about the color and these are great gloves!"
5.0,"My 4 year old is in love with this. Everything is about My Little Pony at the moment, and I could not pass her up. She will be 5 in a few months, and I ordered the size 130 (6). I wanted her to have it a while and if it was too large, I was fine with it. It actually fits great. She is a happy girl."
5.0,These saved my girls hands.
5.0,My guy loves socks. These went off without a hitch. Excellent fit and quality. Awesome patterns. Perfect for the sock lover in your life.
5.0,These are nice warm socks that are quite comfortable for for the price. Would recommend them. Definitely good value.
5.0,Beautiful dress and very comfortable
5.0,"Really pretty, got this for a friends going away present. I want to get one for myself too."
5.0,"It replaced the original perfect!!  The only downside is that the Loophole  is made of plastic. That is the part that gave out on the original part.  If the loophole was metal, it would last longer, especially since it is out in the weather all the time."
5.0,Got this as a gift for my mother and she loves the versatility of it! Looks great with different charms and it's very easy to use.
5.0,Adorable and feminine. I get a lot of compliments on this blouse.
5.0,I bought these for my husband as we will be going to a Elton John concert in the future
5.0,"Love it!! Can't beat it for the price!! Gives medium support (Im a D to a DD), so not for super high impact workouts, but great for day to day or light to moderate impact workouts. And it's comfy! I wear it all day and am not dying to take it off. It's also super cute!"
5.0,I bought this in two colors and they are very vibrent They are a little snug so buy a size up and enjoy.
5.0,Just ordered this suit and it is adorable! But it runs VERY small! I am 5'4&#34; and weigh 110lbs and I got a large! It fits really well but would have been too small in the butt if I can gone any smaller.
5.0,"Love the dress, fit as expected"
5.0,Beautiful and fits great!
5.0,Lindo y fresco
5.0,I wore this over the weekend and everywhere I went I was complemented. The top was made too small but  I had it altered and the seller reimbursed me. Im going to get 2 more in different colors.
5.0,This is my second purchase and I’m really happy about my purchase again. These leggings are high quality but at a great price!
5.0,"This is the perfect length, nice quality amber, and excellent easy-off clasp."
5.0,"This was a gift for my step daughter, I call my bonus daughter. I couldn’t love her anymore if she were my flesh and blood. She is married with children of her own and I have been her life for about 26 years. So I  wanted her to know just how special she is to me and she absolutely loved this gift!"
5.0,This umbrella is absolutely as per the expectations and my daughter is truly loving it.
5.0,Bought it for a birthday
5.0,"Very nice girls leggings, however, I ordered capris instead of full length, so I had to return them."
5.0,"I needed a liner for my boot (Achilles Tendon Rupture) I needed a medical sock that didn't roll, that held shape and that fit over a very swollen calf/foot. These are soft and comfortable from the ankle  down, they stretch over large calves easily, but these are NOT a medical sock. even the bag it came in has ""FASHION"" printed on both sides. these roll, the texture from the ankle up leaves a mesh netlike impression on the skin and for anyone thinking ""fashion is fine""-- these are thin from the ankle up and do not stay in place.. not worth the money spent for what they're advertised as."
5.0,Absolutely love them all - don't know which one  to use first! you wont be dissapointed
5.0,"loved these, order for my best friends graduation and we all still wear them!"
5.0,Lounging around the house after work

5.0,Very happy with these masks. Well made and comfortable. Good value.
5.0,One of my favorites
5.0,Beautiful on my daughter
5.0,I'm happy with the variety and quality.
5.0,"Great band.  It looks and feels premium.  I have two different colors, one silver and one black.  The silver is more Sunday church looking and the black is more of a daily driver."
5.0,"Superrrrr thin material, but I expected it to be like that. It’s very soft & cute! Would consider buying other colors bc it fit nice!"
5.0,Once I get them on they feel very good. Much easier to walk. Glad I got these socks. Execellent quality.
5.0,Nice looking shoe.
5.0,perfetc for my baby
5.0,"They are flattering, but the most important feature to me is that they don't ride/roll up your inner thigh when exercising ."
5.0,"My son suffers from severe allergic dermatitis to work boots, which he has to wear all day every day. He’s tried composite toe, steel toe, different brands, water-proof socks, moleskin, etc. with no relief. While these boots took a while to arrive, they were worth it.  After just a couple months his feet have improved greatly."
5.0,Nicer than I expected. I thought they would look really cheap and they ended up being very pretty bracelets. Everyone loved their gifts.
5.0,I ordered these for my Oakley sunglasses. I was surprised when I put them in that they are as good or better than the original lenses. I love the color and clarity. I will be buying more.
5.0,"Lots of variety and colors! Those I didn't want as much my teenage daughters wanted, so win win!!"
5.0,Stylish and really good quality. Much better than the reading glasses I get at Costco. These are really nice
5.0,I love this bonnet. As a matter of fact I'm gonna order another for back up. It's well made. I love that the elastic is not exposed so no pinching my skin or grabbing my hair. It's roomy for all types of hair and styles. It's also reversible if you wanna switch things up. 😏
5.0,Fit as expected! I ordered an XL and I'm 5'3 175lbs.
5.0,"You know that song ""I'm blue""?  These sunglasses are a lot like that song except everything is red, like really red.  If you're trying to look like Charlie Knox in Charlie's Angels you should definitely buy these frames. If you're only trying to look cool while driving down the road dont buy these, cause they are so red they cancel out the green in stoplights."
5.0,"This is a great lounge around the house product. The bra is comfortable and just the right about of support. I did find it was better to remove the cups in the bra. The shorts are also comfy, they don’t roll down or up and they have just the right amount of compression."
5.0,"Jacket is soft ordered a size large and was able to zip with a 36-DD size chest.<br />Fabric is see through had to wear a shirt underneath jacket, it is also very light<br />Color is true to picture<br />Enjoyed to scarf that came with it, used for ponytail on hair bun<br />Used for a group Halloween"

5.0,"Perfect size bag, I use it all the time! Thanks!"
5.0,My daughter just love it
5.0,"The Floating black locket  I received was perfect...I was so pleased.  It was not cheap in anyway.  Not only very attractive , but,<br />if I hadn't ordered it myself I would have taken it for a much more expensive piece of costume jewelry.  It looked exactly like<br />the picture and had substantial weight, not at all flimsy.  The charms I ordered fit just right.  I will order from this company again,<br />and recommend it to family and friends.  At less than half the price of the competition, it was a great buy, and looks beautiful."
5.0,"It is great, exactly what I was expecting. Beautiful. Shipping took over a week."
5.0,Great for all kinds of craft projects and gifting!
5.0,"Do not follow the reviewer who said these run small - Totally and completely false, and sadly I missed out on an incredible and affordable shoe because I listened to the review.<br /><br />These run exactly true to size. I'm a solid size 6 and ordered a half size up - eek, too big. They are satiny and so spectacular. I was bummed to see that by the time I returned them, the 6 was no longer available."
5.0,Comfortable and flattering.
5.0,Nice sophisticated look
5.0,It's true to the described sizes. It was perfect! I was very happy with this one. It felt comfortable and very pretty! I also love the pockets. I will definitely buy this again in different color. Great buy!!

5.0,Beautiful  dress i love it
5.0,"Not enough light for reading , but very pretty for aesthetics!"

5.0,"AHHH I LOVE IT! It's small, but perfect! It has rubber bands, and it's twist-on. I've been searching far and wide for decent fake &#34;gauges&#34;, and ba-BAM! Got them here. Thank you!"
5.0,"*I purchased the black skirt with elephants adjustable with the string*I love it! Looks so good, I’m a bit heavier in build, and it doesn’t look weird and actually hides my stomach fat pretty nicely lol. It’s lightweight, very adjustable, pretty, and honestly I thought the fabric would feel cheap but it’s perfect!"
5.0,"Great fitting tank top. The longer length is perfect for layering and the lace on top and bottom is fun and stylish. The adjustable straps are perfect for this petite girl. I picked it up in navy, which is a true navy color.  Very nice!<br /><br />I received this tank top at a discounted price in exchange for this honest review."
5.0,"Super cute!  Loved them more that I thought I would. Bats are leather type material.  Skulls were weird but I have those away.  Great price, even for only keeping 3.  They were a nice length in their dangliness."
5.0,"This is a generous sized cap with a Velcro adjustment.  The cap peak is higher which is pleasing to me as I dislike some &#34;shrunken&#34; caps' appearance.  The material is moderately heavy with a moderately sized bill.  That said I am not going to try to wash it, thinking it could ruin it.  This hat looks great on and plenty of room for a pony"
5.0,Really nice and warm. Fits well
5.0,Love these headbands! Can't beat the price. My six month old gets so many compliments on them! They are fancy but I love how they don't leave indentations on her head after wearing. They have a felted back.<br />Really look like good quality hairbands!

5.0,I love them and they look cute on my feet.
5.0,"Love these shirts! They fit somewhat small, but are really comfortable and soft. They are see through, doesn't bother me because I only wear them to the gym. You could also wear a tank top underneath and it would work just as well."
5.0,"I loved this dress! I bought it to wear on vacation in a warmer climate. The sides are low so it would show a bra if you chose to wear one. Very comfortable and flattering. I'm 5'4, 130 lbs, a size 34C cup size. I purchased a size small. If you would want a little more form fitted you could go a size down. I liked it loose though."
5.0,Got it 3 days early! I love it! There's so much room!  Its comfortable to wear and a beauty to look at!<br />Thanks Amazon!
5.0,"Finally!!! a top that doesn't go to my knees! What is up with everything being super long, wide, and see-through these days? Not this top! Great length, not see through (and I got white),  adjustable straps,. Flowy but not maternity. WIN!<br /><br />Size chart was accurate. Bought a M (US small, according to seller chart) for a perfect fit (5'2, 130, 36B)"
5.0,"Love the tunic, hides fat !"

5.0,Warm tights that are not bulky. My daughter loves them.
5.0,Very cute cardigan!
5.0,The blue is just as pictured and a nice change from traditional blue. Perfect with slim black pants. I love it and plan to order more colors! The size was as expected
5.0,I liked the fact that they are easy to put on.  I do not need the heavy-duty compression socks (which are very difficult to put on.)  These fit the requirement I have from the Doctor.
5.0,My wife was HOT in this little thing
5.0,Yes I love it
5.0,Great for interviews or dinner dates.
5.0,"I have to say that I was apprehensive about ordering a string of pearls online.  I did have one small issue, which was worked out quickly and to my satisfaction.  These pearls are weighty and beautiful.  I was able to string them around my neck three times.  There is no clasp, which is a nice thing.  It is an endless double knotted pearl necklace.  I placed the necklace on my bright white comforter so that you could get a better idea of the colors.  The uniqueness of each pearl is what makes this so beautiful."
5.0,"We were tired of using the metal weight clips at our gym. They were always difficult to put on and take off. So after reading these reviews, we purchased the Quick Release Pair of Locking 2&#34; Olympic Size Barbell Clamps. I was not disappointed in the least. They don't get stuck on the bar nor are they difficult to release. They lock quick and easy for you to get your lift started. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.<br /><br />Happy lifting!"
5.0,"I bought these for my grandson for fitness training in the pool. He loves them!  They are very comfortable to wear he tells me... don’t let the water in... and the anti glare is great because he swims outdoors in the sunshine.<br />I was impressed with the speed of delivery!  I ordered Sunday and they arrive d next day, Monday!  Well packaged, and they have their own very neat case to keep them in.<br />Wonderful product, great price.  I only write reviews when the product is good one... and these goggles are excellent."
5.0,Beautiful cover up.  Good length.  I ordered an XL because the L was a little too tight for my liking.
5.0,It fit him like it was made for him
5.0,Great quality tee with perfect print. It’s super cute. Got a lot of smiles.
5.0,Por el precio es más que perfecta calidad puede competir con cualquiera en un rango de 100 a 300 dlrs
5.0,this is a handy accessory for LED lighting projects.  Helpful to buy the bell wire (two pair) from Home depot and crimp to ends for extended lenghts.
5.0,"I put these on my work glasses, I work on aircraft and am always in awkward positions and my glasses would always fall off or slide down.<br />These things hold my glasses in place even upside down.!! Easy to adjust, and comfortable to wear all day."
5.0,"I love having options for toting my &#34;stuff&#34; around, and this beautiful blue bag is a perfect spring color for grabbing and dropping my iPad, lunch, and a few odds and ends for the day in while still looking stylish.  I's a gorgeous color, well made and quite handy..."
5.0,"It's HUGE! I usually carry big purses, but even for me this is huge! It looks nice, feels nice!!"

5.0,These are a dope pair of all black shades. Nice and simple. Can't complain
5.0,"This is the second one of these I've ordered. I am 5'2"" 134 lbs sturdy built with large bust. I got a L which fits fine, perhaps a bit tight. I love the fabric and the print. The waist hits above my natural waist, but anyone with a large bust (mine's 38G) will find that happening. I have not washed it yet, but expect to use cool water, gentle cycle and hang it to dry. Please can we have this in more prints that are smaller to flatter us shorter folks!"
5.0,Watch was easy to fit on iPhone. Looked very nice. It was a good value.  So disappointed my wrist was too small for the band.

5.0,"These are what I've been searching for....a pair of wide, flowing legs that look like a skirt yet are pants - and very comfortable pants they are. Well made but the paisley fabric is semi-sheer. I'm buying a pair of pant liner bloomers. The front features a panel with an elastic back waistline. Would buy another pair but I don't go many places and they are $40/pair."
5.0,I love this product. These eye glass holders are the only ones that really stay on and hold tight. The only thing better than the product is the customer service this company provides. If I could give 10 stars I would. DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY!!
5.0,I bought this white necklace set with earrings to wear with a red Indian kurti set. It looked great together! I was very satisfied with my purchase!

5.0,"Very comfortable, it’s perfect!!"
5.0,Beautiful necklace and not junk. Took a chance with no reviews and glad I did!
5.0,"This compression shirt is just what my daughter needed. She has Asperger’s and likes to pull her shirts/dresses/pajamas over her knees and pull in her arms. I ordered a large for a little extra room and it was perfect- she loves to put this on after school and wear it the rest of the day. I was already familiar with SmartKnit as my younger daughter wears their socks with her AFOs. Great brand, great product!"

5.0,Enjoyed it so much that we bought an extra pair just like it.
5.0,Great quality for the price. Typically I do buy more expensive socks but I was running low and figured I’d just grab some off of amazon. They’ve made it through about 10 washes and still seem to be in good condition and the color hasn’t faded too much.
5.0,"My teenager adores these-cute, comfy, stylish!"
5.0,"This product is effective. All compression socks are harder to put on than regular socks, but these were at least manageable. Very comfortable, good fit, wash well, great value."

5.0,I love it exactly as the picture really recommend it:)
5.0,"These are so light weight you hardly know they're there!  I wondered if they would be too heavy and slide down throughout the day, but that is not an issue.  In fact, I have found no issue after two weeks of wear.  And it's great having two different lengths to choose from.  These are one of my favorite pairs of earrings!!"
5.0,a great looking long sleeve rashguard great for jiu jitsu and wrestling feels and looks so good

5.0,"My wife and I disagree on which of us gets to drive our dream Corvette more (when we get it), but one thing is for sure, this C7 Corvette Crossed Flags Performance Polo Shirt is mine. And my wife loves me in it!  I had the chance to grab it and I am thrilled I did. First, it’s an awesome color - this blue is top notch. Second, it’s got a great look to it - from the logo to the black accents to how it lays. Third, it’s a UA - and I’m a major UA fan. Forth, I love the material. It feels awesome and looks great on. I’m a bit on the larger end of my size, the weight coming down, so it fits, but it’ll only fit better and better - it should be spot on if your in your size. I love this shirt and have every intention of wearing it often. In the end, this C7 Corvette Crossed Flags Performance Polo Shirt is a great addition to my wardrobe and I’m thrilled to have it!"
5.0,"fits like a glove. really sexy and form fitting. opt out from wearing bra since the cut is too low on the sides. it covers my mama pooch from pregnancy, it is comfortable. i love the material. i bought two different colors and will be buying more ;p"

5.0,"Ignore the fuzzy sock and straight face - I was sampling the outfit I picked. I was doing an event where I had to wear all black, and that’s tough for me because I like color and interesting fashion so I picked these red shoes and then this necklace and bracelet set to help add something interesting to the outfit and I tried it all together as soon as it arrived. I love it! It’s delicate but bold, not too heavy but doesn’t feel super cheap. The bracelet is stunning and the necklace is gorgeous. I love them both!"
5.0,Got as a gift for my daughter! Fit her perfectly and looks great!!
5.0,"I love this dress! its true to its size if you are not looking for skin tight. It is a tiny bit big on me but that's how I wanted it. if I would have went a size down it would have been to tight. The material is good for the price, I personally will be washing this if not by hand in a bra bag to keep the lace nice and from snagging on anything. I only wear a b cup so someone with a slightly larger chest it would just fit them like a glove"
5.0,Love it a little bigger than expected though but not too big
5.0,Basic ponchos. Expected quality for price.

5.0,Love this hat! Just as pictured and adjustable to fit all head sizes. Liked it so much I bought a second one in a lighter color
5.0,Absolutely beautiful quilt.  It is well made and a good size.  I did send the quilt back because it had too many green colors.  The quilt is wonderful.  It just did not go with the room.  I don't like that much green.
5.0,I wanted these for my mom but she has to be careful how big they are. Well surprise. These was perfect. I loved them. I am in aww of them.
5.0,"I bought the large. I am 5 '8'' 140 pounds B cup and the dress fits just fine. It is 3/4 sleeve and sits above my ankles. The material is soft and not overly shiny. it is an empire waist on me, which I wasn't expecting. So it looks like a maternity dress on me ( I have a belly) so I was sure to wear it with a corset underneath to avoid embarrassing questions. I got the black and the leaves are a jade green and the flowers are a pinkish coral color. My daughter has a similar dress, but her flowers a little more orange the the leave more of a teal color. I like this dress. It is very comfortable and fun to wear. I love that it has pockets and for $16, how can you go wrong?"
5.0,"Fits fantastic (I'm 5'0"", 112 lbs athletic build) I really like that they aren't a solid color really gives it character. The ones I got are marble patterned (it says tie-dye but it's marble)"

5.0,"I have been searching for quite a while for a bag that could be used as my daily purse, and since I am a photographer and travel extensively, I needed something that could also fit my camera.  The quality of the canvas and the lining exceeded my expectations.  This does not happen often with online purchases.  Thank you Zenteii for accurately advertising and providing a great bag!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:20389534223fa1214656504c6ec380bc]] Have multiple plaid shirts this by far is the most thickest one yet, arm length is not long for a tall girl but I rolled them up so it was fine."
5.0,"These pants are totally ah-mazing!!! Currently ordering them in every color so far I have the jade, red, and bright blue and they are the BEST pants ever! Squat proof, soft, stretchy, and sooo comfy! Love, love, love them!"
5.0,Great product for the price. My friend loved it for his bday
5.0,Exactly what I expected. Works great.I am really hard on my sunglasses and these are surprisingly hard to break I have stepped on them at least twice and sat on them and they still hold shape.
5.0,It is a lot prettier than expected And it's bigger. It's definitely my favorite key chain
5.0,I get complements from everyone who knows the show and it’s a easy conversation
5.0,So soft love the price!
5.0,"My granddaughter was thrilled with these glasses and she looks so cool, so maybe just list them as childrens glasses. We love blue."
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this dress for the price.  It was well lined and the weight of the dress was good because it hung well and aligned with the body.
5.0,"The black color is not sheer, and it hangs and washes nicely. :)<br />It fits me well and only shrunk very slightly, if at all, after washing.<br />It does wrinkle easily, so I hang it to dry, and the wrinkles do come out naturally as you wear it."
5.0,Incredible
5.0,love love it!!
5.0,"This charm is very cute, shipment was fast."
5.0,"Muy bonitas, ideales si eres emprendedora  y quieres revender"
5.0,A little thin on the bottom.  But fits nicely.
5.0,Adorable outfit with good quality material. Fits perfectly.
5.0,We loved it was a gift she is very happy overall not cheap !
5.0,"This is a replacement/backup for the same glasses as before. This one has a hinge that rubs against the frame but should loosen after breaking in.<br />These really are Polarized, not just tinted, and I can see very clear."
5.0,I now have several pairs of these and they are my favorite and most worn pair I own.  Very comfortable and light weight.  I can highly recommend them!
5.0,Nice love it
5.0,"Not for long lasting use, but great for a temporary usage. Only complaint is they arrive with a hard to remove crease because they are delivered folded."
5.0,"I bought these not knowing what the exact size conversion would be, they didn't fit my dad at all, so I stole them for my mom (size 8). There was no comprehensive size chart on the item or on the website, but man they are SO WARM!!<br />Everyone I buy these for loves them, and I've bought 4 pair already. Worth every cent. Just don't treat them roughly in the wash."
5.0,Totally adorable!  My little one worse this for his second birthday at Disneyland.  Shortalls are so fun and comfortable.  Don't hesitant to buy this outfit.  A real plus is that the material isn't overly heavy.
5.0,"Thick satin skirt but holds its shape. I'm 5'4.5, 138lbs, 34cc - 29 - 36 I purchased a medium. I would need to wear at least a 3 inch heel to bring it off the floor. The top fit perfectly, it's stretchy. It's Great value to get a top with the skirt and I've seen some ridiculous prices for similar skirts. I would absolutely purchase it again!"
5.0,Bought it for a friend for xmas and he really liked it
5.0,I love wearing this top because it's so soft and comfortable. I live in FL so it's very hot and humid here. This top helps me not to be too hot. I only wear sleeveless tops.
5.0,Very Nice key chain.
5.0,Made well. Cute. Mom loved it as a Christmas gift = )
5.0,This gown is so soft and comfortable! I love it!

5.0,Does away with belt holes.
5.0,"Hands down the nicest belt I now own. Made in the good ol USofA high quality and great workmanship. Not like Ariat who outsources all the work to China and Mexico....support our economy and shop USA made products, you won’t be disappointed. I would highly recommend  this company 5/5 Also if anyone is curious about sizes, I am a size 33 waist and ordered the 36 waist soze and its a perfect fit. Can’t wait to order some more!"
5.0,One of the best on the market. Superb quality! I followed the advice of another reviewer and cut it into several pieces for easier use.
5.0,It was a gift for my husband he loved everything about it
5.0,"Quality is decent and the design is cute, I really like it for the price. I accidentally got a extra large so it’s too big on me but I don’t mind lol"
5.0,"Everything I want in a headband, plus it’s stylish"
5.0,"This exceeded my expectations, looks like it's a very expensive ring! The gem has a deep (not too dark) green and sometime turquoise flash to it and catches the light very well.  The casing protects the gem well and it doesn't stick out too far from my finger (I was afraid it would).  LOVED wearing it today, will probably find a reason to wear it often."
5.0,These are amazing. They are very secure on the foot. They're also waterproof so perfect for playing or the beach. My niece loves them!
5.0,"Love, love this bracelet.  I wear it all the time.  It works with just about any outfit you can put together.  I've gotten many compliments on it as well."
5.0,"Nice suit, comfortable and flattering. The straps are adjustable, the breast has pads that are removable (though I noticed someone else said they weren't, mine are), and the fabric quality seems nice. The colors in the ""Colorful Blue Stripe"" are beautiful, and true to the stock photo. The bottom of the tankini is fitted more snuggly than some, and I don't think will ride up in the water (I have only tried it on so far, and haven't swam in it yet).  I am 5'5"", 123 lbs, 32B and I ordered a size M."
5.0,Just as described. Great gift idea. Loved it.
5.0,Carries more stuff and works out to be an asset.
5.0,"I just got these in the mail today and I am OBSESSED! I got the rosegold and it is VERY reflective! So cute and fun and different from glasses I have seen others wearing this spring without being way too wacky. Only issue I can foresee might be having to clean lenses a ton since the front is ALL lens and it is hard to handle them without smudging the lens, but in my opinion it's a small price to pay!"
5.0,Really soft and fits well. Well made compared to other products.
5.0,"Bought this for My 7 year old who Love's FNOF , it was his favorite gift. it is silky soft and very bright colors. not really a warm shirt but still nice."
5.0,"I give this a 5 star because it is so beautiful, the only complaint I have is I go too many compliments I got tired of saying &#34;thank you&#34; :-)"
5.0,"great for protecting glasses, i use safety glasses which are pretty bulky so should work well for normal glasses too."
5.0,This product was just as described and worked perfect for prepping meals.
5.0,"Love this balaclava. Great colors. Goes with everything. Is quite warm, so I only use it in cold, windy conditions."
5.0,Exactly as described take note its a high heel!
5.0,great item. got it at a reduced rate and they look great on the leg. fits as shows. would order these all the time with the discount rate. like to know that they come in pairs and work great for which color you want to wear. would tell anyone to buy these and use them for the price and feel.
5.0,"Nuu Muu's work well for many activities, but they are super comfortable for golf.  Run true to size."

5.0,"Pretty and unusual rose gold with sparkly crystals. Was a gift for a cool woman, and she liked them!"
5.0,Love this bag! Great price. I use as diaper bag/ purse for my toddler for errand type days. Divider in the middle (zip pocket) I use to separate her stuff/my stuff.<br /><br />I can easily fit::: my wallet/ few personal items/ cell phone & 3 diapers/package of wipes/ backup outfit/ kid sweater.
5.0,It is exactly what is advertised!
5.0,"I love this bag! It’s perfect for me, and it’s a perfect little purse I use it as a purse. I would highly reccomend!!"
5.0,These are great with a blazer or casual wear
5.0,"Quality of product was great.  Too large, so needed to return.  Small hook closure at top is tough to open and close."
5.0,"Absolutely amazing! I’m 5’7, 118lbs, but I ordered an XL and it is plenty big. Wasn’t sure if this was Chinese sizes and wanted to make sure I got it big. I wanted it oversized. Could have probably gotten away with a L for the loose  look I was going for. I have wide shoulders so I always have to order larger due to that.  It washed and dried very well. It got much softer after washing FYI. If you have regular shoulders order true to your American size and you will not be disappointed. I bought both colors!!!"
5.0,came fast exactly as pictured
5.0,Husband loves them however he is unable to wear them while on his ATV as they are too bulky

5.0,I have a house key on the slinky bracelet.<br />When I walk the dog it’s in my wrist and I don’t take a chance if it falling out if my pocket !
5.0,"I bought the Fitbit flex 2 because I loved the versatility. I didn't like the style of the necklace Fitbit sold, so I started searching for alternatives on Amazon. Came across this one and it was my favorite. The price deterred me for a bit, but I couldn't get it out of my mind. I went ahead and bought it, and I couldn't be happier! It looks wonderful and tracks my steps well. It is very well made and is beautiful. I am very happy with this purchase."
5.0,So love these.... casual boots w/ pizazz I have received lots of compliments

5.0,it has a nice loose fit and strong heavy material. Good product.
5.0,"I bought two caps to send to a couple of picky twins celebrating their 65th Birthday. They sent photos of themselves wearing the hats and looking pretty happy. I know either one or the other of those two would have pointed out flaws in packaging, shipping, or the caps.  :)<br />So far, so good, so I'm happy too."
5.0,"I live this band. Was worried it would tarnish easily or be flimsy, it's not! I wear almost every day and have not had any issues. My only con would be the free bumper for device that coms with it. Just trash the bumper, not worth it and it was free."
5.0,"I purchased a long sleeve of this Black Lab Christmas t-shirt & my husband asked where's mine. :(  On our 7th rescued Black Lab.  Was able to find one in XL but short sleeve on AZM. Husband forgave me on Christmas day :)  I love the TITLE of Company and the material, made in PERU is excellent! How could anyone not like LIFE IS GOOD!"
5.0,Bought this sweater for my son. Fits and looks great!
5.0,Best sounding bike bell. Have ordered many of these for our beach bikes and as gifts. Easy to put on and great sound that warns cars of your presence.
5.0,Product as stated
5.0,"This new splash bag is everything I wanted in my latest addition to my Tokidoki collection. It's beautiful and bright and the largest bag I have purchased thus far. I do wish it had a zipper closing the top, but it's not a huge deal. There is a leather button clasp that works as a way to close the bag up a bit. I really like that the straps are long enough to carry on my shoulder so it's not a &#34;hand&#34; bag. The fabric is smooth and a great material, so it seems really easy to clean if it gets dirty.<br /><br />I have to give a shout out to seller trendygram. I ordered this and one other item coming from amazon. Trendygram beat amazon prime shipping by one day! The item was even delivered all the way across the country! Such a top notch seller!"
5.0,"wow i wish the search was easier, however, my search paid off, and i am so glad that i found these as i used make shift DIY for so long.  Thank you to the designers, creators and thinkers of this product"
5.0,"I really enjoy these pants, I bought them from Costco, just before they ran out or I would have bought more. one reviewer said they stretched out first time worn, I do not know what she meant. I have a 37"" waist and bought a large and they are perfect for me no problem with the elastic . Great loose fitting legs summer pants for lounging, beachwear or shopping at the grocery store. I wash in cold water and hang to dry."
5.0,"Super cute outfit. Fast shipping, good quality."
5.0,highly liked by my 3yo daughter
5.0,"All the other reviews were right. It's cute and fits well. Material is soft. Love the look. Can be dressed up or down, really cute with a jean jacket. Great buy!"
5.0,Well made and worth the price
5.0,Great for my 4 year old who loves dressing up
5.0,My daughter felt like a little princess in these. They were durable and she uses them for dress up too
5.0,"These novel earrings have a ""Punk De La Punk"" attitude. I love the way they even make my ears speak for themselves.<br /><br />Look at the nice presentable box they come in -- a nice place to safely stow these earrings when the time comes when I will once again need to be respectable for work.<br /><br />The earrings are thick - but lightweight -- as one person said they are a little hard to take off but I Do Not Care-- because my earrings usually sleep with me. They are easy to clean -- make sure there is a mesh stopper in your sink.<br /><br />Sure you can possibly find them cheaper elsewhere but that happens all the time. I'm happy with these wonderful ego boosting earrings.<br /><br />Now, is there an identical bracelet to match? I would LOVE one."
5.0,"Great sneakers, stylish and sporty.  He can wear it to school with sport clothes, and also with more formal outfits.  The leather feels expensive."
5.0,"I love the color, it is a nice deep gray."
5.0,"Fit well , nice material"
5.0,"it's very well put together, sturdy material  good tie too."
5.0,LOVE THEM! great that they come in a variety pack of colors and really are nice and warm when you're outside.
5.0,This is an attractive dress. It is very pretty. It seems like it is nice quality. I like that it is comfortable but that you can wear it to work. It seems very stylish. It has a nice shape. The fabric is soft and feels very well made. Basic black is good for work. I think you can wear it for going out too - it is pretty versatile. We have many items from this brand and have been pleased with the quality and durability. I would recommend it.
5.0,"I love these scarves so much I now have three and am thinking about another one. The three I have are black red buffalo plaid, amazon forest green and black grey red check. The black red grey check changes color in different lights - sometimes it looks deep pink/maroon; other times red. Either way, I really like it. These scarves are light enough to pack up small to fit in a handbag, warm in use, super soft against the skin, not itchy and not bulky. The perfect formula for me."
5.0,I love it. I have a small head so not all sun hats fit
5.0,Cute and high quality
5.0,"Bought these for my daughter to wear with her Super Girl Halloween costume. She loves how shiny they are and wanted to wear them right away. She normally wears a 6/6X in leggings, so that is the size I ordered. They are a bit loose on her but they are fine for what we need."
5.0,I love this case!!!  I am a huge Betty Boop fan and this has made it easier for me to accept that I have to wear glasses...lol.  I like carrying this case and get lots of compliments.  it was delivered quickly and with no problems.
5.0,"If you have a large noggin then waste no time and order - great, build, plenty of room, super quality.  I bought two (black and tan). Best ever."
5.0,Soft. Very pretty would recommend true to size
5.0,Love this dress will purchase in more colors...
5.0,Great purchase. Better than I expected!  Like the fit. Great for a gift!
5.0,"Of my gosh, I love this thing! Its so much better than a backpack. Everything is easily accessible and there is so much room!  I have room for my field guides, geocaching stuff, my daughters diabetes supplies, and all of our wildcrafting supplies. I love this thing!  I need a purse that can do all of this!"
5.0,A lot more beautiful in person that in the picture...so beautiful I may buy a pair for myself...the first purchase was a gift.
5.0,Strong and works great for my use.
5.0,"I initially bought this dress in one of the floral patterns after reading many glowing reviews from women with similar measurements to my own. Unfortunately I failed to notice that they all bought solid colors and that there's a note in the product description that different designs use different materials.<br /><br />The floral dress was way, way too small and had absolutely no stretch; it was made of a heavy, almost canvas-like material and I can see why other reviews say it looks much more expensive than it is. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it past my shoulders/hips and had to reorder a solid color. The solid-color dressed in the stretch material are great for plus size women - excellent stretch and very flattering! It does wrinkle extremely easily, but is easy to iron (although the label says not to). I did wear a petticoat and use fashion tape to stick down the 'bar' of fabric in the chest area, but I ended up sweating through the fashion tape and it still looked fine.<br /><br />I laid the two dresses (both XL) over each other, and they're virtually identical in terms of measurements and quality; the only difference is in the material. The floral patterns are gorgeous, and I wish that either they came in a larger size or were made with more forgiving material so that I could order more! The solids are fine but just not that exciting. It's absolutely my fault for not paying more attention before ordering the first time, and I won't be making that mistake again!"
5.0,I purchased this as a gift. The recipient was very please and the fit was appropriate for the size ordered.
5.0,Kept me nice and warm on my trip up north.
5.0,Nice large polarized glasses. I love them!!!
5.0,"Looks just like the picture. Clasp is a bit cheap, but as long as you take care of it it's fine. Wear it daily."
5.0,My new favorite earrings.  Hard to find baby size posts. Size of the eraser on a pencil. Just love them.
5.0,These are nicely made yellow clip on lenses. I am testing them before buying expensive prescription glasses to help my difficulty in seeing in bright glare. They are nicely made and are working well clipped to my regular classes.
5.0,"Excellent, really besutifull"
5.0,Color fabulous looks just like the picture. Overall bag and rope feels sturdy. Delivered fast. Tons of room inside. Only downfall is no compartments inside. I have a purse but since I had too many things the inside ripped and I had to fish for my stuff in the lining so I am going to use this as my purse. Good investment I am giving them as gifts.
5.0,Love love love these shoes. Classy and comfortable - can’t get any more perfect!
5.0,This was a gift.  Mom to be was very happy with it!
5.0,Got these for my 10yr old son. He loves his crocs so I figured I'd try these for the colder months. He says his feet stay warm all the time.
5.0,"Good clean lines , interesting style , Crisp"
5.0,"Pretty dress but since there is no pattern on the back, it shows panty lines (no matter what style you are wearing). The fit  and cut are very nice. 5'-7&#34;, 136, 32D"
5.0,Lovely blouse. Have worn it twice so far. Washed nicely too. Haven’t noticed any shrinkage. Sleeves are a tad long but I don’t mind. I’m larger chested as well and the blouse sits beautifully without any tightness. Totally recommend!
5.0,I wanted a cute t shirt that didn't feel rough or rigid. This shirt is very soft!
5.0,These earrings look great on both men and women.Solid design our family loves them!! I will definitely be buying more in different styles and colors.
5.0,I bought these cause my fav color is the lavender but they were actually comfortable and easy to use and I do love the different pastel colors. I was afraid that it wouldn’t attach right and my watch would slip out of it but it actually is very good I would definitely recommend.
5.0,"Got these for my 6 yr old for Chriatmas, she absolutely loves them."
5.0,its run big but love it

5.0,"My grandchild love it, feels very warm and soft, great buy!"
5.0,"Love it! Super warm, looks cute and is the perfect size for all kids"
5.0,"The photo and description accurately describe these earrings. The silver tone is shiny and perfectly counters the intensity of the rose gold. Because they are lightweight, the 4 dangling teardrops can move easily, creating different looks while you wear them...exactly what I was looking for."
5.0,I love it! Adjustable straps and hides any imperfections perfect for a graduation dress!<br />I bought a large it was too tight and ordered an X-Large it was perfect! The extra large is in the picture
5.0,Quality and thick material. Perfect for casual outings or can be dressed up.
5.0,He loves it ty
5.0,"I am 5'8&#34; and wear a waist size 12, hip size a 10.  I thought it was impossible to find a pair of leggings that could stay at my waist and not slide down during the day.  The last pair I had, I actually had to pull the legs up to my knees to keep the waist from sliding down.  These leggings exceed my expectations!  I could wear them all day and not feel any pulling, sagging, pinching or sliding--they are so comfortable.  And talk about soft!  Wow!  I can't wait to order them in a few of the design patterns.  Truly a must-have for all wardrobes."
5.0,Good fit and soft material.
5.0,Beautiful dress.  Color is perfect.
5.0,I bought this for my husband as a stocking stuff for christmas. As soon as he seen it he fell in love!!!

He get so many compliments from other guys and they always ask where can they purchased one.

5.0,Great Product. An awesome design of a longhorn!
5.0,"Bought these specifically for costume use. They fit snugly, I have big hands. Nice and thin, not heat retaining. They will get dirty quickly but that's okay with me it for an Art The Clown costume"
5.0,Very good quality leather. Very happy with the item.<br />I will be using them for years to come. Thank you!
5.0,The material is fabulous and soft 💖

5.0,So pretty and eye catching. It works well with most jewelry.Also a great price.
5.0,Awesome. Helped me identify my luggage!
5.0,Amazing I still have this wallet and it works great. I wanted this because I do not like the feeling of leather. My wallet has been through the wash 2 times and it still looks great and holds up.
5.0,It's comfortable and lightweight so it's easy to talk to other people. It does not hurt your eats so that's a plus. Most importantly it does not fog up my glasses. Also I love the way its adjustable . Would recommend this to others

5.0,These are so awesome! They'll be perfect for our halloween wedding!

5.0,It's a reputable band. No problem with it.
5.0,These are really a nice looking pair of sunglasses. They are comfortable and very nice quality. I received them at a discount for an honest review.
5.0,"Perfect dress with beautiful, bold colors!"
5.0,"Very comfortable, very convenient on a difficult hair day. I would recommend this product."
5.0,"These things are really popular to sell as phone charms, key chains, necklaces, and bracelets. The material seems extremely adequate for those tasks, and can be painted and further customized."
5.0,"Unique & absolutely Gorgeous!<br />Wow! A beautiful sterling silver pendent.  The rose and the heart say it all.  It is well made and I tried to show the a 3D view of it in the photos I attached.  The letter hanging in the middle is selectable and you can choose one letter from the alphabet to accompany the heart and the rose.  More importantly the letter hangs in the middle of two hearts (front and back which are attached at the bottom).  Refer to the photos attached and you’ll see it clearly.<br />Although the chain is thin but that too, just like the pendent, is well made and is sturdy enough.  The whole neckless is unique and expensive looking and more importantly, my wife loves it.  Whomever receiving this neckless will enjoy its beauty, uniqueness and the personalization touch.<br />If you are in the market for a piece of jewelry for a loved one, you will be very happy with this piece."

5.0,The balls were a little bigger than I thought but it’s exactly as it looks. And the sword piece looks amazing
5.0,"this company is golden! I made a mistake when writing the phone number on the personalization form. When we received it I obviously felt foolish. I wrote to the company just to make sure it wasn’t possibly their mistake. It was definitely my mistake. About a week later we received a new one in the mail with the correct phone number. I didn’t even ask them to do it. Amazing! If only all companies could be like that, so refreshing to feel like there’s actual humans running companies!  Thank you!!!!"
5.0,They are very long but fit around the waist
5.0,OMG THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL!!!
5.0,"I have bought several traditional Louis Garneau bibs and jerseys over the years.  They make first class / great quality stuff.  Top of the line!! I bought this shirt because I wanted a non-form fitting cycling shirt on for days when I and feeling ""heavy"". (Not the smallest guy out there).  This shirt is great. Love the material and the breathable back.  The back pocket is NOT my favorite place to put anything other then a few gells or a snake bar. But that's just nip-picking.  I do love this shirt!!!"
5.0,Love the fit and the color. The style is super cute!!

5.0,"It's cute. Looks like the photo. Unfortunately it just doesn't suit me. I have smallish boobs and this looks kinda big on me everywhere. 5'2&quot; 115lbs, not flat chested just small chested. Typically a 32,b I ordered a small and it's too big but like I said just like photo."
5.0,"These are handy, I keep one in my purse, just in case!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:2cdc0d0ea768dd50accaa5f80c78d6e6]] I really like this waist trainer, it’s one of the best  I’ve ever had. I love the fact that I can adjust the tightness however I want. It is pretty comfortable I’m able to wear it under my clothes when I go out, and it’s great to work out in. Overall I rate this a 5 out of 5."
5.0,It's nice and comfortable.It's very good for preschool.

5.0,those who doubt the power of moldavite or are scared if its chaotic influence if you set your intent this piece is perfect im probably going to get stronger meteorite created gems soon
5.0,"These might be my favorite pair of gaucho capris.  They are the perfect weight for summer.  Just lightweight enough to breathe, but not so lightweight that you see through them like some pairs that I've gotten before.<br /><br />I've seen on here that some people have said that they're too long.  I will tell you that for me they hit mid-calf and they were perfect.  I got a 3x, weigh 275, and am 6' tall.  So, I could definitely see that they might be more like pants on you if you were on the shorter side, or maybe just average height (I think average is 5' 6&#34; or so).<br /><br />In terms of quality, they're great.  I've had no issues with the fabric bleeding onto my skin (which is really common with gaucho/palazzo style pants), seams ripping, or shrinking with washing or drying.  And the lace on the bottom is just the best touch.  I get comments on them almost every time I wear them out."
5.0,"Super cute, but very short.  I definitely need to wear leggings under it."
5.0,"La calidad, los colores muy buenos"

5.0,Very nice and comfortable!!!
5.0,"Still my favorite style of glasses.  They fold to a very slim profile, which is great for dress shirts or suit pockets."
5.0,"I'm an ER nurse and this is what my family and I wear. Very comfortable, easy to adjust, washable and thick fabric with a filter.  Highly recommend these masks"
5.0,"I bought a white dress in size medium, I’m a curvy 145 lbs, normally wear a size 6 dress. The medium fit well. It was stretchy and fitted without being too tight. I wore this dress for my 10 year anniversary in Jamaica and I received many compliments! It’s very pretty and wrinkle resistant so it was perfect to pack in luggage!"
5.0,Muy bonito me encantó más práctico de usar gracias
5.0,The size was as expected.  The color is nice and the quality is good.  I have no negative comments
5.0,"I couldn't be more pleased.  The colors work beautifully together, the strands lie comfortably in place without bunching or tangling, and the 'necklace is an extremely versatile accessory for many different outfits.  I even enjoy the ease with which the clasp is &#34;buttoned&#34; securely in place!"
5.0,I really love these sandals. I had my last pair for six years and they held up wonderfully. They’re really comfortable and a very attractive sandal.

5.0,"I am a 3x,and this dress fits wonderfully. It is stunning on me. I highly recommend."
5.0,I'm glad the seller informed the buyers to choose one size larger. I usually wear a small but I bought a medium. It was a perfect fit and I love the style as length. I would purchase more dresses in the future from this company.
5.0,THEY ARE ADORIBLE WORTH THE PRICE.
5.0,I bought this apron for my husband as a Christmas gift.  He loves it because he is 6ft 3 in tall and it is long enough for him.  The leather is quality and worth the money!  The buckles are sturdy and durable.  Great choice if you are looking for a apron for multiple uses!
5.0,Such a beautiful and comfortable bracelet to wear.  Easy on and off.  I made a great buy.
5.0,Looks great!  My husband loved the gift. The only thing he did was change the strap.

5.0,"Loving the socks. Nice and long,  perfect fit"
5.0,"Just a expected, nice product."
5.0,I have a wide foot and these don't squeeze me at all.  They aren't heavy like some other flip flops.<br />Let's see how long they hold up.  You can't beat the price.  $15 for sparkly shoes is a great deal.
5.0,Super comfy and fits great
5.0,"Cute, casual, and comfortable dress. Its a universal feel and style and is comfortable enough to wear in or out. Can be dressed up with a sweater or cardigan and worn comfortably out. One thing I really enjoy and appreciate is the adjustable straps. As that is always a plus for any spaghetti strap tank. I like the subtle look of the print too as its not a flashy flowery design."
5.0,FITS AWSOMELY AND IS SUPERRRRRR CUTE !
5.0,The see socks are the bedt. Just as good as th ones I get from docs.  The colors make them seem like regular knee socks. They worked so well for me in relieving my leg pain. I am really happy with your product.
5.0,"We traveled for thanksgiving from San Diego to snowy upstate New York and I needed a book to last my daughter the week. This did the trick. She loved the fleece insert (which can be removed) and I think she’ll be getting more wear out of them as we start to get rain out here. She likes them, and for the price they have done exactly what I needed!"
5.0,It fit perfectly.
5.0,"Good quality, very warm, happy with the product"
5.0,"This my second pair. The are comfortable , great fit, and well made"

5.0,Very comfortable and easy on off!
5.0,They close tightly and fit perfect. Totally happy with the purchase!
5.0,So cute!!! Recomended for chunky feet. My son has wide feet and we were able to adjust the straps to fit comfortably.
5.0,"I have a strap that I use when I’m doing something like kayaking or doing some other thing where I have a concern about my glasses or sunglasses falling off or being knocked off of my face. That strap has a tail, though, and I thought it might be nice to have something that doesn’t.<br /><br />I’ll say, first of all, that adjusting the strap on the one that I already had, with the tail, is easier than adjusting the strap on these, especially when I am doing the adjustment while my glasses are on my head. However, I was able to adjust these myself without a lot of difficulty.<br /><br />Given how thin the material is, I think it would be pretty easy to hide the strap under hair if you have a fair bit of hair.<br /><br />These hold onto my glasses well. It does take a little bit of effort to attach them, but that is to be expected, and it’s what you want because if they slide on too easily, they likely would also slide off too easily.<br /><br />This is comfortable and does the job, but time will tell how well these straps hold up over the long term."
5.0,Excellent and warm for those cold weather jogs.  Very well made and durable as well.  They could be cut slightly longer but i am very pleased with the product.
5.0,This product amazes me by high quality material and good design. It seems very durable. My kid had a blast playing with me in the garden. I highly recommend this product for kid who loves outdoor gardening.

5.0,I appreciate this product by far. It's sound quality is the best of each Bluetooth Bernie I've had. Battery life isn't what they say however the quality & easy to use features make that a little problem when working an 8 hour shift nightstocking. Just charge  for an hour n half & it's good for remaining time at work.

5.0,Perfect for what I needed! I needed a Wallet to put my license and credit cards in that would fit in my pocket. I love the snap! It’s just a little extra insurance that that things wont fall out. There’s also a little extra room to put money in the middle if needed
5.0,Perfect addition to the stoles daughter wore at her college graduation! And quick delivery too! 🇭🇹 Proud Mom!
5.0,Nice color combination and good design
5.0,"After having received the wrong purses, we received the correct ones and we are more than pleased with them.  After talking to Hynes eagle Customer Service, they did a great job of following up to make everything right.  The correct purses are really nice."

5.0,"Nice, just what I needed....."
5.0,"I bought this watch because it closely resembles the classic Chronosport Sea Quartz 30 of the 1980's.  It's not too thick like modern dive / tactical watches.  The quartz movement keeps perfect time, and the solar recharging feature means I'll probably never have to change the battery.  Ever.  It easily withstands snorkeling and kayaking and still is stylish enough to wear to the clubs.  I am pretty happy with it - you will be too."
5.0,"This tree of live charm is beautiful. It looks way better than the photo. Impressed and excited to use it on my jewelry making projects. Totally recommend. It arrived early too, which is a plus."

THey get kind of annoying, but who cares?? They are adorable and you can find your kiddo anywhere!!! They are very lightweight and look like little high tops.

5.0,I have gotten so many compliments from both female and male. I wore this with my new cowboy boots. Very sexy!

5.0,This is one of several masks that fit me perfectly.  I needed it for a ballroom gown and the rhinestones were perfect
5.0,I love this set! Keeps everything organized and compact when I travel. It makes it much easier at the end of the trip to repack and eliminates the &#34;digging through the suitcase to find stuff&#34; problem. I do wish they would make this an 8-piece set and add an additional shoe bag.
5.0,"Simply &#34;The&#34; watch band to complement my Hamilton Khaki series watch; that, unfortunately, came with a nice but contrasting-color tan band."

5.0,She seems to like them.
5.0,Fits greats!
5.0,"I did this things where I bought this dress and took it to my tailor. She lowered the neckline slightly, shortened the sleeve and added horse ribbons to the bottom and now, TaDaa, it looks like my dress is a 4,000 dollar dress from Saks, which is essentially the comments I received at the very elegant white tie wedding I went to. That and how I looked like a princess, the skirt on this thing is amazing, it flows and moves beautifully and the detailing on he back is really well made. I will say, the color is more baby pink than the pictures describe, that was my only issue as I was hoping for a more champagne look, I would buy this again in a different color like a lilac grey or actual champagne."
5.0,Fix small but my wife could wear it
5.0,"Love this dress! Fits perfect, I got a large, I am 5'7&#34; 170lbs. The neck line is a little loose but still looks good, I tied the front and cuffed the sleeves. Can't wait to wear it for my birthday!"
5.0,"My daughter has been wearing this in gymnastics for a while now, and it's held up nicely! No rips or seam splitting."
5.0,As room parent it was my job to make up an end-of-the-year gift basket for our awesome 3rd grade teacher. I ordered this item and a bunch of other stuff and was impressed with the quality and sheer cuteness of them. Because of the color I think it could be gifted to any gender. Great add to our basket!
5.0,This is very comfortable and good color.  It is supplementing and replacing another.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks.
5.0,These are so cute. Makes a great gift
5.0,alot darker stones than the picture but still beautiful
5.0,"Wasn't sure how I'd like this color, cement, but turns out it's really nice. Material is a light-weight knit but not see-through. The medium fits me perfect.  I'm 5'5&#34; 150 lbs."
5.0,"The leather is soft and the color is rich. Lightweight but sturdy. Sits up nice and pretty when empty, not floppy at all. It is even better than I had hoped for. I need another in a smaller size in black for my everyday bag. The only thing that was a drawback was the shipping time. It was just over 2 weeks. Still not bad. I’m ordering another right now."
5.0,"Beautiful, as described."
5.0,Nice and very very good quality 👌👍
5.0,Not exactly the material I was looking for but it's wonderful and fits great.
5.0,Wow!  This dress is amazing!  I have never received more compliments in my life.  And it was so comfortable.  A little long but I didn't care.  I'm 5' 6&#34;.  I'm 50 years old and a size 12.  I purchased a medium.  I truly felt like a princess!
5.0,"Its light and stretchy, good for ocaasional use."

5.0,"Very comfortable and breathable, fair priced."
5.0,Very comfortable and cute dress. Fitted perfectly!
5.0,Really nice great material it's cotton and a little spandex it washes good but I didn't put it in the dryer and I bought it big to wear in the house but I would wear it out. Definitely worth the money
5.0,These have been great since it's gotten colder! The rubber on the bottom helps also!
5.0,I love the fit and length of these. Extremely comfortable. One of my all time favorites!
5.0,Nice cap to go along with my C8 Corvette.
5.0,I got this for a friend of mine and she loves it great quality
5.0,"For someone who practices yoga or Pilates regularly , these might provide an extra layer of comfort.<br />I got these and also ones that fully closed. I got these ones better than the fully closed ones.<br /><br />The fabric is soft , the fit is little bit tight . I wear a size 8.5 and I would say my feet are pretty normal-- I do not wear wide or narrow, just normal fit, and these socks are a little bit on the tight side of the spectrum for my toes. I like the tight feet on the feet but I felt like my toes could have benefited from some air. That is said, the more you wear it, the more they become comfortable. Next time I purchase these, I will get perhaps a large rather than a medium.<br /><br />That is said, their look and hold is awesome. they do not slip and this non -slippage especially in poses like triangle, warriors --or  actually anything that requires form foot grip. I think this would be especially beneficial for the practitioners of the Bikram due to sweat slippage. I do vinyasa and prana and I do not seat that much but still appreciate the form hold.<br /><br />I also sometimes do not like my toes to be showing during yoga: sometimes I become a little too toe-aware. I should love my body yada yada yada but still it happens, These solve that problem!<br /><br />I receive this product at a discount for my honest review, that is said , I do not overrate an item because of the discount. These socks are very good for a stable , comfortable yoga / mat practice."
5.0,"Pretty, shiney, love it!"
5.0,My husband loves the bands! Very comfortable.  Thank you.

5.0,It has a length 12-16 inches and is super cute!
5.0,"I bought a large to have room to breathe but a medium probably would have been the proper fit for me size. Comfy set, not scratchy, the cream color is slightly see through."
5.0,"I already own the black one at the same length. It's good for a beach cover-up, or anywhere really. It dries fast too. I wear with a swimsuit top or tank. I normally would wear a small, but I like this for the extra wrap coverage, plus I wear it lower, below the waist."
5.0,I have yet to wear the cap but it looks great next to my dad's picture

5.0,Beautiful and different.
5.0,Smart looking casual for males.  Fits my teen grandsons perfect.  Good buy for quality product
5.0,"These sandals are everything promised. They have good arch support and are quite comfortable. The adjustable straps make it possible to wear these with or without socks. They are sufficiently lightweight to make it possible to bag them and carry them in a backpack or larger purse. I’m not sure about hiking in them. It depends on the trail. If the trail is smooth, fine. If it’s rocky, sandals are not the best for that – any sandals. They are great for walking around my neighborhood, shopping, etc. I don’t know about the beach. I live in the desert. Recommended"
5.0,"Fits beautifully, true to size!"
5.0,Looks beautiful on my granddaughter.  She does makeup and costuming and needs several different wigs.
5.0,Love ❤️ it
5.0,My little 4 year old loves this!!!
5.0,"These are surprisingly good quality for a nice price. The pocket and fit are perfect. They don't turn see through when you put them on either. Overall, a good buy."
5.0,Fit perfectly my son loved it.
5.0,"This is very nice. I don’t think you can get a better ventilated jacket for this price. Nice hood that is perfect distance from face.  I live in beekeeping apparel and this will be perfect for a hot day fast throw on, when a full suit is overkill. I will be happy if it lasts a year. The zipper is not the best quality. Hopefully I can still buy the next one on EBay for a lot less, now that I know that it works. I wear a Medium and this Medium is the same as other Medium bee suits."
5.0,"This was perfect for my 3 year olds birthday party. It was fluffy and thick great quality, she loves it and will be able to play dress up again and again with it"
5.0,"The color and design is not quite like the picture but in a good way! I ordered the Dark Blue and i got just that! That is very rare that you receive something better than the image. I am in love with this. Fabric is super soft. The length is perfect, lands right at my belly button and it doesn't show too much when you raise your arms up. 20/10!! Highly recommend.<br /><br />Size: XL  Color: Dark Blue"
5.0,Looks good.  Fits good.  What more can you ask for?
5.0,Great maxi dress priced far below other online sellers.
5.0,So beautiful. Pictures do it no justice.
5.0,"I wore these leggings while rock climbing. Not only was I comfortable and pretty warm, considering the low temperature and winds, but they stood up to the numerous times I had to butt scoot over granite. Can’t find a tear in them. I am super impressed."
5.0,I use to be upset over this type of sock slipping down in to  my shoe .I love these because they are pretty and they stay put !!!!
5.0,"This is great! I gave it as a gift for my brother and he loves it. It looks like any vintage tshirt. You wouldn't know it is from Tommy Boy unless you're a  super fan like we are.  Hes gotten a few complements,  mostly people quoting, ""Brothers dont shake hands...brothers gotta hug."" You know a Tommy Boy fan, this is a great purchase."
5.0,"great fit, sturdy readers.  Took too long (weeks) to arrive"
5.0,"By no means is this some high tech 200 dollar watch, but it is a light weight, high value, and useful watch. There isn't much else you could want from a watch.<br /><br />The four features of the watch are all you need. You've got your regular time setting, dual time, a stop watch, and best of all, an alarm clock. Along with this, the watch is water proof. What a bargain!<br /><br />The instructions for the watch are simple, and setting it up is a breeze so long as you can read. Figuring out the alarm clock was a bit tricky, but after doing it a few times, it come naturally. Once you have all the settings set you should be able to toggle back and forth from settings with ease.<br /><br />The dual time feature is useful when traveling or keeping up with loved ones in other parts of the world. You can also choose between 24 hour or 12 hour time settings with one press of a button.<br /><br />For ten dollars you shouldn't expect the best made watch. I've had it for a month now and can already tell that it can't take a beating, so I recommend taking caution with it. In the end though, this watch is a great deal if all you need is a simple watch with an alarm clock."
5.0,"Great colors and fits as expected. It hits a bit below the knee on me, I'm about 5ft4in and 106lbs. It fits a little tighter, but not too tight which is what I wanted. The material is a silky feeling and very comfortable, I have a thing with clothing textures and was leery that this may be one of the fabrics that would be scratchy. I am very happy that it is silky and not scratchy! I would recommend this."
5.0,"I bought these for my fiancé for his wedding ring while he is working, as he is a construction worker. I knew he would need these & they fit well! He loves them & having a variety of colors to choose from is awesome. ;)"
5.0,Exactly what I wanted.  A not too fancy tactical looking belt that I can wear with my uniform for work.  Came with a bonus buckle too.  Easy to use.
5.0,"Fits perfectly, looks really great too!  Surprisingly, the volume buttons even though covered are still very tactile and easy to operate."
5.0,I absolutely love these charms you get a huge variety so I was able to share and give some away. I would definitely recommend.
5.0,Great dress for the price! Many compliments both as a dinner dress with heals or everyday casual dress with sandals.
5.0,Good quality comfortable and supportive
5.0,"Definitely a loose and flow effect. The fabric is a very soft and flattering. I haven’t worn it out yet but when I tried it on I was very happy with it, especially for the price. It will be very comfortable in the summer."
5.0,Just as described. Love it. Love the fact that stretches to fit custom in all the right places.
5.0,"These pretty individually wrapped square scarves are perfect for a pony tail, purse addition or a cute look with a blouse.  You cannot go wrong with the price too.  Great purchase!"
5.0,"quality fabric, lace is beautiful!"
5.0,Great dress for a wonderful price!  Fit well and was comfy to wear.  I added a cardigan to it and it looked great!  Looking forward to wearing it again for another event.
5.0,Bought to wear to an event in jamaica. Very nice
5.0,"Perfect fit and LOVE the small arm holes. So tired of tops that have arm holes half way to my waist, showing all of my bra. This blouse is perfect!"
5.0,Excellent product very good quality ... I RECOMMEND WIDELY TO THE COMMUNITY OF AMAZON
5.0,Perfect fit for 5'6&#34; tall and 134lbs. Item is exactly as pictured!
5.0,Grndaon loved these
5.0,Pretty socks and nice fit.
5.0,A good product. Reasonably priced.
5.0,Bought  for a school dress up frontier day.  Hat was as seen however you get the color they send you so beware if your trying to match colors.
5.0,Hat
5.0,Great eyeglass case.  Your eyeglasses must be small to fit in the case.  The case cover is clothe.  I like the flower design on it.  All said I like it.
5.0,"This is my most favorite shirt I’ve bought! It fits perfectly, is flattering how it lays, covers my tummy, isn’t too tight around the waist. The quality is fabulous, washes well! I love it! Definitely worth the purchase!!"
5.0,Loved it used it as decor for office for halloween
5.0,Soft. Cute. True to size. Happy with my purchase
5.0,Color is a little uneven but nice overall.
5.0,"It's a beautiful summer dress! Wrinkles very easily. It's a bit see thru but that's can be taken care of with nude under garments, can't wait to buy the other colors. I love how flowy the dress is, I could've gone down a size but I didn't want to loose the flow of the dress."
5.0,"Good printing good bandana, it's larger than a standard bandana so when I wrap it around my head you can't see the dragons, I'll find a diffrent use for it than a head wrap"
5.0,"They are kind of thin, so I don’t think they are actual sweat pants.  They are good for medium temperature environments. They fit my big butt without being too tight. The colors are bold and beautiful. They are comfortable and allow free body movement."
5.0,One of my original Guitar Plug Keychains broke and I lost it. Glad they make and sell replacements. I thought I was going to have to make one myself with one of my own instrument cables.
5.0,"Very colorful and comfortable I bought them for Pride Month but I wear them all the time,"
5.0,This was a gift and this was perfect.
5.0,"Love these pants and the pockets!  Fit nice, wear nice, wash well.  Fit as expected."
5.0,These sandals are so cute and I love wearing them.
5.0,"Just like other customers I am very happy with this dress.  It fits perfect, it falls very nicely on the body without showing off flaws.  The fabric is thicker with some give and is very nice.  I got the black, size large.  I am 175# and 5'6&#34;, usually a 12.  It can pass as retro, it could pass as modern.  I wore it with a black retro pump and black nylons with simple jewelry.  It gave me a classic look that was just dressed up enough.  The dress fell to just about below my knee.  There is a side zipper which is placed very well, giving the dress an even cleaner look.  I will definitely buy from this seller again and plan on looking at the other dresses they offer."
5.0,Very  comfortable. Husband and friend commented on amazing look. Black and gold size 9 Wide. Plenty of toe room for hammer toe.
5.0,This watch is pretty nice. It is hard to read the face in certain light levels but the overall aesthetic is classy. It is thin but it feels pretty sturdy. The color is also a really nice gunmetal gray stainless steel that is polished. The size should be good for just about any wrist size without looking too big or small.
5.0,Looks just like the photo!! Love it! It's sheer so don't expect much warmth but expect a super cute scarf!
5.0,"Gorgeous dress, but long enough for a supermodel! Material is very soft and not see through."
5.0,I am so impressed with both vests! We wear them on our nighttime walks. I feel safer knowing that we are wearing these reflective vests!
5.0,Been using Reebok trunks for a long time and they never fail to satisfy quality and fit wise for the money.
5.0,I purchased this watch for my husband for our anniversary and he loves it! it is perfect for casual or more formal events! the scale or the face is great and love how expensive it looks! Would highly recommend!
5.0,Adorable! My daughter looked beautiful this this dress.
5.0,like as said it would be.  price FP
5.0,Was satisfied with my flower of Life necklace
5.0,This is a lovely bracelet that will make a nice gift. It’s not cheep or cheesy looking it looks expensive
5.0,work to keep sun off my hands. Used on beach while surf fishing and holding the pole and baiting the hook was possible without any problems. Use them also for holding binoculars. This is the 5th and 6th pair I purchased. Have some stashed in both cars - in my mobility scooter basket - and I have only worn one pair out. I use them often! I wash them with the regular wash and hang to dry. They dry quickly.
5.0,I need to exchange for a size 12. They are a bit too big.
5.0,"I love these sports bras - comfy, well made and perfect for walking and working around the house."
5.0,"Beautiful color, super spacious..."
5.0,"This is a utilitarian product and does what I need: a robe that’s easy to get on/off after the shower that will keep me from getting super hot or from having sleeves in my face as I dry my hair. It isn’t winning any style awards, that’s for sure. When you hit 40, sometimes you realize that your great aunt’s muumuus are way more practical than you ever imagined. It is a little short, so be warned that you could give a show if you wear this to get the newspaper. I’m assuming that most people who buy this get newspapers."
5.0,ordered this dress for a wedding vow renewal ceremony. the color is vrey pretty and the wait of this dress is very flattering!
5.0,🍻
5.0,"Beautiful fit, perfect in every way."
5.0,I was just blown away when I opened the box. This is a definite statement piece! What a gorgeous addition to my jewelry wardrobe.
5.0,My sister loved it! Its soft and warm but not too thick!
5.0,Love it better than the picture
5.0,"I am 5'2"" and the length is PERFECT. It falls just at my feet so I can wear it with flats or heels. I bought this to wear pregnant and to wear after baby. It works great with my 22 week bump. Very comfy!! I just throw a cardigan over it for now. Then after baby comes in May, it'll be a good, easy summer dress to (hopefully) flatter the post-partum bump. It is quick and easy to throw on (win for a soon-to-be mom of 2!!). I've washed and dried it once and it held up great in the wash (no shrinking, yay!!). My pre-baby weight is 154 lbs (currently 170 lbs at 22 weeks) and the large fits perfectly. Can't wait to buy more colors!<br /><br />Edit: still loving this dress 5 weeks later at 27 weeks pregnant! I bought 2 more colors!!!!!! Its been washed and dried several times and is holding up great. Excellent quality! All the designs are so pretty! Very comfy and easy to wear!"
5.0,I love love love this product.  I hang the phone around my neck and off I go and the best part is  I don't have to dig in my purse to find my phone.
5.0,awesome. wear everywhere
5.0,The sunglasses fit comfortably and well. I like the shade of the lenses. I would recommend them to others.
5.0,great stuff fast shipping
5.0,Nice! Thanks!
5.0,This robe is absolutely beautiful and so soft. I highly recommend it.
5.0,"Perfect for lounging around the house, sleeping, even running errands. I am relatively tall -- 5' 8&#34; -- and usually have trouble with length being too short but these are a great length."
5.0,Nice shirt and great color
5.0,This cloth works amazingly well when shining silver.
5.0,I love the mask. This is a great product.
5.0,Purchased for my husband to replace had he had for years. So glad to find this. it's well-made but we had to return the first one as I bought one too large. They are individual as they are hand-woven.  The company was great about the exchange so I had to pay postage to return the first one. I only complaint is the sizing is erratic trying to decide whether to buy a large or by the actual head size.
5.0,"omg its perfect! size, stretch, breathability, style."
5.0,fit great very comfortable
5.0,"Gorgeous, ballet bag interior compartment for each ballet slipper+ a zippered inner pocket for hair bands etc. Fits body, suit, tights and a light change of clothes. Cute and functional. Hoping it washes well :) PERFECT!"
5.0,It's great in all ways!!
5.0,Looked wonderful with my tux on my wedding day<br />And amazon with 1 day delivery wedding was on the 12th i ordered on the 11th got them that morning
5.0,Love it and soft
5.0,"Was kind of a pain to install, but once on, fit the GA-110 perfectly."
5.0,"Great look, it suits the purpose for which it was bought and the fit is great. I had to place  heavy objects on the edges to smooth them out on arrival as it was sent bent."
5.0,Gift for father
5.0,"Bought them for my son who spends a lot of time in the gym. He loved them enough to order another 3-pack in other colors. Definitely his go-to gym shirt now! They are dry-wick, with small, aerating holes in the material. They fit well and move well. He likes the deeper cut on the armholes, as well. Great purchase!"
5.0,I order about 1 size bigger. Original size is too small
5.0,"I Really Enjoy The Watch I Received -It Go's Really Well With Everything I Wear. Awesome Detail Of The Brand Style And I Know It Would Work For Any Female Buyer- Thanks So Much For Awesome Product That Has A Tick Tick Tick Beat Too It![[ASIN:B06ZYQ7HZ6 ETEVON Women Quartz Black Leather Strap Watch with Date Window Starlight Dial Rose Gold Stainless Steel Case, Casual Dress Wrist Watches for Ladies]]"
5.0,Petfect
5.0,My grand daughter loved it for bracelets she’s making
5.0,The sizing chart guide was very accurate and the overall fit and durability are very good. 10/10 recommend this uniform as well as the seller. They were very prompt about delivery and took care to package it well for shipping. Overall great quality and reasonable price.
5.0,Perfect shoe for lifting. Fits a wide foot too.
5.0,"I loveeeee this dress .. , I'm just sad because the seller just have 1 option of color , I wish they have diferent colors so I can buy everything :) .. I'm 5'6&#34; 157 pounds ,  I ordered &#34; L &#34; It Fits perfect"
5.0,Cute sweater with a mock turtle neck.
5.0,Does what it's supposed to.
5.0,I love this top
5.0,"I was looking for seamless toe socks, thanks to your company, these socks are also very excellent in quality."
5.0,"Very comfortable, sucks you in just right. I’m 5’ 4” and it is just a smidge long."
5.0,This is so cool! Looks great and my son absolutely loves you!!!
5.0,Great dress and fits well
5.0,Perfect size for me. I was looking for a nice simple watch and this fullfilled my need.
5.0,I love these pants so much that I bought a second pair in a different color. They are super comfortable and look great! Just buy them.
5.0,"Holds the chips I get from AA just fine.  Soft, light material.  Highly recommend."
5.0,Perfectly sized. Wore them to the gym and loved it.
5.0,"Nice hat, fits as expected.  Will get lost in the snow, don't drop it outside in the winter."
5.0,"It is almost like I am not wearing a band, it is THAT comfortable. It also has a cool looking texture to the fabric (the grey one)"
5.0,Beautiful and fast delivery. I put a lighter in 2nd picture for size reference.
5.0,"Really nice, feel heavy, non flimsy, I have 2 glasses from these guys!"
5.0,These genuinely work.
5.0,"This is the 3rd time I have purchased a pair of these over the past 6 years.  They fit great, look nice and are good for everything I need a sneaker for."
5.0,Easier to breathe than other mask I've bought. Covers more area then others
5.0,Pretty but they fell apart
5.0,I had a pair and wore them out- so had to get a new pair of shorts
5.0,This is such a clever system. My new favorite necklace. Can dress up or down and I get a ton of complements. So far I only have one Jewel Pop for it. But I can't wait to start a collection.
5.0,"Make sure they ship it FLAT!  The instructions are clear this hat needs storing flat. The first one sent to me was folded in half and leaves a permanent crease.<br /><br />It's a great hat. I have one for my child but I wouldn't recommend them for kids due to the high price along with that the hat must lay flat when stored. My husband liked it so much he ordered one to protect his neck on hikes. It's keep him cool and protected his neck so he's very happy with it.<br /><br />Personally it's not a hat for me, I like one I van shove in a bag and have a kid step on it, get drooled on and run over and still put it back into shape."
5.0,"Me encantan estos calcetines, son súper cómodos y me ayudan a no resbalar."
5.0,"I purchased the solid black scrub hat and I absolutely love it! It is very comfortable, it stays in one place, it keeps sweat from dripping down my face and it protects my hair from breakage. Which is why I bought it in the first place. The rubber on all the PPE I have to wear is a nightmare, but this hat, saves the day! You are also supporting an amazing small business with every purchase and that is a win in my book. Their customer service is friendly and they also put extra love in the packaging. I am recommending them to everyone! Great quality for an affordable price."
5.0,"The shirt fit perfectly. Material of shirt is good. I thought the shirt might be tight & that the material would be cheap. But, to my surprise the shirt is good 👍  I'm always leery about buying clothes online because you never know what you're gonna get."
5.0,"The silky smooth fabric feels so good and the cut is flattering and very comfortable. This is an amazing garment! I want five more in all different colors! I ordered green this time. I am 5' 10&#34; and weigh 153 pounds and included an image so you can see how it fits on me. I cinched it a lot on the chest; it could well accommodate someone more well endowed than my B/C cup size.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Flowy, comfortable fabric<br />- Quality printing of design<br />- Nice cut; fairly universally flattering, could fit multiple body types<br />- Long enough to cover my rear end, which many &#34;cover ups&#34; do not<br />- Pretty enough to be worn as a standalone top with jeans etc (undershirt could help if you're uncomfortable with the low V which looks fine with a bathing suit)<br />- Comfortable and flowy enough to be my new favorite nightgown<br /><br />Cons:<br />- None!<br /><br />In conclusion, this is my new favorite top and I am going to order more. I received this item at a discount for reviewing purposes but am so pleased I am fully prepared to by it in different colors at full price. It is that good!"
5.0,"We've been using Coolibar hats for our kids since they were babies (we have 4 ages 4-11).  Love the fact that they can be smooshed in a bag, worn, wrung out if they end up floating on the water and put right back on.  We wash these on delicate when necessary and air dry.  We finally retired our first daughter's hat that our third daughter was wearing and finally grew out of.  The hat was 7 years old and still doing a great job protecting her precious head!"
5.0,This bracelet is unique and beautiful! I get so many compliments when I wear it.  It's very easy to put on and you can wear it two different ways.  Its also adjustable.  My wrist is eight inches.  I also had a jeweler verify that it is sterling silver.
5.0,Comfortable fits great.
5.0,Was exactly as described and expected
5.0,They’re beautiful and fit in my ears perfectly. They feel like they’re very good quality and they’re heavy. They came faster than expected so that’s a plus too
5.0,"I like everything about this skirt, the color, the fit, it's well made, the price , and it's wash & wear."
5.0,"We have had an excellent experience. The seller responded promptly to a question we had, and the flag football set arrived quickly. We tested it out this weekend at the beach ... it's a high quality product!"
5.0,"I bought this bag for present, it looks so awesome , stylish , nice design . Thinking to buy for myself as well"
5.0,"These earrings are perfect for women or men. They are not too big and not too small. They came in very nice packaging as if you bought it straight from a Jeweler' store. I love how there are 2 different backs for the earrings included in the package as well. I like to have the options for the backs as well as having a backup in case I lose one of the back (which I tend to do alot). They are very cute and fashionable and I am so far very impressed. They are shiny and I have gotten many compliments when I wore them, a few people even asked me if they were real. I may have to purchase a couple more pairs for gifts for my family members!! I received this product at a discount in an exchange of my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,The socks work well although they cramp my toes occasionally.
5.0,"I ordered this A for Awesome Boys T shirt for our son and he says he likes it so much and that it is a really cute top! He says that he likes the orange color, the design and the styling of the crewneck, front Art graphic with embroidery, and the pieced trim neck collar.<br />Our son says he likes that the T- shirt fits him perfectly well and he likes that this short sleeve is comfortable to wear, easy to put on and take off as needed. He says he likes that the shirt is soft, smooth to touch and gentle on his skin, and he says he likes that this T-shirt appears to be made with good quality material with 60% cotton and 40% polyester and it seems to be stylish, lightweight, durable and breathable.<br />Our son says that the top matches some of his jeans, pants, and shoes. My wife says that she has only washed it once and so far so good, as it retains its quality and color. Considering the quality and the price point, it seems to be great value for bucks. I would recommend it."
5.0,"Very cute, just as pictured, exactly what I expected, love it!"
5.0,"Me encantó, es hermoso y queda a la media"
5.0,I recommend this product. several different color options and great quality.
5.0,super cool
5.0,ENAMORADA DE ESTO
5.0,I've just received it and put it on... it is exactly what I was looking for in a statement piece.  Quality is good for the price and believe I will get a lot of wear out of it ;)
5.0,"Nice and good quality,  thanks!"
5.0,"First off, I got this necklace for my wife because she loves clovers. She loves it! It's kind of small, but really great quality. If you're thinking about buying this just do it. You won't regret it!"
5.0,"The quality is fantastic, the prints are cute, and while it could stand to have a slightly larger capacity it does the job just fine."

5.0,MY TALL GRANDSON LOVES IT ! HE'S IN ADULT SIZES NOW AND A LARGE FITS PERFECTLY. THIS IS NOT CHEAPLY MADE BUT A WONDERFUL SHIRT ! VERY PROFESSIONALLY MADE !
5.0,"Love this dress, been using it."
5.0,Lost last one.
5.0,"Love these!  Large, warm muffs, and generous band (fits my larger than average size head without tightness).  Comfortable.  How did I get through our winters without them?  A definite must for cold winter weather, and definitely work better for me than the behind-the-head band ear muffs which I've tried several times."
5.0,"Strap is good quality and slides in and out easily BUT color is not red, kind of a salmon.  Would send back but to much hassle for the price.<br />Update to original post.  Customer service has been brilliant to work with.  That is what update to 5 stars."

5.0,Flattering and soft
5.0,Very good quality socks!
5.0,I love these and I love the pockets on the side
5.0,"Purchased these for my husband who is extremely rough on his sunglasses.  He works outside all day and needs the eye protection from UV rays and tends to be a bit rough with his eye wear, so I needed to find him a pair of sunglasses that will hold up to the abuse he puts on his sunglasses.  He loves these, the fit was perfect for him, very impressed with how the ear piece is a bit longer so they ends do not scratch the lenses (which is what happened with his last pair).  The frame is very solid feeling, just a great overall fit / feel for him.  The carrying case is very well made, will keep the glasses protected during tumbles out of his truck."
5.0,It's a batman hat for toddlers. What's not to like.
5.0,Has a nose piece to help with fit and prevent glasses fogging up

5.0,What I was looking for!
5.0,Will order again
5.0,It is difficult to find square earrings for boys to wear and these were perfect.  They came quickly and were exactly as promised.
5.0,"Very very soft, great colors. The traction is good."
5.0,"I'm 5' 9&quot; and weigh 165. I always order a large when buying fitted clothing. This large fit, to me, like an XL.<br />However, that does not take away from the quality of the pant. Very nice material, great color and no wrinkling.<br />Also, I have a 35&quot; inseam and these are exactly as described. I haven't washed them yet because I'm exchanging them for a medium."
5.0,"Great socks for the price, they stay put when I am on my feet constantly"

5.0,"These glasses are fantastic! Super flexible! They fit great on my 6yo son. He's used them all week while in FL on vacation. Last year my kids lost their sunglasses in the ocean. This year, I bought the candyhome sunglasses straps sold here on Amazon and they work great! Haven't lost them yet."

5.0,Fits as stated
5.0,This has become my new favorite bonnet.
5.0,"True to size. I like how the stones are bezel set. In my opinion makes it look cleaner, neater. As with most clickers, sometimes it takes a little maneuvering to close but it isn't terrible. I had mine out of the package and installed as little as ten minutes."
5.0,"Product as described, perfect fit, love the pj's"
5.0,Exactly as advertised.  Quick shipment.

5.0,"Color looks closer to beige than apricot. Soft fabric, great fit!"
5.0,"These are beautiful and great dupes of the Love bracelets designed by Cartier. Those bracelets are anywhere from $2,000-$15,000. I ordered a gold bracelet, excited to wear the piece."
5.0,Excellent. Love the sturdy leather. Just as described.
5.0,"Very impressed for the money, better than most. I wear a 10.5 work boot , I ordered a 12 and are perfect with no sox"
5.0,These feel great...and no one suspects they are compression socks.
5.0,Me encanto hermosos delicados lo q esperaba tal cual como en la foto
5.0,The hoodie from to size for family member 3x good quality and stretchy. It's not thick a thinner material.
5.0,I love this little piece of fabric. If your bad at wrapping your hair like me this is for you. I purchased two and then purchased two more for my mother. She just mentioned she wanted more colors so I will be ordering more for the both of us.
5.0,It’s so pretty and will be so cute this summer.
5.0,Gorgeous heavy ring.  Very very detailed.  Would have paid twice that for it in person.
5.0,"Big ups to Maggie from Shangpule!! Very great customer service! Had a small issue with my band but she managed to solve the problem and send me a new one , ABSOLUTELY FREE! I only wish there were more people like her. Thanks again Maggie!!"
5.0,"I wasn't sure what size to order this in because my bust is small, waist is medium, and butt/hips is large. I ordered an XL just to be safe but I'm swimming in it. So I will exchange for a smaller size. The quality of the dress is good & I got the package w/in 2 weeks which is decent considering where I live."
5.0,The 3yr old boy loves the sunglasses. Every time we leave the house he always asks for his glasses. It's cute
5.0,Pretty and well made
5.0,Love it! It adjusted well
5.0,"Getting compliments from watch-collecting friends. Good fit, but note that the material is a thick, so I had to do a bit of minor surgery to the watch case to allow the webbing to fit (the width is fine, I am talking about the thickness)."
5.0,My granddaughter loves these boots.  Happy with purchase.
5.0,Received so many compliments.  Amazing skirt.
5.0,Great mask and good quality
5.0,Really cute men's Halloween socks. Good quality. My son was very happy with them
5.0,"Loved this shirt for a weekend with family. So soft, true to size, washes well."
5.0,"Let's get all of the bad out of the way first. (or skip to the good bc there's a LOT good)<br /><br />It came with some stitching missing at the waist mesh. I could have exchanged for a new one, but it took me 3 minutes to stitch it up. Also, I had a ring that snagged the material in several places. It's not high quality material, but I just trimmed it with scissors and it was fine!<br /><br />The good: I LOVE this dress and I felt like a Disney villain goddess in it. I'm 6'2"" and I was wearing 4 inch heels, so it is long. I bought when I was 258 pounds and with the right shapewear, I would have loved it then. But that was last year and I was down to just under 200 when I wore it. Boob tape is your friend (the stuff is magic!).<br /><br />The material is not expensive, but it's completely wrinkle proof and it's so stretchy, leaving lots of wiggle room for different shapes and sizes.<br /><br />I'm going to wear it again on St. Patty's. I'm going to throw a Clue party just to be Professor Green. I love this dress."
5.0,All the functions work as advertised and the watch some very good looking.
5.0,I have been using this for years in my sonic cleaner machine. Love it
5.0,Looks very realistic!
5.0,"I'm 5'7"", 140 pounds, 36DD, hourglass shaped, and ordered this dress in S. It fits me like a glow. Length is exactly at knee, so I suppose it's to be taken into consideration if you're shorter (it will probably hit below your knee). Also, if you have a generous chest, you better like to show some cleavage (I'm sure this will not be a problem for ladies with cups below C). The material is soft and breathable, but not too thin - I am *extremely* fussy with the fabric I wear. Take my word for it.<br />I will also say that this style resembles similar ones that I found on Amazon from other brands at a cheaper price, BUT fit and material are definitely worth the extra bucks. Dress can be dressed up or down.<br />I purchased several dresses from PattiBoutique (and I will purchase more!) but so far this is my absolute favorite. Classic, chic, perfect for any occasion. Must have in your closet. Just. Buy. It."
5.0,"There were a gift for my grandson for his birthday and he loves them.  He is a Zelda fan.  He lives in another state so I sent them and when face timing with him, he held up his foot and showed me the pair he had on.  He loves them."

5.0,One of my new fav shirts!!!
5.0,"Nothing to dislike at all.  What a great suit.  Unfortunately, I will need to return it, due to MY weird proportions....just doesn't fit me right."
5.0,Love the Tank tops. Very comfy and great fitting.
5.0,Love these earrings!  I wish it was easier to determine the sizes of the earrings on line.  These were perfect but some others I purchased are a little bigger than I had hoped.  These were just right!
5.0,These packing accessories are awesome!!!  I can't believe how much clothing I was able to fit into these bags....we recently went on a 2 week trip to Alaska (land and cruise) and I was so organized and packed according to item.  I would highly recommend these for any traveler!
5.0,Fits as advertised and looks good

5.0,Great sunnies!
5.0,Makes my wedding ring look brand new! Love this stuff.
5.0,Slightly smaller than expected. Pay attention specifications when ordering. Haven't really tested strength yet.
5.0,The blue Sapphire Zirconia Pendant is a perfect replacement for one that I lost. It looks exactly like the one I lost.
5.0,Loving it so far! This baby is warm... it covers my ears and neck. It could use an inch or two on the length to be perfect. It will fit snug and I don't have any need for the cordlock.
5.0,I am buying many more pairs.  They really are comfortable.
5.0,"I bought this as a X-mas gift for my wife. She Loves Michael Kors products. While I didn't have the money to spend on a larger purse, I thought that this could be her &#34;starter piece&#34;. It came exactly as described. She uses it to carry in place of a regular full purse. Her Iphone (without case), license, credit cards and cash fit nicely inside."
5.0,"The colors are unique and I can find my bag easily amongst other bags. I take it sailing and camping so it is durable. The zipper is large for easy access to items inside. Lastly, folds up small for easy storage."
5.0,"Great Quality, my son loves this galaxy hat."
5.0,These glasses came today which were right on time. The quality is amazing! The fit is perfect! I am so glad that I decided to get these. They are polarized which just adds to the greatness! Y’all need to buy these for real! You won’t be disappointed!

5.0,came in earlier. very pleased with the necklace. my granddaughter will love it.
5.0,Me agrado todo el diseño.
5.0,Material is a nice weight. Not tight but very flattering. Color is perfect.  For the money I didn’t expect this to be so nice.
5.0,"This Dress has a good quality fabric, perfect for wear at work or business affairs. Features elbow length sleeves and the skirt comes below knees. The dress come with a black patent belt, but you can wear your belts in other colors like red for match with the shoes. I bought the size XL but sadly was too big in bodice. A size Large would be perfect. So pay attention to size chart before buy it."
5.0,"Love the dress but it was way too long.  Had to have it altered but for this price, why not."
5.0,Fits perfectly. True to size. Comfortable. Love them.
5.0,All I can say is Wonderful!!!
5.0,Perfect and says it all. Nothing else needs to be said.
5.0,"Love this! Have a similar style in the magenta that I had so many compliments on— so when I needed a dress for a wedding, I picked this one up!"
5.0,Wow!! do i love it... and Beautiful it is!!!
5.0,"Got these yesterday for my daughter, came in very protective packaging.. very nice sturdy sunglasses.. will be ordering another pair."
5.0,Nice quality.  I'm 5'11 165. Its perfect in length. Not see through.
5.0,Could be a little longer...I'm a fat boy! :)
5.0,"looks exactly like the picture great quality , we broke up but they're adorable sweatshirts ^,^"
5.0,Even better in person!
5.0,These are the most comfortable pajamas that I have ever worn. I bought 2 pairs and I plan to order a couple more different colors😊
5.0,This is the second time I have ordered ties for this store.  Quality is very good and value is very good also.  I will continue to shop for ties from here iin the future
5.0,"Beautiful ring.  Feels solid, stones set well and sparkly"
5.0,Great dress! I'm 5'11 so it is hard to find dresses with enough length but this dress is prefect.
5.0,"Beautiful dress, good quality, perfect fit, good price, I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND.  LOVE IT!!!!"
5.0,"I bought a large bc I don't like things really tight.<br />I'm 5'4"" and 108 lbs and the large fits perfectly. BUT look at the size chart and measure your hips/waist.<br /><br />I got the black (only problem is I have a WHITE Cat...so they are pretty furry!)<br />They are not sheer (I can wear them to the store and they look great~)<br /><br />Would def buy another pair."
5.0,"It's s satin-dream! So soft and silky and nice! I ordered mine a bit bigger on purpose so it would be nice a comfy and not restraining at all. I especially like that since the material is so airy, it can be worn in the summer."
5.0,"Very comfortable. Easy to fit to get a good seal. The filter pocket is great, along with the nose wire and ear adjusters... all in all one of the better commercially made masks I’ve purchased!"
5.0,"If your toddler loves Shimmer and Shine, then these shoes are a great choice."
5.0,This is perfect for the abuse my watch takes in a welding shop environment.
5.0,"Value..  well we’ll just say that the rings on the chain “give out”.. meaning when you pull the pocket watch out,  it breaks!  I M-Gyvered it twice. I was sad because I bought it for our 8th wedding anniversary.  Because it is bronze,  I bought it.  Bronze is one of the traditional gifts for an 8th anniversary.  Overall it is a substantial timepiece.  My husband is very pleased with his gift."
5.0,I love these for daily wear. They are a nice firm fit and flattering. They come in several colors
5.0,"Nice cotton panties that fit comfortably from my second to third trimester, but they do fit a bit smaller than I expected at first, but after a few months they stretched a bit so they're perfect now.  Will definitely buy them again!"
5.0,"Beautiful items, fit as expected, right length. Would definitely purchase again."
5.0,I like the outfit because it fit very well considered affected on the short person and it covered my body type perfectly.

5.0,The product came just as promised and on time.
5.0,My husband loves this tie clip.
5.0,"The waterproof nylon travel bag has  one huge compartment with a two-way zipper's u-shaped opening, two sides shoes compartment ventilated to keep my shoes and dirty gear separated.The bag is lightweight and comfortable in that it has breathable mesh and padded shoulder straps. It's easy to adjust the length and lock firmly. In addition,it has high quality two-way zipper that goes smoothly.It's durable because it is made from water and tear resistant nylon fabric and high quality zippers with pull string. A detachable shoulder strap can easily turn the backpack into a crossbody bag  or shoulder bag.It will be my good companion when I go sightseeing in the west of U.S.."
5.0,Well made. Pretty. Functional.
5.0,Sturdy and stays clipped. Daughter plays rough and hasn't lost a earring yet.
5.0,A real eye catcher; chicks dig it.<br />So sayeth Sirjon Thedude
5.0,Love/ lovely
5.0,"I am so obsessed with this dress!!<br />Perfect for summer and so sexy, but isn’t too revealing. Fit like a glove! You won’t be disappointed, seriously a MUST BUY!!"
5.0,"Love this apron! Perfect toddler size! My day is 20lbs, 30” and wears size 9-12 or 12 mo for reference. She loves putting it on and playing kitchen."
5.0,"It’s not see through, the dress is pretty in color, order a size up if you want it looser"
5.0,It’s a super cute dress and fits just right
5.0,"These goggles are fun and really comfortable. My children are fighting for a chance to wear them.  Unfortunately, I only have one pair...and they are for me!! Notice the rubber lining? These make for a much more tight fit. The uv protected/anti fog lens makes for a safe and much better experience underwater as well. As far as swimming goggles, these seem to be Olympic quality. (Ok, I wouldn't know but they are very good)<br />Thanks for allowing me to review and test these goggles. I would say they are worth the investment!"
5.0,"As everyone know, I give an auto three stars then add or deduct as needed. First, this is very well made. It fits great, The pull straps are spot on. I've even worn this with a suit in the winter with people loving the design. I wasn't to sure about the skulls, but people love it."
5.0,"These are the most confortable slippers ive ever had. Plus they really turn heads when you go out with them. Though i would advise against going out with them because the bottom wears out very easilly. But they're perfect indoors, really keep your feet warm."
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous most beautiful necklace I own
5.0,Fiance wanted an engagement band wellllllll he loves it and wears it every day arrived really quickly runs a tad snug depending on your mans fingers. But he loves it and so do I!
5.0,"Material is warm and hat fits well (might be a tiny bit big).  As a 5'2&#34; 120 lbs female, my head might be on the smaller size though. Would recommend and I definitely bought it again."
5.0,"These leggings are great!  I wore them for St. Patrick's Day and everyone loved them.  They are comfy, soft and thick enough to not be see through."
5.0,Love this shirt fit well looks great. The only thing is I'm short so its kinda long.
5.0,Great quality swimming parka!
5.0,Absolutely adorable. Either sex can wear this. Soft and cute
5.0,Mi hija de 11 años lo amó!<br />Talla s
5.0,Nice necklace exactly as described.
5.0,This is my favorite glasses case ever.<br /><br />1) No hinge to break! The hinge broke on EVERY hinged eye glass case I ever had.<br />3) Roomy and sturdy enough that I can shove my glasses anywhere (in the bottom of my purse) and they're proteced.<br />4) Lightweight!<br />5) Not just for kids - fit my adult-sized cat-eye sunglasses just fine.
5.0,My husband loved his new shirt!
5.0,[...]<br />I got an above pendant from my husband on Valentine's day and was looking for perfect earrings to go with it. These earrings are absolutely great and I get comments from even non Christians along with the pendant. Many asked me about church and God when I wear these products. I think jewelries can serve God's purpose also!
5.0,Very cute style.  Got lots of compliments.  I'm 5'7&#34; 175ish. This is a large.
5.0,"I bought the Toilet-bound jacket for my granddaughter's 10th birthday and she wore it to dinner last night. It seems well-made, very cute, not too heavy, and the medium size fit her perfectly. (She is very tall for her age and the small size would probably be a better fit for average size 10 y/o's.) If you're considering this jacket as a gift for an anime fan, go for it."
5.0,This bra fit well and was great for low impact exercise. I'm 36DD and it held everything in place without being suffocating. It's comfortable and the straps don't dig in. It may not be great for anything intense like running.
5.0,"Adorable, just adorable and they’re are comfy with the slip resistant footing"
5.0,"Show the world for your love of the Miami Hurricanes! Tight fit but looks great. If the liberals insist we wear these ridiculous and absolutely unnecessary masks, to promote a political  agenda, you may as well go in style and wear the Miami Hurricanes masks, the greatest college football dynasty from the mid 80's to early 2000's, no doubt about it. Better than Saban's Crimson Tide!"
5.0,"I wanted leggings with pockets that fit well and these fit the bill.  They're comfortable, easy to wash, and long enough for my long legs.  Seem to be well made and having pockets for my phone or other small items is great."
5.0,I wanted to try a silk scarf but didnt want to pay much... These were perfect!  I just love them!
5.0,"I got these to protect my extra glasses sitting in my drawer. They colors are nice, the texture is soft, and they're easy to open and close. I wouldn't use this in my bag because I only trust a hard case for that, but they're goo for protecting your glasses from scratches at home."
5.0,Bought this for a long time friend and he loved it
5.0,"I worked at a very fancy retail store inside of a casino that sold this brand for $40-100. Now I know where they got their stock and I can order the jewelry for next to nothing. I was skeptical ordering from so far away, but they come in a timely manner and I received a ton of compliments."
5.0,I will buy this again.  The shirt is lightweght and allows for ventilation so it doesn't get too warm in the sun.
5.0,Wear them all the time at work. They are a great price and help protect my eyes from the sun.
5.0,It's cute and work buying if you have spare money.
5.0,not bad for the money! thanks!
5.0,hermosa larga pero con tacones quedara perfecta soy talla m en pettite 10 pero la pedy xl me encanto
5.0,Was looking for something sturdy and this is definitely sturdy. I can wear it over or under clothes and can wear my own bras with it which is nice because other corsets I've tried don't fit quite as well. Def helps with my posture.
5.0,"Very nice quality belt, exactly what i ordered."
5.0,Adult Halloween Dennis Rodman NBA Celebrity 3/4 Mask Adult Just Excellent! Just Excellent! Just Excellent! Just Excellent! Just Excellent! Just Excellent! Just Excellent! Just Excellent! Just Excellent! Just Excellent!
5.0,"Just like the picture ... True to size ,"
5.0,A must have for the elderly and/or those who need assistance walking!
5.0,These are GORGEOUS!  I want more like them.  I love them.
5.0,My son loved this!
5.0,Fabulous!
5.0,My daughter really love it
5.0,"Well made, not cheap."
5.0,Love love love my skirt! This is the third one I have purchased. I may just purchase a couple more colors.
5.0,Great looking mask!
5.0,"Cute dress!! Material is as expected for a twenty dollar dress. I ordered a large. I'm 5,3&#34; about 145 lbs, 36 c/d. It hits me right at the mid thigh or maybe a little higher. Loose throughout except maybe a little in the bust area super good buy!!"
5.0,muy buen articulo
5.0,"This is a beautiful skirt. It is a little long, i am 5'5 but i love the look of the skirt."
5.0,Beautiful product. Professionally packaged and quick Prime shipping. Two thumbs up!
5.0,"Really cute. The color is rose pink, as shown but almost looks fleshtone on me. I wear a 10/12 and purchased a large and it fits perfect."
5.0,"Better than expected! This tote is the perfect size for work. Not to small not to big. Feels great on my arms. Lightweight, looks and feels very expensive. very satisfied with my purchase!"
5.0,"Nicely made, light, and roomy, given the price I cannot really demand more. It's the best price - quality bag to carry stuff personally with care. Not sure if it can take the beating at the airports since the material it's made of is very thin. Still not sure if I should take a chance to use it on my international trip. If some one did it I'd be happy to know..."
5.0,I use these smocks for art class for elementary age students.  They are easy to put on the off.  Easy to fold up and store as well.
5.0,"I love these tights. They are soft and very slimming. They wash well. If you are a size 8 or smaller, get the size small. I'm a size 6, and the medium is lost and won't stay up; the small is perfect, not too tight. I have two colors now. I'm 5'8&#34; with long legs, and these hit a couple inches above the ankle for me. If you're short, these may be too long."
5.0,"I love with this dress. I have a few AX Paris dresses and all are super wel made, and fit amazing.<br /><br />5’1 , 170lbs, muscular build. I ordered a large"
5.0,"Yay! It fits! First try!<br />I usually have to try 3 different sizes before I get it right. The size depends on the brand, so I have to guess. I usually wear 12-14P jeans ... here’s the catch... I’m top heavy 38DD. Simple T-shirts can be tricky. XL usually fits, but I don’t want it suction cupped to my body either...<br />So, I got the XXL and it fits perfectly.<br />I’m 5’4, 170. It’s comfy, I don’t feel stuffed in it. It looks nice and is cut in a way that is figure flattering. Fits without making me look twice as big (once I’ve found the right size up top)...<br />Anyway, this dress is awesome. Fabric is nice and cool for summer. Good  quality (not too thin or see through) material. And, it has pockets!.... that you can’t see."
5.0,I love this variety packs， good quality and easy to use！ five star good review，thank you。
5.0,"I ordered an XXL as I'm a semi big woman.<br />It fit perfect, was very comfortable.<br />I wore a 2.5 inch heel and the dress was just barely touching the ground.<br />The gold buttons were just sewn on, I took them off as they contrasted with my jewelry I had worn."
5.0,My daughter loves them. There soft and the right size.
5.0,These socks keep their color and shape.  Not too thick or too thin...just perfect.
5.0,Love the shirt now I just wish merl was alive in the show tbh
5.0,"Daughter has very sensitive skin, these were great and comfortable for her."
5.0,Bought this for my husband to do yard work !  Keeps his head cool and protects his ears from the sun.
5.0,"So cute. The shiny stone is in the middle of the cat's body. The piece isn't large, but is very pretty and highlights your outfits."
5.0,Cute for readers. Sturdy & easy to wipe smudges.
5.0,"Omg, they are so cool. Easily adjusted, light, delicate, and comfortable. They are not restrictive anyway. They are lasting just fine! Love!"
5.0,Looks exactly like patches on authentic jerseys and was easily ironed on.
5.0,"Very comfortable fabric, better than any similar products I've tried.  And the pattern has a high quality look.  I was surprised that it has a drawstring too.<br /><br />I'm sensitive to face coverings that put pressure on my nose but this one is entirely comfortable.  It's also easy to breathe in while still having a filtering effect.  If you exhale strongly with your hand in front of your mouth, you can tell most of the breath is redirected.  So it's got some chance at capturing moisture or ""droplets"" that might carry viruses."
5.0,"I love these bows! Great quality and So many color options, they look adorable on my little one !"
5.0,Cute skirt. Fits perfectly based on the size chart. Very well made for the price.
5.0,"Very comfortable!  However, I would suggest getting a size smaller."
5.0,Exactly what you expect to be. Very happy.
5.0,"I’ve got probably 5 pairs of these and love them!<br />Look, nice gym shorts are super expensive and that’s just not something I’m willing to drop that kind of money on. So, sorry Lulu but it ain’t gonna happen! These shorts are legit. I wanted something light weight, not so long that they get in the way in squats, box jumps, etc. but not so short they they’re awkwardly short and a built in liner is a must. These are fantastic for the money! Lulu might be nicer, I’ll never know, I love these and have ordered more since my first order. I wear them every day to CrossFit which is why I have like 5. The liner is comfortable and holds everything in place nicely without being so tight that it’s uncomfortable. In the summertime I even use them as swimming trunks at the pool, lake or beach. They’re fantastic!<br />The trouser trout pair I have, the liner seems to be slightly shorter and tighter than the grey liner ones I have. Not sure the difference but it’s not a problem.<br />Like I said, I wear them every day. When we haven’t done laundry and they’re all dirty imma go wash a load of clothes real fast so I have them ready for the gym. They’re just as important as the right shoes or making sure you have your shaker bottle clean and ready to go.<br />Don’t waste your money on expensive gym shorts, these are legit!"
5.0,Fit perfectly. I am 6 ft tall 32 waist 170 lb. Not looking for a date. Just telling you what they're supposed to fit. Got the extra large which equals a medium in American size and that works well. Don't know how long they'll last but at this price recommend you buy a pair.
5.0,This is a good watch I bought as a gift for someone else. The only complaint I collected was that it doesn't have the tiny hand for the seconds.
5.0,These are great swim trunks. Very comfortable and if your a middle age man or older as I am you don't have to be embarrassed of being a sicko in speedo. These swim shorts are nothing like that. They are nice for any age. I am 50 and have 32&#34; waist. i bought an 33-37in (XL)..The fit was perfect. Now when I get out of the pool I don't feel like I am hauling half the water out with me tugging my shorts down.  If your worried about your stuff showing they are very modest specially when wet. They were great at the water park this summer.
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter who play the Uke. It looks exactly as pictured, made of nice materials. It came very quickly."
5.0,Very comfortable and warm for these cold winters
5.0,Love this leggings. Very good material
5.0,It's a watch. It's cheap. It works. No complaints.
5.0,"Just what my husband was looking for. He doesn't like to carry around a bigger, bulky folding type wallet. We've been looking for something like this and here it is."
5.0,My husband loves these pants. They are very durable and hold up well to all sorts of activities from gardening to welding and look nice enough to wear out and about. These are his go to pants and he is very particular about the fit of clothes.
5.0,"I love the watch, but if there was a different type of clasp would be better cause the clasp opens to easy with the movement of the wrist"
5.0,Bought these for my 3 year old nephew. He loved it. My brother in law wants his own pair and his cousin also wants a pair.
5.0,"Great medium sized cross body, another nice bag from Latico."
5.0,I gave it 5 stars bc it’s very cute and well made! It just wasn’t my style and was too long for me. I’m 5’3” It runs a little small in the waist and doesn’t have much stretch there FYI
5.0,"The mask arrived much sooner than expected. It looks great, it’s thick & well constructed. My son put some foam on the inside of the mask so it would fit him better. It’s an adult sized mask. All in all, we love it."
5.0,Great Quality and perfect fit! My 3 year old nephew loves his Jersey!
5.0,Very comfortable!! I would buy this again in different colors.
5.0,"Flattering cut and flare of material. The material is a breathable, light swimsuit polyester feel. I bought this for a beach vacation and I can't wait to wear it!"
5.0,"Very well done, gave it as an engagement gift"
5.0,I have two pairs of these and they are long lasting! I wear them both with shoes and just as around the house kind of socks. They are very durable and warm!
5.0,"the fit was awesome , will buy these again , well made , materials  were what i expected , would recommend these for anyone that like this style ,,,,"
5.0,Ijust love the way it fits.
5.0,"I was looking for something similar to an aviator style with red lenses; and came across these shades. Glad I bought them!  I like the design, size and sturdy feel!"
5.0,So light weight and very comfortable
5.0,Not a cheap product! Very nice selection a lot of variables  And lot to choose from
5.0,love the fit and design of this dress. fits perfect only thing is that it rides up
5.0,I bought this one as a gift to my favorite cousin the other day and I am really happy because she loved it! Simple yet so elegant.
5.0,"LOVE this suit! It fits amazingly well (I did size up based on other reviews, but I think my normal size would have been a good fit too. It looks great on, and it a really classic look, without being too aged. Everything stays put nicely, so I can jump in the pool and chase my daughter on the beach without worries."
5.0,So cute. I love it. I wear an XL usually and probably could have gotten away with a large but I do like my shirts kind of baggy.
5.0,Just what I wanted. Easy to wear. Comfortable. Did well.
5.0,"IT HAS POCKETS! I bought both the music note and red plaid skirts. They are both comfortable and fit to size. I got so many compliments on the music skirt. It does have a satin line material,  but I am okay with that. I have a third skirt on the way now."
5.0,The piece is stunning! Thanks
5.0,These are comfy and of great material
5.0,This fits as expected and looks like the picture. I wore it to work (bartender) and got a few compliments on it. It's comfortable and I like that it hangs loose in the stomach area.
5.0,So comfortable Imagine. Bit on the heavy side. My daughter loves them. Soft and cushioned inside. If I carry her on boot likes to slip off a bit. But I love the loops. I just hold on to them and she can use to pull on. So adorable and attractive.
5.0,So pretty and great quality.
5.0,They are great. Everything I was looking for!
5.0,"Too small. I had to return them. The company promptly helped me return the item and receive my money back. Even thought the boots were super cute! They didn't work for my daughter. However, I would by from this company again just for the pleasant experience in having to return the item."
5.0,I love this skirt.  It is pretty and most important comfortable.
5.0,Love love love it
5.0,Very summary dress and looks amazing. Very comfortable I’m buying another color.
5.0,"It's very good quality, especially for the price. My only complaint is that the pendant tends to turn around, but that's just something that happens with any necklace - so it's not a big deal. I am personally using this for cosplay purposes. The character Ritsu Kasanoda, aka Bossa Nova, wears a necklace with a gold pendant. I thought this would be perfect for it and it is! :D It's also great to sport your Ouran love!"
5.0,Shipped quickly and packaged very well.  The earrings are beautiful.
5.0,These sunglasses are a great value and look great as well. I highly recommend them. Thumbs up!!
5.0,"A very traditional tie bar that works more like a fancy paper clip than a fancy clasp.  I like this about it because it is sleeker, doesn't poke, and probably won't break as easily.  Fits great on skinny and fat ties.  It is really the perfect size.  It is very shiny!  Prepare to blind some people when it hits the light.  Overall it looks sharp.  I read in some other reviews that it was too small and had sharp edges, but I haven't noticed either with mine.  Great tie bar.  Very professional looking."
5.0,"Russel again puts out a great product. The fit is just right, the fabric is soft and comfortable."
5.0,"I will be moving to Boston, MA from Florida and I spent a lot of time looking for something warm and easy to carry. This jacket kept me warm in lower 30s-upper 40s degree weather and was so light! I walked a lot around Boston so walking + this jacket kept me warm. I wore a sweater or two along with a scarf, and felt comfortable (as comfortable as one can get in New England around March). I would highly recommend for others."
5.0,Fun and helps me keep track of my keys.
5.0,"I've been wearing these for as number of years now and in the beginning a pair would last until I would lose one or both, or the grip would wear smooth on the fingers. Now I go thru them once every 4 to 5 months depending on use because the grip peels and falls off. They are still comfortable and work well until the peeling starts. I liked the original version better."
5.0,Feels sturdy! Fits perfectly! Not too flashy like diamonds but just enough height from the “dome” that it makes a subtle statement!
5.0,"These earrings were suprisingly delightful! Not only do they look pretty, but you can't beat the price! And they are 925 Sterling Silver! I definitely will be buying again for my daughters and they make a perfect gift. They come in a cute little box. They are lightweight, and worked for my 9 year old daughter who doesn't really like wearing or the ""feel"" of earrings."
5.0,Unbelievably beautiful item. Looks exactly like the pictures. Perfect mindfulness jewelry!
5.0,My mom loved the earrings but I think the are a bit small.
5.0,"Nice fit, gloves are unlined"
5.0,The wig was just as I expected.
5.0,Feel really soft. Feel sexy.  The wife like's the see through.
5.0,I love this band.  It is very co fortBle to sleep in and works great when the fitbit is charging too
5.0,Beautiful earrings.  Attention getters.  Also bought matching ring and necklace.
5.0,Very pretty just like the picture! I love the adjustable straps and the material is like a canvas or linen so it’s very comfortable. It is layered so I can simply cut open one of the layers and add a filter for more protection.
5.0,"I love this, I wear it all the time. It does loosen pretty easily on the wrist, so you have to keep tightening it, but otherwise it is beautiful!"
5.0,"I like it because they were exactly what the description say., super soft and comfortable"
5.0,"Very nice product, beautiful striping and swirls on the beads.  Very well-made."
5.0,Muy bueno el teléfono se protege completamente lo recomiendo
5.0,This is my go to purse. I wanted something to carry my main things and not be a pain to tamper with when I needed something in a rush. I wear it cross body so I don’t have to worry about forgetting my purse somewhere.
5.0,very nice coat. i will definetley buy from your site again.  thanks
5.0,Son tall and skinny little big but he loves it and he will grow into it.
5.0,I love the colors on these earrings.  They were fast shipping.
5.0,Perfect fit and color
5.0,My son took these to class for his birthday to hand out to the other children
5.0,"Ordered a small, I’m 140lbs 5’6, 34ddd I love the fit, cannot wait to wear it out. It holds boobs pretty well, you May not have to wear a bra"
5.0,"I use this to display my nail polish swatches that I have on binder clips and hang them from the branches, it looks super cute and I've gotten alot of compliments on it. I'm sure it would look just as cute with jewelry hanging on it, although longer necklaces might be too long, but they would rest nicely in the base."
5.0,Love love love them! So pretty and very flattering.
5.0,Loving this purse.  Fits everything I need for work and after 5.  The added wrist strap is handy.
5.0,"Cap fits excellent, soft, and I am surprised how well the eye covering works. It looks crazy but it will be my go-to cap in cool weather."
5.0,Fits well and very flattering.
5.0,I love wearing this with a crop top and mini skirt!  Fit is a little tighter than I would have liked but I really love it! Thinking about purchasing a second!
5.0,"Got this as a gift for my niece. I am the wonder woman aunt.  Parents say it's great,  just enough entertainment for a restaurant and doesn't require lugging a bunch of toys or a tablet around.  And she's obsessed with it.  Had to buy another for her little bestie"
5.0,"Cute and perfect for a little bit of cover up in the evenings! I am 5'4&#34;, 128#, and it fits great!"
5.0,Love the patterns colors
5.0,"Great fit, comfortable, and cute!"
5.0,The BEST hair wraps ever. Definitely worth the money! They hold up great!
5.0,Really beautiful earring. Thank you
5.0,"Omg so cute keychain set, looks just like the photos, the alarm is really loud and the flashlight is so bright. I totally recommend this product! And definitely order some more as gifts for my family members!"
5.0,I was a little skeptical at first because of the price if these would be good quality and size but they are ah-mazing! I just came back and bought the last one. Thank you so much for having a great product at such a reasonable price. I personalized them for our new business with our logo with HTV and they look fantastic. Now if you could offer them in other colours that would be even more awesome. But I am definitely not complaining. Now I just need to finish ironing them. I was just too excited and had to take a picture and write this review!
5.0,"Was worried about the sizing but didn't need to. The size large (10/12) was plenty big enough for my 12, 11 and 9 year old grandchildren."
5.0,Great fit and make.
5.0,I love this purse. It looks stylish.  The bow is securely attached.
5.0,It’s just st like the band that came with my Fitbit. I like it a lot
5.0,They don’t have a lot of structure on their own which is great for storing them and they feel sturdily made like they’ll hold up for many uses. I absolutely love the print and they hold quite a bit of clothes. I like being organized and this made packing and finding things I needed on my trip a breeze. It’s easier having packing cubes instead of having to rifling through a whole suitcase and making a mess.
5.0,"Great for yoga and pilates workouts, and super flattering"
5.0,Although arrived a day after said it was delivered USPS..I love  them  thanks
5.0,"Excellent jacket for the price. Heavy duty and comes with spine and elbow protection as well as a removable vest lining. My only complaint is that the material has a slight odor to it. I don't think the smell is specific to this jacket, but rather to the material. Not overwhelming or anything, but it hasn't gone away after a week.<br /><br />I'm 5'10, 175lbs and the large fits me well."
5.0,Purchases as a gift for 13 year old nephew. He was very pleased.
5.0,Gorgeous! I love this dress! I want to get it in more colors.
5.0,"This is a story about customer service.  I bought a bag from Limited Handmade Items about 4 months ago. There was something wrong with the bag, but I never got around to contacting the seller for 4 months.  When I did, they jumped through hoops to take care of the problem.  I am fully, full satisfied and this is an AWESOME product. I plan to buy 2 more shortly, one for my brother who started a new job as an exec and another for my dad."
5.0,This pull over hoodies fits well on me. Love the design. Will order more
5.0,"The dress is very nice, the fabric is heavy and shapes the body in a flattering way. It makes you look slimmer and hides minor flaws. It has an integrated bra, which I much appreciate. I bought a size up, normally I’m a 6, I bought an 8, it’s not big, it’s just confortable, not too tight. This is good because the front opening would make it look bad if too tight. So I recommend to size up just a little bit. Great quality for the money!"
5.0,The style and fit are great. Well worth the money.
5.0,"I bought this in black and brown for my dad's birthday. It shipped faster than expected and I got it just in time. The leather feels amazing, like really high quality leather. The sizing is perfect. He immediately put it on right out of the box and didn't take it off for the rest of the night."
5.0,These are real huggies. Not all earrings that say they are huggies are authentic. I believe this was actually patented a while back. The attaching post should click on firmly and be very difficult to remove unless you press slightly on the post to release. Also the post should never protrude through the earring to then irritate the skin. I have ordered other earrings that were not working right and had to return them. Once you have had a real pair of genuine huggies you will never go back. I can wear these earrings in my ears comfortably for months. Accept no substitutes.
5.0,"Or any events. I wear it to concerts, bars and theme parks or things like the renaissance festival for when I don't want to lug a purse around. Doesn't get in the way and holds plenty securely. I wish they had more colors, I'd never use a purse again!"
5.0,Perfect fit and my friend loved hers!
5.0,They were a gift for my niece who is 20 years old and has. Downs syndrome and  Autism.  She loves pink and loves them so much she won't wear any other shoes.
5.0,Loves these jeans and the price!
5.0,Love this dress. Very soft fabric and hugged my curves very well.
5.0,"Five year old daughter loves this shoe. It's comfortable, light weight, and has good grip. She really likes the bright rainbow like colors."
5.0,"I bought two of these suits for a production at our local community theater. They were a great value and exactly what I needed. The material is nylon, but it makes a great costume. I would order again."
5.0,Perfect size! Cards stay in slots securely but also slide in and out easily. Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:4dc6598135a6123176527f6fd9cb1cc4]] These Gloves Are Great! I use them whenever goin out during this pandemic and I also use them when blogging and doing skin care tutorials. Follow me on ig for more great content @dav0nll0y
5.0,Over everything about the fit. Can not lose with this sweater. I will buy many more!!
5.0,Cute bands and they are easy to change out.
5.0,"I go to a lot of outdoor events that aren't cancelled due to rain. This is the ideal poncho for hours in the rain. Most recently I wore it to a Supercross race in Atlanta. It was so long, I could sit on it on the wet bleachers and keep my butt dry. It doesn't let a drop of rain through and has an ample food for keeping your whole head dry.<br /><br />Best of all, it's not a little cheapo thin poncho. This bad boy is thick and durable...no chance of tearing it under normal use. This is the epitome of ""heavy duty"" raingear. Worth every penny, so I bought one for trips, another for around the house, and a 3rd to keep in back of my Jeep."
5.0,"Love this swimsuit, very flattering"
5.0,"It's really big, and looks way more expensive than it is."
5.0,Great product exactly what it said it would be.
5.0,Quality product. A statement hat. Large and attention grabber. Definitely recommend.
5.0,I have quite a few watches and this one isn't too bad. It definitely looks just like a Rolex date just but it's not a bad quality watch. I think the band could be stronger it feels like it can break easy. Otherwise it's an alright watch.
5.0,"I am tiny chested, 32A, and this bra gives me awesome cleavage. My husband says it makes my boobs look great. It isn't the easiest thing to get on because it's tight to push you up, but once on it is very comfortable. The straps and the back band is thicker than a normal bra so they don't dig in. I wish there were more colors- I'd buy them all."
5.0,"The blouse is a little larger around the lower forearms. But overall nice. The splits are a little higher, but fine. A pair of shorts underneath will really add some interest to the look. Can't wait to wear it this summer!"
5.0,"Very cute. Fit well, washes well. Didn’t shrink."
5.0,Good for college showers.
5.0,My old capri leggings were getting pretty faded out so I figured it was time for a new pair.  I looked at several pairs on Amazon and read the reviews.  I decided to try these by Power Flex.  Love them!!  A good weight material with no &#34;see through&#34; but not too heavy for summer.  Look to be very good quality.  Not low waisted like a lot of leggings out there.  Would definitely recommend.
5.0,The flex capacitor is an excellent ultra light backpack.  It is comfortable and highly adjustable.  We are able to get our packs between 20-25 lbs now.
5.0,"I like that you get 5 in a pack, also they hold a lot of sweat."
5.0,"I was always captivated by the &#34;Infinity&#34; symbol, the thought of never ending love is beautiful.  Very impressed with the classy, delicate design. It's well-made and definitely impressive!"
5.0,Hermosas
5.0,I love it and its fits just right.
5.0,I'm very happy with these reading glasses. They are lightweight and stylish and are holding up well. The price was great too!
5.0,Love the detail of these. So adorable!
5.0,Cute dress! Nice material. Happy with my purchase.
5.0,NICE WORK!
5.0,"LOVE! These socks, my sons can wear his sperry’s with coverage and they don’t show."
5.0,"I saw Jill Winebanks, respected Watergate Attorney, wearing this on one of the main stream media news channels, and it caught my attention. I researched the Internet and found the exact one! She’s known for wearing lapel pins, and is never seen or photographed without one. My guess is one of her fans may have sent this to her as a gift, or - she simply respects art no matter the price, even if it’s just $22 bucks! Good quality, beautiful!"
5.0,Looks exactly like picture. Great quality . Recieved it timely and without damages . Would recommend you to purchase .
5.0,very nice quality and prompt delivery
5.0,"These tights don't sag, fit nicely, and look nice.  They seem to be of good quality material.  Most important, for us, are the no-skid feet."
5.0,"The ring is just perfection! Despite all, I still love Star Wars and I'll definitely buy more items like this.<br /><br />Thank you Han Cholo ;)"
5.0,"It fit true to size. I got a medium. I'm 4'11"" and 115 pounds. I carry most of my weight in mid section. It hides it perfectly and is soft and flowy at bottom and more fitted at top.  I bought all colors except white. The wine red is more of an orange red and the orange one is more of a ginger brown. Also the blue one is a shade lighter but I love them all! I did not find them see through on top."
5.0,Love them for working on my computer...I can see clearly now!!
5.0,"This was a Christmas gift to a friend. She love the cut and fit, it was extremely happy"
5.0,Love it. Very expensive looking and easy to attach. Magnet holds well.
5.0,You get what you see and nice quality for the price
5.0,Warm and super comfy I bought two more.
5.0,"It fits perfect, I have it for my lip so its easy to take out for work and its held up well. Really easy to put in and take out and there is no color changes."
5.0,Perfect my grandson loved it
5.0,"One of my favs, goes with everything"
5.0,"I like these sterling silver half open butterfly earrings since most butterfly earrings have the butterfly fully open. Pretty, delicate detailing."
5.0,Beautiful bracelet bought for a friend's birthday.
5.0,This is a wallet not shoes and its great
5.0,"As far as the company goes, Easy transaction, fast shipping, would buy from this seller again. Thanks. Love these shoes.  The lights are a fun novelty, but the shoes wear good like regular shoes, too."
5.0,these are so cute. fit great. affordable!!
5.0,"awsome heavy bib apron. good Value, too."
5.0,"I've always liked muscle shirts with thin shoulder's and the Y-back design, but could never find one that was not cut too far down on the ribs. This shirt is the exact quality and cut I have been looking for. If any of you are looking for a Y-back shirt that doesn't have the sides cut all the way down to your stomach, then you have buy these."
5.0,Purse is well made. Looks just like the photos
5.0,"This case is just as pictured and works great for a variety of sunglasses. I've broken so many pairs of sunglasses by throwing them in my bags, and this was a highly affordable investment that saves me money and waste!"
5.0,Loved this dress I am typically a size 4<br /><br />I wear 27 pants and DD34 chest 5’5’ 130lbs
5.0,Bought them last Christmas.  Daughter still wears them.  Held up well after many washings!
5.0,great stuff
5.0,Love the Cut and style
5.0,"I looove this dress. Cute, flattering, and thin enough material to be perfect for August heat. I'm 5'7 usually between a 12 and 14 with 36DD and got the 2X. Don't have to use the zipper but I like things a bit looser and the top fit perfectly."
5.0,These seem really durable and well put together. They’re adorable and the loops help my tot pull them on himself.
5.0,"They are attractive, easy to get on and off and protect my glasses from falling to the bottom of the pool."
5.0,I’m loving it
5.0,Received this as a gift from my wish list and they are awesome! I'm a fitness junkie and donuts are my cryptonite so these socks were made for me○○○ I wear them at least 1 day a week in my 5 day a week workouts so they've hit the wash quite a bit and they've held up strong with no fading or holes. Good quality. Love them.
5.0,I love it! This is a beautiful piece I got it for my daughter for the prom and she is going to rock this head piece!
5.0,I LOVE THESE
5.0,Exactly as pictured. Shipping was timely and well-packaged.
5.0,My son needed these for a play he was in.  He loves them and wants to wear them all the time.  Says they are very comfortable.
5.0,"I was looking for an easy to use, small, light, but plenty of pockets and I found this one. Its great. I was able to get everything that I had in my other billfold with two pockets to spare. Very easy to use and find your cash quickly. No more fumbling at Walgreens trying to find my cash or cards. The chain looks well made and very comparable to another chain I have which is a Swiss Army Chain. The belt loop is soft and flexible and doesn't dig into your side when you set down. I would highly recommend this leather wallet to anyone."
5.0,"This product was exactly as represented in terms of color, fit, and use.  I got the A1 color/pattern and have received so many compliments.  I'm 5'5"" and 130 pounds, wouldn't change anything on the sizing.  I have worn it as a mini-dress.  I bought a pair of black boy short swim trunks on Amazon that look great with it."
5.0,"I've had a pair of the &#34;cat eyes&#34; for 20 plus years, used them all over the world and loved them, especially in the winter time. The bows finally broke a few years ago and they sat on the shelf. I found the replacement frames and figured I'd give them a shot and see if they were quality or not. I ordered the frames hoping that the &#34;002&#34; model hadn't changed since I got my pair back in 1989. Other than the lenses being just a tiny bit loose in the frame which is expected actually, everything is perfect. A quality product.  I must add one thing, one of the reviewers stated the frames were too loose on her daughters face, well these aren't built for a kids narrow face. Mine fit as good as the original frames did."
5.0,Great quality and great value!
5.0,"These shoes arrived so quickly, you would have thought I had Amazon prime (but I don't). Service was fast, and these shoes are so cute and well made. I'm loving this buy."
5.0,"I got this watch for my fiancé as one of his Christmas gifts this year. He has a watch collection so when I saw this, I had to snag it. It is really nice! I was surprised at the quality and look of it considering it’s only $35. The watch face is large so do aware of such if you or the person you’re buying for doesn’t like big and somewhat bulky watch faces. My fiancé doesn’t mind and really likes this watch. I got it in the black/brown and the colors compliment each other beautifully! He loves the bits of blue within the watch face as well. The leather strap you do have to break in some as it’s a bit stiff at first but overall - he (as well as myself) are very pleased with this watch. Great quality, classy yet rugged and easy to read!"
5.0,Extremely comfortable.
5.0,Great deal. Way better quality than I expected!
5.0,My brothers shark theme birthday party 🎉
5.0,A beautiful earring set that I will be wearing as often as possible.  Great value for the price.  Looks exactly as pictured.
5.0,love this fabric material combination best of all their similar batwing styles; some of the others were too thin and clingy. looks very good on.
5.0,"Great gift, thanks"
5.0,This is such a good quality and it cames ur size just order regular size
5.0,"Super cute, comfortable, neutral color and oversized. They seem durable as well. Would totally buy again."
5.0,"It’s like one of those soft blankets but made into pants…. With pockets! Not too tight , not too loose! Love them"
5.0,Love them! I can't wait for my sister to get them! What a deal! So perfect!
5.0,This are the best glasses for the money
5.0,The gloves were perfect. I recently used it to check my car underhood. I wont be using it as much but i know it will come in handy for the future.
5.0,My partner loves it.
5.0,"I bought the L and it's a bit oversized.  I'm 5'6"" and 180 lbs."
5.0,"Super cute jacket! My baby is 12 months, but the bigger jacket fits over her long sleeve shirts and sweaters without too much effort. It isn’t fleece lined, so my baby doesn’t sweat in this jacket. The onesie is well made and big enough to fit 12-18 months. The pants are a little big, but only because my baby girl is tiny. Overall, great clothing for a great price!"
5.0,"Love these, they easily stretch out.. but look and fit true to size. I would buy again"
5.0,We were looking for a hat like the one my husband got in college. This one was the closest we could get and he Loved it! Thank you!
5.0,"This dress is beautiful and great quality.  I am 5'8"" and it was a bit short but otherwise was a great dress."
5.0,"Well-made, good quality. The Sheltie on this mask looks exactly like our beloved Sheltie, whom we lost last year."
5.0,I abosulty love the dress! I wear a size 14 and got XL and it fits great! Nice and sexy
5.0,I really like this. It very helpful during winter days..<br />I like the fitting of it.
5.0,Love my TARDiS slippers  fluffy inside and knitted outside . Keep feet warm at night when cold.
5.0,"Well made, beautiful stones. great service."
5.0,I ordered them all in different colors and I absolutely love these nightgowns. They are very soft and comfy
5.0,"Product was as advertised, and arrived in very good time."
5.0,I bought these masks for my son and he really likes them. He wears them to school and he likes keeping them on. He looks cute with them on.
5.0,"Loved it.  Well made, not cheap fabric."
5.0,"So colorful and very comfortable, they wash great no color leakage either. I wear them for work every day and they’re soft as well as durable."
5.0,"I was surprised at the quality of this dress for the price. The top is made like a soft corset, having stays along the back laces and on the seams. It also has bra cups sewn in. I'm 5ft 3inches, 170lbs. Ordered a 16 and it was long on me by at least 4 inches, maybe more depending on heel height and where I would have had it fall (to floor or at shoe top).  I found the bodice tight somewhat at the waist, but it could have been the way the person lacing it for me did it.  The top felt just a little loose but could be tightened up. There is a generous  insert under the laces so no skin shows.  The skirt is 3 layers, but the 2 under layers are seamed together at the bottom, so if it needed to be hemmed it would be a bit more work, unless they are separated and hemmed individually (ending up with 3 individual layers).  Many people mentioned loose threads on the embroidery - yes there were some, but nothing a minute and a pair of scissors couldn't fix.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this dress, as did my ""fashion consultants"", but returned it in exchange  for another dress that seemed more my style for the event I'm attending. But I have to say - it was a tough choice to let this one go."
5.0,These are perfect!  Soooo darling and fit really well!  My son loves them!
5.0,I love these shorts. I want more. They are comfortable. The fabric is nice and soft with a great stretch. The length is perfect. They are flattering. I want to wear them all the time.
5.0,"These masks have a bad smell when you first open it.  I would air it out before first usage.  These are my favorite masks.  Very lightweight.  Easy to breathe.  It's made out of a foam/ spongy material.  Not exactly sure if it protects against virus, but when I wear a mask because I have to, this is the one that I'm able to wear for hours without feeling suffocated.  When I'm headed to a medical facility or a crowded area, I would switch to a mask with a filter.  If you have to wear a mask all day long for work and you're not constantly interacting with others, this might be a good choice for you."
5.0,Fits great and looks nice
5.0,I going to purchase in more colors definitely 😊👏🏻
5.0,"I love this ratchet belt, because it looks like a normal belt when you have it on. Easy to use, although, when putting it on, you have to becarful how you thread it through the buckle, but other than that. I use it every day and holds my pants up and looks great."
5.0,Great gift for my daughter's gym coaches!
5.0,Not cheap looking!
5.0,These are my favorite socks. They fit over the calf and stay there all day. They are cushioned and add a little bit of comfort. They are dirt cheap!  What’s not to like?!  I would—and likely will—buy again.
5.0,"Cute. Ordered a size up for a looser fit. Wanted it to fall off my shoulder. I would not call it warm, despite it being a sweatshirt. It's light, so you could workout in it or layer."
5.0,"One of my favorites, Ive been wearing it for about a month now, So pretty all gems are intact, and its beautiful."
5.0,"Though masks are essentially required everywhere, they create added difficulties for asthmatics. In addition to inhaling impurities, our body rids through expiration, the frequent gasps for air left me with a mouthful of the mask and complete obstruction of my nostrils.  I truly felt I was being suffocated. I was forced to retreat quickly to my vehicle to use my nebulizer/inhaler, before returning to my planned activity. I ordered the Disen 3D brackets and I no longer have these obstruction issues. I am able to breathe with ease and the need for intermittent deep inhalations is without difficulty. The brackets fit reusable/washable masks and disposable masks. Though they have clips to attach to disposable masks, they are not necessary. The brackets are held in place by the tension of masks and keep them from being in direct contact with the areas over the nostrils and mouth. I recommend Disen 3D brackets for everyone experiencing difficulty wearing masks."
5.0,Bought for my daughter. Fits perfect.
5.0,"This was a very lovely dance dress.  I was just a little chunky mid section, otherwise it fit me great!<br />Needless to say I am not at my dancer size anymore, but it was for ""Praise Purpose"" so it was fun!"
5.0,These gloves worked so good for me and I can use my phone with no issues!
5.0,It’s was very comfortable for my nephew
5.0,"My daughter loves her umbrella.  It's yellow, big, sturdy, and easy to use."
5.0,"These guys are great, Awesome is the word.  Received my product in good time. and very pleased with it.  Had a little problem with one of the earrings and they replaced them.  Awesome Will be shopping with them again. Most defiantly.<br />Dewayne"
5.0,My women love it
5.0,"I love this lightweight yet cozy neck zip sweater! I am 5'4 180 usually an XL  ( big chested) but all they had at the time was a large so I took the risk and I'm glad I did, not gonna lie it's a little snug but I still love it!"
5.0,"Great price, awesome product. Love it."
5.0,Nice great item
5.0,"These earrings are an excellent buy.  Good quality, sparkle and fit.  At this price you can't go wrong.  The size is just enough to get noticed without being too large.  The gold makes the black stone really pop."
5.0,Good quality and the sizes run true
5.0,"Bought it for my wife, she loved the shirt."
5.0,"Well great looking Coach watch band. Matches my Coach purse, hubby liked it to.<br />The band is genius leather and was shipped fast and on time. Great product would recommend this watch band to any one, looking  for a top of the line watch band."
5.0,"Overall, I decided to keep and wear the dress. I wanted something oversized, roomy, and cotton. I also wanted it to be longer on me. I should have inquired more about the material. I wanted to get a vinyl print on it for the summer and use it as a beach coverup. I did use it as a coverup in the end. I love the pockets. The material is def more of a rayon and not meant for a heat press vinyl to be attached. It fit me and not snug. I'm a 2xl size 20-22 waist and tummy. I just wasn't expecting the material to be that clingy and stretchy feeling. Also, the neck is way higher than pictured. I kept pulling down on it trying to stretch it away from my neck."
5.0,"Stylish, pretty, fits well, better than I thought."
5.0,Will definitely order from here again. the ties look great
5.0,"Love this shirt, very cute"
5.0,"Holding up good so far, very happy with my purchase"
5.0,"These tennis shoes are really light weight. They seem to have comfortable padding in the soles. Love all the little sparkly bling on them. Once I seen them in the sun, I joked that my daughter would blind people from the sun bouncing off the sparkles at P.E and recess when she's running around."
5.0,This was a gift for my daughter. She likes it.
5.0,These shirts are very lightweight and breathable. I use them for work everyday.

5.0,Loved it! Great gift for my girlfriend!
5.0,Very durable necklace for my Cross

5.0,"Very pleased none of these matched.  Several of them I won't be using, but my sister seems to enjoy the ones I don't like!  Great tongue rings"
5.0,Was very satisfied with time & product.
5.0,"This was delivered in a timely manner. It is clean, well marked and does not look cheap. The symbol description paper that accompanies it was helpful for the lesser-known religious symbols that are included on the stole. I am very satisfied with its quality. No complaints from me."
5.0,Excellent thanks
5.0,LOVE THESE!  Very blingy.
5.0,All I can say is I wear this band almost everyday. It’s so nice to not have a buckle! I have a small wrist and bought the small - it’s not tight but holds it close enough for the watch to work normal
5.0,Girlfriend loves them! Seem to be of good quality and the price is right. Win!
5.0,Packs into a small space when empty. Seems very durable.
5.0,"Purchased this backpack for my 3 going on 4yo. It's the perfect size and he loves it. He goes to school with a folder, a lunch box (I think we have the Wildkin) and a water bottle and everything fits inside nicely. The strap across the front is a nice feature too. Would definitely recommend."
5.0,So cute and they feel nice
5.0,"Going to try these out for my first Triathalon. I don't have access to a lap pool, but hoping these work well. I am pleased with the suction while trying a dry fit and they feel comfortable."
5.0,I bought this for my husband and he loves it. Gives him more options to wear his Fitbit and yet feel a bit more dressed up.
5.0,Dad love it!! It looks very very nice!! Great purchase.
5.0,"Beautiful dress, fit perfectly. (I'm 5'8&#34; and 145 lbs and I ordered a Large.) I got a lot of compliments on it. In addition to being pretty, it was very comfortable to wear. Good quality for the price."
5.0,"My wife absolutely loves this bracelet.  Pictures don't do it justice!  It is the perfect thickness, stirty but able to be bent slightly to fit the wrist just right.  Excellent craftsmanship!"
5.0,It is a nice fitting tunic. A little more loose than I thought. But still a nice fit. Hit right in the middle of my bottom and it’s comfy around the collar. It is a brighter red as well.
5.0,Great quality. Sooo cute. My 11 month old wears 18 month clothing. I got XS and it’s perfect! Can’t wait to celebrate her 1st birthday unicorn party!!
5.0,Dress was perfect!
5.0,He wanted pins for his bookbag representing iconic things from the 80's. He was well pleased as he had played the game often with his dad.
5.0,I originally purchased this because it was inexpensive and I didn’t want to pay very much for a solid color scarf. The value of this is way better than what I expected and I am so thankful to have made the purchase! Will definitely recommend these to other customers.
5.0,"Fit great, nice material, very flattering"
5.0,Great product! I like a wider band and most other silicone rings for women are very slim. I work in healthcare and constantly wash my hands and it stays in place and doesn't absorb any water or trap it underneeth.
5.0,"I bought this for my daughter for a concert.  They require clear bags only.  This was a stadium approved bag.  Stylish and great to carry my daughter's phone, wallet and her backup charger.  She had room for her friend's phone as well.  Great value for the price."
5.0,I loved this tank top! The material is very soft and comfortable. I truly recommend it for those who practice yoga.
5.0,I thought it was perfect for a dancer who has everything.
5.0,I was looking for a pair of everyday boots for my son that could hold up to wear and tear.  These boots are a little big but he has room to grow.
5.0,"Good quality, great gift"
5.0,Fits as expected. Good material.
5.0,"Always happy to buy something you know is decent quality  in terms of fit, durability and cost. Need I say more? The fit is perfect, it washes well (color stays very well) , is extremely comfortable and is priced well."
5.0,"Great fit, cute dress. I was the Queen of Choir because I could stow away everyone's cough drops and hankies for our winter performances!"
5.0,Very very nice! So elegant pair of boots. Better in person than the pictures! Worth the price!
5.0,I used as covid mask. Didn’t want warmth or thickness. Not adequate as solitary covering but good for double masking. Comfortable to wear. Easy to pull up and down.
5.0,Best dress if you need one fast  Gold tone beautiful
5.0,Absolutely love this!!!
5.0,"Of course, not a high quality knit sweater, but super warm and cute and as described and seen in the picture. Brand I recommend for affordable, every day cute and comfy."
5.0,The shirt itself is great I like the fabric it’s synthetic and cotton; it looks like a nice quality shirt. Best thing about it is it arrived less than 24 hours after I ordered it
5.0,"I bought this to wear as a form fitting top rather than for dancing, so I don't know how it would work for athletic wear. As a form-fitting dressy top, it works great. The gathers between the breasts and the princess seams give it a really pretty, almost ""sweetheart"" kind of neckline. I am 5'6"", 130 lbs, bra size 32C/D with an average torso length. The medium fits snugly, but not uncomfortably. The fabric is sort of ""firmly stretchy"" and cottony to the touch, so it is not flimsy. I wear mine with a bra, but if you like to go braless, I think nipple show through would not be a problem."
5.0,"Prompt delivery. Color true to picture. Soft material.  I usually fit between a Med and Large. I opted for a medium and glad I did, perfect fit. Highly recommend."
5.0,Purchased for my son. He loves them. Says they are comfortable.
5.0,"Heavy fabric, hangs nicely and beautiful color.  Well made."
5.0,Gave as a gift to my bridesmaids for helping me tie the knot and they loved the gift. Very simple and elegant.

5.0,"I love this shirt! Very happy.... the design is a true classic! Great quality material, soft cotton and fits great! I ordered a medium.... I'm 5'9 and weigh 155 lbs and couldn't be more pleased with the fitting.<br /><br />Will be purchasing more from this line of clothing. Thank you QraphicTees!"
5.0,This cardigan is very fashionable.The fabric is soft and stretchy.I picked Medium size and it fits on me perfectly.This cardigan is just in the right length which is long that cover my behind area.I like the wrap idea design by which fabric is being held by a button on each side by the shoulder to keep it from falling.The added tassels makes it look pretty.This sweater is perfect for the fall and winter season.In my own opinion it is a nice cardigan perfect for the fall and winter.
5.0,"Love it, fits great"
5.0,Totally happy with the product!!
5.0,I am very pleased with this tank top. I love the feel of it. It is a very breathable material. Fits Great...  I would recommend this tank top  to other heavy set woman it seems to be forgiving in some areas.
5.0,great service and product!
5.0,Look very nice for price. Not adjustable but over all fit well.
5.0,Particularly the metal nose band was excellent to shape mask to your face and keep from falling down. The adjustable ear loops are great also
5.0,"Very comfortable and very clear. No fog, and good seal; no water leakage"
5.0,"I didn't have high expectations for this dress. At all lol, boy oh boy was I wrong! I love, love, love this dress! The material is nice and thick, but still soft and breathable. The color is true to the picture. The cut is perfect. The slit is high enough that he dress is comfortable to walk in, while not revealing at all. I'd say it's about 6 inches long, true to the picture. My favorite feature is that the string to lace up is not sewn down at all. I wasn't a fan of the bow at the bottom or the holes at the top, unlaced, so I removed the sting and related it, bottom to top, and tied knots behind the top knot to keep the string from coming through the holes. Even with largish boobs, the string was long enough to do this and it looks perfect! I should also mention that this dress has lots of stretch. I am a size 14-16 and the large has plenty of room. There is a zipper in the back so need to peel it on and off or worry about ruining your hair or makeup as you would with over the head dresses. It does have a seam down the front (which is in the image if you look closely) and that is my least favorite feature, but it does not compromise the dress at all. Over all, I highly recommend. I received a discount for purchasing this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Also, please ignore my post baby belly lol!"
5.0,Bought this top for a concert. It arrived in a timely manner and did not disappoint. Nice top.
5.0,My granddaughter loves this.<br />It's well made and really cute.<br />Many of the moms in her ballet class have asked for the best way to get one for the their daughter.
5.0,"This tutu is puffier than it looks in the pic, but was super fun to wear. The neon yellow is a great color twist and I got so many compliments on this tutu."
5.0,"So happy to be able to find an extremely large size in an NSync shirt! I searched with little hope to find a tee of my favorite all time band to wear on the same day my husband wore one of his favorite (Beatles). But I’m a huge woman who wears a men’s 4 or 5XL. I could probably do a 3XL, but I like all my clothing loose. Figured it would be a long shot. Thankfully this item and it’s seller exist! Wore it with pride on our Danube River Cruise vacation in Europe (we are from USA). I got lots of fun comments from people my age (thirties) both from the US on ship with us as well as from European locals. Apparently NSync is universal! Wore more often than planned because of it!<br /><br />I had to make a few transactions to find the right size- that was my poor choice. I should have bought the two or three predicted sizes in one purchase and then returned the size(s) that didn’t fit me."
5.0,Didn’t dislike anything! Very nice looking for the price !
5.0,"My real engagement ring is in lay away jail at the jewelry store, and my fianc&eacute; wanted me to have something to wear. He surprised me with this for my Valentine Birthday. I have to say, I thought he spent our entire budget for the first 5 years of marriage. This ring is very convincing. It poses a problem for me, though, as my rock is going to shrink considerably! Lol. I'll store this away for occasions when I'm around some of my more annoying snooty acquaintances!"
5.0,"very pretty hat, love to were it."
5.0,A versatile dress that goes almost anywhere.
5.0,"It's beautiful, fits my daughter great"
5.0,"Bigger than what I expected but I didn't read the description so that was my fault, but love it anyways."
5.0,"Very nice denim shorts. Firstly, this denim shorts is different from the fabrics I bought from other shops before. They are stretchy , soft, and very comfortable to wear in hot summer. Secondly, I love this vintage distressed style, it's classic and stylish, and I gonna  wear it on my outing next Tuesday. Thirdly, it is true to size and the pockets have plenty of space for me to carry a variety of items. Overall, it was a very satisfying online shopping, good quality and nice price, I highly recommend it."
5.0,"This was soooo cute! I bought both a large and a medium and went with the medium. The elastic part hits right under your chest which for me is the smallest part of my torso and since this dress has a triangle flow, although the large fit just as well on the top the bottom just flared out too much and made me look too big (in my opinion). The medium skimmed my silhouette making it the most flattering. For reference I am a 10/12 in jeans, medium/large tops and I’m 5’7"
5.0,"Cute dress! If you have larger girls I would suggest a size up, it fits but is snug up top."
5.0,"Bought for my 4 year old for her tap/ballet dance class. She usually wears 4T and this fits her perfectly. It's her favorite leotard! Good quality material, thicker but very stretchy. Stays on well without any movement."
5.0,Wonderful item. Just as described.
5.0,I love these interchangeable straps.  I can match my outfit by changing the band while keeping the  very same watch.
5.0,my grandson was pleased with these socks.
5.0,One of my favorite maxi’s - It’s my go to! Fits so comfortably and flattering for me being pear shaped<br /><br />Top usual size medium 34B<br />Bottom usually size L or 12-14
5.0,This is great! The hole at the top is prefect size for a pony tail or messy bun. Very Cute!
5.0,Really cute! A little difficult to put on at first but it's worth the hassle lol
5.0,Came right on time and fits snug. I had a little bit of trouble getting it on but I think it's cause I got size 20 and my first stud was 18. I like the look and would by it again
5.0,"This strap looks better in person and the leather is so soft and wears extremely comfortable.  I thought there had to be a catch because it was so inexpensive, but no catch at all, in fact it is nicer then bands costing triple the price.  Very impressed!"
5.0,"They fit really well, are very comfortable, and they look super stylish."
5.0,"This is a perfect sized purse - not too large, but small enough to conveniently carry and have ""all my stuff"" with me."
5.0,Love this bag. Delivery was prompt and the bag was exactly as described.
5.0,It's heavier than I thought but in a good way
5.0,I like the texture and light materials
5.0,Awesome quality and so cute. Would order again.
5.0,My daughter just turned six. She is very tall for her age. She wears 6x- 7/8 girls clothes. We ordered the Capezio short sleeved black leotard Amazon's size 8/10 which is Capezio medium child (M/Ch) and it fits her perfectly. My first impression was that it looked small but the material allows for a stretchy-snug fit but also room to grow into. She has just enough room grow another size and still fit into this leotard. Very satisfied. I hope I provided enough info to help gage size and fit for the next viewer.
5.0,The watch was excellent.  I did only because it did not fit my wrist.
5.0,So pretty and fashionable
5.0,Very fine. Its Good
5.0,"I can read my books, magazines & newspapers again.<br />The glasses are perfect!!!"
5.0,Plastic at the connection. Slight wiggle. Not noticeable while wearing.  Metal at the adjustment. Almost too small for male  wrist. Dope pattern though!
5.0,"Great tote bag, I can fit so much in it."
5.0,"It's a great outdoors shirt and not just for water sports. It's lightweight, well ventilated and dries quickly. I'd recommend going a size larger than you normally would wear."
5.0,Just as described and arrived on time
5.0,"I love this dress. It was so flattering. I’m 6ft tall, 235lbs. I bought the 2xl cause my boobs are big. I had room still. It’s was perfect."
5.0,"This watch is very sleek and expensive looking, get an extremely accurate Japanese movement sure to last for years to come for pennies per year. I have a dozen Adee Kaye watches I have collected in the last 15 years and they still all are operational and keeping good time."
5.0,"Amazing product, I lovee it, good price and the delivery was very quickly!"
5.0,"I adore these bangles I have had my fair share of trouble trying to find gold stainless steel bangles and these are it. I do everything in these bangles and the color has not changed and they are still as perfect as the day I received them. The color is a perfect gold, not bronzy at all."
5.0,"Beautiful and elegant, good quality."
5.0,"I like how lightweight these are, my earlobes weren't tired at the end of the day."
5.0,"Absolutely stunning watch, very acurate at keeping time. Sturdy little thing not cheap at all. I am surprised at how well this watch sits in the hand."
5.0,"I originally ordered 4 pairs, great hit with everyone I gave them to SO I ordered 6 black fingerless gloves. Received 3 black, 3 gray. Not worth sending them back just hope they fit as well."
5.0,Loved it. Fit perfectly! I got a lot of complements.
5.0,Arrived in a timely Manner. Great price.
5.0,"These pajamas are very cute.  They are very comfortable.  They fit true to size.  They wash and dry well, at least so far.  I ordered a second pair."
5.0,Purchased for my niece. She is very pleased with this product. A little hard to fill but the funnel helped. I did seal it to make sure it didn't come apart.
5.0,"This is it 😃 I found the perfect shirt.<br />I am 5&#34;4  134LB & ordered a size Large<br />It fits great, I like a lot the feel of this fabric, & how fancy it makes me look.<br />One other thing I want to say is if your afraid that you will order the wrong size<br />Don't Be because the fabric has a good stretch to it ,like I said I ordered a Large but even if a ordered a Medium it probably would fit just fine too.<br />Happy Shopping!!!"
5.0,"I have only tried on this dress, but looks nice! havent had a occasion to wear yet but will be ready soon."
5.0,Great sunglasses! I was tired of spending $10 for one pair of sunglasses per kid only to not be able to find their sunglasses when it was time to go outside. These are great quality and great price and fits our needs perfectly.
5.0,"I was a little  nerves getting it , I'm 5' 7"" I'm a larger  in size , so I went up one only because  I like room , it fit perfectly! I'm getting the other colors , the color was true . It goes great with jeans !!!"
5.0,These are great! super fast shipping! They really look realistic! Great addition to any Halloween costume!
5.0,I like the brand Buff better than these but they do the job
5.0,This Shirt is true to its size. My man has some muscles. So when he put on the shirt it looked so sexy on him. Arsenal is his favorite team. This was a great purchase.
5.0,"I bought this for a summer wedding. I am so glad I did. Fit great, I am 5'4 & 180. I bought a black dress. Fits really good, I was worried but after trying it on it looks so pretty."
5.0,Very nice material and very comfortable.  I did have to relocate the buttons to accommodate loupes. So far my favorite scrub cap
5.0,Watch band is as described and was even nice that it had a tool to take links out if needed. Would recommend this item
5.0,"Purchased as a bridesmaid dress for a wedding. The quality is super nice, the material is great, and it is a little on the thicker side which was nice since the wedding was in November. I recommend this dress, and I'll likely purchase another one in a different color."
5.0,This was such a quality dress. It’s the real thing. Highly recommend.
5.0,My favorite thing I purchased on Amazon this year!! And that says A LOT.  So flattering.  I was skeptical because of the price but it's surprisingly very well made! I bought another color immediately and WILLL be buying more. Absolutely love this skirt!
5.0,Nice mask. Very funny. Was a gift. Made person laugh. Looks exactly like persons service dog.
5.0,Love it. Stays on and locks in moisture.  Not stylish  enough  to wear out as it says though.  Great  product
5.0,Perfect for my grandson
5.0,What a great comfy outfit for Halloween and upcoming Christmas! Love it
5.0,"Love the shoes, comfortable, very well made."
5.0,I bought these to replace my 11 year old's rain suit and my son loves this set. The color is nice and the Velcro adjustment on the ankles and wrists are a nice addition. The jacket length is perfect as it isn't too short or too long. The sizing runs true to size and can be comfortably worn over pants and a hoodie or light jacket. Reflective print on the back of the jacket and arms is a great supporting feature.
5.0,"Nice dress.  It is very soft and comfy.  The straps are wider and it is higher cut that pictured, as other have mentioned.  Love the rose/brown/blue combo.  I am 6 feet tall and this is long enough on me!"
5.0,"This is a nice fanny pack. I got it for my boys to put their nerf ammo in, and it's way too big for a kid. But it's nice quality...so, definitely good for adult use. It's not meant for kids."
5.0,Nice design. I will wear the hat when I fish.
5.0,"Great quality and great look, very happy with this purchase!"
5.0,Great size for me. Sturdy canvas.  Put together very well.

5.0,Excellent Seller
5.0,"It's so much fun, I can't stop laughing ))<br />Quality is better than expected from China.<br />WARNING: whoever will see you in these ""USA-Eagle"" briefs, will continue to laugh until you remove them.<br />And then, maybe, some more )"
5.0,Beuty ring
5.0,Quality of sewing is okay but it is decently made and a keeper. I would definitely recommend it. I got a medium because I am between a small and medium. It really didn't shrink at all after the first wash. Since I am only 5 feet 130 lbs it hits mid thigh on me.Sleeves are a little long on me but it is not noticeable.
5.0,Lovely skinny pants. If you are 34 get 36 w or large.
5.0,this shirt fit me way too big it felt like I was wearing a nightgown. The shirt is still really pretty and soft.
5.0,"Excellent Quality, Perfect Fit, Rivals My Designer Brands!<br /><br />Awesome Purchase! Perfect Fit!<br /><br />These are right on-point for fit. So don't worry about size up and down or &#34;muffin top&#34; or any of that. I actually ordered these not noting the Brand and then went to *name-brand, big-box store* to see if they had reasonably priced workout clothes the next day and ended up trying on 3 different pairs of Power Flex pants that all fit perfectly and seemed better than even the CK and Nicole M. sets I have/tried on! I realized when I received these via Prime today that these were &#34;that same brand&#34; and breathed a sigh of relief knowing they'd fit well before I even put them on.<br /><br />To be clear....I am about a Size 10. I'm 5'7 with a 34 Large C Chest and pretty &#34;normal/average&#34; thighs and butt in relation to my overall size. I buy a &#34;Large&#34; in bottoms, typically because I'm &#34;long in the thigh&#34; and have problems with regular sizes not being long enough for my crotch --&#62;knee area. So I ended up sizing up or buying &#34;talls&#34; hoping to not have a crotch that's 2 inches below my actual body. These are PERFECT for long legs!! The length is awesome in that it's hard to find this length in-stores because they mostly label only &#34;Capri&#34; and &#34;Regular/Full&#34; lengths and you have to scavenge for this length. I love it that they're still long enough that I don't freeze in the Winter and Fall, but can still wear them in Spring and Warmer Weather.<br /><br />I know waistbands are really important to pretty much every woman. I'm using these for regular working out at the Gym as well as Physical Therapy for my back which means a Therapist is grabbing my body parts and flexing them for me (so you don't want super-wild pants and a weird fit both because therapy can be painful and because it would be embarrassing if butt-crack or muffin-top came out....you want WELL FITTED pants for this, trust me). These are perfect for both!<br /><br />*PLEASE NOTE* In my photos I left the tag on the pants to show that these are genuinely branded and marked properly and didn't realize that the tag was actually folding the waist-band down a bit. It's actually &#34;smooth&#34; all around. The band is thicker and double-seamed around the upper belly and these are about &#34;medium-rise&#34;. You could probably yank them up to make them a bit higher, but they honestly fit JUST right. There is the built-in &#34;pocket&#34; on the front-inside of the pants just like Nicole M. and other more expensive sets you may be used to. The band is flattering, but not too tight. The back is high enough for any butt no matter how large or small it is. The band leaves plenty of &#34;length&#34; so that there's no areas that you'd need to worry about even doing an extreme work-out or running.<br /><br />Most of all, I want to make clear how amazingly soft these are....but somehow thinner/more natural feeling & durable than other brands. I don't know what it is or how they do it....but these feel more like &#34;second skin&#34; than any other brand I've tried lots of Designer Brands.  Normally if you want &#34;durable&#34;....you get the really heavy/hot/thick pants that are less flexible. If you want &#34;thinner&#34; and &#34;cooler&#34; you get pants that aren't durable and shift around on your body. Somehow these are the perfect mix of both. They feel soft and &#34;medium&#34; thickness....but are still cool and super-flexible. But like the thicker blends, they stay very secure in the waistband and other areas and can handle tough workouts and stretching with no problem.<br /><br />And on a side note...I wasn't sure about ordering the &#34;Charcoal&#34; but they are a perfect heathered grey and they really look great with any of my bras, tees, and cover-ups because they are very neutral and look amazing on. My photos are &#34;meh&#34; as far as getting the color and fit using the selfie-cam, but you really only need to buy a pair of these yourself to find out that these are amazing quality and will make you forget your designer sets in favor of these. Excellent value, perfect fit, sizing on point, and amazing comfort and flexibility/durability! I highly, highly recommend these no matter what your preference or fitness demands!"
5.0,Comfortable !  Great price
5.0,"Simple installation, maintenance-free, and good quality.  But the base has to be purchased separately."
5.0,Great shades for the price! Bought this pack for my family for a 7 day cruise.  Figured if a pair broke or was lost no one would be too upset but I was wrong!  One of my kids was pretty upset when he broke his pair after 6 days of wear and tear so I ended up giving him mine.  Will definitely buy these again!
5.0,"My 2nd pair, I love them"
5.0,Came early and grateful. Great price.
5.0,Girl friend loved it!
5.0,"The fabric of this shirt is soft, heavy enough that it hangs well on the body, and doesn’t wrinkle much. I get a lot of compliments on it, and I always enjoy wearing it out."
5.0,"beautiful, high quality, very comfortable will last for years"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:c3b9a0979fdfe087ff64e030cdf915d]] Son absolutely loves them!! Would not take them off!!! Any kid asking for light up shoes, you found them!"
5.0,Grand daughter will love for Christmas
5.0,"I ordered this a while ago and I’m just getting to writing my review, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this necklace I never take it off unless I have too. There’s been no discoloration, no weird green marks NOTHING. I have nothing bad to say about this product I love it and if you’re looking for something simple and worried about the color tarnishing are coming off you have nothing to worry about."
5.0,"I ordered two of these rings in a size 6 for me and 12 for my husband.  Both are very beautiful, highly polished silver.  The moldavite stones are small and pale but the energy from that little stone is amazing.  Because of the wide width I advise ordering a size larger than you normally take.  Both my husband and I had to switch the rings over to our left hands because the fit on our right hands was a bit tight.<br /><br />The company shipped the rings the day after we ordered them and they arrived within 4 days!  It was nice to get them 2 days earlier than the earliest estimated delivery date.  I am very happy with this purchase and the company."
5.0,"Bought this for my nephew and it fit perfectly. It’s really soft and high quality, especially for the price!"
5.0,Hard to find Elmo clothing my little grandson loves them
5.0,These are perfect for my homemade cleaning supplies!  The sprayers all work wonderfully!
5.0,I didn't expect much but I love it..I was looking for something subtle and it's perfect
5.0,"This dress is a steal! I would suggest order and size up just because it really hugs curves. (Unless you’re into that) I revived SOOO many compliments and people were amazed that I got it from amazon. I are it to a fire & ice themed event and it was perfect. Very comfortable, quality fabric and the shimmer really shines through. If you got more junk in the trunk don’t worry about the slit. You can twerk all night long with no coochie slip. But this dress!!"
5.0,"These are excellent quality and have an adequate amount of padding to protect your cheeks. However, they do run a bit small. I ordered a medium and they seem more like a small or even a x-small. I would definitely order a size up next time."
5.0,There are many reasons I like this wallet.  The magnet is strong enough to hold more than 5 bills without worry. I can carry at least 4 cards and 2 I.D.s without worry of stretching the wallet out of shape.  It is also free from I.D. theft.
5.0,Great fit & stylish hat
5.0,Love them laced gloves
5.0,Bought this as a gift for a grieving friend to place a picture of their lives ones. It was cute looking but definitely had that made in China feel. It gets the looks good from 10 feet away look.
5.0,Perfect for my 6 year old's kitten birthday party!
5.0,Fits as expected. Very comfortable.
5.0,"This is a beautiful band, and is very well made, I just did not think the Rose gold does not match my watch well enough to keep it. the Rose Gold on my watch is more of a brushed rose fold and the band is more of a glossy rose gold which makes it look more like gold."
5.0,"My wife typed this in: Bought this for my everyday workout. It fits perfectly, fine quality and breathable. Have tried many tops and by far this one is great and will be ordering my 3rd pair shortly."
5.0,"I love the style, fit, and look."
5.0,"There is nothing I don't like- love the way it looks, fits perfectly, speedy delivery!"

5.0,Great pendant
5.0,I bought my husband these bc he always loses his sunglasses. He loved but lost them so I bought him 2 more pair! Great purchase!!!!
5.0,"I like the fit, and the multi focal properties, just not the blue blocking effect, it causes flares of light when viewing cell phones."
5.0,"Great product. Light weight, easy to use and well made."
5.0,Very Soft Inside!<br />Thick beanies perfect for winter
5.0,These are so much bang for your buck! The bridge of my nose is super sensitive from breaking it twice as a child. Most sunglasses are super uncomfortable to wear for me. I took a chance with these because I liked a similar designer style. These are so light and trendy! I was super happy with my purchase.
5.0,"I'll admit when it came, I was certain it wasnt going to fid. But I tried it on anyway, and it stretched easily as much as I needed it too, without looking stretched and without looking too small for me. It looks amazing. I gotta get a pic taken and update this review. Love this skirt so far!"
5.0,"Well made, great fit. Super comfortable. Excellent choice! Ready to roll!"
5.0,love iy
5.0,"I love this ear cuff. I have worn it every day since it came in. Great quality for the price, very sturdy, love the design. The only issue I had was when I pushed it up too high and it pinched - easy fix."
5.0,Love the design it's so cute but I recommend buying a size up for shrinking room and comfortable for.
5.0,Good quality. Looks to be official merch
5.0,"I am going to wash my dress before hemming it, just in case it shrinks.  I am 5'2"" and even the petite XLg is<br />still too long.  But, I am online and going to order a couple more of these dresses already!"
5.0,Pretty necklace.  Got lots of comments.  The seller is great to work with if there is a problem.  I love it!
5.0,"Nice wristband, well worth the price!"
5.0,Nice generous fit
5.0,My wife loves it. Lots of complements
5.0,Love this. I've been saying this to my husband for years and found the pocket watch. Too perfect!
5.0,"I ordered this ring for my wedding last year rather than purchasing a similar one at Zales for upwards of $200. The ring size does run large and I had to send it back initially, but West Coast Jewelery exchanged it with no problem. The ring arrived in a very nice plush blue bag and looked great.<br />I've had this ring for over a year and it still looks as shiny and flawless as the day it arrived. The ring fits snug so I don't take it off, and it has had to endure a litany of home repairs, gardening, and auto repairs and still looks fantastic. Through sanding joint compound to cleaning paint brushes, this ring hasn't lost its shine or received a single scratch."
5.0,Great size work great.
5.0,This was a little bit bigger than I expected but I didn't mind.
5.0,Nice pants.  But mine came with a big brown stain on one leg.  Had to wash it in some hot water and dawn .  water turned real brown color.  Right now they are in the dryer.  They fit real good though.  Will buy more.
5.0,Really nice size and price. Looks great on most people.
5.0,"I have to be honest when I saw the previous review about this containing only the box, it scared me because I already had placed the order! But I was very happy to see when my package arrived yesterday it did in fact have the box as well as the Nintendo 64 Donkey Kong game cartridge!!!! I’m super excited to play it, I haven’t done so yet but I will try to give an updated review once I do to let you know how it works, but so far so good!!🥰😆🥹👍🏾"
5.0,"Anything Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated, I love. If it is correct of course.<br />Thank you for having an abundance at a reasonable price."
5.0,This boot lasted me 8+ yrs (not sure exactly when i bought it).  Just bought it again when i finally destroyed the old pair.  Waterproofing lasted almost that whole time too.
5.0,"So comfortable! Great movement in them, not restricted at all but still feel like nothing is going to pop out for a free show either. Awesome pants"
5.0,Great Sweatshirt!!!
5.0,"Nice shoues to be honest, i use them to walk on a daily basis,  and they are really good"
5.0,My 2 granddaughter wore them with no complaints.  Great fit
5.0,Great quality it has a good size for a 9-10 years old kid
5.0,So sexy ! Was exactly what i was looking for .. i got a medium and it was perfect  .. the only thing i didn’t like was that i had to put the strings in myself but other than that definitely recommend
5.0,"Beautiful dress! So happy it is not too big. I'm between an XL/XXL mostly because I don't like things too tight, but so many dresses can end up way too baggy. I'm broad through the bust & shoulders. I got XL, my stats for reference are 5'7"" 190# 38dd, 14 pants (or L) and 18 top (XL-XXL) carry most of my weight around the middle. This dress drapes just right around those curves without being baggy or so snug that you can see every jiggle with each step you take (I don't wear spanx- too constricting). The empire waist is flattering, hitting just right, not too low under the bust like so many can, hiding imperfections around the middle. The mid weight material of poly & a touch of lycra is soft and gives nicely! The arms fit me well, not tight at all, and the neckline is a crew. The length for me, is perfect. It grazes my lower ankles, down to the heel, but doesn't drag on the floor. This is one of my favorite dresses I've chosen and hope it will hold up well! I'll be getting another."
5.0,I'm Asian and short bridge nose..this sunglasses fits very good on my face and the lens on the bottom doesn't touch on my cheeks. perfect fit and love it!!!!
5.0,This cover protects my laptop from all kinds of dust that could get onto my laptop and I really love that.
5.0,Awesome frames! My 6 year old grandson loves them. Perfect size.
5.0,Quick delivery. Great gift for our soccer player.
5.0,It's a little big in my waist but I fixed that with a belt. Super cute
5.0,I love this sweatshirt. Fits perfectly and is comfortable.
5.0,These are some of the most comfortable and warm socks I've had.
5.0,Looks really nice in person.
5.0,Beautiful dun glasses for summer..
5.0,Super cute little necklace set!  Bought it for my granddaughter who absolutely loves it!  It comes exactly as advertised and is easy to put on and take off.
5.0,Great top. Love the teal color.
5.0,My daughter likes to be different just like me when i was a kid and i bought her two of these for her dance class they are so beautiful and she stands out and i know she loves that. They fit her perfectly.
5.0,I wear it every day. Stays strong and color doesn't fade even if I never remove it.
5.0,These sunglasses are truly remarkable. They fit well and the protection for your eyes is very good. Bought a second pair for a family member. Stylish and easy to clean.
5.0,Best leather ever top quality but that’s lucky brand.
5.0,This belt is beautiful. I wore it to my daughters wedding and it went perfectly with my dress. I received many compliments. I would recommend buying this.
5.0,"Very soft feel good material. I love the pockets on both sides. It is so easy to dress it up for a nice occasion or just running errands. Be swear there are no washing in structions or tag saying what the garment is made of. Other wise, I love and would buy again. I have one in purple also"
5.0,"I am very pleased with this watch.  So far it keeps good time.  What I didn't like is that it arrived ticking.  I have no idea how long it had been running or if it was a returned item.  Usually, a new watch arrives with a small plastic piece that you remove to engage the battery.  There were no instructions or written materials of any kind either.  That, too, makes me wonder if it had been returned.  In either case I like the watch and hope to wear it for some time."
5.0,Loved it! It was the same as the original!
5.0,GREAT product! Durable and classy.
5.0,Great charm
5.0,Adds style to you're outfit
5.0,"The print feels durable and flexible. The tubular mask is thin, soft and elastic for a comfortable feel. Meant for spring/summer riding. Too this for 50deg or less."
5.0,"Love 'em in our hot, humid Florida Sunshine!"
5.0,Absolutely adorable and very entertaining for passersby :) I usually wear a medium sized hat and am able to wear it but it's snug.
5.0,These ear rings are STUNNING! The color is vibrant and beautiful and they arent too heavy for wearing long periods of time. Only downside was that at the end of the night I noticed my neck was a little blue from what I can only guess was the dye running from getting caught in the rain earlier in the evening. It wasnt a lot but was noticeable enough my boyfriend was able to see it sitting next to me.
5.0,"A good fit and fabric feels great - actually better quality than I expected from the price.  The dress I received was as shown in the picture.<br /><br />Color note to US shoppers:  The picture, not the description, is accurate.  The dress that was sent to me is a true blue, similar to a cobalt blue, as shown (NOT the much darker shade that is generally advertised in the US as navy blue).<br /><br />I will review the petticoat I purchased to go with it when it arrives."
5.0,This was a gift to my daughter who loved it! it is to cute! Love the color scheme!
5.0,I love this watch. It's unique design makes it so attractive. I bought the red one and am seriously considering purchasing the navy one.

5.0,My grandson wanted to go as a mage and this was a perfect cape for him. He loved it!
5.0,Very very sexy I have worn this as a shirt tucked under skinny jeans and later as a sexy dress. Fabric is so soft!
5.0,My husband liked them a lot.  He said that they are really comfortable. They are like jeggins but for guys just thicker material than jeggings. They are stretchy. He normally wears size 34 I order them size M and they fit perfectly.
5.0,Just what I wanted and expected.
5.0,Bought this dress for my gender reveal party in May.... Absolutely love it! Fits perfectly ( I was afraid it would be long) can't wait for my party now!
5.0,Tarnished within a week. Not real
5.0,"I really LOVE these simple little earrings. I have only been wearing them for about a week… so, stay tuned for longevity. I of course do not wear them in the shower. I normally wear a large stud earring. Once in a while I will wear hoops. However, I must typically wear a 5-9mm stud earring. Usually a CZ round or square princess cut.  These little studs are actually the perfect size and color minimalist gold earring.  They go with everything. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase."
5.0,"Its exactly in the website description; well presentation packaged. Very comfortable, I loved it, the color is beautiful and bright, I bought in other different  color."
5.0,Love the clip
5.0,Prompt and decent quality
5.0,Love this key chain.  Its pretty nice and I definitely recommend it to anyone.  The quality is really good and lightweight.  The feel is smooth to the touch with crisp edges that are a touch of class.  The gold latch to the clip is a very nice touch.  The ring is big enough to put a good number of keys on it.  Its surprisingly sturdily built too.  The other slot on the back of the clip has the capability to be daisy chained to something else without any issues.
5.0,Super cute earrings. Lightweight and hypoallergenic
5.0,Product is exactly as described. Great value. Fast shipping.
5.0,THiS DRESS IS SO LIGHT WEIGHT ANDCOMFORTABLE

5.0,my goddaughter ryleigh thoroughly enjoyed her gift
5.0,Im normally at 6.5 but I got a 7. They for my wide foot and they were comfortable. I added a gel insert for added comfort. Wore them for a church event. They didn’t tire me out like normal flat sandals.
5.0,My husband uses for work . Lots alof pockets - so far holding up well daily ise
5.0,I really like it. My favorite mask
5.0,"Gave this shirt as a gift. They loved it. Shirt was a nice weight, quality screen printing as well.  Very much satisfied with my purchase!"
5.0,The t-shirt has a soft feel and is made of a quality fabric that is tolerated well by my youngest son who has autism. He loves wearing it and cheering for his driver on race day.
5.0,Muy buena calidad. Pero la entrega no fue buena lo entregaron en otro apartamento
5.0,GREAT PRODUCT.....GREAT SERVICE!!!
5.0,"Delivered quickly.  Great customer service!! Nice material. Bra can't be seen at underarm area. The first one I received had a weird hard stain on the front, but they very quickly sent me a replacement.  Great tank for hot summer lake days. For reference: I'm 5'7 with 41"" chest."
5.0,"my wife love this handbags, it's great big and very stylish and the price is amazing, the color very nice"
5.0,"Based on others reviews, I decided to order a medium.  I am 5'7&#34;, curvy size 10-12 (DD with 41&#34; hips).  I would normally order a large.  The medium fits just the way I wanted it to. I probably could have ordered a small and been content with it as well, but because of the way it hangs - the medium is fine.  Perfect for casual.  Very soft material.  It has an extra layer of material at the bust area (so no see through) - kind of like a tank top you'd buy locally."
5.0,Beautiful Easter colors. We are putting them along with candy in Easter eggs for the kids at church.
5.0,"First time ordering from this vendor...was pleasantly surprised at how well the dress was made and how nice it fit me....it was the perfect dress to a college graduation which I was attending.... My husband loved it on me and was very impressed. However, I typically wear a large I'm 5'7 and weight 170 lbs. with a bra size of 36DD but I decided to go with the XL and was glad I did because it was just perfect.  I felt amazing......love my dress and will definitely be purchasing more soon."
5.0,Everyone at work loves my mask. Giving a smile even when you can’t see my real one. Lol
5.0,The Hat was excellent<br /><br />Thank you
5.0,Better than expected.
5.0,Very nice. A little smaller than I was expecting.
5.0,"Nice hat, sized correctly. Tight sewing, correct edging and loops to standard US pattern, excellent construction overall, and the Felcktarn pattern fabric is not some weird color variant, matching German issue surplus. Recommended."
5.0,"Great quality, good fit, comfortable and love the pockets"
5.0,I like it. It loosens up a bit when wearing it but it's a very neat piece. Well made and attractive.
5.0,These white classic dance tights are just what my daughter needed for her ballet class.  They fit just as we expected them too and they're easy to put on.  They're machine washable but you can tumble dry them on low.  Price is good for 2 pair of white tights.
5.0,My mother was love
5.0,"Perfect condition. I love the watch, being that I'm out in Kuwait, I immediately switched the band to the rubber band. Feels good, looks awesome, I love the company anyway with my first one that I bought. I Was also told also that the watch looks like it is worth more than what I bought it for!"
5.0,"I love this bathing suit! I ordered a Small, and it fits perfectly. The bottoms are a little hard to pull over my hips/butt, however, once they are on, they fit great. I just have to pull them on slowly ao i dont pop a seam. I am 5'1&#34; and 104 lbs."
5.0,loved it with my police outfit for Halloween
5.0,Use this everyday for work. I love the long length. Most leashes are short. Reminds me to use my mask when in public.
5.0,I love it and I’ve got a lot of complements.
5.0,Amazingly fun party dress.  I am very happy.  It would be pretty cool if Amazon suggested what tops would go with it.  I wore a white vest but the whites did not match perfectly.
5.0,Great top - I've had lots of compliments
5.0,"Great buy, ideal for workout and casual wear, look nowhere else, just buy these!!"
5.0,"It's a style I like, and I have several."
5.0,"Love these! Airy for running and cute,  not tight!"
5.0,"Literally the perfect sports bra. I am a 36D 5’7 160lbs for reference. Love how it looks, it stays in place when I’m lifting, stays in place when doing cardio, and the material is good. I wash and dry it at least once a week and it has not lost its shape or elasticity. Better than much more expensive workout clothing I have purchased and would recommend to anyone."
5.0,Looks great and arrived on time
5.0,Fit perfectly !
5.0,I LOVE THESE SHINY MASK WHICH ARE ALSO COMFORTABLE  WEARING.
5.0,"This ""BFF"" facemark and bandana set is super cute. You can wear your mask while matching your furry friend. The lightweight material is super breathable and washes up nicely. The design is so sweet as well. Love the daisies and paw prints so much. My furbaby loves it too!"
5.0,"Just got this ring in today. I actually have a set of plastic ring sizers. I'm size 9 and it is the same if you use the method described by Amazon. The ring is a perfect size 9 ring. There is only one Triforce logo on the ring. The blue plastic / glass imbedded in the ring is a little dark and difficult to show off in a photo. But, it does look very nice. I have another one of a different design coming hopefully soon"
5.0,"I really like the comfort of the band. The watch works, nothing fancy there, but it looks really cool. I've had lots of people notice it, and ask me about it."
5.0,Love my portable briefcase.  Easy to use and fashionable.
5.0,"These leggings fit perfectly, are soft, great quality, and non see through!"
5.0,The fit is perfect and the material is very nice. You guys need to have this same style in white though. Would definitely buy again.

5.0,I wear a small or medium. I'm 5'6&#34; and 124 lbs. got medium fits nicely. Looks great. It's a dark navy.
5.0,All BOC purses have stylish touches and wear well. I'm frequently complimented on them. Love BOC.
5.0,"It does well compacting your wallet and saving your butt from potential pain, it also has some cool hidden compartments to hide cash from would be curious home dwellers who need money for candy or cosmetics"
5.0,It was good I am on the smaller side and order a small cause the reviews said it was smaller but I should’ve order an x- small cause it was a little big so I had to do some hemming. But overall I liked it!
5.0,"I read all the reviews and decided to give them a chance I have no regrets. One persong said the straps with buckle did not adjust, MINE DO HAVE ADJUSTMENT!!! Every bit as comfortable as my Named Brand B's for 1/4 the cost and more style."
5.0,"Doesn’t make me sweat.  True to size, love the pattern.  Very Happy with this purchase."
5.0,Love these socks
5.0,Perfect Thank you
5.0,Looks good! Ready to try it at the beach soon!
5.0,"I love this set! I get so many compliments every time I have them in. They are by no means easy to get in and out, as is true with most tension pieces, but that’s also how you know it’s secure and not going anywhere. I wear them constantly and have had minimal tarnishing which I really appreciate. I will totally reorder these again when I need replacements!"
5.0,Nice art good construction. You'll get noticed with this one.
5.0,It was too cute
5.0,"Wallet has lasted me about a year so far. It is great value for money but it is started to come apart.<br /><br />No regrets, it was cheap and it carries with ease the 8 cards I carry around. May buy it again if I don't find something else I like."
5.0,I love it. I am just under 5 foot and it fit perfect after washing. Very cute!
5.0,An awesome buy!! Beautiful!!
5.0,"Love this. Absolutely perfect and comfortable. I live in dresses, I'm buying more!"

5.0,Great product and I love everything about it
5.0,"Great little bag.  I bought it for taking on walks with my dog.  It fits my Iphone 6 plus,  pepper spray, dog treats, small water bottle and so much more.  strap is perfect length for cross body and comfortable.  seems to be made well.  however since I am not a fan of Velcro I removed the Velcro on the flap and replaced with a magnetic snap.  making it perfect."

5.0,I love these earrings they are substantial and light weight.  I have long hair these are just the right size to stand out when u have long hair.
5.0,These are cute and the kids like the images. The wire in the nose is nice to form to their faces. The wire moves when washed in the washing machine so you have to shift it back in to place when out of the drier. The wire did poke through one of the masks but I was able to move it back inside the mask.
5.0,Perfect for the money you paid

With these I don't even think about that. They fit great and are pretty stretchy. 6'3&#34; with a 32 waste and got a large.
5.0,"I Love this! Better than I expected! Beautiful red, like Christmas red. So comfortable and fit is perfect! Back zipper close, elastic waist, ruffles from front, over shoulder and down the back, empire waist, side slit in the front to my mid thigh, & length without shoes brushes the top of my feet. Flow of the dress is fantastic! Doesn’t seem to wrinkle easily. Be cute and casual or dress it up!<br /><br />Measurements of dress: SIZE LARGE, 7” from the lowest dip in the front bust to the elastic waistband (empire waist), 15” across waistline not stretched and laying flat, 11” shoulder to shoulder outside edge minus the 3-1/4” width of the ruffle, 56” in length measured from top of shoulder down the back of the dress, 18” from underarm to underarm<br /><br />My measurements: I’m pear shaped and this dress helps to balance that uneven shape! 32” waist, 39” bust (padded bra to give me boobs ☺️), 42” hips and this dress didn’t reveal my big bottom at all!"

5.0,"This is a very cute hat that is perfect for the pool or the beach. It has a cute bright floral trim wrapped around it. I wear it with the trim tied to the back and the hat does an excellent job at keeping the sun out of my face. It is perfect for a day out on the beach and it has held up well after multiple uses.

5.0,"I have fallen in love with Illi leather goods!  While in the market for a purple handbag and accessories, I was about the settle for the Coach bucket but the violet was too bright.  This Illi brand is sure a pure shade of medium purple. It compliments whatever shade of purple I am wearing (and I only wear purple) without looking trendy or garish.  As a more mature woman on the go, this wristlet crossbody phone and ID case is perfect.  I can house my iPhone 5c and lip gloss in the front pocket, metro card and drivers license in the back pocket, and cash, credit card, and business cards in the sleek middle zip pouch!!! I will wear the crossbody strap daily as I zip around our nation's capitol and have stored the wristlet strap in my fine jewelry box to have handy when I need to make a quick change for a formal event!  Loves! This is my fourth Illi purchase in 6 months."
5.0,Very nice. Will make easy to size. Come with everything you need to make it the size you need

It fits good, is soft, the waistband has elastic and the color is perfect. It is slightly see through but I didn't care. Got many compliments while out in it. Loved wearing this for my baby bump pictures! I'll wear it casually as well."
5.0,"Upon looking at recent reviews, I am so glad that I purchased this jacket in a xxl for my husband. It fit him perfect. However, the zipper is on the wrong side to be a mans jacket. Other than that, its great. No complaints."

5.0,"This bag is large and sturdy. I use it for work and bought a sectioned divider for organization. I typically have all the normal purse items, medicine, makeup, business cards, etc, but I also pack two compact laptops, with electrical cords, note pad and clipboard and tightly rolled gym clothes (shirt and pants). I did not realize the bag was reversible at first and the first time I tried, it was a little stiff and hard to reverse, but became easier the more the tote was used. Then, what is cooler than party cats...Has been a conversation starter since I bought it. Awesome in style, versatility and practicality."

5.0,Very nice quality. Well made.

5.0,"These set tye dye pajamas are thick and suitable for chill or cold weather. It between mixed fleece and some type of cotton. Material after few washes still in good shape. For reference I'm 5'2 and 110 lbs, I got in medium size, to be honest the pant is too long, but I love highwaist and oversized apparel so it won't matter at all. I love how it fits me. If someone likes regular fits just go with regular normal size."
5.0,Absolutely love this dress! The fit was perfect and very flattering.
5.0,"I wear a size 16/18, and it's what I ordered. fits almost perfect. The chest area is padded however not too bulky. I love the feel of the material, also it isn't thin so no peek-a-boo action. I think the size is just right however if you're larger at top maybe a size up."

5.0,YES YES YES YES! I got it in blue and green and they are gorgeous! Tons of compliments every time! You will not regret this purchase!
5.0,"It is not easy to find a nice folding women's wallet. With the new chip technology in credit cards, I am using RFID blocking cards.  (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R1Z8UZO?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_126).  You keep your chip cards between the two RFID blocking cards to prevent them from being read.  Since the cards have to be stacked between the blocking cards to be protected, I needed a new folding wallet.  It is a nice sturdy wallet and it looks good.  I even had compliments (store checkers, etc.) on it.  I am very happy with it."
5.0,"Perfect! I love these earrings! They look great, are a nice size and weight, but not too heavy. My college age daughter wants a pair too! Very happy with this purchase!"

5.0,[[VIDEOID:cb8c1eb15a0ea1475e0e1e9d1bc539b4]] The dial. Wow. It's the best looking dial I've ever seen. Great value for money purchase. I've had this watch for a week now and the accuracy is spot on.  I didn't use a time grapher or anything like that. I just set the time by my phone. One week later is is the same time as my phone. Seiko is a awesome watch making company.
5.0,This bag looks even better in person! Color is a perfect neutral and the size roomy without being to large.
5.0,Neat gift nicely packed good variety of styles. Good value for the money

If you don’t like dresses too fitted size up one size otherwise stick with your regular size. Lace comes to knee and the slip is slightly shorter, just above ruffle at the bottom. Perfect mermaid fit. Colors are beautiful also. Purchased in Wine and Royal. I would get every color!"
5.0,"This is my ""dress"" watch and I'm loving it.  The dial is technically white, but with the sunburst, it almost has a slight Champaign tint to it - which is very nice.  I took off the bracelet and added a dark gray leather band which fits my style and look better.  No complaints so far and recommend it as a nicer dress watch over a diver or other."
5.0,Great variety for every outfit!
5.0,Everyday wear.
5.0,"...so let me start off by saying that I think this is a wonderful charity! This bag is so spacious, I use for my class books, and my purse!

5.0,"I’m a borderline M/L but I trusted the suggested size (M) and it fit perfect! Was looking for leggings to run and workout in that wouldn’t slip down with my phone in the pocket and these did the trick. Not quite as breathable as I would like, but that’s expected with the type of fabric necessary to stay in place with my phone in the pocket. 10/10 would recommend."

5.0,After a couple months riding with these I am very happy. They fit a little narrow (I have 2E feet). Relatively good grip. Cool enough for summer riding. Not uncomfortable to walk around in.
5.0,It really works. I wear this around the house when cleaning or just watching TV you really do sweat alot. Make sure to wear it more than once to really see a difference. 3×/week
5.0,I got this to replace my husbands wedding ring while it's getting fixed. It fix perfect and its smooth and he says uis just the right weight. He said that he might keep wearing it instead of his $600 wedding band

5.0,I will be honest that I was nervous ordering these at first because of the low price but I made the leap and order three of them for gifts. I am so not disappointed. They are beautiful and vibrant. Even the chain seems to be good quality. It took a while to arrive but they were well worth the wait. I will be much more open to ordering from this company again.
5.0,These pants are super comfortable and exactly what I like. They fit me perfectly which is saying something because it’s hard to find pants that aren’t too long on me.  I’m 5’2.

5.0,Very cute! They are Perfect soze of a dum dum lollipop 🍭.  My daughter absolutely loved them.
5.0,"I love the light color pink! Besides that, the jacket is super cute and comfortable and the stitching seems very well done. I enjoy that it has pulls to tighten around the upper waste and the legs if its a windier day than usual I see that being very helpful. Its a lighter jacket but also seems to hold enough heat where you don't feel terribly cold. The gold accents on the zipper and buttons is a nice touch as well and isn't a tight fit either which is nice. Overall I thoroughly enjoy the jacket and recommend giving it a shot."
5.0,"Awesome shirt!  soft fabric, and perfect for the gym."
5.0,"Really happy with these true to size pants! I did machine wash them in a garment back, and dried on ultra low.  They came out fine, but it is against the care instructions."
5.0,"I usually wear a small, but sized up to a medium because I was worried it would be too tight. I should have ordered my usual size, because it is a little more loose than I am used to. Oh well, I still wore it and loved it. It is well made and has festive colors for the holidays."

5.0,Feels good on my feet and ankles
5.0,I bought this pair for my son because the other pair I got from another seller was really bad quality. This one is like what you will get from the eye dr.

5.0,Love them my daughter was David Bowie for Rockstar day got a lot of compliments. definitely not as durable as I would like them but they are a novelty. daughters rough on stuff so needless to say that they didn't last 24 hours since she was on her knees doing dance moves.
5.0,MY GRANDSON RECEIVED A SIZE 4 IN U.S. BIG BOY SHOES THAT FIT GREAT.  I ORDERED ANOTHER PAIR THE SAME SIZE FROM THE SAME MAKER BUT THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY TOO SMALL.  I DIDN'T KNOW IF THE SIZE WAS WRONG ON THE 1ST PAIR OR 2ND PAIR.  I RETURNED THE SHOES THAT WERE TOO SMALL AND ORDERED A NEW PAIR FROM ANOTHER MANUFACTURER IN A LARGER SIZE (SIZE 5 U.S. BIG KIDS).  THE SIZE 5'S ARE A LITTLE TOO LARGE. EVIDENTLY THE SIZE 4 U.S. BIG KIDS SHOES RECEIVED THE 2ND ORDER WERE NOT TRULY SIZE 4.

5.0,"Hey Fellas ... This isn't the norm but I was having the worst time trying to find an XL size belt for a dress I had just ordered, and yes I did say ""dress"", so I started looking thru the XL belts for men.

5.0,"I bought these to wear while plowing snow with my 4 wheeler. I tried several regular cold weather gloves,after 30 minutes my fingers were frozen.

5.0,"I love these bags. This one is black/charcoal. It is large enough for my date book, checkbook, wallet, Kindle, cell phone, pens, lip sticks, etc. It is an eminently practical bag!"
5.0,I like the quality of these I just wish they had a reminder to take them out of the car and take them inside the store so I wouldn't forget them. LOL.
5.0,"Great quality, my husband loved the fit and feel of the insole. Love that you can wash these! I get him a new pair of this style slipper every year, from LL Bean to Macy’s- and these are by far his favorite pair yet!"
5.0,"The bag is super cute, however it’s more canvas than leather.  Love it though, very roomy."
5.0,The fabric was beyond my expectations and the color was very vibrant pop !
5.0,"Came unscuffed looking fresh as can be. Nice shades, comfy, clear lense, look good. And definitely worth the price they are asking."
5.0,comfortable for work &#60;3
5.0,Ended up getting 6 pair for the price of 3!  Thanks so much.
5.0,Yes my husband loves this shirt. The style and the fit.
5.0,"I like this product, I didn’t realize I should have ordered a size smaller.  I like being able to order a short size, glad for the source."
5.0,Me en Cato
5.0,Love these sunglasses. Lightweight not too dark. Great for the money.
5.0,Great hat wish I could of got 1 size bigger
5.0,"I love the embroidered flower on the shirt. I'm usually M or L US size so I ordered XXL. :D It was a bit too large on me around the shoulder L would fit more. The length of the shirt went up to my thigh. That's normal for me since I am of short statue. But surprisingly the sleeves was not too long and neck line doesn't droop low. My advice is to get a size or two up. The only thing that bugs me is there is no tag on the back so you can't tell which is front or back and when you first get it there is a really bad chemical smell so do wash your new clothes before wearing them and put them under the sun! The material feels weird to my touch when I first got it. It's 90% polyester and 10% spandex. When I wore it though, it's really warm. It's not very thin material. It's quite decent for cheap clothe."
5.0,Nice sox
5.0,"Lovely ring for baby, very sweet."
5.0,made a perfect stocking stuffer for the groom-to-be
5.0,"kept, but a little tacky style with flower print"
5.0,Minus the tiny safety piece they put so the adjuster doesn’t get pushed in before opening it is perfect!!!!  Ruined a very good set of tweezers lol.  My brother loves this movie and he likes pocket watches and it didn’t break the bank. Came in a cute little box and everything I love how the flip thing is a cut out of the Jack Skeleton scene. It was perfect!!!
5.0,"Just as most people have stated, the bag is great - fits the bill for the free item on spirit and it does fit a lot of stuff! The only thing I don't like about the bag is that there is only one strap to it and it's quite short, so it hangs at an awkward place on the body and becomes very heavy.<br /><br />Also, for those who are worried about flying it on spirit, I wanted to describe my experience: I packed mine nice and full and before the gate opened, a Spirit staff member announced that we could come and show our luggage and she would tell us whether or not we needed to check it... if we did it before the gates opened it would only be $60 versus it being $100 after the gates opened. I was worried, so I brought it over to her and it wasn't a problem at all, the size was totally acceptable. On the plane, it fits right under the seat in front of you, it really is a great bag."
5.0,"Super comfy and cute, my daughter loves dinosaurs she loves it."
5.0,"Queda muy bonito, muy cómodo para mis entrenamientos en el gym,"
5.0,"Love it so far. With all the pay apps, we don't need so many cards anyway, but this makes it easy. Nice design and fits nicely in the pocket.  A bit sturdier than leather."
5.0,"This bracelet is incredible, I am embarrassed by all the compliments. I live in LA and I am worried I will get robbed because everyone thinks it is an AP. Lol, superb product. I love it."
5.0,"Wore for the first time while hiking. My head and ears stayed so warm. Stayed in place, never had to adjust. Super cute, too."
5.0,Honestly these look hella cool. It really is worth a buy. Really makes my outfit look cool. 10/10
5.0,"Got it for my wife. She is 5'4"" 116 lbs. Size: Small. Nice fit, can't keep my hands off."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:379f836145f080edfeb911ed50faa8a7]] Update stone fell out after a month. Though im no longer getting married so maybe is was a sign. I want to buy it agian for myself but they raised the price abd idk if i w3aba risk loosing another gem<br /><br />My engagement/wedding ring. I LOVE IT. Beautiful and well priced. Company makes great jewelry at a great price. Very honorable in their craft.
5.0,Sizing and quality is perfect!! I never have to worry about not having a spare.
5.0,"Oh my goodness, this boot is ADORABLE!! Fits me perfect. I wear a size 8 and I ordered a size 8. I have wide feet also, and I have plenty of room to wear a thick sock. I just wonder I can scotch guard them? I do not want to ruin them. I love them!!! Inside is soooo soft."
5.0,These are very durable socks! Love the rubber dots to prevent slipping.  The color keeps even after many times in the wash!
5.0,Part for Halloween Costume
5.0,"It is a very nice purse.  I love the quality of feel of it.  Looks very elegant.  Love the phone charger that comes with it.  It is not bulky.  Very roomy for a small purse.  I can put my wallet, samsung mega phone and what makeup I need to carry with me."
5.0,"This shirt is soft, comfortable and works well with a skirt or leggings."
5.0,Great quality..Too long though..Daughter loves it
5.0,Very sturdy and cute very pleased
5.0,use it on my omega speedmaster .. works real good .. James bond 007
5.0,I loved the fit! The dark blue is beautiful and the lace arms were a perfect fit. It made me feel so elegant and I got lots of complements on it! Would definitely buy from this company again!
5.0,"wear it all the time, my main night shirt"
5.0,It is a gift so I do not have a answer at this time
5.0,"I actually purchased this shoe for a toddler size doll, it fits well and looks cute on his feet. Not sure if this comment helps for someone buying this shoe for a real baby, but I've been pleased with this purchase."
5.0,The rings are pretty long which is good for occasional swelling or pain that might occur
5.0,This band is easily fastened and easily adjusted. The cold is a rich blue and the band is made very well.
5.0,"I bought a pair of rain shoe covers a while back, but they ripped on me after a few wears. Although  I was upset and considered getting rain boots right after that, rain shoe covers just made more sense with my lifestyle since they are much more portable. I hate the thought of carrying around two pairs of shoes on rainy days! All that said, I decided to search for a stronger pair this time around and just purchased this set recently. So far, I’m impressed with the quality. The material is definitely much thicker than the previous ones I had and I like the height. The waterproof bag is a nice addition and looks like it would be helpful for huge rain storms should you need it."
5.0,Super cute and comfortable! I get compliments every time I wear these!
5.0,It's beautiful and my daughter loved it!!

5.0,"These are just as described but take quite awhile for shipping. I had purchased several as gifts but they didn't get here in time for me to take to recipients.  When they did come, they were very nice.  Just had to ship them!"
5.0,"My husband loves his new ring. He wore the black one today to work. We stepped on it and pulled on it last night. The silver looks unique. It appears that the silver is &#34;sprayed&#34; onto the ring. I'm going to wear it as a thumb ring and see how the color holds up. Nice quality. Very pleased with shipping/delivery. Came neatly packaged.<br /><br />This item was purchased at a reduced rate for my unbiased opinion. However, I would recommend it to my family and friends. I've ordered others using Amazon, but I believe this may be the best purchased. Thank you."
5.0,My husband loves this xl speidel twist a flex watch band. He has larger wrists this gives him plenty of room and no pinching! Very easy to install.
5.0,Did not like the extra long tie. Otherwise loved the style and material.
5.0,What a great asset to have. These poles are so light weight. I wish I had them on my hike of Kilimanjaro! These poles provided excellent stability on my hikes with my sons scout troop. I also like how easily they pack in my bag. Super convenient!<br />I would recommend these for adults and kids. Excellent Christmas gift idea. Thank you for a great product!
5.0,My daughter loves the show and loves this pajama even more. It was a great price and a great fit. Looking for another one to buy again.
5.0,The size and the ease from my ears when wearing a mask at work is the biggest thing for me. The buttons on the side takes the pressure off my ears from wearing my glasses and goggles. I get compliments when At Work.
5.0,"Love this dress.  I’m 5’2, 160 lbs and carry most my weight in my tummy.  The extra large is not clingy and fit perfectly. I’ve recieved many compliments and just ordered another color 💃"
5.0,Very pretty. Smaller in diameter than I envisioned but I'm not going to take any points off for my ill-visions.

5.0,"It does come small, as others have said. But you can easily bend it to make it bigger."
5.0,As far as I know they fit great because I haven't heard anything from the person I gifted with them.
5.0,Bought these for my husband and I to wear on Christmas with my family. Christmas Vacation is one of our favorite Christmas movie and we all watch it each year. For the price the quality was good. Honestly they are more of a one time wear item so I am very happy with what I paid for them.
5.0,"Very cute stitch key chain.  I gave it to someone as a gift, and they loved it."
5.0,I definitely had to size up but this bathing suit is adorable! Too bad i got it at the end of the summer but just means I'll have something to look forward to next year! :)
5.0,"Tuff, and authentic"
5.0,My son loved it. It was a crowd fav at the party.
5.0,Great item! Makes planning fantasy football a lot easier~!

5.0,"Since I ride a small cycle and have to wear a helmet, these masks are perfect for me. They fit perfectly and allow me to breathe while I am riding. I have learned to coordinate them with my wardrobe, so I am truly happy with these masks. Strongly considering ordering more, because these are by far my favorite masks and I feel secure when I wear them. Thank you for this."
5.0,I like it. It's very warm.
5.0,The dress was actually really nice and material was good. I ordered a 2Xl one size bigger just i case.  It was was long I am short 5'0 but got compliments on the actual dress.
5.0,Love the distressed look of this jean shorts. I have the Small and it fits perfectly. Good quality for the price
5.0,"This is an amazing piece of art.  It is at once accessible and simultaneously repellent.  The craft is top notch, design is sublime and the overall feel is slightly creepy, which is a wonderful thing.  This is my favorite of the series."
5.0,I bought these for my 10 month old to wear while we watched monster trucks race. It was very very loud and he was able to fall asleep while wearing them.
5.0,This looks great!  I get compliments every time I wear it. Warm as well.
5.0,"These stockings/ socks are for my teenager daughter.  They are adorable and they have held up through being worn and washed several times.  The color stays true, and although it is in the red family, it didn't fade or run much (still, don't wash them with your whites. ) no shrinkage and no pilling.  Overall a great pair!"
5.0,very elegant and smart
5.0,I purchased two style. The AppleJack (ivory) I was so disappointed.. The hat was very sqaure and boxy looking. It felt cheaply made and the sizing was off. The back of the hat came down to the very bottom of my neck. Needless to say I returned it immediately. The other style was Herringbone (BLK) I couldn't believe it was from the same company. It had a light weight quilted lining inside the cap for extra warmth unlike the applejack. The fit was PERFECT. It is such a well constructed and fitting hat I wish I could duplicate it and just change the color. Giving it a 5 star to represent the good hat. Size was just right for me too.
5.0,Beautiful item. Fit perfectly on Pandora bracelet!
5.0,"I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. Wore it to school that day and it is extra special to her because a portion of the price goes to charity. This is really a cool choker. I had forgotten all about onyx till I went looking for something, anything she would wear. Teens are hard to please. This is perfect"
5.0,It's great and I love it
5.0,"Liked the shirt, good quality!"
5.0,Great graphics.
5.0,I love this purse. It was a little bigger then what I expected but it's perfect. I have a newborn and it could be used as a small diaper bag for sure like other reviews have said.
5.0,My ring came fast and it's perfect! Just like in the photos. It's fun and feminine and I love it.
5.0,"These are really nice; they looked really good, and came pretty decorative pouch.  Overall an excellent choice for Christmas gift-giving."
5.0,Very pleased with the scarf. The colors are vibrant and it is VERY soft! It will definately be able to keep me warm during the cold winters in Michigan. I highly recommend and would make for a wonderful gift!
5.0,"I am really enjoying wearing this anklet.  The double chain makes it look different from regular anklets, plus you get some sparkle too.  I have a smaller size ankle and it fits well."
5.0,Definitely will be buying more colors! I love this dress so much. I was a little anxious when I took it out as it looked so small  but it definitely stretched and wasn't too tight. Super cute to dress up or down
5.0,"Like the style, colors and great elasticity."
5.0,"These are the B.E.S.T leggings I've ever invested money into. They are super comfortable, form fitting and long. I'm 5'9&#34; and around 220Ibs. I bought the XL and they fit perfectly. Plus, they aren't see through. The pockets are a nice touch also."
5.0,Got this for the wife.  Also got her an open back shirt to wear.  She had it on now and I love it!  In fact it is so hot I can't keep my *$&#@^!JDN:#Y*&#u98o4sKEDh
5.0,Best hat for the money in this style out there!
5.0,A little big but loved it
5.0,new pair in my collection....
5.0,This brand of socks is awesome! They are so much thicker than most athletic socks. I find them way better than the name brand I have purchased in the past. Great buy for the cost.
5.0,My son loves his wallet
5.0,"Loved the case, made a nice presentation. The bracelet is beautiful. It is slightly loose around my wrist, mainly since I have thin wrists. Wish it was a tad shorter since I'm on the very first ring and it can't go tighter. Other than that I love it, even prettier in person!"
5.0,"I have a friend who collects cuff and chain earrings and I got them for her for Christmas and she loves them, mission accomplished! The only downside is the backs are those cheapy clear gel backs, not metal, but whatevs."
5.0,Big fan of Linies Shandys and Sunset Wheat so this T-shirt made sense.  True to size material is soft.
5.0,"Love the way it looks, have gotten many compliments!"
5.0,These are very pretty. They acre a bit bigger than small studs. I will wear them.

5.0,Great beach hat!
5.0,This came fast and I know I would have FUN wearing it anytime.

5.0,"Its smaller than the large ovel or round one, I like that. I love the color and i've gotten lots of compliment on it. Itssweet and femmine."
5.0,My son loves this sweater good material and warm too and fit is actual to size

5.0,Just as good as the original!
5.0,"Love it! The quality and fit is amazing, especially for the price!"
5.0,"Not sure if these were going to be of quality or not for the price. But, they are just what I was looking for! I am ordering another set."
5.0,"Great fit, kind of flimsy (would not survive being crushed), but lovely aesthetic, especially at the price point. A go-to accessory, for sure."
5.0,"They were perfect for a lobster bake, love the lobster claw wave!"
5.0,"The scarf lays a little flat, and it's made of very thin fabric, but I like it, though it's very delicate."
5.0,These are my favorite festival sunglasses
5.0,"Wow, i totally love this dress! It actually feels like a good quality and fits really good on me. Super cute and so far dont have any regrets in buying this dress. I am 5,6 1/2 and fit me a little below my knee just perfect 💗"
5.0,This fitted my Oakley M Frames that I've had for years.  Parts fitted perfectly!  Very happy with quality and time of shipping.  Great product for a great price!  Would recommend.  A++ seller.
5.0,for me the size is was too big but its a great product.
5.0,"I am very pleased with these glasses.  They are a perfect fit for my vision, and very comfortable. I can wear them all day with no issue.  The blue is cute."
5.0,They are just like the pic not too big
5.0,"Great and as described,  fast shipping too!"
5.0,This is my second pair of these pants.  They look and feel so soft.  Very thick and excellent for me to workout in. They are not compression pants but they fit as if they are.  I plan on ordering more pairs of these in the future.
5.0,These are great slippers.  you can wear them outside if you need to.
5.0,These underwear feel great but they run an entire size small. So if you normally buy large get an xl.
5.0,Dope mask I’m definitely rocking this for Halloween
5.0,It’s sturdy and the pictures are exactly like the product
5.0,"The dress is beautiful, classy, and comfortable."
5.0,I love the earrings
5.0,nice looking and able to read now in bright sunlight
5.0,"My wife has several of these in various colors and she loves them. The last order we made of this particular belt though, it seems the buckle was a little on the weak side where it clips together. I tried to modify it a little with a pair of pliers, and may need a little more tweaking."
5.0,Perfect fit for my 10 year old boy. Also very comfy
5.0,I love these. I never feel the heat through them and always get a good grip.
5.0,"This dress was everything i expected. True to fit, good material and quick delivery.."
5.0,"Light weight, beautifully made with a great touch."
5.0,Tons of pockets and doesn't hurt my back.  I have even had compliments about it!
5.0,"I've read the reviews and some said that it's not true to size, a bit smaller to be specific.  I'm size 6 and I ordered size 6 but it fits very  well.  This pair of crocs wedge is very stylish but very comfortable.  I wear it when I go to the mall and my feet never get tired.  It looks good in a dress, jeans, romper or whatever you wear.  I'm happy with my purchase."
5.0,"These are nice quality! Super comfy and fit my toddler perfect, definitely true to size. They seem like they will hold up well and if they get dirty I think it will be absolutely fine to toss them in the washing machine."
5.0,best  reading glasses I've had.
5.0,Always a hit!
5.0,"I really like these. Lightweight, simple, and colorful. I’ve worn them several times with no issue."
5.0,"Low price, nice looks."
5.0,I receive many compliments 🙂
5.0,It looks amazing! I wish all swimsuits fit this well i honestly think this type of swimsuit would look good on just about anybody! It was a bit cheeky so if you dont want that try ordering a size up instead of your actual size
5.0,It looks and feels great.  I don't have the greatest figure but this suit makes me feel and look pretty nice for an old lady of 71. lol
5.0,Cute and sturdy. Great for around the house.
5.0,great quality! inside the hat is a lace that allows you to fit the size of your head! color exactly as in the photo - light pink!<br />I recommend!
5.0,this jumpsuit was a bday gift for my niece she absolutely loved it fit her well it was super comfy she loved the material.. it looks denim but its not its stretchy material.. highly recommend it for any age any body size ..
5.0,"I love this shirt! It does fit a little big. I’m usually an xl and sometimes a large, depending on the type of shirts. I got the large to “size down” and I could have fit perfectly in a medium. I’m 195lbs 5’2” 36D. If you’re around my size, the large will fit beautifully, but a medium would be perfect! My breasts don’t really fill it in so it kinda bunches up from the back side."
5.0,"This makes a great low-profile no-show belt for adults -- so long as you wear a smaller size in adult clothing. No-show belts for adults usually run about $15-25 and they are made of the same material as this one by CTM. The CTM belt price is much better. Moreover, I think the 1&#34; width of the CTM belt is ideal. No-show adult belts are either 3/4&#34; (too thin), 1-1/2&#34; (too wide) or 1-1/4.  I find the 1&#34; and 1-1/4&#34; width belts to work the best as they are the most comfortable and versatile. The buckle on this CTM belts is also pretty nice -- much nicer than the utilitarian plastic buckles on the no-show belts. While the buckle is not meant to show with no-show belts, sometimes with a shorter top it does.<br /><br />The only issue with using this as a no-show belt is that the sizing is limited for adults. I wear a women's size 8 in pants and this fits comfortably, with even a little room to spare. This might be OK for you if you are a size 10. But this would be too small for anyone size 12 or up.<br /><br />I like this so much as a no-show belt that I bought it in both black and beige."
5.0,Really cute and easy to attach
5.0,This is a prefect gift. It is so amazing. Loved it
5.0,A little bigger than I thought my fault I read so may product details that day. I have gotten several compliments on them and have been asked where I got them.
5.0,Bought these for my wife whose a nurse and on her feet for her 12 hours work days... and she absolutely loves them. No achy sore feet and legs at the end of her shift.
5.0,"Excellent fit, and very comfortable. Nice stretch so you don't have to worry about size. Definitely recommend!!"
5.0,Looks good fits nice
5.0,Love it! Perfect for my husband who likes to bring lots to eat at work!
5.0,"This hat was better than expected! The quality of this hat exceeded my expectation. I bought the hat for my brother, who is currently in law enforcement. He complimented on the way it fit and the quality in which it held up after being washed and weathered. I would highly recommend this product!"
5.0,Fits Great!!
5.0,The item came on time as expedted.
5.0,We used these for a Girl Scout World Thinking Day event as SWAPS. They were a great size and so cute! I’ve repurposed the extras into necklaces! These are a nice large size!
5.0,Got as gift for daughter.  They fit well.
5.0,"My daughter used it as a Halloween costume, and now wears it as pajamas and around the house because...well, teenagers are weird... lol. She has loved it. Got my money's worth out of it! Good quality!"
5.0,Fantastic over the lens alternative. Wish there was a a more friendly double bar version (see photos) but it works all the same and it works pretty well.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend the slip on version for extra large double bar lenses however.
5.0,"I wear and 8.5 (US) in women’s shoes, and I ordered a 9 (in tan) in these. They fit perfectly. A bit big around the ankle like others have mentioned, but it doesn’t ruin the look of these booties in my opinion. They’re adorable!"
5.0,Perfect fit and apeal and all!!!!! Shipping on time and quick
5.0,Warm and work well for using the phone while wearing.
5.0,"Attractive and comfortable for goggles. The hinges are nice and tight so they are easy to prop on my head when not in use. They do mess with peripheral vision but any goggles would. You get used to acting like an owl (turning your head to focus .) They absolutely do  fog up, also unavoidable. I’ve been through a few goggles for my job as a nurse and these are the best I’ve found and I get zero comments on them which tells me they look like normal glasses!"
5.0,Love the pants.  The material isn't thin so I can bend and stretch at the gym without showing everyone my butt cheeks or what color my undies are.
5.0,Purchased this product for Mom for Christmas. She loved it! Nice and looks heavy.
5.0,I ordered these shoes for my son in Brown and he loves them.  They are comfortable and nice looking.
5.0,"Nicely made linen guayavera, though I'm not wild about the stiffening material sewn into the collar. Doesn't make it uncomfortable to wear, though."
5.0,These leggings are so soft and they are so comfortable. The only thing I did notice is that they run a smidge smaller but other than that they are fabulous. Will be ordering more
5.0,Love how it looks
5.0,"Me encantaron, fáciles de poner y me encanta la variedad"
5.0,I purchased this necklace for a gift for my close friend.  I love it so much I am going to order one for myself.  It's absolutely gorgeous!  It is not too large but a perfect size that shows the beauty of the inlay and the sterling silver.  Just beautiful!  Love it!!!
5.0,Super rad detail.
5.0,Exceeded expectations! Bought this for my son who is 17 and he absolutely loves it! Very sturdy!
5.0,Love it....
5.0,"These socks are awesome.  I wish they cost a little less; however, they are worth it.  And so fun and snappy!"
5.0,Lots of compliments. Reasonably priced!
5.0,Great costume and it shipped fast.  Thank you!
5.0,"This works amazingly well.  I have it set to beep first then, If I ignore, I will get a vibration, this is my last warning to wake up or else..lastly the zaps begin.  I wear it on the inside of my risk which is much more sensitive.  95% of the time once I hear the first beep I’m immediately up, occasionally I’ll need the vibration, but rarely do I get shocked.  It’s a powerful tool with lots of options."
5.0,A mi hermana le agradaron 👍
5.0,I like the material. Very light and soft. I have a little bit of a tummy after my second child and this shirt makes me feel great. It conceals my tummy and it just very comfortable.

5.0,"The slippers are for my wife and i ,exactly what the description and reviews fortold.<br />They are the best slippers that we owned in our 89 years on this planet.<br />very warm in the winter as well."

5.0,"I have owned one of these wallets for about 2 years now. It is the perfect wallet. Before this I had the phone case that holds cards and this is way better. It holds a bunch of card. I have 8-10 in there at all times and you can't ever feel it in your pocket. You can easily move it to your front pocket if you feel the need, or even stuff in you gym shorts for a quick trip to the store for more ice cream. The colors don't fade. The money band on the back is great for holding some cash or receipts and it never loses it grip. If you are a firefighter, or have one in the family, or think it would be cool to own this, buy it! You won't be disappointed.It's made from a fire hose and will last forever."
5.0,My husband loves this wallet. I thought he would think it was dingy but he loves the weight reminding him he HAS the wallet in his pocket. Has used it continuously for two months usually he loses his wallet by then lol. Great for the price!

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:210bc88df8022c70c4f33a4ba8ce5a79]] I used these goggles at an indoor pool as the current weather does not permit outside swimming. Tinted lenses would be great for blocking the sun and only lightly darkens vision so can still be worn inside. Silicone outline is comfortable and seals out water well. Straps are easy to adjust, even my daughter could change the size to fit her head. Kiddos all tried it out and love them. I received this product during a promotion in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."

5.0,"I got a small and it fits amazingly. I'm a bit on the shorter side, 5'1, 115 lbs, so it's a little longer than I would like; however, it shouldn't be an issue and if it is can be easily fixed by either wearing heels or hemming it."
5.0,Wish this fully opened down the shoulder just sides. Not able to use for X-rays at<br />Doctors office without removing.

5.0,I love this dress! I bought a similar one with long sleeves as well and while I love this one. I wish the bottom had a little more “flow”. The skirt part of this one was sort of straight so there wasn’t as much flow to it. Still going to be a staple dress when school resumes in the fall.

5.0,I get many compliments on this t-shirt from those who know who Tobuscus actually is.  This shirt has many colors to choose from so was hard to choose!  Have not had problems with the shirt shrinking too much.  It did a little but didn't really change the size.

5.0,"I highly recommend this as a gift for birthdays, holidays, etc... I gave it to all my girlfriends this year and they all loved them.  If it is someone whom you want to spend more on then just fill up the bag with extra stuff!  Also, if you just purchase 1 it is $35 but when I purchased 4 at a time the price dropped to $23.  The main thing is that only $20 goes to the WFP so anything more you pay is for advertising (I think)."
5.0,Very nice quality jacket<br />It’s a gift so the fit at this time is unknown
5.0,been looking for this argyleculture sweater since 2005 when i saw it on Tyson Beckford in a VIBE magazine ad.  finally found it on amazon for 18 bucks.  love it!!!

5.0,"Love this belt.  I wear it with not only my jeans, but with dresses.  Keeps my clothes in place and my pants from gaping in the back!"
5.0,"Ok love this item - good quality and stylish - fits well - i size down in this brand - normally medium in everything else but small in this brand by far - so get a size smaller then you would normally think.  jewel tones in this brand are deep rich and make the item more luxurious then price tag.  this is more of an outside item - in the mirror i would feel funny wearing it around the house.  this is like a very stylish fleece jacket - fleece jacket with pop.  super for window shop on fall day and when you would layer and where a fleece but want to look cute and not bulky boy.  i needed  more of a shacket type piece to where in the house - where i spend 90pct time so not sure its right for me but thinking how i cant style it to work and not have my husband keep saying ""you going somewhere"".  this is an excellent super cute item i am TRYING to find a reason to justify keeping  i loved the item so much in the pics i thought i could use it more for my indoor house craft type life but not sure if it works.  recommended buy but purchase as an outdoor fleece with pop item not shacket over shirt inside thing."

5.0,"I wish I had've ordered one size up, the shirt still fits well just would've preferred a baggier fit The shirt does not come already assembled like the display it will come open down the middle which allows you to custom build it across your chest area to your liking so be prepared to put some holes in the shirt where you want it fit around the button. Once assembled the shirt looks just like the picture. The material is decent and for the price I would order again."

5.0,Read the reviews and decided to order just a tad larger.  Worked out well since my son had to at some pretty heavy duty socks with them.  They survived the whole weekend...5 mile hike and all.  My son did remark that they have some weight to them.  So may be something to keep in mind.
5.0,"These leggings are amazing! They feel very soft, very smooth, suck in your tummy very well too. If you’ve recently tried the brand name (VS) leggings in their new soft material, these are pretty much the same! I will definitely be buying more!"

5.0,Pretty bug and heavy
5.0,"OMG I LOVE IT! Seriously tho. I've been fighting with finding the right setting for my daith piercing, and it's been a headache. Most of the jewelry on the market is just a single piece that you have to twist and deform to get in while holding pliers to your head. Don't get me wrong, there are some great pieces that I've found, but it makes changing out my faith jewelry something I can only do every now and then. This piece changes all of that. It has a hinge and snap so it literally just goes into place like a regular earring.  Maybe these have been around a while. I don't know. But, I've been looking and this is among the first few like this that I've bought.<br />And I love it.<br /><br />The color is perfect. and it'd fit either side well. The size is exactly right and overall the product is as described."
5.0,I got this to hang on my handbag as a remembrance of my cat that died last year. It is a great size that really shows.  I have the red and the purple. The bag must have a chain to clip it on to though . I would highly recommend it.
5.0,Nice casual shirt. Washes well  Damp dry in dryer then hung to complete drying. I hang dry most of clothes to preserve life of item and most important in winter to add moisture to our dry air.  I ordered 3 more because he likes them so well. Received the same quality shirts with second order.
5.0,"Those are the instructions on the Amazon page. I don't know if that is what they discovered after sizing them or if many of us are going to wear thick socks. I ordered one size up, with thick socks... they fit perfect.<br /><br />Warm, water resistant. They look great. The soles are solid. The material is light weight so they are not clunky. Very comfortable.<br /><br />I have not had a chance to take them on slick surfaces yet. It will be interesting to see how durable they are, but from the feel they seem solid.<br /><br />Between these or my old Colombia boots, I'll take these."
5.0,"Love, love this dress! I purchased ALL COLORS and waiting on the Large size in white to purchase it. Wore the blue (light/blue) to church and eyes were on me. One sister asked that I ordered the same color for her.<br /><br />Notify me when the White Large is available.<br /><br />Dr. Myers"
5.0,A little bigger than expected but nice
5.0,High quality very shiny. They were a little too big for me and also kinda heavy but I did like them though.
5.0,work just as good as the name brand but at more than half the cost.
5.0,I didn’t think my Fupa was going to stick out like that but hey I was still feeling myself
5.0,Cheap shiny material.  I don’t know anybody who would wear it. Not sweater or sweatshirt material.  Returned it.
5.0,"The ring is gorgeous and fits perfectly. I even got little pictures of some of the members. Thank you, will definitely buy from them again. Perfect"
5.0,Such a great deal!

5.0,"I loved this cape, the material is a good quality and it is a thick and it has a shine to it in which I love. The only thing I don't like about it, its to small, but I'm definitely sending it back for a larger size. I wear a medium but its to small so you would have to go to the next size."
5.0,Love the fit and the colors! Super cute
5.0,"This is my 3rd of these scarves. I buy them, I loose them and I buy them again. Best scarf EVER. (it's a little scratchy at first but that goes away fast, just FYI)"

5.0,"I absolutely LOVE my slippers (adjustable). They are nice and roomy. Most adjustable slippers don't have a long enough ""flap"" for the velcro to catch for those of us who struggle with occasional swollen foot/feet...but the MukLuks have a generous flap with strong velcro. I could've even ordered 1/2 size down or so, but I'm pleased. The very small raised area to prevent heel from sliding out is an added bonus you just don't find in other slide slippers."
5.0,Got these for texting and reading texts at softball games.  Work great.
5.0,"Really, really happy with this suit. Got lots of compliments. Withstood a bunch of active swimming and the tie never came off even jumping off a rope swing! It runs a little small. I'm 5'4, 148, and wear a size 6-8 and in a large it was a little tight. But I loved the color and the suit!"
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful set!  I have received so many compliments on this set. So sparkly and it doesn't turn my fingers green either.  I usually can't wear fake jewelry, but this set I have no problems with."
5.0,"The fabric felt great, colors were beautiful, and I so wanted to like them but they felt a little to snug/tight in the legs and a tad to cheeky for my taste.  I am 5'6"" and weigh around 130# and I ordered a M."
5.0,Very pretty 🤩
5.0,"I am glad I bought this band, it was a good fit for me with versa lite."
5.0,Love it. Its excellent.
5.0,unique and beautiful
5.0,Great value. Can see as well as my prescription progressive glasses.
5.0,It's a nice dress in all but it runs small
5.0,"These are great. The lens design is only slightly disorienting as the center of lens is ""optically neutral"" that is to say it only has color and no noticeable distortion. All the refraction happens on the edge which allows you to walk around fairly unhindered, all be it with tunnel vision. Very nice construction and very comfortable."
5.0,Beautiful dress. I love the fit. Quality material . Looks just like the picture on person.
5.0,Nice Key fob!! Great quality I love this product... Would buy again.
5.0,"This is an adorable set! I alway wash all clothing before wearing  this was no exception, laundry bag on delicate. Item came out perfect. The stitching and seams on it are well done. The color is true to what you see. It is soft and fits quite well. Very elegant looking and a super hit with the hubby. Based on other reviews, I went with my usual size I am normally a s/m so I ordered the small and it fits perfect. 5.5 128lbs chest 36B. If you are large in the chest area you may wish to allow for that. I would  recommend this cute little  number for lounging in or the romantic evening.<br />Delivered quickly and well packaged."
5.0,I bought this for my husband for Father's Day and gifted it to him early. He absolutely loves it! Great fit and looks slick!
5.0,Chakra beauty
5.0,Couldn’t ask for a better hoodie
5.0,Very nice Bama tote bag. Great for taking to a game or anytime. I highly recommend it. Gets an A+.
5.0,Arrived right on time and fit very well
5.0,my daughter loves it
5.0,"This sweater is very soft and comfortable and it fits the way I like it! I ordered a medium and I'm 5'2"", 145lbs. Made of good quality materials that stood their first wash really well. I love the ombre design! It's a ""hairy"" kind of knit looking up close (see picture). I'm wearing it with a mid-rise jeans pants and as you can see I didn't have any issues with belly showing up or anything like that."
5.0,Awesome sauce once i had it tailored :)
5.0,Helps with my edema. Fits great.
5.0,GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY YOU GET SO MANY ITEMS.
5.0,Great fit and super comfortable!
5.0,"I like it, the band is not as substantial as I would have preferred, but the watch itself is quite striking."
5.0,Perfect for the event
5.0,Good quality and easy to use.
5.0,Dress was absolutely beautiful when I received it but it was just too big. I will eventually order a smaller size once I lose the required weight ordered by my Endocrinologist (I am a Diabetic)
5.0,It’s comfortable and convenient at the same time and the mask is light and breathable at the same time.
5.0,I like it ;)
5.0,"The gift came on time, fit perfectly and seemed to be good quality."
5.0,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend because I hated his last ""murse"" as I call it. I chose this one because it is masculine looking. I am happy to report he loves it. The feature that sold me was the zipper to the main compartment under the main flap."
5.0,These are just as described. Super soft and comfortable. I like the longer length. I wear them to walk in and also under dresses. I love that they have deep secure pockets.
5.0,Daughter loved them. They have withstood 3 years and look as good as the day they arivved. They have even been in the washing machine. Plenty of room to grow but never seemed to large
5.0,Absolutely love this cap!! I have ordered many off of Amazon and had to send them back because they did not fit right. This one is perfect. I cannot wait to order more!! Thank you!!!💜
5.0,Good one for the price
5.0,These are great- very warm abd perfect size for my 3 year old and her hands stayed warm in the playground.
5.0,"Beautiful dress! Great fit. I’m 5’6, 145 lbs, 34 DD and a large fits a bit loose (which I prefer)."
5.0,"Very pretty! Fit me perfectly! But,I have small wrists,its not a one size bracelet!"
5.0,These glasses are so comfortable and light. I'm very happy with my purchase.
5.0,great headband inspired my whole costume. thanks!!
5.0,"This dress is much nicer than what I expected since I’m leery of buying clothes online. The top is VERY form fitting, I’m a 32c so it’s not even like I’m big up top. It works for me but some people might have a problem with that. I ordered a medium and I’m 5’9” and the dress hits just above my feet."
5.0,Awesome watch. Very unique.
5.0,Gorgeous!!!!!!
5.0,Loved it. Good quality.
5.0,Looks so cute on my son!!!
5.0,Love it! The quality is very good!
5.0,The belt works great.  It is even easier to use than the other ratchet belt I bought from another vendor.  I'm tired of traditional belts that get worn and frayed from the tradition tongue through hole fastener.  I have a 34&#34; waist and the size to 34&#34; fits perfectly without trimming.
5.0,Love it on my husband.  Very stylish for the price and warm.
5.0,"After washing 5 times, the color is still vibrant and the fit perfect! I love these pajamas!"
5.0,"More than expected, te fabric is beautiful and fits perfect"
5.0,Adorable and flattering. I have issues with being worried about my belly but this dress fans out.
5.0,it fits great thanks
5.0,"I was skeptical since this product had no reviews, but the others had such low ratings I figured there was no harm in going for a more unknown brand.<br /><br />Much higher quality than most of the ones on the market. Smaller teeth in the zippers gives it a more secure feel and long enough to fit navy issue aviator boots. Great price and still working so far."
5.0,A gift for our church musician
5.0,Loved it. Great to hide the belly bulge
5.0,"Got these for my babe, she's awesome and the sunglasses are also awesome. They look great. So, overall, thumbs up."
5.0,I love the color and they fit perfectly.  They also stretch and don't pinch the skin.
5.0,Absolutely beautiful and so well made
5.0,it's very convenient and I like being able to text in a more secure way
5.0,"some people said it's smaller than described but i got an XL and true to any other brand of XL clothing that i buy. i wear this at least once a week, wash weekly and no fading, no fabric pilling, no fabric runs, nothing bad over the 6+ months of owning. so happy with the purchase, i bought it other colors."
5.0,Had been searching for some glasses for cycling. A friend recommended these. They was nice and keeps the sun out of my eyes...sometime they dont sit well and I have adjust but overall nice pair.
5.0,Love it! Perfect for air travel!
5.0,"Love this dress! The pockets are great, they are deep, and they don’t ruin the style of the dress. Great Summer and vacation dress."
5.0,"I absolutely love these sunglasses , I’m so happy I ordered them they are awesome."
5.0,"Awesome keychain, arrived on time and it's a solid piece of plastic. The details on the sega mega drive is very accurate. If your a true sega gamer you need to get this!!!!!"
5.0,The quality of these nose studs far exceeds the price that you pay for them. These are so pretty and impressive. The variety they include gives you color options for almost any outfit and they sparkle like crazy in the sunlight. The balls screw on and off with ease without any problems or difficulties. The length of them was perfect. They did not cause any irritation as of this moment and seem to be made with good quality steel. I will highly recommend these to anyone who wants great nose studs for a bargain. This is a must buy especially since you get such a variety.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.
5.0,"Fast shipping, quality hat! Fits great, looks great, very warm!"
5.0,Beautiful ring! my wife loves it!
5.0,Belt has thick leather and appears to be heavy duty.  Just what I wanted.
5.0,"This product works well for my needs especially when the need for sunglasses gets more and more pressing with each sunny day.  For the price, however, I wish that the lenses would stay in since the sunny days were few and far between here in the northeast."
5.0,Came fast cute and versatile
5.0,Daughter was happy
5.0,Bought for my son and his friends they loved them!!!
5.0,Its wonderful. Thank you.
5.0,My husband loved this set.
5.0,A Plus -
5.0,Es bellísimo!
5.0,"I really love these gloves!  The glpves fit real good.  They are very comfortable and easy to get them on and off.<br /><br />These gloves come with great insulation for cold winter months. There is a zipper which provides easier time for getting them on and off. For me, the zipper provides me with a thing to zip and unzip will sitting around waiting. Something i like.<br /><br />These gloves come with touch screeb capable fingers. And they work very well!  I have tried others that dont really push the screen well. But these work very well.<br /><br />They also come with a small clip to put the two gloves together for storage. I am always losing one of my pair of gloves. This will help me keep them together.<br /><br />Very good quality and great seller to deal with. Thank you very much."
5.0,"I loved the leggings, perfect fit, great material! Definitely NOT see through!"
5.0,Perfect gift for mu Irish man on St Pats day. Love them!
5.0,It fits good for being a women’s garmont  I’m a large man and I like my women’s clothing to fit tight.  So for me it’s great  Love the pockets  They hold plenty of nuts and bolts or to hold whatever you’re working on
5.0,Beautiful fabric. Nice and soft. Looks so pretty I ordered 4 different colors.  None disappointing.  Highly recommend.
5.0,I absolutely love these boots. I have a large calf (18”) and struggle to find boots that fit. These are perfect!
5.0,"I bought this jacket for my 15 yr old son, who was looking for Techwear type clothing. The jacket fit him great, he is about 5'8 190 lbs and we got him an XL and it fits him really good and the length is very nice as well. He said it fits great in the arms and chest area and doesn't feel too tight. The jacket is also great quality and looks exactly like the picture. We are very pleased with our purchase and would definitely recommend to others."
5.0,They fit my 7 year old daughter perfectly. She had to dress up as an older lady for the 100th day of school and she looked positively geriatric!
5.0,I was a little hesitant at first about buying a hat over the Internet because I like to buy it in person where I can see it and try it on. This hat is very well constructed with quality materials and quality stitching. It’s probably one of the best hats that I have and it fits perfectly! I would definitely recommend to any LSU fan or man/woman who enjoys wearing ball caps
5.0,Works great for me. Demon allergies plague me😡
5.0,Bought as a gift. They were perfect for the person I bought them for. Thank you for a great product
5.0,"Beautiful and whimsical. Not too big, not too small. As described."
5.0,Exellent
5.0,Great beginner costume for cosplay. The shoulders tend to slip off but you can add Velcro to hold them up. Otherwise it’s a great product.
5.0,Love it!  Very pretty and great quality!
5.0,the temple of wasn’t properly measured and was causing me severe pain behind my ear.<br /><br />The sleeve fits on larger temple tips too.<br /><br /> The sleeves are a game changer and offers comfort and relief.<br /><br /> I love the material it’s perfect for anyone with natural hair.
5.0,"Just right. Light, cool fabric that actually filters well, and is comfortable. Looks great, too."
5.0,It was a size too big otherwise it would have been perfect for the recipient.
5.0,This was a present for friends on a trip to Jamaica. They all loved it! great quality and reasonable price.
5.0,Super comfy! Runs true to size.  Covers the rear!
5.0,I love this watch and wear it a lot
5.0,Love the fit and light material since it’s always warm here in AZ.
5.0,"I really liked this shirt, exactly what I expected. Very thin and tight but stretchy. The design is very cool I love wearing it to the gym. Makes me look huge with out being too constricting."
5.0,Very nice material with a great stretch if needed.
5.0,Had strong smell but only for few days.
5.0,Amazing sunglasses. I will buy these again and multiple pairs to have in case I misplace them. Great price and great quality.
5.0,Love this purse! Super cute and can hold multiple items.
5.0,"I love the quality, and the feel , just wish they came in more color and designs"
5.0,"I love these pants!  I have several pair.  They wash well and keep their shape.  I dry mine on low for just 10 minutes and then hang, smooth them out and let dry on a skirt hanger.  Awesome!"
5.0,Bought these for my guy to wear to work. They are not too thin and not too thick. He's on his feet all day and he likes them just fine!
5.0,Like this hat. My favorite driver
5.0,"Looks just like the photos, fit true to size and shipping was fast."
5.0,I ordered a size up to be sure it fit and I love it. The arms are a bit snug but not uncomfortable. I love the Gray color with the pretty florals. Perfect for fall!!
5.0,Great little wallet that holds the cards and cash I need without taking up a lot of space in my pocket
5.0,Pretty shirt!
5.0,"This costume definitely exceeded my expectations! By far the cutest costume I have purchased on amazon. It looked like a custom item from etsy. The top was lined, which I wasn't expecting. My daughter received tons of compliments. I would definitely purchase from this shop again."
5.0,"Amazing quality, and comes with a little pouch to keep your glasses safe! They feel sturdy, and (at least for the smaller pair) it seems a real frame is used."
5.0,"Just what I was looking for, very beautiful sturdy pieces. Very happy with the purchas I made here."
5.0,"I'm 5'3"" 155 lbs 36B, I ordered a size large. When it came in, I tried it on, it was slightly too big all over and slightly too long. I thought maybe it'd shrink up in a hot wash...and it did!! The fit is perfect now, and the hem hits me at the knee. The fabric is stretchy t-shirty, I wouldn't say it's thin and I wouldn't say it's thick. Color is nice. There was a little cluster of threads sticking out of one of the seams, I clipped them (the seam seems fine).<br /><br />This is a cute, flattering dress, I'd buy it again."
5.0,Great protecter :)
5.0,My husband LOVES this. It works.
5.0,Great for decluttering my suitcase.
5.0,These fit awesome..love them

5.0,Fits well on my omega
5.0,Purchased it for international travel. Lots of pockets and comfortable.
5.0,Great quality. Not see through at all and the fabric is perfectly stretchy and soft. I've been looking for great color/quality/price. Found it and sold!!!
5.0,BOUGHT these for my daughter I really liked this set and had to force myself to give them to her because it was so pretty.
5.0,Bought 2 for gifts for my two granddaughters they loved them these girls are grown women not little girls
5.0,It looks awesome on me but the zipper in the back makes it so you need help to get in and out of it. Took a full month to get to me just a warning....
5.0,Loved the size and quality
5.0,"I really love these. Love the feel of the fabric on my skin, I love how form-fitting they are. And I really like how the crotch is roomy yet form-fitting without being too tight, like other boxer briefs I've tried. They realize we have ""equipment"" to store down there. Great value for money, highly pleased, and will order again."
5.0,I absolutely love the sweater. It’s heavy and very warm.  It is oversized. I wear a large to Xl so I ordered a medium.  I could have worn a small.  If you do t want the oversized look I’d definitely do 2 sizes down.  I had just paid $150 for a sweater in this style and won’t get it until Dec.  I wish I saw this first.
5.0,good hat..just took to long for delivery
5.0,Chinese muck
5.0,Love this item will definitely purchase other products from this brand.
5.0,GO PACK GO!!  Love my socks!!
5.0,"They are very soft, good gripers on bottom, and true to size"
5.0,Comfy.  Cute.  Soft.  Great fit. One of my fav Sumer tanks

5.0,Liked the color and the quality material. Very happy with the hat
5.0,This sweater is nicely made and very warm on cold days.
5.0,So cozy and perfect fit.
5.0,"Very cute, bold design, goes with everything."
5.0,It got well
5.0,I bought this for my sister. She absolutely loved it.  So I got her 3 more in different colors.
5.0,"These are not only adorable, they are super comfy!"
5.0,"THESE ARE FABULOUS!!!! They work exactly as promised. Just a little heavy but worth it. Every gamer and professional that makes their living<br />looking at a screen all day/night should add these to their tool box. You need a life and you need to sleep. Having blue blockers helps you to become drowsy because they do block the blue light which triggers your &#34;awake brain&#34;. There is plenty out there to read about this fantastic technology that supports the validity of this product. It takes a couple to a few days for your brain to begin to feel the effects of the blue blockers, (at least for me), but I am finally sleeping at night, sleeping very soundly, and waking up refreshed, ready for a full day during the daylight hours. That is what I wanted. I love this product."
5.0,It's a bit stiff when you first get it and takes a few days of constant wearing to get it broken in properly. But this is a great belt and would purchase again!
5.0,I'm short 5'1 and the 27 inseam was perfect and the fit is great overall. I order 4 more pants.
5.0,great color and fits me perfectly.  also looks good on me.
5.0,Really cute and inexpensive way to update your 'boot-look'.  I'm 62 and still want to stay a bit 'trendy'...anyone could pull this off.
5.0,"This is my 2nd purchase, arrived on time. The fit and price are great. Hard to find 2pc. short sets in retail. Will definitely continue to buy more"
5.0,Loved it. It is so cute.
5.0,Small and simple was what I wanted and exactly what these are.
5.0,Love this product.  Fits as it should.
5.0,"Little sister loved these and still uses them, it's been 2 years now :p"
5.0,They are just what I ordered. Havent used them yet but they look awesome. The color is just the color pictured.
5.0,The color of the hat is nice and my daughter loves it. She says it is very comfortable. It’s a fine enough quality for the price and seems like it’ll last for a bit.
5.0,I bought this as a gift for a friend and she loved it! It is perfect for fall and completes any outfit. It is a big size so it can be used many ways.
5.0,I love this suit- I bought it in every color! It hides everything I want hidden and is super cute and comfy!
5.0,Can dress it up or down. I like the flirty casual look.
5.0,Bought this hat for a cosplay costume. Sturdy and fit great.
5.0,This was recommended to me and it is a very nice bag. But I use a smaller
5.0,"Not only are the colors and patterns on this suit bright and cheery and pretty, it's also a super functional suit for a little girl learning to really truly swim.  I had issues with my thin little girl's legs and swimsuits that otherwise fit tending to gap a bit at the crotch...big no no!!  But this has a great athletic fit and even has grippers around the butt so they are super secure.  That said, the gripper doesn't pinch or irritate her at all.  She picks this suit out of her pile of others every single time because it really moves with her and she feels comfortable in it.  I pick it because it's not showing her parts to the world!!  Win-Win."
5.0,"Arrived quickly, item was as advertised. What more can you ask."
5.0,My mom lost her dear poodle and this was a sweet token of remembrance for her.
5.0,This was a gift that was well received.  Vibrant gorgeous colors and warm enough for her needs. I ended up buying 3 more variations based on her review.
5.0,"I got this to replace the cheap stanless band for my Casio Edifice watch.  I felt lucky to have found this 24mm band with a 10mm lug!  An odd size to get and was so happy this band even existed!  It matched up with my watch perfectly, and looks 100x better than the stainless band.  Only critique is the rubber strap is heavy duty and reluctant to conform around the wrist...so I am training it by compressing each end with rubber bands wrapped tightly around each end while storing it.  Nevertheless, I am very happy with this band!"
5.0,so many complaints.  built well and inexpensive
5.0,The dress is beautiful. Looks great on. You can dress up or wear it casual. I bought two more in different colors.
5.0,This face mask is so cool. So beautiful with these rhinestones. Looks so expensive but in the same time I didnt pay a lot of money for it. The price is super affordable. The quality is great. I can wear it when Im going to a restaurant with my husband and wearing a cool black dress. So cute! So cool
5.0,"Love love love... Has the room I need, came on time!"
5.0,Beautiful color and great boxy fit...I love this shirt. Seller shipped quickly...thank you!

5.0,Size up if you like a looser fit.
5.0,"Warm, comfy & well made!"
5.0,"Love these glasses, I have been using these for biking now for a few months and they have met or exceeded my expectations. They are comfortable, the transition in varying light conditions is not even noticeable and does a great job of properly adjusting to the light levels. I don't need to bring my prescription bifocal glasses on rides anymore, one pair does it all. Nice carrying case and lens cloth provided are a great touch too. Couldn't be happier with my purchase, well worth the money."
5.0,Very happy with 16 inch necklace
5.0,Love it.. tons of compliments.. 5’4” 160pounds and have lovely big arms lolol so the large fit perfectly..
5.0,I like this little set a lot. It will be perfect and lightweight for this summer!
5.0,Love this dress! Fits great. So comfy.
5.0,"Beautiful romper. Fit is true to size and the material is light and free-flowing. Color  is vibrant and just as depicted online. I was satisfied  with my decision to purchase and would definitely buy this in other colors. Follow the size chart, it's accurate."
5.0,went on smooth
5.0,Super comfortable; not see through; got a second pair after discovering how good the first pair was; way better than any of the brands and types that  Target carries.
5.0,Great concept & convenience.
5.0,Love it!!!❤️❤️❤️
5.0,"I was asked to review this watch in exchange for a complimentary or discounted one.  By no means does this alter my opinion in any way.<br /><br />Burei has a vast collection of watches to choose from.  I really LOVE this one for a few reasons.  The watch itself is large, but not too large for a woman to make a fashion statement.  Now that doesn't discount it from men wearing it.  It's very gender neutral.<br /><br />I often break out with watches because there's something in the bands that doesn't agree with my skin (Nickel?).  I have to be very careful and usually turn to watches that are cloth, leather, etc... and the back of the watch doesn't have any allergy-prone ingredients.  With this watch, you don't.  The fabric of the brand runs UNDER the back of the watch so you make no direct contact with it.  Nice, very nice.<br /><br />My only .5 star gripe (I round up) is that both side of the band, on either side of the watch itself, wear itself flat against your write.  They stick out.  It isn't horrible.  It is noticeable if you happen to see it.<br /><br />I haven't tested it to see if it keeps time well.  If something happens, I'll update."
5.0,Was a gift and they loved it!
5.0,Purchased for my nine year old son.  He loves all of them.  He hates wearing a mask but doesnt mind wearing these.  They can be washed in the washer and dried in the dryer with no problems.  They have held up very well.
5.0,Love this skirt! Wear black to work everyday as dress code. This is nice looking and very comfy. Moves beautifully and very soft fabric. Received many compliments!!
5.0,"Comfey but it it was a little big on me.  I purchased this for a onesie party and it was a show stopper but it fit a little big on me.  I was comfortable the entire night, so it was not a big problem."
5.0,Unique and fun!
5.0,"I wish I would have bought 2 sets, very comfortable"
5.0,For this price.  Sweet.
5.0,"I have a few pairs of these and I love them. I'm 5'4&#34; and 135 pounds, size 8-10 , fits perfect with a small heal. Just bought the black velvet and they can be used at dress pants. Feel like I am going to work in Pjs. People can't believe it when I tell them it is pajama jeans. Draw string is adjustable and stays in place. Also have the cordouroy ones and black jean style. LOVE them!"
5.0,Gorgeous handbag! Came sealed and packaged great! Thank you again for a fantastic A++++ service!
5.0,"On time, well made - just what I was looking for!"
5.0,These are absolutely gorgeous
5.0,"I ordered this for my girlfriend, and she is happy with it. It fits as expected and is light and comfortable to wear. She recommends it."
5.0,"I honestly thought it'd be too small, cause that's my luck ordering online most times.. But it was a PERFECT fit! Couldn't be any happier, I LOVE it! Fits true to size."
5.0,Perfect for my cleopatra costume.
5.0,Son always wants to wear it
5.0,We loved it and it was delivered quickly! Just the sizing is on the smaller side. My son was 7 months and we ordered a 12m size and it just fit. Otherwise it was awesome!!
5.0,Beautiful thanks
5.0,"I would definitely recommend it, fits nicely, comfortable and breaths really well. Does not slide down and stays cool. I am about to buy several more."
5.0,fits ok... but not a good fit..the pockets show out and puckers out  - i have big hips
5.0,Easy to install very comfy and cute 🥰
5.0,THESE EARRINGS ARE SO STRAIGHT FORWARD IN THEIR LOOKS AND COMFORT OF WEARING.  I JUST LOVE THEM AND FIND MYSELF CHOOSING THEM TO WEAR DAY AFTER DAY!!!  ORDER WITH CONFIDENCE.....YOU WILL LOVE THEM TOO!!!
5.0,"Easy, convenient and holds ALOT for its size!"
5.0,"Love these and I get complements all the time. They arrived promptly, brand new, with a nice hard case and soft cloth case! They've held up well so far! Will purchase again when I need my next pair. (I'm quite rough on sunglasses!)"
5.0,"Absolutely love it! I ordered red but I’m probably going to order the blue too. Such a fun colorful beautiful dress! Can be worn for multiple occasions. Some assembly required, such as the bows, they are not sewn on, they pin on. Honestly I had to look at the picture to put them all in the correct places but it’s not cheap material. A couple bows are plush filled for an extra ‘pop’ and all are made with very nice fabrics. I recommend a petty coat for extra poof but still good even without."
5.0,I love this coat! Everyone always compliments me and asks where I got it.
5.0,Feels great and hasn’t faded after several washes.
5.0,These gloves are very soft and has a nice fit. The small/medium size is slight big on me but it’s better than being too tight. The gloves are affordable and functional.
5.0,Great nostalgic dress...Perfect fit!
5.0,So cute; kids loved ‘em
5.0,Perfect for keeping my fingers in place during some really hard spikes. For a frequent finger breaker I appreciate these to no end!
5.0,"Got this as a gift for my mom and she swears by it, and her friends have already ordered a couple. This is an amazing vest if you want both the front and rear to be warm"
5.0,Great shoes!!! Fast delivery.
5.0,"This is a fantastic deal for you money.  The chain is sturdy and while it may look delicate it is excellent quality, doesn't get tangled in my curly hair.  The clasp is super strong and easy to open to put on.  The detailing is wonderful.  Overall, this is one of the best costume jewelry brands I have used."
5.0,This is a beautiful bead that fits Pandora bracelets at a fraction of the cost of the name brand version.  Very nice.
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful tutu. Fluffed out very nicely. My granddaughter feels like a real ballerina-princess when she puts this on. And she's worn it several times already, having it only one week. We went to a baby shower and she immediately got blueberries all over it. I got home and put some oxy cleaner on it...rinsed it and it looks like brand new. I will definitely be ordering more tutus from this company. Five stars."
5.0,"My granddaughter is the little fashionista and loves these sandals.<br /><br />She is able to put them on all by herself with the Velcro straps.<br /><br />I really like that they are waterproof, you never know when we are going to get rain in the summer and so glad they won’t get ruined.<br /><br />They have a nice rubber sole so they do not slip and slide like other sandals. They are comfy with the padded insole and she loves the decorations on the inside.<br /><br />And the outside is so adorable with the cute cherries. So adorable!"
5.0,Perfect and comfortable
5.0,Elegant as described. I’m so pleased with this purchase. Planning on getting different colors.

5.0,"These tank tops are just what I was looking for! I also got a size smaller, because they do stretch."
5.0,Beautiful and comes with a small paper explaining what carnelian is good for. I love my bracelet.
5.0,My girl friend loved it .good quality
5.0,"I was not familiar with this brand before, but we are very happy with these shoes. They were comfortable from the first wear with no blisters unlike many other flats and mary janes."
5.0,"First off, this belt is as good for women as it is for men, despite the product description (that currently says ""...FOR MEN.""<br /><br />In the package are four heavy-duty nylon belts in the type of colors that do not clash with anything.  It's very durable and well-stitched and the release mechanism is intuitive, very easy to detach.  The belt won't fit through the loops of dress pants, better suited for the kind of pants with wide loops.  I can see these belts lasting for a long time, great for MOLLE or ALICE gear."
5.0,Fits well and very flattering.
5.0,"So far this has been my favorite watch ever. It's thin enough to be worn under shirts, minimalist enough to go with all of my black outfits, and exceedingly stylish for a digital watch. Beware though, this watch is the one with different colored lettering. While I like that, for some unknown reason, I would assume most people who want to get a minimalist watch don't. But yeah, buy this. :3"
5.0,nice color blue.  fast service
5.0,Great selection for my summer classes.
5.0,"I ordered the Burgundy in my usual size large.  I am 165 lbs, 5’3 41 inch bust, 35 inch waist.  Fit perfectly. Long enough to wear with leggings if I wanted."
5.0,Love them.  Get so many compliments.
5.0,"I purchased a large and it's very soft and comfortable.  with dress slacks and heals, it looks professional for work, but can be paired with jeans for a  more casual appearance too.  I plan to purchase in other colors for work wardrobe."
5.0,I really like these tops!  They fit well and look nice!  I will be buying more!
5.0,"I do like a lot, walking."
5.0,the hat came. bent but I fixed it
5.0,"I work a lot with my hands on crafts, cleaning, various projects and I don't want to get my beautiful, expensive wedding ring set marked up.  So.... I wear this one around the house.  it is cute, washes off, sparkles because of the texture, and still looks great... Comfortable fit and easy to clean."
5.0,It’s all the marks… Soft on the inside durable on the outside… Warm quality product… Highly recommend!

5.0,exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,"This is a joke in our family.  They were gifts, hoping they fit good."
5.0,Amazing belt. Big into weighted pullups and dips and this by far the most comfortable belt I've used. Great bang for the buck and super durable and easy to use. Check out my 9/28 vid on Instagram @caliscience to see it in action

5.0,"My son has loved sequins but found everything to be ""too girlish.""  So while I have been trying to teach him that boys and girls can wear pink, have long or short hair, I have also been looking for a shirt he can wear and feel good in.  This is perfect!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:399913dd8e151e6ab54d5e6d16c0675e]] Very comfortable and easy to put together even came with instructions
5.0,"Gave these as Christmas presents, they were pretty high quality and fit well in Crocs"
5.0,This is what you need to stay warm if you are a cold nature person. Keeps you toasty when you want and warn when no heat is required.<br />  Draw backs are nine I have no hot spot complaints or over heating.
5.0,Absolutely love this dress! I wish it came in more colors. I would buy every one!
5.0,High quality leather belt incorporating a genius buckle design with a holeless ratchet system is a must have. Highly recommended.
5.0,"This is just as pretty in real life!<br />The colors and print are fantastic!  Just as shown in the ad!<br />I had hoped that the solid side was useable, but there's black bleed thru from the tree trunks on the print side.  The edges can still be folded over though, to give a bit of contrast if wearing with a pin.<br />The fabric is soft and cozy too!<br />My new favorite!"
5.0,I use it as a key chain and never have to take my use shopping.  Have bought three of them...and Wil certainly buy more as needed.

Very unusual and would be much more expensive at outside stores.<br />Really, just a high quality beautiful bracelet.<br />Will buy more as gifts at the great price for the top of the line quality !"
5.0,PROMPT DELIVERY AS PROMISED. VERY ATTRACTIVE AND PRETTY: CORRECTLY SIZED. VERY PLEASED!! RECOMMENDED.
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my teenage nephew who drives a jeep. He was thrilled with this cap.
5.0,Great for the late fall early winter.  The size fit perfectly with some room just in case you wear a bulky sweater.

5.0,Perfect fit. Love them. Super comfortable.

5.0,"I wear mine everyday. The quality is great, I get a lot of compliments on it. I am a nurse and use my upper body a lot, especially helping patients up and out of bed, supervising them, turning them- and this little baby has not fallen off. Ive literally had patients with anxiety grab me, and it is still on. Love it."
5.0,The material is so thick and comfy! It's darker blue in person but still really cool.
5.0,Exactly as promised. Fast shipping. Will come back to this seller for this product when/if I need more.
5.0,Wife loved it!  Also can be used as a necklace.  Compliments everywhere she goes

5.0,"These bands (I purchased 3) don’t absorb sweat like leather, don’t slip o the wrist  like metal and have an interesting and class look.  The easy installation is a plus."
5.0,I would highly recommend this item!  It is reasonably priced and makes a great gift.  Great quality! :)
5.0,Fantastic!
5.0,Works for face cover. Might not be what CDC want public to wear but it covers face.
5.0,"I am proud to be an American and a Virginian!  Now, with this quality, sharp looking pin I can share this in a visible way.  I wear this pin on the lapel or collar of my outwear.<br /><br />Color is very good, looks like something you'd get as a gift from the state legislature or your congressman.  My son saw man and was really excited about it so he now has one that he received as a stocking stuffer from Santa :-)"
5.0,"I discarded the flimsy chain that came with the pendant and added a nice one.  The emerald is very nice and not a bad size for the relatively low price.  In fact, the woman behind me in Starbucks commented on the necklace - guessing it was an emerald!  I'm happy."
5.0,So cute. Love it.
5.0,"Not much to say, along with the similar material and color causal jacket, I do not wear as lounge wear, rather a coordinated outfit.  Very happy with them.  I have two pairs."
5.0,"I bought these to replace the bands on my wife's fitbit. Two come in the pack, easy to replace and seem to work real well."
5.0,I like that they fit well and were made of high quality material.
5.0,Super fast delivery after order. I have several pairs and I love the fit and quality of these capris. They have just the right amount of stretch and are thick enough for no show during squats. The waistband comes up high and is wide and comfortable. Even after washing over and over the quality is still there! The color is a rich deep maroon. I'm 5'8/150 lbs  and wear the size medium and the length falls mid calf.
5.0,Shoes fit my 9 year old son perfectly and looked cool.  Many of his wrestling mates like them because of the Velcro....keeping shoe laces tied at this age is daunting.
5.0,Comfortable and great for the National Park aficionado.
5.0,"perfect, perfect, perfect for my neck and body size....love this necklace, quality seems to be good...color is as photographed...I wear with a very thin silver necklace, necklace could stand alone.....I like"

5.0,So pretty! They came in perfect condition and mirrored.
5.0,This was a perfect gift!
5.0,"My son is a huge Minecraft fan. He wants to be a creeper for Halloween and wear this.  He does have a creeper box head, but we thought that would be a little annoying to wear all night.  He loves this hoodie.  After Halloween, he plans on wearing it for everyday use.  He normally wears a size 8 but we got a large because of other reviews stating the hoodie runs small.  It does, and the large fits him perfect."
5.0,This was a gift for my niece and it fit well. She loved it.
5.0,Makes your legs feel great.
5.0,Too good
5.0,"Not too big not too small, these earrings are very beautiful and looked just like the picture."
5.0,Looks beautiful on my grand daughter.  Great fit.
5.0,Good product and delivered on time.
5.0,This belt buckle is bigger than i expected but it is still very beautiful. I was not expecting it to say Gucci on the back of the belt but oh well. The material is not the best quality but it will last long if you wear it on ocassion and take care of it. I am happy with this belt♡
5.0,These shorts are comfy and funky.  The pattern is cute and the product is well made.
5.0,"I really wanted this bracelet, but after reading that it was hard to put on, I was skeptical. I'm average-sized, but I wear a size 11 on my ring finger; saying I am big-boned is an understatement. ;-) I went ahead and ordered it because, for the price, I could always give it to one of my waif friends as a gift. It DOES have a smaller opening that no one could just slip their wrist into, but it is also pliable enough to bend a little and put it on. It's not super-heavy so it snaps right back into shape. Conversely, it's not so thin that it will break. This works better for me anyway because I am a salesperson and use my hands a lot in presentations. I really don't like loose bracelets sliding around and and banging on my wrist. This piece is elegant and sleek-looking. All-in-all, I am very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Love this hat. Fits perfect and looks good for when i workout at the gym
5.0,"Just what she needed: looks great, feels great, fits the watch perfectly."
5.0,"Super fast shipping! Cute and cozy flip flops, can't wait to wear them under my wedding dress after I take off my heels! Perfect!"

5.0,"just right size, fit. Looks great!"
5.0,This is a really fun sexy dress for when the weather is hot . The fabric is thin yet soft and hugs the body The cut is on point . It’s a reasonable price and really anything you purchase from PattyBoutik is excellent quality anytime I see a piece from them that I like I don’t pass it up . Love this dress I only wish it came in or patterns .
5.0,"I love these glasses.  Stylish, comfortable and I wear them all the time to read my Kindle.  Recommended!"
5.0,"Wear white cuz it’s very transparent. Everything else was great!!  Make sure and get batteries, they don’t come with it"
5.0,"This Kimono is similar to one I used to own bought at a department store in Japan.  I lost that one to normal wear and tear.  This one keeps me warm, looks great and is just a bit thinner than my old one.  But the one thing I just love is this one has pockets!  It's a little smaller than I thought.  I ordered an XL and it fits more like a L, but still ties closed just fine.  I would get another one of these from the same seller again without hesitation."
5.0,Heavy enough to withstand the weather. Hood that can be folded away.  Very attractive.
5.0,I normally wear a size 10...got an extra large in this...fits perfectly!! Lovvvvve this suit!!
5.0,"Wow. Blown away! These are the closest comparable Amazon find I’ve ever tried that matches rivals Lulu’s Aligns. I actually like that this fabric is super buttery soft but offers a little more compression and shape than my Aligns. 28” length perfect for my tall frame, high waisted cut hits perfectly at my natural waist (long torso even!), and even in the blue hue very little cellulite noticeable (even though: PSA we all have it girl don’t sweat it!). BUY THESE LEGGINGS! You won’t regret it. Sizing: I wear a 10 in Aligns, and the large in this brand fits perfectly."
5.0,Great fit and love the material washes well
5.0,Great belt for the money.  Holds my pants up.
5.0,Love these glasses. Perfect.
5.0,These rings were gifts....loved them!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:cf70c7546c0a3cac57e438c4557c3a8b]] This is a great watch winder. Before I had this, I would have to set and wind my Rolex often because I didn't wear it every day. Now, I don't have to worry and my watch is always set! This winder is awesome. The led light is cool and you can turn it off if you want. It comes with a key and locks and also has 4 different modes. I love this thing so much!"
5.0,My 5 year old got these as a gift they are amazing . She has been wearing them for 5 months and no sole wearing . They are perfect . I’m Definatley going to buy more colors .
5.0,I was worried that it wouldn't hold my bills securely and wouldn't hold enough credit cards. I am able to fit 6 cards plus my drivers license in the card slot and the dollar bills have stayed secure in place on the back.  My only complaint is that my wallet didn't get any of the cool  writing like the one in the example: Mine is just solid yellow.  I guess that just where it gets cut out of the old hose.
5.0,Very nice and dark....perfect
5.0,"I took these on a river trip to protect the tops of my hands from sun and the inside of my hands from callouses.<br />I would still be loving them if they hadn't gone overboard when not in use and the wind kicked up.<br />very comfortable, and very secure feeling."
5.0,Comfy and attractive!
5.0,Im surprised these are not over $100. They kept me warm in 35 degree weather while keeping me comfortable on the saddle. Don’t hesitate to purchase.
5.0,Great quality. Like place for shoes inside

5.0,Great at least they delivered
5.0,"I bought this to top a chimney sweep costume for my son.  It arrived on time, fit was true to size, and was well made.  This hat is so cute, we received so many compliments on it."
5.0,"I did not include a photo because it is just as pictured.  I was so surprised when I opened this as to the softness of it, and as far as fit?  It fits superbly and so incredibly comfortable.  I have looked for a robe that feels this great and fits this well for a really long time and I finally found one.  Absolutely worth the money!!"
5.0,"I love it, its so pretty comfy  true to size, I wear Large and it fits perfectly."
5.0,Nice.  works exactly as I needed it to do.
5.0,"I bought 5 silver chains to go on some museum pieces i bought for 5 great granddaughters.  They truly exceeded my expectations, the price was great, but they were so beautiful and well made.  loved the lobster clasp.  i was so pleasantly surprised."
5.0,"I bought this jacket for the fall season, when haunted houses are open. This is a medium jacket, and very comfortable. The only thing I would say is bad about it is that the zipper is backwards. But that's easy to overlook for me because I rarely zip it up anyway. It's very durable as well, I wore it deep into winter, and I'm not very easy on coats or jackets. No tears or rips yet. Never felt like I was restricted by the arms either.<br />All in all, it's a very good jacket and I highly recommend"
5.0,I used these for a costume in a hair show and they worked out just fine.  My client was Ms. Pacman.
5.0,"I love love love this dress. It fits perfectly and is super flattering. The only complaint is that it's just a little thin. Other than that, it's the perfect dress."
5.0,"Feel great, fit great, and looks hella sexy!"
5.0,"I got this product for a couple of days now. I can say, this watch is really a masterpiece, and has a very unique style (as positiv). The only thing that is hard to read is the 24hour format on the right handside on the watch due to the black needle on the black background, despite the needle has a white part at the tip.<br /><br />Serving and shipping was fast and precise.<br /><br />Overall 5 stars"
5.0,Perfect fit! I got a small and it is true to its size. Material is nice and stretchy. Good quality for its price!
5.0,Looks good and very light and it feels like rubber and the coin fits just right
5.0,Big fan of this line of luggage. Is weightless and durable....enough!
5.0,These are awesome. Super light and great to wear for workouts.  I use mine as a headband to play flag football and for boxing cardio training.
5.0,"Works well, not as refined as Seiko, buy for cost is great!  Fun to see the working of watch.<br />I love it for the price!"
5.0,Perfect for Halloween very cute and soft cute faces and kept me moderately warm comfortable.Just what I wanted

5.0,Arrived before date specified  and fit perfect.
5.0,"I bought these for my husband for a skiing trip.  They worked wonderfully.  He was able to wear them for several days with no issues.  Of course, he had on thermals underneath, but they kept him warm.  Similar pants at the ski store in town were double the price!"
5.0,"Its thinner than it looks but it's perfect. Great to wear around the house, run around, wear going out or lay around in. I got the apricot color and is like a light beige. Sleeves are exactly as they look like in the pictures. I am normally a M/L and I ordered an XL. Fits loose. I would love to get this in a M or L too!"
5.0,Fits perfectly. The product size I got is  120. My daughter is almost 5 years old. Customer service  was great. Thanks!
5.0,"Awesome and way cheaper than Claire’s, hot topic or any other store. The fact there is different sizes is a plus!"
5.0,Flattering one piece. Fashionable yet slightly modest. Color is very pretty as well.
5.0,keeps bags from spilling on the car floor or in the car seat.  Very useful!
5.0,"Received Spring Bar Set on time and in excellent condition.  I had just ordered a new spring bar tool but knew that when changing watch bands it is not uncommon to fire a installed spring bar across the room, never to be seen again.  Also, many of the new less expensive watch bands do not come with replacement spring bars.  With this in mind, I ordered this spring bar set.  The set itself has just about every size of spring bar you could possibly need, and many you won't.  However, at the price, it sets the average customer up in spring bars for years to come and is much cheaper than taking your watch to your local jeweler for band replacement.  The spring bars themselves seem to be well made and were easy to install with my new spring bar tool.  One of these replacement spring bars has been  on my watch for about a month with no problems.  I have large wrists, and even with long watch bands, exert pressure on the spring bars. So far, so good"
5.0,"My daughter is an above average 8 year old, I went up a size and it fits well with a little room to grow. She loves it.<br /><br />Product seems to be true to size."
5.0,"Excelente producto lo compraría nuevamente , me quedo perfecto la talla L fue la que pedí y me quedo como quería que me quedara"
5.0,I am pregnant and wore this at about four or five months and got so many compliments as I walked around a cocktail party with this on. It doesn't look anything less than sophisticated. I wore it was a small tank top underneath because of the occasion. Though award at night to a nightclub with a dark colored bra and I loved it and so received plethora compliments
5.0,Good quality.  Love the coverup.
5.0,I loved all the colors. But I didn't get to enjoy them because I sent the watch back.
5.0,I received so many compliments on this shirt.
5.0,"Fits true to size. Short and real light , great for short ladies"
5.0,Love how great it looks.  It was very easy to install.  Have not had it long enough to know about durability.
5.0,Have had these for a while now. They are cheap and work well to protect cutting classes in my toolbox. I use another to cover my dash-cam when I park the car for the night. No issues at all.
5.0,"Very comfortable, the material is soft and light.  The fit is good and the value is great!  Just hope it holds up for a while.  I know I'll enjoy wearing it."
5.0,"These are ALWAYS a hit. Pool day, boat day, whatever. These are the best!"
5.0,"Got this coat for my teenage daughter and it looks wonderful! The color is a deep luscious purple. The coat is warm without being bulky. In fact, it fits loose enough so that she can wear bulky sweaters and still zip the coat comfortably. The coat really flatters her figure because it has an almost hourglass form to it.  It is a tad narrow at the waist and a little bigger around the hips.  So cute.  Great coat."
5.0,"My daughter is sensory sensitive. Her pajamas must be soft, loose and lightweight. The cute fabric is an added bonus! These are perfect!!!"
5.0,I love them. The best part is that they are easy to take of and also stay snug and don’t move back and forth!
5.0,Lots of compliments on these pants. Can either be dressed as casual or comfy. I’m short so I have to roll them but they look just as cute. I absolutely love these pants!

5.0,My husband loves these!
5.0,"You can't beat these hats for the price. They are cozy and cute and are great quality. As a woman with thicker hair, the hats fit fine, but they aren't baggy in the back at all. (there is no slouch) Even my teenage daughters are stealing these hats from me! I did remove the CC tag that's on the side of the hats. The tag is easy to remove with a seam ripper. I definitely recommend these knit hats."
5.0,Bought as a gift. It’s the most adorable dress! Quality is really good
5.0,"I used the wallet on a recent trip to Thailand. It was slim enough to fit into a very small purse and it protected all of the contents. I utilized many of the pockets which were just the right fit for my passport, credit card, change, paper bills, etc. The wallet itself is a beautiful color and I have received many compliments from friends. I certainly recommend this wallet. I tried to limit my use of the wallet for travel, but have started using the wallet on a daily basis. I am very satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,nice sock
5.0,Socks were comfy and in variety of color. They tend to slip a bit but less than the usual ones I bought before. Overall great price for a good amount of pairs.

5.0,"You bring your umbrella to the beach for shade, dig a hole for the pole, aim at the sun, you have shade! Yeah until the wind picks up, most umbrellas can't handle it, they spin, blow away and almost impale someone nearby. Saw these  on the beach taking the wind like a champ, look good too. Chatted with some owners, i bought one. COULD NOT BE HAPPIER. It's an umbrella/tent combo. Put your pole in the ground like usual, but you're not done. Each side of this ""tent"" has a large pocket at the end for sand. Fill it with sand, you have the pole and 4 sides held down with sand. No stakes, stays put. lightweight to carry too. Absolutely love this. Looks like they are making an upgraded design that has issues. This one is great, glad i bought it"
5.0,I use this for my parking garage passes so they don't fall on the floor of my car and I love it - super cute!
5.0,My daughter really enjoyed the spider princess costume. It was a really fun take on a superhero. This costume was very nice. It is great for Halloween or just for playing pretend. It looked really authentic. It was well made.<br /><br />They found it easy to put on and off. It was fairly comfortable. I thought there was really a lot to it. Quality and durability were good. I would recommend it.<br />It was so sparkly. It was also nice that it came with so many accessories.  I would recommend this.
5.0,love it! perfect for our 5 days of rain a year
5.0,LOVE IT...HAS THAT COOL SLOUCH LOOK AND MADE OF GOOD MATERIAL. SEXY.
5.0,Nice fabric love the feel.... fits as expected.... love the color...
5.0,"Great foot support and plantar fasciitis inserts really make a difference as far as foot fatigue goes. Love the trimmable design so that i can trim it a little to fit my shoes well. After a  day's get used to the new insoles,  they are great. Great value."
5.0,Super cute dress! Love the fit and feel of it. Will definitely buy again!
5.0,"A few reviewers mentioned things that had me a little worried about ordering this, but I'm so glad I did. It is perfect in every way - -the product has a great design, the materials and construction are of high quality, and using it is just simply a pleasure - - one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon (and that's really saying something)."
5.0,Am enjoying the bracelet. Thanks
5.0,Have worn the tie with tails and it looked fine. If I need another at some time in the future I would consider a new one instead of trying to clean this one..
5.0,"Good quality,  fits great.  Already recommended to friends."
5.0,I love it! Super cute.
5.0,I love Grace Karin clothing.  This dress is perfect in the navy color.  I wear it with a crinoline to add some fullness.  Many compliments!!
5.0,This is the only glove I've found (not a kitten) that fits my 3-year old! Great price too
5.0,"I LOVE, LOVE these shoes. Have had them for several months and still look and fit like new. Great support, easy on/off, and no slippage in the pool. Thx Ryka for a great product!"
5.0,Unexpected quality for the low price.
5.0,My mom loves these! Great quality.
5.0,absolutely nice
5.0,For the price a very nice set of earrings.  Beautiful color love them.
5.0,I love these shoes. they take the pain away where it needs to and has that extra cushion in the heal. I had to get used to the height but once I got them broken in I am sad to take them off for bed.
5.0,Fits great and I got exactly the right patterns that were in the picture. Love them all!
5.0,"These work well when shooting our guns. They fit comfortably and protect our hearing, so 5 stars!<br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,I can't get enough of the. One fell off and the red crystal became dislodged. Fortunately I had glue on me.
5.0,"Beautiful, well made stainless steel watch bracelet.  It is substantial and heavy, which depending on what you are looking for is good or not... Construction, fit and finish are terrific.  Nicely polished links that are screwed together which makes adjustment pretty easy.  No real slop between the links.  Really like it on my Citizen Eco Drive Divers watch.  I had also ordered the Super Engineer type II bracelet which is very similar to this one.  I preferred the rounded links on the Engineer vs. the flat links of the Super Engineer for this watch. The polished links seem to match the finish of the Citizen watch better.  Fantastic upgrade to my Eco Drive Diver."
5.0,"They look great! I bought them as a replacement for some earrings I lost, and they are perfect!"
5.0,"When I'm not at work l live in leggings. I have purchased so many brands that have disappointed me... not these! Perfect weight, not see through at all! No muffin top at all! The stretch and total comfort of these is perfect! They make my big butt look very nice. I wear a size 12-14 usually and the L fit like a glove. I JUST BOUGHT 2 MORE PAIRS!!!"
5.0,Perfect bag as described.  Got if for my bestie and she loves it.
5.0,Love this socks they are a pleasure to wear. If you are a BIG man—not just a large shoe sizes—but heavy fat calves these are perfect for you. I can't count the big & tall men's socks I've bought over the years that suck—because they are made for men with tooth-pick calves. These are knee-high and over-knee so be forewarned.
5.0,This minimalist wallet was EXACTLY what I was hoping it was when it showed up. If you don't like bulky pockets or carrying a ton of cards you never use this is the wallet for you. Well done guysz
5.0,Great price and really looks nice on.Good length but not too long.
5.0,Tugless suits fit good and are chlorine resistant.
5.0,"Great pin.  I put it on my riding vest. Looks great, stays put."
5.0,It looks so good I also added a cute embellished belt to it to make look classy.
5.0,"These are the BEST!  I really don't like underwear that are uncomfortable or squeezey.  On top of that I recently had a surgery so I especially needed undies that would not irritate me.  These are soft, tagless, and super great!  My only complaint is that the gray pair with the print is made from a different material than the rest, and those did bother me...so I just don't wear those.  Other than that, great purchase!"
5.0,"Great beanie. Fits my small-ish head well. I like that the pom is removable, so I can use the same beanie whether I want to wear my hair up or down, which is so much more convenient. The pony hole is just the right size, and barely noticeable if you wanted to wear your hair down without the pom. Good material, no unraveling, not itchy, and washes fine. Color is as pictured, no complaints!"
5.0,These are the best military/hiking boot socks ever.  Period.  These socks are EXTREMELY comfortable and keep my feet dry.  At some points I've worn these socks for multiple days at a time and my feet have had no issues whatsoever (comes from many miles of experience rucking in the field).  I cannot say anything bad about these socks because there is nothing negative at all.  They are the best sock brand I have ever had (their running socks are equally as good).
5.0,Love these earrings .i wear them all the time .
5.0,I order this for my 17 year old nephew he really wanted it he love it one of the best he has .
5.0,Perfect for games! I get so many compliments.
5.0,Es perfecto me encantó
5.0,SUPER cute sub dress! I am excited to wear it on vacation next week!
5.0,"These are fantastic weight lifting gloves. Very durable unlike many of the popular brands. Great palm padding and finger support. Also, I’m not sure what the little Velcro strap is for on the back of the hand, but I’ve found it’s the perfect place to secure the thumb ring of my wrist wraps. If this is what it’s intended for, it’s genius. The only issue I’ve had with these (and it’s extremely minor) is that they’re not super easy to take off. I’ve found that it helps to pull the wrist band up on your hand and then pull the fingers. Pull the fingers alone and the gloves will hardly budge, esp. if your hands are sweaty."
5.0,"Muy buen reloj, bastante sobrio y elegante. Los pasadores del pulso son un poco duros al soltarlos para ajustar, pero es muy cómodo cuando queda a la medida."
5.0,My daughter said the leggings are very comfy and she recommends them!
5.0,"I’ve always been a large busted woman, and for the first time there is a sports bra that I don’t dislocate my shoulder getting in or out of, I don’t had the straps come undone mid-hike, and fits!<br /><br />This bra offers support, comfort, and durability."
5.0,Fun occasion. Ect dress it up or use it at the beach.
5.0,Súper cute! So nice for lounging around the crib or dressing up with some pumps and jewelry
5.0,Absolutely adorable! I purchased 2 more today. High Quality materials. You will love it and be 100 percent happy
5.0,I bought the xl because I wanted it loose to wear with leggings.  I love the fit and how there is some stretch in the material.  I would buy this again.
5.0,"Comfortable, sleek, utilitarian and fits just right. The quality is good and I'll be enjoying these for a long time."
5.0,These are beautiful!
5.0,These shoes are the BEST!!  I have a high arch and had to loosen the strap at the top of the foot.  Once I did these are comfortable and I can walk on them forever. I love dansko clogs and these will be my summer alternative for years to come
5.0,Fits great and fast shipping
5.0,Although the skirt is thick this is a beautiful peice I got many compliments. I felt comfortable and looked great in it
5.0,Wonderful dress with great quality
5.0,"What a beautiful set of pins! These BSG Commander rank pins are excellent quality, and I really don't know how one would improve upon them. I can't wait to try them on!"
5.0,Cutest dress ever
5.0,"Yay, new bras! Love the colors and they are pretty comfy."
5.0,Looks good and was easy to put on.
5.0,These are so cute. I bought them for my daughter. She wears a size 9 shoe and these are just a tad small. Not a big deal though.
5.0,Fairly priced!  Easy to spot vibrant colors.  Little bigger than Triple Zip Hipster Crossbody.  Vera's bags are not throwaways.  Are sewn well.  And wash well for years.
5.0,"This is my second product from SUNGAIT. I like their products. Good quality for the price. Also, GREAT customer service."
5.0,"Se utilizó para primera comunión quedó perfecto la talla y el largo tal cual cómo lo indica la tabla, muy lindo el vestido"
5.0,"I ordererd both the red, and kelly green. I wanted a cheaper alternative to the Lularoe Sarah. I'm happy with this product and may order more."

5.0,This bag was exactly what I needed ♡
5.0,Nice wallet. Has a place for everything and being black matches everything. Being RFID is a plus. Easy to use. Would recommend.
5.0,"I was not expecting this swim top to be as supportive as it is, but it's great! And the cut looks great on everyone. Will be ordering another color!"
5.0,I bought these for my husband and he loves them. He says they are very confortable and warm.
5.0,Fit me perfectly.
5.0,felt nice and looked good.
5.0,They’re so cute. I love them sm.
5.0,"Fit as expected, comfortable pajama shorts."
5.0,"This top is so cute. The twisted bottom adds interest to an otherwise basic top. I found the top to fit accurately, and on the generous side through the mid-section. The button front does function down to the last button but know that the bottom/hem is still connected so the top doesn't open like a shirt. I wear this top opened with an accent tank or camisole. The sleeve falls over the shoulder and is not tight on my arm. The length of the back is long like a tunic, shorter on the sides. This is cute top that can be dressed up or down and worn with different bottoms. Really a great versatile top and a great addition to my wardrobe."
5.0,Cool shirt!.... Exactly like it was represented.
5.0,Love these gloves. Best gloves that I have ever owned!
5.0,These are the ones!!! Luxurious and Classy!! Love the Red!!!
5.0,Great ring fit true to size looks good.
5.0,First perfect. This is more of a business casual shirt or one to wear with jeans
5.0,Lightweight.  Great for spring and summer
5.0,"It's beautiful on, just like the pic"
5.0,For well
5.0,The watch band is pretty and feels light and comfortable on the wrist. Very satisfied with purchase.
5.0,"Don’t let the price fool you, this is a pretty ring! I got the lavender colored ring and I have no complaints."
5.0,"This shoe polish is the best and a great price! The shoe polish lasts a long time....it is the absolute best polish that I have used in a lot of years. Very easy to apply, conditions your shoes and the coverage is excellent!"
5.0,"Great bra, fits as expected. It is the new I have been looking for over a long time and it is very comfortable to wear all day.  Will probably buy another one, maybe in black."
5.0,Got this for my boyfriend since his old watch strap was wearing out. He didn't mention any issues with installation and the new strap looks great!
5.0,"The pearl was larger than I expected, and the setting is very lovely.  It looks much more expensive than it is."
5.0,I got two pairs of these for a trip to Iceland. It’s cold and wet but my feet stayed warm and dry. Best thing is they also never got too hot and the wool made them not stinky either!  Great socks
5.0,I love Egyptian history and this necklace pendant is made beautiful for the price plus they did a wonderful job.Looks as pictured.It came in a little clear box with card info about Isis
5.0,"Very nice item, quality piece."
5.0,Got these for my girlfriend and she loved them. They are really pretty and well made.
5.0,These are just great.  They're a much heavier gauge of stainless than I was expecting.  They stay in nicely and keep my collars looking crisp and sharp all day.  This was money well-spent.
5.0,"I thought a hat with a folding brim might not be very cute but you can't even tell when the hat is on. It is light, comfortable and looks good!"
5.0,"Bought two and glad I did, could layer these everyday with different tops."
5.0,Goods
5.0,It does not in any way feel cheap or look it. I shower with it and feels comfortable no matter what and it fits great.
5.0,Perfect for a young boy's baptism gift.
5.0,Great color. But this case won't protect your phone if it dropped on cement.
5.0,I love my hat! Got it to wear with my retro dress and it looks so cute!!!
5.0,"Fits great, looks awesome not too much else to say would recommend"
5.0,Excellent product!!
5.0,It’s fits well enough- not perfectly  but thats cuz I’m not a standard fit generally ... I usually have to manually adjust my purchased clothes for a perfect fit anyway... nothing I can’t adjust on my machine anyway... I love this dress either way
5.0,"love them ,beautiful"
5.0,"GET THESE! Great support and fit and they really look like denim too. so, I am 60 y.o. 5'4 approximately 150ish and like to dress young these are comfortable and better than any jeggings that  I've ever bought"
5.0,Super cute perfect for teen daughter
5.0,Love the t-shirt and the material...so soft
5.0,Got so many compliments on it
5.0,"I just got mine and it’s absolutely fantastic. A great value for the package , it’s a must have considering the work from home schedule ,working out in your backyard or going for a quick run on my break. Loveee it !"
5.0,"For the order, you get 3 pair of novelty socks that are in their own independent packaging, so you can potentially have 3 small gifts from one order. The image quality is pixelated, so it's a bit off but still much better than I expected. The fit is mostly universal for adults, and they stretch well. The fabric is blended and feels much more like synthetic dress socks than soft cotton. The one negative I found was the text on the red pair is only on one side, so when wearing as a pair, they are not the same on each side, and looks a little awkward if you care. The other 2 pair are printed the exact same on each side. I find this set to be a good value, as you can have 3 separate pair to gift or keep for yourself. This may even make a fun white elephant gift for the holidays. I'll be happily keeping these for myself."
5.0,These socks are great! I bought them for my husband because he wears his loafers without socks due to the fact that most socks are visible while wearing loafers. The only problem with this is his feet sweat and his loafers get to smelling really bad! These socks have worked out really well! He wears about a size 10 and these fit his feet great! He says they are comfortable and they don't slip in the back like other short socks. He also says his feet do not sweat while wearing these. Now he can wear his loafers with socks and not have to worry about the socks looking tacky. I recommend these socks to anyone who wears loafers or boat shoes. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.
5.0,I love this dress.  I&#34;m 5.9 and finding dresses long enough to wear with heels is hard.  This dress is perfect with or without heels.
5.0,Love the sun glasses!!!
5.0,was a gift for my mother. .. she LOVES it!
5.0,Very cute and fits good
5.0,Looks great with my denim shirt!
5.0,"Better looking in person, very happy with purchase."
5.0,"I wanted a shoe that resembled a cowboy boot, but without the ""boot"".  This is a great shoe.  I love everything about it."
5.0,"Love the fit, feel and quality!"
5.0,Beautiful. Comfortable. Easy to put on.
5.0,Love it ...
5.0,Great pendant! Chain clasps could be better though.
5.0,This is a warm comfortable nightgown perfect for Maine winters.
5.0,Recently pierced my vertical labret and this bar was the perfect size to help out with the swelling. The quality is also great!
5.0,"Love the shape, lightweight, don't hurt my head, love they have the built-in nosepads so the pieces don't snag in my hair."
5.0,This  sturdy foam allows for better contouring! Absolutely love! Defines my waistline!
5.0,There great!
5.0,I absolutely love these glasses. I wear them daily for my admin job working virtually. I highly recommend these glasses!
5.0,Excellent bag for the price.  Looks like it should have cost a lot more.
5.0,Ordered this in 3 different sizes for 3 girls. Every one came in perfect and fit perfect. Definitely recommend.
5.0,"This product offers great compression and you are not likely to rip these getting them on like other compression socks or stockings. They are generally comfortable socks. However, just be aware that they are quite thick and warm. Not ideal for a hot summer day."
5.0,love these sunglasses
5.0,I am a shorty
5.0,Great value and looks nice.
5.0,"I bought these goggles because I wanted to have a pair that would be comfortable and would protect my eyes from the Florida mid-day sun. These goggles were what I hoped they would be. The entire frame is made of 100% silicone which makes them comfortable. They do not pull on your hair and have a no leak seal around the eyes. The lenses are  UV protected so it protects your eyes from the sun and I found myself no having to squint the whole time I was wearing them. Visibility of these goggles are fantastic. The anti-fog feature is also nice. For the most part they did not fog up like my last pairs have. After a period of time they did start a little but never got past unbearable.  Another added bonus is the silicone ear and nose plug, Both are also made with 100% silicone and have the same comfort as the goggles do. This product came with a protective case and micro fiber cloth to protect the goggles and wipe any smudges or fingerprints made on the lenses. I was very impressed with these and would recommend these to anyone who is training for any water sport or if you just want a good pair of goggles for a good time at your home pool. These will fit anyone of any age that can swim. my younger boy was able to fit in these no problem. I purchased these goggles free or at a discount for my honest and fair review. These are great goggles for the price."
5.0,"The socks are comfortable. I'm waiting for the sumeer to see how they feel then, but so far so good."
5.0,"I love the shape and color of these frames. They are sturdy yet modern and not ""clunky"" looking. They are deep enough for progressive lenses.<br /><br />A note about the seller; absolutely fantastic. I had occasion to communicate with them several times during the transaction. They were incredibly helpful and very quick to respond to questions. Combine that with a great price and it is hard to ask for more.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: The red pictured is a brighter red than the actual frame. The color is a bit more on the cordovan side. Also, if you are able to, it is useful to try on frames for shape and size beforehand. I wasn't able to but these frames proved perfect, nonetheless."
5.0,Please measure yourself before you pick a size...it definitely works to do so...I felt like such a fatty when I tried it on and it barely zipped.
5.0,Tf
5.0,"I ordered my true size of L. At first, I thought it was perfect, but they kept getting bigger as I wore them. I think I could easily size down and expect them to be fitted when I first put them on. I need the long length, so I don’t want to dry them."
5.0,Go great with my gym outfits!  Comfortable and practical.  Great service.
5.0,Love it! Read the reviews that it shrinks after washing so perfect for me I am 5’4’ and love wearing macis with sandals. Yay!
5.0,The material is so soft and it's going to fit better around baby's 1st Christmas if not before like maybe in the fall and I think that it's going to be wearable all Winter and it's going to be great to just pop my baby that is in a light T-shirt and deeper in the warm house I can pop him into this and go out through the store
5.0,I loved very confortable and warm
5.0,I will most likely buy in other colors. I recommend. Recvd quickly after ordering as well.  No issues.
5.0,"This top is great! A little thinner than expected but perfect for early fall. Also, the ribbing and balloon sleeves make it look more expensive and give a fun flare to a basic top."
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE MY SKIRT! WILL BUY OTHER COLORS AS WELL.
5.0,"Found it a bit tight for the finger I wanted to wear it on, but you can spread the ends apart pretty easily, making it adjustable."
5.0,I have had this bag for about 4 months.  It is super soft and holds a lot. I kind of want the larger size as well.  I get so many compliments on it.  I did take out the inner liner because it was more of a hassle than it was helpful so the inside is &#34;raw&#34; leather but I don't mind.  I like the look and love this bag!
5.0,Very nice! Same as on picture!
5.0,It hasn’t turned green and perfect size
5.0,I liked the length and the pockets best.
5.0,Absolutely love this!!!!
5.0,It is a nice sweatshirt
5.0,"After trying to install this band on my husband's watch unsuccessfully, I realized there was a small tool included to help with this task.  Using the provided tool made the job a snap! How incredibly nice to include this tool!  The quality of the band appears to be good.  The band I ordered is a Large one, and it fits my husband's very large wrist.  I am so very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,Wow these are awesome!!! A dozen handmade silk scarfs. The patterns are simply gorgeous. Much more than I expected.
5.0,I got this for my tragus and it is super cute. If fits nicely in my ear and looks really well made. I would definitely buy from them again!!
5.0,My two year old loves these shoes and can put them on himself.
5.0,Perfect product just how it was shown on website
5.0,works very well
5.0,It's beautiful!! I love it!! It's a gift for my daughter n law I'm sure she'll love it too!!! Thanks Amazon!!
5.0,"Loved this dress. The only issue i had was that the elastic from the shoulders snapped, but i was able to fix that."
5.0,Perfect fit. Good quality.
5.0,"I got some similar gloves (set of 12 pairs) for my husband to use while working on the car and using a chainsaw (messy, oily work) and decided to try a pair for use in the garden. I liked them so much I decided to buy some of my own in a different color so we could tell them apart.<br /><br />These are great for working where you need to have some flexibility--like planting small seeds--and they are protective enough that I wore them while pulling briars out of overgrown areas without puncturing my hands. Overall a great pair of work gloves for gardening OR for messy work like car repair of painting."
5.0,"I loved it, but to small..."
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for!
5.0,"Great watch,  always,get compliments,on it .  This my second one, I accidently broke the crystal on the first one"
5.0,Loved this tote!!
5.0,My sister and I wanted a new set to wear on Christmas and this worked for both a nighttime set and an outfit! Super cute and very comfortable.
5.0,"Like the way they fit, the way they feel and the way they look. I have been looking for slippers for a long time and because of the width I was not able to find any. These are the only slippers that I could afford that fit me.  Thank you Old Friend."
5.0,Great quality and fit great. Love the style
5.0,"I’m a true size 14, 5’7”, 36 DD. The dress fits great. Is a little too loose under the bodice, so a true empire waistline look would need help w a little tightening to make an impact."
5.0,I got these for my boyfriend and he loves them we are now getting to Joto set
5.0,"Amazing product, great buy!"
5.0,Little bigger than expected but she has room to grow so I'm okay with that
5.0,Do not hesitate to buy him! My kids named him Nacho the Gnome and we love him!<br />Best thing I've bought in a while!
5.0,great gift and looks wonderful
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for and expecting
5.0,"They fit perfect, with a size 8 shoe they were snug and didn’t roll off my heal like most."
5.0,"My calf sleeve helped my recovery and gave me access to a greater range of motion. While checking in with your doctor is critical in determining whether compression is warranted for your particular injury, I have experienced great comfort and seamless transition to walking with greater ease using these sleeves. They wash and wear beautifully, and add a moderate amount of pressure - read the labels, this sleeve is not at the high range of pressure for, say, active running, but suitable for me when I was walking, working and for my general activity level, including standing and sitting."
5.0,"I love these socks.  They come in great colors and are my favorite socks for cold weather.  They are so fun since they are color co-ordinated and mis-matched.  They last longer than any other socks I own.  A bit pricey, but worth it."
5.0,As expected. Soft.
5.0,Very beautiful!<br />Quality excellent!
5.0,"amazing hat. Light, soft and warm."
5.0,This ring is one of my favorites that i have ever bought. it is so comfortable to wear and i get compliments on it all the time. Wish the true love stood out a little more but other than that i love it to the max
5.0,So comfortable and sexy!  Loved it!
5.0,"This is a very useful clutch, it will hold all of the things I need but not be so big to handle."
5.0,love this.  It makes my fitbit look beautiful.
5.0,A classic:<br /><br />- Tells the time<br />- Has an alarm function<br />- Hourly reminder<br />- Green backlight<br />- Stopwatch
5.0,just what i was looking
5.0,Very nice quality really like it
5.0,"Love, love, love!!!! These are my new favorites."
5.0,Fits well and easy to wash/dry. Liked it so much I bought another.
5.0,The material is alittle thin but very light weight for intense lifts. Fits very well.
5.0,Our ministry gave these out to graduating high school seniors. Inexpensive and stylish for this generation. They are reminded of the message each time they look down.
5.0,The best sandals I've ever owned.
5.0,"Very comfortable, casual shirt that has worked well as a maternity top."
5.0,I followed the reviews and ordered a XXL. I normally wear like a 14 or 16 in dresses. I am 5’2 about 190 lbs. The dress fit me nicely and hugged my curves in all the right places.
5.0,Soooooo coool the blue tile/frost grays! And in my size? Super rare find online! Thank you Vans! And all involved as well!
5.0,"It looks exactly like the picture, maybe even better.  Fits great, looks great.  I love it!"
5.0,Bought these for my very active 8 year old son and he loves them.  He said he likes how soft and &#34;squishy&#34; they are and said they are very comfortable.
5.0,"Very nice! not cheap looking and for the price, it’s a steal."
5.0,Better than last replacement.  Has notches to keep retaining strap from slipping.
5.0,"What a terrific first wallet!  We decided to give actual cash (instead of a check) inside a kid's wallet for our 8 year old grandson's gift this year.  After reading reviews and shopping around I selected this wallet for the durability, zippered compartments and features listed in the product description.  When it arrived (fast delivery and carefully wrapped) I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and workmanship (made in the U.S.A.).  This is a wallet that any age would enjoy, but certainly something our 8 yr. old grandson (who loves anything army related) will love.  The clip on buckle is a nice added feature as well!"
5.0,"These are great, versatile belts.  Love that they stretch with you and are very comfortable.  Well made and good looking"
5.0,"Got it for my boyfriend, and he loves it. They're thin and comfortable. Good  for sports"
5.0,It fit as expected and washes great!
5.0,Love my purse!..small purse with so much room!..You’d surprised!
5.0,Such cute booties! Fit my 8 week old perfectly.
5.0,Cute visor and adjustable. Perfect for summer time!
5.0,As others notes you need to stuff something in the wig to get to stand up straight. Plastic bags did the trick for my wife
5.0,I love this wristlet! Great size! Holds a lot! Highly recommended!!!
5.0,Haven't worn it because it's a little big but good quality
5.0,"I don't care for this, but grandson loves them that's all that matters."
5.0,"Super cute. A little smaller than I expected, but cute."
5.0,They are so pretty! Fast shipping too. I am satisfied. You got me sooo excited for my wedding. Thanks! :)
5.0,LOVE YOUR SHOES !!!!
5.0,"Comes with so much stuff. Link removal tool, a bunch of links (even the one made just for Asus zenwatch) and looks fantastic"
5.0,"Can be used as a scarf, or opened up to wrap around shoulders like a shawl. Great for those chilly airline flights. Compact, light. Easy to pack. Great fabric - soft, inviting."
5.0,"Exactly as pictured, and well constructed. My artsy friend loved getting them and wears them all the time."
5.0,Has become my favorite watch because of its lightweight quality. At first I had the impression of it feeling cheap because of the weight but now I def appreciate it and my other stainless watches feel like anchors on my wrist.  Wear it during surfing swimming and when I forget to take it off at work chasing bad guys.  Pretty tough watch and looks great. Love the rubber watch band.
5.0,I recieved this band today and was super excited i got it faster than i had expected. It looks and feels really nice. I like the look of the original leather blush band that the moto gen 2 band comes with but felt like it was getting sweaty and worn out after 2 weeks of having it. I saw the reviews on this and i give 5 stars. I felt like it was a little pricey but after feeling the quality i feel like it is worth the money. If i feel differently later on about The band i will write another review. But so far so good.
5.0,So cute. Easy care and lots of compliments
5.0,"These are perfect stocking stuffers! I gave some to my daughter and my friend for Christmas, and they are perfect. Some people said the mermaid tale didn’t hold lip balm properly, but all you need to do is tuck the top in, and it’s just fine."
5.0,Omg I can't believe how gorgeous this is.
5.0,I was very suprised on the quality of this watch.  The watch has good weight to it and the face looks high quality. The leather band isn't bad either. It looks just like the Bell & Ross but for thousands less. I highly recommend.
5.0,I buy these for my husband. He works outside in the cold and he likes these because they aren't too hot or too cold. They wash well.
5.0,This is a very thin light-weight iPhone 7 case that is perfectly protective of my investment. And it is a beautiful addition the the phone itself. I am completely happy with my purchase and the fast shipping by Roybens. Thank you for providing such an outstanding product.
5.0,Super soft inside and my little mad absolutely loves them!
5.0,"Great boxers! Got it for my husband, he really likes it. Got size M as that's what he usually wears and it fits exactly right!"
5.0,This shirt arrived so fast! Looks just like the pictures and it fits true to size maybe slightly bigger than a medium but that’s how I like my tops anyway.🤷🏻‍♀️ I am 5”5’ and 150lbs for reference. As a big dachshund lover I had to snag this!!!
5.0,This is a great product. I have a family member who is visually impaired and relies heavily on this product. It is absolutely as advertised and such a relief since the company that seller products for visually impaired people gave me such a hard time trying to order from them. I highly recommend it for anyone with low vision issues.
5.0,"Very good quality, looks a lot better in person. Heavier feels solid, and colors are very vibrant. Overall greet product."
5.0,"This seller is amazing! Product is awesome!<br />After ordering, I realized the shirt might arrive later than needed. I contacted the seller and asked if there was anyway they could get it to me earlier. well, it arrived 2 whole days earlier! I'm grateful to the seller and the product is very nice. Nice quality cotton and the print is perfect. Please add more designs, loyal customer here!"
5.0,"I love this dress. It is so comfortable, it is light weight and doesn't cling."
5.0,"Didn’t notice the eye in the middle when I ordered it, it’s bright colorful and sure to crowd please regaurdless. I like going out looking kinda funky."
5.0,"This was a gift for my grandson.  Jersey type material,  true to size. My grandson is about 100 pounds."
5.0,Very beautiful and comfy!
5.0,Very cute and stylish! Great with leggings. Covers all the right areas
5.0,"I purchased this piece for my Matron of Honor, as an accent to her dress. It is lovely and is good quality for the price - very happy with it and my MOH loves it too!"
5.0,I love this dress! It’s a great price and very flowy and flattering. I am 5’4 about 118lbs and normally a size S/M and I got a small. It’s fits perfect and I did not have an issue with the neck hole being too tight like some other reviews said.
5.0,"I thought this dress would be a cheap material, but when I received it was so much more than I expected. I love this dress, I was surprised."
5.0,super supportive
5.0,"Product fit well and my son loves it- very comfortable, warm and fit well.  Customer service was above and BEYOND.  We had an issue and they kept in touch quickly, effectively and fixed our issue!  I was so impressed with how rapidly and regularly they communicated to make sure we were happy.  Thank you!"
5.0,This adorable scrubs runs extremely big. Measurement chart says a large has a 34.2 bust. It measures 23&#34; lying flat armpit to armpit which would make it a 46&#34; bust. See picture I have attached.
5.0,"I love yellow mustard, and everybody makes complements about this beautiful handbag.<br />Also it is very roomy and confortable.<br />Love it"
5.0,"Love my new socks! I was looking for socks that fit without showing; these show a tiny bit because my flats are so low, but the lace is so cute it looks like I'm showing it on purpose. Happy with this purchase."
5.0,"The glasses were a great purchase. Durable, flexible, and comfy. No complaints"
5.0,Favorite pair off Amazon so far.
5.0,"I received my necklaces not knowing what to expect at first but I absolutely loved them.  I think they are beautifully crafted and a very unique gift.  They turned out to be bigger than I initially thought about the size of a quarter,  maybe slightly bigger,  and were assembled very nicely. The two separate pieces fit together just like two puzzle pieces.  I was weary at first because of the cost of them but not disappointed one bit with the outcome.  I would certainly buy again."
5.0,This dress is lit 🤤😍 I’m in love
5.0,Love my new necklace! Great quality for price.  It comes in a beautiful navy box with a cute silver logo on it.  I also love the fact that a percentage of sales goes to keep our oceans plastic free.  I will defiantly buy another for a gift.
5.0,"When I was contacted after my order shipped that they would do whatever was necessary to make my order right, I really thought ""yeah sure you will"".  Then when the size was wrong, and it was MY FAULT and they STILL made it right!  I recommend ThunderFit and will be back when we inevitably need another set of rings!  AWESOME customer service!!"
5.0,"Bought these for the bridesmaids. Looks like these maybe a one time wear accessory. Necklace is pretty, looks just how it does in the picture, I was just expecting it feel a little more heavy. Metal is very light and dainty. Definitely not something you'd be able to wear everyday. Plus it came with a sticker warning on the back that it has lead in it... So definitely a one time wear thing. You get what you pay for. And it's worth what I purchased it for."
5.0,"We've been impressed with the A for Awesome clothing my children have tried so far. This sweatshirt seems well made and it looks nice. It's not super thick, so it's not for super cold days, but for mildly cooler days, it's perfect. The inside is somewhat of a terry cloth like material. It's not something I'd want against my skin, but my children always wear a T-shirt underneath their sweatshirt(so they can take it off if it gets hot). It's all only a single layer. The sleeves are designed to look like there's an extra layer underneath, but there's not really. The grey part of the sleeves is sewn onto the bottom of the yellow portion. My children have liked wearing it and I think it looks great on them. We've been pleased with it."
5.0,"I love the quality of this dress. I love that it has pockets. The bottom of the dress is a silky material & it feels great. It does sit about right on top of my feet, which is what I prefer. Received lots of compliments"
5.0,These shoestrings were fine.
5.0,This was a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves the dress. Very cute on her. Of good quality also. Nice that it has pockets.
5.0,Work perfectly
5.0,Cute not for blocking the sun but they are super cute
5.0,"I am a mechanic, been standing on concrete for 25 years. Trying to find something to ease back and leg stiffness and soreness. This was not it. Took 2 days and these hurt worse than original that came in my boots."
5.0,"This is a gorgeous, elegant, simple bracelet, really loved it. But was to small for my<br />wrist, ended up giving it to my sister."
5.0,"I bought it although it was to big hoping the stretchy material would work.<br />It is a true size 20 and very nice quality, just didn't work for me"
5.0,"These tank tops are the best I have ever purchased, excellent quality, very soft, not sheer at all. I will definitely be buying more in the future and will highly recommend to family and friends."
5.0,Bought this for my bf and he loves it. He gets tons of compliments on it.
5.0,Bought for my mother! She loved it and said she loved it
5.0,Very good quality and the colors are the perfect match. I wear this all day and find it very comfortable.
5.0,"My fiance who is a Minister loves this Prayer Shawl.  He loved the healing scriptures on it.  This is a perfect prayer shawl for anyone but especially for those who need any type of healing be it physical, emotional or mental.  This is the perfect gift to give to anyone who wants to be covered under the Blood of Jesus.  Our Mighty Lord and Savior"
5.0,Perfect sizing and great quality
5.0,"This piece is gorgeous and of great quality. I gave it as a gift, and the person's joy when she saw how beautiful it was was worth it."
5.0,Nice little shirt and my son loves it.
5.0,Cute Christmas masks. They fit his face very well but he said they felt a little tight in his ears (even at the loosest setting.) Hopefully we won’t need them next year!!
5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress. Bought it for a trip out west and ended up wearing it two days on the trip because it was so cute, so light, and so comfortable over my other dresses I packed."
5.0,My nephew got so many compliments on this romper so adorable!
5.0,This sports bra really surprised me. As a lot of people I'm on a budget. I wish I can afford the name brand but with a family it is hard to pay name brand. So with the price of this sports bra and the style I wanted it. It looks comfortable on the picture and feels even better.<br />The comfort level is great. Also the back support feels great. Even with no pads I feel you can still wear it plainly. The style and design is also eye catching. I would definitely recommend this sports bra. Like me you will not be dissapointed.
5.0,"Excellent fit, fast drying - after a tennis session where the hat got soaking wet I left it to dry and it dried up in about an hour. Best of all, the hat does not get stinky. A few sweat marks will form on the hat - just rinse it off with water and it is good to go. The sweat dries up quite fast so it does not drip onto your face. Highly recommend this product"
5.0,"This is our second set. Love them! Nice and soft and good quality but they do run really small. Meant to be tight fit but definitely size up. Our son is 24lbs, 35in and we got the 3T but could probably fit 4T."
5.0,I purchased these for a gift<br />i have them they wear and wash well and are warm esp. in the colder weather
5.0,Great product. Fits perfectly on my head. I will buy again
5.0,Fits perfectly- not too tight. Helps your legs to not feel fatigued half-way through the 12 hr shift!
5.0,"I love this. the scroll and cowboy are raised quite a bit and stand out. Easy to mount, good quality. Not 'too big' or too small'. Nice item. Cowboy up and get one bucko."
5.0,The quality is great and fit is just right ... designs are just right.  Fun and colorful but not too flashy or tacky!
5.0,Great gloves if you want to stay warm and still be able to use your phone. Fits easily in your pockets.
5.0,"Great dress, very flattering."
5.0,Truly beautiful! I use it with my essential oils.  Just love it!
5.0,Arrived before expected and fit properly.
5.0,Love these so much.  I shared with my 16 year old daughter.
5.0,She liked it and uses it every day :)
5.0,It's fits very nice..
5.0,"I’ve purchased this necklace for both of my adult daughters. One admired it when I got it for her sister, so I bought her one too."
5.0,These are so comfortable and such a great deal!  I love the colors as well!
5.0,The material wasn’t super sturdy.
5.0,Adorable bracelet for my 9 yr old niece.  She loves dance and this is perfect.  Looks exactly like the photo.  Recommend product and seller
5.0,Fits great. I wear with a belt and leggings and I got some compliments.
5.0,"nice fabric, comfort and sizing good."
5.0,I loved this bikini! Great value. I thought if it did not fit me my daughter could wear it. But it fit perfectly! I love the high waist briefs & the top had thick straps. The colors were beautiful! I do wish the top had an underwire for more support (38DD) but I think one could easily be sewn in since the opening for the padding is at the bottom. I feel sexy & not self-conscious like I usually do in bikinis. Can't wait for vacation now!
5.0,I LOVE these. They're a little thick but don't make you hot. I run hot and live in a hot and humid climate. They're thick but not hot and not too thin for winter. These are so soft (not silky but more jersey). They fit great. They're stylish. I highly recommend. I ordered size L when I was 158lb and 5'1. Wearing these while 6 months pregnant and I now weigh 199 and they still fit with so much room but didn't look too baggy before.
5.0,Fit great and had lots of compliments.  Made very well
5.0,It provides the protection from the sun that I need on my face.
5.0,"This dolphin was a gift to myself and it was even more beautiful than the photo.  A symbol of family, this lovely rememberance will bring many happy memories.  The quality and packaging was very impressive! Pat"
5.0,"Very attractive on my 8th grade grandson.  Fits well, was not very wrinkley once it comes out of the dryer."
5.0,"Love this dress, exactly what I expected."
5.0,comfortable says it all.
5.0,Great Value. Mask just as pictured. Good purchase.
5.0,I am so much in love with this purse and wallet set. I usually just use the wallet for everyday things. And use the purse when going places that I need to bring a lot of things to. The conceal and carry compartment to the purse is perfect for sneaking small wine bottles into the movie theater. I so wish the snap on the wallet was a hit stronger though. Sometimes it will just open and everything in the wallet comes out. But overall I am very happy with this purchase.
5.0,Loved the color and fit. Received several compliments.
5.0,"I  got it for the heart for a gold chain, so I can only say the heart is dainty and just like I wanted."
5.0,"Love it, super cute and comfy!"
5.0,"My daughter is a gymnast, she wore it at 2 separate practices and she loved it! I would say, it does run a little small."
5.0,"Es perfecto y muy cómodo, el tamaño es el normal para los Estados Unidos"
5.0,The size seems about right. Great shirt.
5.0,Great Shirt! The wife loved it.
5.0,"my wife loves these.. make sure you have a pair of needle nose pliers handy.. The center post unscrews from both sides, so if you tighten them down on one you can pick if you want to load via the front or back of your ear. also.. if you buy two different types of ear rings as long as they have the same back, you can effectively get 3 pairs of ear rings, since the back of the ear ring is what they use for the front of most fake gauge ear rings, so buy 2 get one free kinda lol!"
5.0,Great shirt and great quality. My son loves it!
5.0,Love it love the feel
5.0,"A little large, but workable.  The shoes go well with the dress I bought them to wear with."
5.0,The gloves look and fit great and work as advertised!
5.0,Lots of comments.would like the top of dress in lace.
5.0,Good fit. Excellent fabric. Love the color
5.0,Love this dress..got good compliments..
5.0,"Exacto al de la foto, tamaño, color. Excelente."
5.0,Great price and a great fit! I am petite and the 4-6 fit perfectly.
5.0,"Good fit, not see through. Arm holes are a little big on me, but I think putting it through the dryer will do the trick. I liked it so much I bought it in three colors!"
5.0,So cute and such great quality!
5.0,"Love this dress!  I use it as a beach cover-up, but I can pretty much go anywhere in it. Very comfortable!"
5.0,Good shipping time. Material feels great.
5.0,This is a beautiful scarf. It is soft and light weight.  It can be worn around the neck or as a head covering.
5.0,Soft & has held up nicely in the wash
5.0,Exactly what we were looking for
5.0,I love this jacket.
5.0,"The socks are good quality, very thick."
5.0,They are as described. They have held up well to washing.
5.0,really  nice folders pass port fit in well and the slots to pass port cards and other id's is nice
5.0,"Yep, looks just like the one in the movie!"
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with this suit. I was nervous getting it since it was a bit cheap and had no reviews but I got it and it's awesome! Fits well, I'm 6'3 190 lbs and I got the xl. The jacket is a little tight but fits, the pants have an adjustable waist so they were huge at first but adjusted nicely. I normally wear 34/34 and these adjusted to that size. The material is super comfy, feels like pajamas and they're super stretchy so you can move around in them easily. The color in the pictures is a lot duller than real life, they're much brighter and more vibrant which I liked. Overall, they look amazing, they're comfy, and they're adjustable so you can get a semi-custom fit. I would recommend and would buy again."
5.0,"I LOVE THESE!  As someone with a large head, these things stay put!!!  I wear them all the time just to keep my hair out of my face when I am playing with the kids or working out.  I don't find that they slip and they stay put all day.  I have washed them at least 20 times, with my regular laundry and they still look great and function the same as when I first bought them.  I did think that they had an odor when I first got them, like a chemical plastic type smell, but after several washings the smell was gone.  I love these and will totally be buying them again."
5.0,Nice for price.  Add to wolf costume.
5.0,"The colors are beautiful. The wrap is beautiful.  The fact that it's made of alpaca wool means it's very soft & comfortable.  Very fun to wear.  I'm 5'4 and rather chunky, but this fits nicely.  Overall, I think I personally prefer sleeves, but I really like this shawl.  I wear it around the house to keep the draft off my spine.  I also wear it out when I want to dress up my normal look.  It's very versatile."
5.0,What I like was it was cute
5.0,"For any BTS fan or Jungkook-stan, search no more because this is a great little addition to your wardrobe.<br /><br />The shirt is made from 65% Cotton and 35% Polyester. It was manufactured in China.<br /><br />The letters printed on the shirt are just a tiny bit glossy, but mostly matte, and seems to be almost stamped on the shirt. I was worried the letters would fall off after the first wash because they look very sensitive, but they've held up so far. I have accidentally thrown it in the dryer and, while it's survived, I wouldn't recommend it with any shirt that has this type of lettering or logos on it as they can start melting or falling off. On the front of my shirt it seems to have made the letters ""pop-out"" from the heat, but it is barely noticeable.<br /><br />As far as quality, it is not shabby at all; I don't expect the shirt to last me 10 years or anything, but I do think it will last me a decent amount of time. (I do want to note that I've only worn this shirt a handful of times since purchasing it almost a year ago because I want to preserve it as much as I can.)<br /><br />The shirt itself is a little see-through, but not a ridiculous amount. You can definitely replicate Jungkook's outfit from the Save Me music video as a result. In the pictures I am actually just wearing a nude-colored bra and you can't really see it indoors. This may not be the case outside on a sunny day, so just be mindful of your bra color if you aren't wearing another layer under! That being said, the shirt is not necessarily thin or anything! It holds up like any other t-shirt just fine as far as thickness.<br /><br />Overall, I like this shirt and think it's a good purchase!"
5.0,Loved the dress. Just too tight  returning for a larger size.
5.0,Great quality! Perfect for a small pendant!
5.0,These earrings are so amazing . I wore them for my 30th Birthday party  and they were perfect. They aren’t heavy at all and very comfortable. What I loved most was you could dress them up or dress them down.
5.0,"i really like this pendulum.its good quality.the only thing you need to know is when you put it in the pouch,leave the chain hanging out because if it gets tangeled up in the little spiral,its very difficult to get it out.other than that,its awesome."
5.0,These are the classic shirt stays used for many years in the military.  They do the job keeping your shirt tight and fitted while still comfortable.
5.0,"Love this shirt, fits great and is very comfortable!"
5.0,Pretty but A little plastic looking on the stones
5.0,My daughter loves it! She wears it everywhere and gets compliments
5.0,Beautiful dance wear. My daughter adored it and it was precious. She loves it so much I bought one for my niece too!
5.0,I bought this item and the package wasn't damaged whatsoever! It was in good condition and stretched well. I recommend buying this!
5.0,"I’m 6’ tall and wear a size 16. I ordered XL Tall and the length is good. In the pic where the dress is a little shorter, that’s where it sits naturally when I’ve walked around in it a little bit. In the pic where it’s longer, it’s after I pulled it down. I am barefooted in both pics. It would be too short if I wore it with heels. The material allows it to be pulled down/stretched a little and it will stay. I am wearing a white tank underneath or it would be VERY low cut, especially after it’s been pulled down to make it longer. Hopefully this will give my fellow tall girls a good idea of the length. I LOVE this dress and just bought the black & white one. It fits really well and to have a maxi dress that’s long enough is a miracle!"
5.0,Perfect size for a phone and the necessities.
5.0,"bought for a gift, very pleased with it"
5.0,So cute and comfortable. Like that it is adjustable.
5.0,Stuff your fingers in them it's good
5.0,"Gave them as a gift to my daughter and she loves them. Some days she wears them together, other days she wears on different fingers. 16 year old teenager approval"
5.0,My mother loved this gift. It is a good casual wear item. Delivered on time.
5.0,"hides flaws well, perfect for my age and body"
5.0,"Excellent quality, lightweight, and dependable. Great price too... well worth it!!"
5.0,Love these quilted bags.  This one is a littler smaller then I was looking for but still works out ok
5.0,Very comfotable and fits my long locks.....
5.0,"These came promptly and seem very sturdy, I was pleased with my order."
5.0,I don't plan on ever trying another brand for my workout bottoms. If you're in the market for workout capris/yoga pants- buy these! They are so comfy in comparison to others I have tried!
5.0,"Turns out the tie doesn't seem to actually go through the waistband, but rather sit on top of the shorts. See least that's how mine came, and if there are holes to slide it through, I haven't found them. They're comfy and breezy, I quite like them. I'm 5'2"" and they do sit well at my natural waist line."
5.0,Love these! Came with a great case too. Light weight and comfortable.
5.0,Absolutly gorgeous T. Justice League Dark is one of the few reasons to hold out for DC Comics.
5.0,nice material - nice fit
5.0,"Well, we wish they had an extra small (we bought the small) but my wife loves it anyway and I love the way it feels on her too even though the small does seem a bit BIG on her (she's 4' 11) so that's why we feel if there was an extra small version, that would probably actually ""fit"" better, but all in all, it's nice and comfy for her to sleep in."
5.0,Very nice cut and shape. Not too big and drapes well. Of course I got mine in black and it is very slimming. I love these tunic style tops and they are very in style this year
5.0,Got them for a friends birthday.  She has wanted these
5.0,My husband had a total shoulder replacement two weeks ago.  This shirt has been a lifesaver and is one of the best  purchases that I have ever made.  It's been a breeze to put on and fits well. The nurse practitioner at his surgeon's office was so impressed with the shirt when he went in to have his staples removed.  All she had to do was unsnap the top snaps and she was able to access the surgical site.  Someone even stopped us when we went to the store.  The material is super smooth and washes like a charm.  Going to get another one in white now.  Don't hesitate to buy it.
5.0,"Little tight putting the ear socks on, but they are a perfect fit"
5.0,Order one size up for a more relaxed fit! Overall great casual summer dress
5.0,Very cute jacket for the cat lover in your life!
5.0,My Granddaughter LOVED these .... I did not realize the blue stone would come out and could be used alone and the heart could be used with any other stud earrings  ..... Win ....Win ...  They are perfect  :-)
5.0,"Love these pants, I have pairs now.  They look dressy but feel like yoga pants.  My only complaint is that there are no pockets, but that would probably change the comfort.  They're a heavier fabric with a lot of stretch and somehow help smooth everything out. Love them with my boots and a longer top."
5.0,Loved everything about the product. No complaints.
5.0,Thank goodness I found the perfect socks for my tired legs
5.0,Love the purse/tote bag perfect size nice color and good quality
5.0,This is my 3rd pair. They are virtually indestructible. I wore these practically every day for 3 years in Florida. The only reason I had to purchase them again is because I lost the first pair and the second was destroyed by my new puppy who thought they made an excellent chew toy. They have much better arch support than most flip flops. The only downside is they are a bit narrow and took time to break in because the plastic is pretty stiff at first. The thick plastic can be a deal breaker for some. Also the arch support placement works great for me but might be an issue for some because there isn't a lot of give because of the stiffness of the material at first.
5.0,Love them very dressy
5.0,"Have been using this wallet for about a month now and love it. It's very organized and even holds my iPhone. Color is as shown and the quality seems good so,far."
5.0,"I bought these for a gift for my brother, he's a body builder, and he's very happy with them and the material, very nice, I recommend them."
5.0,Wish there were more colors.
5.0,"The color is so pretty and the quality is top notch. It is a little small for every day running around, but I knew that because the dimensions were listed in the description. I will keep it in a safe place and bring it out for special occasions."
5.0,I got this for my princess Bailey's birthday. We had some problems with shipping took an extra week to get here but she loves it and was worth the.little extra stress
5.0,"At first I was upset when I recieved an email that I was now going to recive my dress 2 days after my planned gender reveal party. But then it arrived the morning of fiuf! I love the dress it fit very nicely even though it’s not a maternity dress, it’s stretchy. I ordered the large, I am 165lbs 6 months prego bra size 36D (hope this helps)"
5.0,I like that it can be used with ANY type of mask and I don't feel like I'm being suffocated using it.
5.0,"The list picture is brighter and more vibrant than the actual shirt, but it's still a nice shade of lilac. Aside from being made of a differing fabric, this shirt is identical to the traditional white versions. It is very roomy and sewn well."
5.0,I bought the strawberry purse so so so so cute!!! I was able to not only got my IPhone 12 Max Pro in it but also my car keys and some chapstick! I completely recommend!
5.0,"My granddaughter loved her shirt.  The fit was good and Stitch was adorable. For me, the price was right."
5.0,I got them for my mom as a Christmas gift and boy does she love them. They're really good quality and came in a box and hard case to protect them.
5.0,I love these!! Great quality for the money and it’s so much better then spending $30 plus for each pair somewhere else.
5.0,Loved this tie . It was perfect for my costume
5.0,"I bought this to replace one that I'd been using as a work jacket for about 8 years. The stitching in one of the pockets was coming undone and the zipper pull was coming off so it was time.<br /><br />It fits snug but not tight. The hood is thick and does a great job of keeping your head warm. It's a light jacket so you'll be okay in a refrigerated cooler or outside in similar temperature.<br /><br />This will take a beating and I'll probably still use it for another 7-8 years. The cuffs don't wear out, the hoodie drawstring doesn't fray, and it's breathable enough that you probably won't sweat in it."
5.0,"great thanks my mom loved them. they are nice and light weight, heavy earrings hurt her ears so these were perfect."
5.0,This is a very pretty and flattering dress. I wore it to a friend's son's wedding and received many compliments.

5.0,Ease of replacing old band- pins are easy to push. Material is great
5.0,"No, we don’t understand why our wives want to be walking advertisements for some corporation. But we don’t have to. Pony up the salmon for this baby and your wife will love you more, at least until you really screw up again. Gift-giving doesn’t get easier. Buy it with One-Click and get back to watching the game."
5.0,Me gusta su comodidad
5.0,I bought this earphone dust plug as a charm for my nintendo switch and it is perfect 💕
5.0,Comfy summer style dress
5.0,Very pleased with the items I couldn't stop trying the different styles. Perfect!!!!
5.0,"With five tops for $20, this little package of cropped tanks is a great deal. they are a little bit shorter than I expected, but I think they're great for wearing around the house, layering underneath your clothing, or wearing out if you're feeling brave. I'm 5 foot 4 + 115 lbs, I ordered a size small. one thing I'd note about these tank tops is that there is a stretchy band around the bottom. it isn't so tight that it will dig into your flesh but it's a nice addition especially if you're going to use these for layering, because it prevents it from riding up. all of the colors appear nice and as advertised, and the tank tops are not too thin or see-through. They are all opaque and have a nice soft quality to them. if you like cropped tank tops this is a great way to stock up on the basics."
5.0,Great item at a great price
5.0,No complaints. Arrived in good condition. It’s exactly what I wanted.
5.0,"Super stretchy, beautiful bright color, pockets are a plus, soft fabric. I just had a baby so I love that it made me look slimmer, I looked and felt great in it, but hides my jiggly belly. It is super long so I'll have to figure out how to adjust the bottom so it doesn't drag (I'm 5'4). I've lost weight since delivering so ordered a Large and is not snug, has great flow. I order the pink color and it's very bold. I may order in additional colors."
5.0,I love how it keeps me warm and dry without being to bulky under my work uniform. I work in all kinds of weather and I like that I'm not sweating in these like my previous cotton thermal sets.
5.0,"Very supportive, doesn’t slip on pool floor"
5.0,Loved the feel of the fabric. Flattering to the body even for us plus size women. Will be ordering again.
5.0,"Fits nice, very soft and very warm. Love this hat, I wear it to work outside."
5.0,"Nice and comfortable, also flexible so i can stretch it on my somewhat large head even with hair rollers in, love it"
5.0,"I'm very pleased with this purchase.These pants are a bit more heavy duty than I expected, which is a good thing for cooler weather. The pants have a nice high waist and they're loose-fitting, but by no means baggy. And they are extremely comfortable to wear. The quality is excellent! A great buy for the price! I strongly recommend!"
5.0,Excelent...
5.0,I bought these boots for my daughter. She loves them. They are really adorable and very comfortable!
5.0,"We've now bought 4 pairs of these. They are sweatpant material on the outside, but it is nice enough looking. They are easy for my daughter to put on and match. She is tall and thin; the pants are slightly loose on her."
5.0,Perfect length and built well.  Fits great.
5.0,They are super cute and soft. My little man loves them
5.0,Perfect for going under a costume tutu.
5.0,I received these free with a sleep mask purchase. These earrings are very pretty and I'm actually giving them as a gift!
5.0,Perfect little booties. Just love them.
5.0,I brought this product for my little great niece 7th Birthday unicorn sleepover party. It was beautiful as shown by site pic. Ordered a size 7.
5.0,I love this dress! Pockets are perfect and it’s so comfy!!
5.0,"I was skeptical of this item due to reviews about quality. There were SO many options that came up when searching for this item but I'm glad I went with this one! I said the fit was ""as expected"" because I sized up to a medium (normally a small) for an oversized fit and it fits me exactly as I was hoping. It is thin but very warm and soft. Definitely a great layering piece and it's long enough to wear with leggings, which is another reason why I sized up. As far as where the ""quilted"" material meets the fuzzy material, mine seems to be just fine. No puckering of the seam or strings, just what so far is a quality pullover."
5.0,Nice material but a little too short.
5.0,You cant beat that Casio quality. This watch has that distinctive retro look.I get many compliments on this watch.
5.0,This band looks great. The lines are imperfect but it's not noticeable unless you are up close.
5.0,Excellent weight
5.0,"This watch is killer! It’s obviously an import and all blacked-out so, it’s gonna cost ya... What a cool piece though. I love the fact that the buttons are easily accessable unlike some of the other G-Shocks I’ve had. I can press them with gloves on which helps in the field."
5.0,Absolutely love this dress. fits perfectly and love that it grows with my baby bump
5.0,"Open the packaged and was thrilled! Nice and sturdy, if you like the CELINE's you will LOVE THESE.. Ordering in more colors, and for family and friends! You need these in your life."
5.0,"*Note* skimming through the other reviews there seems to be some confusion about how the chronograph works and about the 24-hour clock dial. Both work great as long as you know how to use them and set them.<br /><br />This watch is a bit of an experiment for me. I have smaller wrists so a lot of men's watches are oversized and I have a lot of excess watch band. So I decided to see if a woman's watch would fit better. It does fit but I was surprised by how significantly smaller both the watch face and band are compared to most men's watches. I really like the watch but I don't think I'll be repeating the experiment with future watches. Now let's get to the important stuff!<br /><br />One of the key things I look for with watches is legibility. What's the use of a watch if you can't easily tell the time? When I look at my watch I want to be able to precisely tell the hour, the minute, the second, and date with zero ambiguity. Unfortunately a lot of watches sacrifice legibility for the sake of fashion. I'm happy to report that this watch neatly balances both.<br /><br />Hours and minutes are clearly marked in the watch face. The minute and second hands are long enough that you can easily tell what they're pointing to at a glance. The 24 hour dial not only looks good but it's a really nice detail that I particularly appreciate. It makes setting the date and time a lot easier and there have been times when I've been so tired that I have known if it's am or pm. It also looks cool. The 24-hour dial is the one at the 3:00 position. When setting the time (pull the crown all the way out), make sure you're not 12 hours off. So if you're trying to set it for 7:00 am, the 24-hour dial should be pointing at 7 and not 14. Vice versa if you're trying to set it for 7:00 pm. As mentioned it makes setting the date an absolute breeze, since you can set it the day of (pull the crown to the middle position) since you instantly know whether or not the watch is in am or pm. No need to set the date to the day before and then start twirling around the crown until you cross midnight. It makes things a lot easier compared to other watches with a date indicator.<br /><br />It's not a requirement for my analog watches, but I really like having a chronograph. It's a really handy function that comes up a lot more than you would expect. I tested this watch's chronograph against my other analogs, my digital watches, my cell phone and computer and it does appear to be true. There is no millisecond dial, it's just seconds and minutes. Which is fine by me the watch is too small to accurately read milliseconds and I very rarely need that level of accuracy.<br /><br />Switchology is the same as you'll typically find on other analog watches with chronographs. The button on the top starts and stops. The button on the bottom freezes and resets. To start timing, press the top button. When you're done press it again and the timer will stop. Pressing the top button again will start time again from that point. If you want to reset back to zero, with the timer stopped press the bottom button. The dials will twirl back to zero. It's fun to watch. With the timer running you can freeze the dials, you can better note the time without stopping the timer. This is good for things like laps. Press the bottom button with the timer running to freeze. Once you have noted the time press the bottom button again and the dials twirl forward to the current time.<br /><br />Overall this is a beautiful watch that has both form and function. I feel it absolutely justifies its price. I think it's a great piece if you want to keep it for yourself or give it as a gift. I'm incredibly happy with it."
5.0,they are comfy and fit great
5.0,"I like this band, it's really feminine and pretty.  They were cheaper when I bought this one.  I cant' buy another until the price come down.  I would like a white and black one."

5.0,"My fav pair of glasses, they fit just as described, and are so posh!"
5.0,Been wearing these in Navy blue for 2 yrs. decided they’re so comfortable that I’d buy the pink ones as my next frame. My eye  Dr. put my prescription in them with no issues.
5.0,Catches the light and sparkles . Unless you're a jeweler can't tell the difference. Beautiful setting.
5.0,"Get lots of compliments, very comfy"
5.0,Purchased this as a cheaper alternative to a Lularoe Perfect and can say I will be buying more in other colors!! Fit perfect and the material is very soft and breathable. Looked geeat with my leggings. Very happy with my purchase!
5.0,Love it - ordered one size to big but im keeping it for my sister - thats how much i love the ring.

5.0,I wanted this to wear with my watch and it’s even better than I thought it would be.
5.0,Very flattering and feels good
5.0,"My mom didn't realize how small it would be (I warned her) but it worked out for the best, I love it. I just had to take the silly strap off of it, the strap didn't secure flush with itself so there was like this huge loop when I let the strap out as far as it would go. The belt loop thing was too tight and wouldn't fit the strap."
5.0,LOVE THESE!!!!  Will make awesome jewelry!  Thanks!
5.0,Very cute and true to color!!
5.0,Super comfortable for daily wear. You will love these.
5.0,These earrings are nice. Screw backs are a little tiny. I bought them for my toddler so getting the tiny screw backs on is a little difficult. The earrings are exactly what I expected though.
5.0,It was heavy duty.  It will last and he loves anything with daddy on it.  it was a great stocking stuffer
5.0,"Comes in a simulated black velvet bag with the company name written across the front of the bag in silver ink. People are complaining the ball does not screw off, it is not supposed to unscrew this is a cuff not an earing and it says that in the title. People are not reading the description. I bought the gold tone, it is very beautiful and really sparkles, the picture does not do it justice, looks high end. I have not wore them yet so I will update this product review after I try them on, but for now 5 stars very beautiful."
5.0,This is a gorgeous top and it arrived far earlier than anticipated it's everything it looks like in the picture and if I weren't so bust it would fit perfectly I own one in every color made they're grey one is really more of a slate or a bluish-gray the white one is really a standout as as the beige one really a great price for the stock
5.0,"This dress is super classy and the color is stunning. I love the quality- it's very heavy but I like the material a lot. I'm 5'2&#34; and the length was actually pretty good for me. It kind of does poof out on its own, but if you like that extra fluff, I'd recommend getting a petticoat."
5.0,Fits as expected. She loves it! Didnt expect the seams to be on the outside but it looks nice and clean
5.0,Fun for Christmas parties
5.0,"Great, I loved it"
5.0,very elegant and looks beautifull good for a gift or for yourself
5.0,"I've been searching for these bras FOREVER!!<br />I can Finally get rid of the ones I had for YEARS! They're So Old; but they're the ONLY bras that made me look &#34;Just Right&#34; in fitted tops!<br />Even w/ the padding, it gives you a Very Natural Look. Your breast shape & cleavage don't look fake. I'm a 36B and when I wore it to gat sized at a bra store, the lady told me I was a 36D!!! I had to confess that I had on a 2-Size Bra. She said &#34;That's a Good Looking Bra! I couldn't even tell that was padding!&#34;<br />And the fact that I got 6 for less than what I paid for 2 is a BONUS!!!!<br />They Fit Just Right!!"
5.0,Have to order a large size. Beautiful product but runs really small
5.0,Dainty but sparkly - GORGEOUS!
5.0,Product fits well and comfortable. Will definitely buy from seller again!
5.0,I wear this set with everything
5.0,Arrived in very nice box
5.0,"Size was exactly what I thought it would be, quality pin !!"
5.0,"I bought this for a friend.  She said she  really likes it, and I think it's really cute and colorful."
5.0,love itall my friends want one
5.0,I thought this would be a pretty cheap item. I was wrong.  It was much better quality than I expected.<br /><br />Can’t go wrong with this purchase.
5.0,Looks nice and a great fit!
5.0,just like is shown
5.0,"This dress is well sewn, not see threw. Not to short or long. It's beautiful quality. And for my over plump body figure is very flattering to my curves. 5'9&#34; 240lbs order 2xl. The marks on the green are marks from my mirror"
5.0,Love these cufflinks! They're the perfect size - not too small or unnoticeable. They worked as the perfect add-on birthday gift! You won't be disappointed.
5.0,"These Boxer Briefs have fit wonderfully on my 3 year old who is absolutely thrilled to have some big boy undies now.<br />He has only been wearing the traditional, tighty-whitey style underwear ever since he became potty trained, so this was a pleasant surprise for him and also a new “no going back to the old undies” for him. These look like something his dad wears and he officially feels like he has graduated to a new stage in life. I am very happy that these have given him so much confidence and I’m glad I tried them. They have washed really well and their quality has been really soft and nice. I also appreciated the variety in this particular pack, giving my son many different choices throughout his week.<br />We would recommend them!!"
5.0,"Cute cute cute, perfect for the party we attended. It was to big for me, so I snipped the hatband and realigned to fit my head, stapled the band and glued the material back together. It was perfect!"
5.0,Super comfy dress! I was pleasantly surprised after I put it on. The weight is nice. It doesn't feel cheap and I like the way it hangs. You also can't go wrong with pockets. ;)
5.0,Exactly as described and I got so many compliments on my accessories for a 20s themed wedding
5.0,"I love it. I was concerned it would look cheap but no, it looks just like the picture. I was also concerned about the strap getting loose, nope! it stays in place and it is easy to adjust. Great buy!"
5.0,"I would call this a rain jacket instead of a coat since it's a light vinyl material. Only the hood is lined in a thin jersey, the rest of the jacket isn't. This jacket is perfect for spring/summer rainy weather and provides good coverage for a 3-4 year old. I bought it for my 2.5yo daughter so I can get more wear out of it. It has a really cute Shopkins print on the front and back, and the color is as shown. My daughter really loves it as she's super into Shopkins right now!"
5.0,Nice fit. The color is nice and bright like the picture. I like the stretch waist ban. The fabric feels nice and is comfortable.
5.0,Excellent product. It fits maybe a little larger than expected but not a big deal at all
5.0,Good cover up!
5.0,"Perfect size to fit everything I'd like to and might need to day to day. I only use it when going out and black just goes well with about everything, and that chain is just such a cool touch. Love it."
5.0,Sturdy and strong! I probably should have gotten a medium or just a large because the extra large was a little too big. 🤔
5.0,I typically wear a large to extra-large and most shirts so I ordered the XL/XXL in the shirt because I do not like stuff that fits super tight. Well let me tell you this thing still is pretty darn snug but not unbearable. The functionality on a hot day out ways the slight discomfort.
5.0,"This bag is such a great deal!  It’s a nice size cross body, not too small ( fits wallet, phone, keys …) but also not too big! I’ve gotten so many compliments on it! I’ll be ordering more colors!"
5.0,I was very satisifed with this item.  I normally only wear 14kt gold jewelry but needed a silver slide to go with my gold reversible omega necklace for a certain top and this was perfect for what I needed.  I would definitely recommend this item.
5.0,"Great,cute sunglasses. happy I bought!"
5.0,"Very comfortable and pretty. I got the turquoise and it's a nice, muted color that goes with lots of things."
5.0,"Love this shirt, very comfy and cute tooL"
5.0,"We bought for Disney World! We got so many compliments and my daughter loves it! Highly recommend, super cute."
5.0,"Love this bracelet. Had it for 3 or 4 years. The only thing is that you kind of have to bend it to get it on/off your wrist, so it changes shape over time. You can kind of bend it back, so it's like an artwork in process, always changing. I just pulled mine out of the jewelry drawer, polished it with a soft cloth and a little baking soda, bent it into shape a little, and it's good to go. I have others like this, but this is my favorite."
5.0,Very cute. Flower is perfect size
5.0,Recovering lulu addict!! Super impressed with these flattering soft and comfy leggings- been looking and trying ALL brands and I’m happy to say the search is over. I’m a yoga teacher and wear 10-12 yoga pants a week and frankly was over paying Lululemon prices! Getting these in every color! I’m wearing an XS and they fit true to size. Flattering but not constructing. My hurt is not flattened out in these as you can see from the photo. 5’2” 114lbs with 36 hips 26 waist
5.0,Love this dress. Received so many compliments.  Wish it came all the way to the floor on me but it's still a great dress
5.0,I play a lot of golf.  I also sweat a lot and in the summer I need something to absorb the sweat.  These visors are comfortable and sporty.
5.0,"This beautiful bag is everything I had hoped for!  Of course, I had seen it in Macy's for $95.00 and didn't want to pay that much.  Thank you, Amazon!  It looks like leather, very good quality, beautiful printed fabric lining and the deep turquoise color is rich and attention-grabbing.  You won't be disappointed in this one!  I like the large size, but it's not too large for me because I'm 5'9"" tall.  Love it, love it, love it!!"
5.0,I am so happy I found this! It fit perfectly on my daughter and Everything was as expected! Material was great and Jersey was perfect!
5.0,I like these bellbottoms jeans the fit is perfect I'm 5'0 feet tall and about 150 lbs and I got a small I will order these again if the price is right.
5.0,"It is beautiful, exactly as pictured!"
5.0,"Very comfortable. After first wash, no issues like shrinkage, unravelling of stitches. Love it!"
5.0,Very soft and warm.
5.0,The graphic on this shirt is so vivid and its beautiful. I was scared about how it would fit but I'm 5'3&#34; 150 and fits like a baggy dress shirt.
5.0,"In the picture I posted, the one next to Yeppsys’ is the leggings from Victoria's secret.<br /><br />I am not big for Leggings and wear them only when I work out at home.<br /><br />Almost all my leggings are from Victoria secrets as it fits me well, and when I saw Yeepsys one showed up on my recommendation page, I solely picked it as it looks so similar to one I wear during stretching (right after I wake up and right before I go to bed). The timing was just right too as you can see, the one I used to wear was coming apart.<br /><br />To my surprise, Yeepsys one was actually of a better quality with a thicker material so it held the body better. I would have loved it more if it was XS but still I was really satisfied with these leggings.<br /><br />Since this style and feel is the one I like the most for my stretching sessions, I would definitely order more. I actually wanted to order more right away but it became unavailable for now.<br /><br />If you want something comfy and functional, you probably won’t regret getting this one :)"
5.0,Perfect in every way....
5.0,Excellent product! Very comfortable. Highly recommended.
5.0,"Bought this for my son last year when he was a college student and studied a semester abroad.  The luggage has been heavily used, he literally travelled all over Europe and moved across the country when he graduated and it still looks great and functions like new!  He has not had a single issue with any piece.  I would highly recommend purchasing this set.  I am so impressed that I plan on buying a set for myself."
5.0,Very nice quality and a little bigger than I'd expected.  They are still a really nice size though.  I've received a lot of compliments on them.
5.0,"I really like everything about this nightgown, the fit, the feel of the fabric and it washes up beautifully."
5.0,"Regardless of what you believe about the metaphysical properties of stones, this is an impressive jewelry item. It is set on flexible metal wires (not elastic) and has high quality findings. It would be appropriate for any wrists, be they he/she/they. Sodalite is said to relieve nightmares and fears and sometimes the reminding and intention is all we need. This bracelet was given as a much-appreciated gift. This would make an elegant addition to a collection of natural stone stackables and it is lovely on its own too!"
5.0,"So adorable! The only concern I had when I purchased it was that it might be too heavy, as I don't like heavy earrings. I needn't have worried. It's not heavy at all. Love it!"
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my mom and she loved it! Shipping was fast and the product was packaged very nicely!
5.0,Worth the money because when you buy other 1s for like 20$ it tears within the 3rd week also this 1 s very durable and you could wash it with your hos and hang it outside to dry worth the fifty
5.0,Great gift for any Miami fan!!!
5.0,they fit perfectly and very unique!
5.0,Given as a gift to the ultimate Martin Truex fan and he loved it.
5.0,Four I had to purchase this because I wanted to see if the legend of the &#34;white whale&#34; watch from Japan was true. Did they really start turning out a quality mechanical product with a quality real leather band for under $30 delivered . It hadn't never been done before end take it from somebody who's own dozens of high-end Invicta's and many other Swiss made timepieces. I have my hat off to this company and a few others other competitors now that are turning out beautiful products for an affordable price where this at least three times a week . I'm shocked but very happy.

5.0,I just received my purse and I absolutely love it.  It is just the right size; not too small; not too large. It's PERFECT.  This purse will work extremely well for traveling because of the shoulder strap. It is also well-made and totally worth the money.

5.0,Nice kippah but wish it was a bit larger
5.0,These are great quality and very vibrant in color!
5.0,"I have used these for years. They are thick, poofie, and add that extra bit I need in my steel toe boots. Every once in a while, I wear through the toe and have to get more. That is true of every sock, but these don't also wear out in other places. So they last as well or better than any other socks I have had and are more comfortable. They are also on the warm side, so if you don't want sweaty feet, don't get them."
5.0,"Excellent watch for a young girl. Screen will allow taps and drags, although it is not very responsive. Camera and video works, although low resolution. In spite of those limitations, this is watch is very good for the price, especially since I gifted it to my 7 year old niece."
5.0,Great dress - fit well and a great color!  Would buy again - love the neckline.
5.0,I love the pockets and the neckline is very flattering.
5.0,"Works great, I got no complaints."
5.0,"I already have a few of this style gave my son one in which he loved the, quality and color assortment."
5.0,This was a perfect outfit for the wedding I attended.  Fit perfect and was comfortable all night.
5.0,Perfect...a great addition to our families game nights with Mega Monopoly
5.0,Bought for my husband to wear when we renew our vows at the beach. Worth the buy
5.0,Comfort and ease of packing
5.0,Perfect fit. Great buy. Going to buy another
5.0,cant wait for winter to put it to the test.
5.0,I love these leggings. I have two already and plan on getting more. Super comfortable and length is perfect for short girls like me! I’m 5’ 2”. They come up as ankle length for me which is what I like.
5.0,Fancy Fashion! Matches easy
5.0,My husband love it!!!!!!!!
5.0,My son loves it !
5.0,Awesome! Love it.
5.0,I LOVE this dress. I want every color! I've bought the royal blue and wine and love how they look and feel. They wash nice and keep their color and form.
5.0,Very good quality for the price I love it
5.0,My new favorite shoes
5.0,Product arrived very fast and was better than expected.  It also cost a lot less than those selling locally. It's great for carrying credit cards etc.
5.0,"Quick shipping.  These sandals are a great summer time neutral.  They are easy to dress up with a skirt or sundress, or go more casual with jeans, capris, shorts.  Nice light, cork and gold color goes with everything.  Comfort and support as expected from Vionics.  All the straps are adjustable.  Nice sandals!"
5.0,"I love the idea that I can put allergic to nsaids, comfort of sleeve and doesn't look cheap or take away from the watch at all."
5.0,I really enjoyed these boots they fit comfortably throughout the day.
5.0,"This product fits perfect! I absolutely love the color, the underwire support and the overall fit. I do have a shorter torso and this fits nicely below the waist - if you have a long torso this probably is going to be too short. It has a slimming effect too. I was just glad that it offers a higher neckline but when I tried it on, it looked so much better than expected. Good quality. I’m a 38DD and the size 10 is great for what I was looking for. I don’t expect bathing suits to fit like a bra, just to keep my boobs covered and supported.<br />This is my second Magicsuit tankini and I love both! I use them daily on summer to hit the pool/ beach and they are good quality.<br />Arrived earlier than expected. Super happy with this product and seller!"
5.0,Will be buying more in other styles and colors this is a cute durable bag. I am not a purse type of person yet I feel like a straight backpack isn't for me either so I got best of both worlds with this bag!
5.0,i bought one size bigger than my measurements and fits perfect.
5.0,"I bought 2 in different sizes since I'm at the beach. At the pool, I like it comfortable so I wear the larger. If you want to get in waves, you will want it more snug."
5.0,"I love the way this mask feels. It completely covers your face without coming up, or the need to keep adjusting it to fit your face. Great purchase!! Repping the best Sorority in the land, DELTA SIGMA THETA!"
5.0,"Very pleasantly surprised to get this very attractive top. Fit well, just loose enough to be very comfortable. Little different from my usual choices, and I am so glad that I got it. It is one of my most comfortable and favorite tops and goes with almost everything. Great value, too. Would recommend to others."
5.0,Great product. A pleasure to do business with.
5.0,The watch is awesome. Got this as a gift for my sister
5.0,Order this for my daughter. As soon as I took this out of the bag and she felt it she snatched it up. It is super soft and very comfortable. She wears a size small but she's used to things order online being too small. So we ordered a medium. It's a little big on her but she likes it that way. I would say we could have ordered her true size and been fine.
5.0,"I can not believe the great quality of this umbrella! It completely shades my 10x12 deck and was the perfect solution after looking at pop up gazebos. I did have to buy a super sturdy base to keep it in place, but I found one for dirt cheap on amazon! This umbrella is easy to put up, take down, and even completely remove in case of real bad weather. One person operation, looks fantastic, and the price was ridiculously low. I'm going to enjoy this umbrella for several seasons, easily!"
5.0,Always find uses on the boat. Not just keys
5.0,"Fits great, works great!"
5.0,Good quality and cute print. I can’t wait to use these bags
5.0,My husband loves his keychains. Huge Star Wars nerd. His keys take a beating every now and then. He’s had it since Christmas and Vader is strong with the force. Great gift.
5.0,love them! perfect size and exactly what I expected!
5.0,So happy show up in time !!! Beautiful color!! Will buy from them again!<br />Thank you.<br />Dawn Krueger<br />Sheboygan
5.0,💕 these boots they are SO comfy I’m buying another pair right now 😘
5.0,"Cute cap! A little big, but my hair hasn't grown back from chemo."
5.0,Protective
5.0,Great sun protection but unsure how to tighten strap
5.0,Too tight over the bra
5.0,"The material is thinner than I expected, but the fit is perfect!"
5.0,"I love it. It has a great color and plenty of space for all of the stuff I need to keep in my wallet. I am sure it fits the phone (S4 mini) I ordered it for, but not with the existing protective case I had on the phone, so I never use it for that purpose. Overall, pretty pleased with the product."
5.0,Looks just like it does in the picture can't wait to see my daughter's face when she opens it on Christmas she's a super big Dr. Who fan and put it on her Christmas list!!!
5.0,I got all of the pieces in the set for my Mom she loves them! What a bargain to! Really cute.
5.0,I will buy more but next time one size up . I bought a large should have gotten the xlarge instead..
5.0,Beautyfull! Very good quality.
5.0,Awesome shorts! They fit perfect and really cute! Love these shorts!
5.0,I really love it .  Would buy it again in a different color.
5.0,Awesome watch from the Seiko limited edition series. There's something about a 23 jewel automatic watch that says life alone keeps it ticking.
5.0,Easily better than any Dr. Scholls trash you can buy.<br />These are the cure for aching feet if you're on your feet a lot.<br />They give my running shoes a second life when I put a lot of miles on them.
5.0,Great hat. I love it.
5.0,"Not stretchy, but super cute!"
5.0,I am on my feet for a good part of the day and these prevent them from hurting.  I have very high arches and these slippers give my feet the support they need.  This is my second pair of Orthaheel Slippers.  The first pair I kept until I wore them out at the bottom.
5.0,The pants looks just like the photo it is perfect
5.0,"Love this, super cute and I get lots of complements."
5.0,"This is my second time purchasing this hat; the old one got dirty and I didn't feel like washing it =)<br /><br />I'd buy it a 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th time, maybe something else on the 7th but no promises."
5.0,"This is a fantastic rash guard, after i ordered up two sizes and thew out the pads.<br />I wear it over the top of other swimsuits. The one that works best is a nike swim top that is shapped more like a sports bra.<br /><br />I burned myself into blisters a few summers ago so i just need the coverage for my chest and shoulders, this is perfect for that. Its very light weight when swimming and dries quickly in the air.<br /><br />+ The print isnt just flowers, all the spandex in the world and I dont understand why all the rash guards are Hawaiian print flowers.<br />Im going to grab a second one."
5.0,Terrific quality. So much so I ordered other items from Della Q.
5.0,I loved it. So cute and fit me so nice. Probably my favorite dress I own now! :)

5.0,Perfect for what it is!
5.0,Great socks! Very comfortable and durable. They do not show when I wear sneakers.<br /><br />Walking 5 miles per day on a trip to Canada exclusively using these socks. They kept my feet from smelly. Nice socks for summer.
5.0,"LOVE IT. The electric blue color is so bright and pretty. NOT see through even while squatting. Pretty sweat wicking as well. I'm a heavy sweater and usually avoid colored leggings but these held up good. Best leggings I've ever bought for this price range.<br /><br />I'm 5'3.5, 120-125lbs, ~24in waist muscular build and usually a size 0-2 in jeans. I ordered the XS and they fit perfect."
5.0,amazing went 2 sizes up as most reveiws complained was 2 tight  i think you should too :) ps I LOVE IT
5.0,I love this bag. It is much smaller then the other one I used but it fits everything. Because it has zippers everywhere you can separate your items well. I have room left over!
5.0,Cute! They fit well and stayed on through rock climbing. I was very excited because I have trouble with sunglasses not staying on my face.
5.0,I needed these key chain loops to hang a bird feeder outside.  They are working great.  I could not get key loops big enough but I have strung several together and they are working out well.
5.0,Love them they look so real.
5.0,Fit my father in law and he loves it
5.0,Very solid ring. Purchased it as a Christmas gift and hubby loves it.
5.0,"I bought these for myself after I tried my husbands and loved them !, even tho I'm a girl that weighs 120 lbs tha mans large fits me perfect , room to layer if I need , and they're long enough to cover my ankles !"
5.0,"I ordered a Medium. I am 5'7 145lbs, athletic build. It fit perfect. It is really form fitting but the crisscross design in the front does keep it flattering. Perfect for work. I like the length but it does ride up a little when walking... Will probably order in more colors!"
5.0,"Was extremely worried this would be too short. I'm 5' 6&#34;, 130lbs and am a DDD. I usually wear a size large in dresses to make sure it fits my bust.  I ordered a large and it fits like it should and the length is perfect. Looks expensive and is well made. Love it!!!"
5.0,I purchased a size small and they fit exactly as I thought they would. Length wise they come to right above my ankles. If you’re short like I am( I’m about 5’3) it’s really nice to find a pair of leggings that are the proper length for your body.
5.0,"Purchased this as a gift for my son who gives it 5 stars! He said the sound quality is excellent, unit is easy to use and works great. Beanie is warm and comfortable. He highly recommends."
5.0,Perfect! This is the best gift for any dads or grandpas that love to hunt!
5.0,Awesome item. Look great over any glasses!
5.0,Classy stylish underwear for a toddler. I keep buying them as he grows.
5.0,"I love it...I love old fashioned, and that's what it says to me; also feminine and delicate. Thank  you!"
5.0,I love this suit!  Adorable vintage feel.  Fit my &#34;mom&#34; body as expected.  Hides the things I want hidden.
5.0,I love Thinx love their mission. Love that I can not wear tampons or cup the first and last days of my period and love the security in between. As a teacher they bring me mental and physical comfort and peace of mind on my heaviest days
5.0,Perfect for the gym! I ordered 2 pairs but different colors.
5.0,"It's a bit big and bulky, but has good controls (esp the intermittent wind setting), winds 2 watches simultaneously, and holds 3 more for convenience. Quiet enough for my bedroom, and I'm noise sensitive."
5.0,"My 8 year old daughter loves them, what more do I need to say?  Well made, have held up well so far!"
5.0,"Material is thick and feels durable.  Mesh side pockets for water bottles are great.  Good zipper although I wish it had dual zippers.  Good metal rings.  Overall, a nice clear bag!"
5.0,Love everything except the straps should be adjustable.  Really cuts into my neck
5.0,The jersey fits and looks great.
5.0,"Fit perfect, my daughter loved it<br />Excelent quality and perfect size"
5.0,"A very comfortable band. At first I thought that the holes would not look very good, but when wearing it they are barely noticeable. I recommend it highly."
5.0,The product fitted greater then expected and material and design was nicer than shows in photo so that was a great surprise and very pleasing! Thank you for the great product and care to detail in the craft.
5.0,Nice and delicate...good price for such good quality<br /><br />I love it
5.0,"For many years I relied on a silver polishing cloth from a very well known manufacturer. I ordered a new cloth last month, and I realized the company had changed the product: it did not remove any tarnish at all! I returned those cloths and bought the Sabrina Silver cloths hoping they would work. And they do work! It takes some elbow grease, but the tarnish comes off! I recommend this product!"
5.0,...material. I love rompers# and i love this outfit. I also ordered one in wine color..
5.0,I love this case!  It's built well and holds A LOT!!!  Great price and fast shipping.  Will be buying another in a different color!
5.0,10/10
5.0,I love this earring for my upper ear of cartilage. It fit perfect doesn't snag or bother me whatsoever.
5.0,These Bermuda are slim but have a lot of stretch! True to size!
5.0,I wear these at work in the winter. I am on my feet all day and walk throughout the day! I definitely noticed that over the last few weeks my spider veins on the outer part of my thighs have reduced to the point where honestly I was like wow omg where did they go!! Not a 100% gone but I see it!! Now if I sit down and not do much I do feel uncomfortable maybe it would be better if I got a larger size but without movement I can’t wear them! Otherwise I love!
5.0,"Love the material, looks really nice"
5.0,I love these!!!
5.0,These are super fun holiday earrings.  They would make a great gift.  I fell in love with them so nobody got my pair as a gift!  If you like bells as Christmas...buy these earrings!
5.0,"Fresh, soft material."
5.0,It fit
5.0,Doesn't turn your finger green or change colors. I wear it everyday!
5.0,Super adorable! Came in a nice little sac. Full metal rims (thought they were plastic)! Beautiful rainbow colored lenses. I want a pair for myself! LOL 😍
5.0,Nice for st Patrick's day. My husband wore it proudly tho he is of German heritage. Green beer is universal
5.0,Fit like a second skin. No chafing.
5.0,Perfect for working out! Was not disappointed!
5.0,So much prettier than pictured!
5.0,"Love the comfort.  I’m 5’ tall and expected it to be a little longer based on the model in the picture.  All I. All, I’m happy with it."
5.0,I gave as a gift to a bride.
5.0,"I love this dress. When I received it, I was looking forward to wearing to church on Sunday. But, when I tried it on, it didn't fit. 😔😔I was so disappointed. I hope you guys have other dresses for me to buy from in the future."
5.0,I love it and I have not seen it any in the store.
5.0,"Es hermoso y estiliza la figura, ya pedí otro en diferente color realmente me encanta"
5.0,It was beautiful. My daughter loved it.
5.0,I love this ring fits perfectly looks great too A+++
5.0,"Didnt realize how great these socks were until I walked up the stairs, pain free, for the first time in years!!"
5.0,Love it.  Keeps me warm
5.0,"My wife loves it!!  I'm currently on deployment and I like to send little things home so she knows I'm thinking of her.  It's been hit or miss but this one was a definite hit!!!  She was so happy with this purchase, she sent me a pic wearing it, telling me how happy she was with the selection."
5.0,"This is an umbrella able to withstand strong winds. The top of mine is black and the underside is blue. A sliver of the blue fabric comes over the black on top, so you have a nice accent of blue around the rim. The stitching is impeccable.<br /><br />Press the button and it extends the rod and opens the canopy. Press the button again, and it collapses the canopy making it easier to close the umbrella. The canopy is large enough for two people to huddle under. Very nicely done!"
5.0,"Love these glasses. They are fun and adorable, and I get many compliments on them. Plus, they were very affordable!"
5.0,Great wallet alternative!!
5.0,Fix perfect
5.0,Comfy & Stylish.
5.0,"After buying some junk from other dealers I was pleasantly surprised ... for the money this is an excellent necklace, and I will not hesitate to buy more expensive items from this seller."
5.0,I love it..though it was on the larger side it worked..thanks
5.0,Very nice presentation in a black box ready to wrap. I bought this for my supervisor at work - she has three min-pins. I think it's a nice little gift without being over-the-top - something that says &#34;I'm thinking of you - but not all the time!&#34; LOL  This also arrived 2-3 days early and that's always impressive. I would buy one of these ornaments again - definitely.
5.0,They work great.  I use the Non-polarized because i have a heads-up display and polarized lens block a heads-up display.
5.0,Great sweater for the price.
5.0,I love the way the it fit in my nose. Just what I was expecting.
5.0,Good quality and fit. Very true to size
5.0,"Material diff then I thought, but absolutely love it and looks super cute on."
5.0,"I love this top! Have the purple and black.  So grateful that I discovered PB last year!  I am 5‘8“ tall, size 2-4, with an hourglass shape.  Shopping in stores is a nightmare.  Love the way PB’s styling flatters my shape.  The extra length that her sweaters and tops provide has been a lifelong search for me.  Size medium in PB always works great for me."
5.0,"Excellent safety shoes. Since they have a composite toe, there is no need to take them off to go through security on airports (if you are TSA Pre in the U.S., that is). I was glad to see they were extremely comfortable and lightweight. Usually I don't travel with safety shoes, but these are like sneakers, really comfortable.<br /><br />I don't care much for the neon green shoe laces, so I swapped them with these Lock Lases (http://amzn.to/2gkZBrS) and they look terrific. Excellent built quality overall."
5.0,Love this hat! It’s soft and warm over my ears. Best of all are the snaps - you can snap it under your chin and customize the fit. Thinking of getting more as gifts. Adorably dorky as a bonus :)).
5.0,Makes the watch look more expensive
5.0,"As described, on time, good shape."
5.0,The dress is beautiful and a very flattering look. It was prefect for the event!

5.0,Beautiful Belt - I bought two. High Quality.
5.0,I loved this dress! It fit great and was comfy.
5.0,Went by the size chart and it's perfect for the pool!
5.0,They are very nice for the price!<br />I Love them!<br />Would also make a Great gift!
5.0,I purposely bought the next size up as I tend to like things looser. It fits great (loose around the mid section) the arms are a bit large but gives me plenty room and all range of motion. I tend to have issues with womens shirts due to having broad shoulders but do not have a problem with this shirt.
5.0,They are so cute I havent had the days if the weeks written on my butt since I was a kid! I wish I would've purchased 2 packs when they were on sale! I bought these to wear and sell and Wednesday is already gone😔
5.0,Gave to a HSchool grad
5.0,LOVE 💜 these plugs so much. 🍄 The little blue💙mushrooms are so cute! I love these glass plugs so much! High quality glass. Both of the plugs are the correct size 2G 6MM and the lip on the end isn’t too big that you aren’t able to get it through your hole in your lobes. I do recommend you be fully healed for a while before you attempt this style plug. I’m a fresh 6MM so it was sort of a pain and hurt a little bit. So definitely wait until you know your lobes are healed and healthy beforehand. They are perfectly made. The price is reasonable and they are Prime eligible. Love the BLUE 🧢🧢because the fun ones actually have the beautiful 💙 🧢 🧢💙 if you look closely. Excellent in every way. Definitely recommend picking up a pair of these plugs. You won’t be disappointed! 💯
5.0,Dad loves it uses it all the time

5.0,holds smaller frame glasses well
5.0,Llego lo esperado
5.0,"Bought two pairs, Fit perfect,"
5.0,"Love it fabric is knit but of good quality, fits perfectly"
5.0,"I wear a medium.  Size chart said to order a large, so I did.  It is loose.  The fit is cute for general wear or to be layered on top of other articles.<br />Love the quality of this shirt.<br />I am more petite.  The sleeves are long on me (not uncommon).  The waist band hits me below my belly button.<br />The wool is soft and lux.<br />The color is as advertised.<br /><br />I am a big fan of this shirt.  I will wear this a lot.  It suits me well."
5.0,"Great with a light sweater - keeps you plenty warm, and hood doesn't get in the way."
5.0,Nice addition especially to off the shoulder dress
5.0,"My son says very comfortable, adds a layer for warmth but not heavy. Good for skiing or cold days in the City. Likes the pattern/colors."
5.0,It may need to be taken in a smidge but I really like it... and it came in 3 days kuddos!! I got it to wear to my boyfriends military ball :-)
5.0,My grandaughter needed tihs for school!
5.0,Great bands. Fit perfect. My daughters love them and the colors! Thank you
5.0,I bought a small and it fits perfect ! I am 5”5 and 120 pounds . Form fitting with beautiful detailed sleeves. Perfect with jeans and boots for a night out.
5.0,Just nice. Love it.
5.0,This band is comfortable! I love how it just one and stretch and fit to my wrist! My new fav to wear everyday!
5.0,Please do not buy these if you are 4xl because these do not fit. 4xl fits an Xl. But these are nice for control top underwear for xl Woman.
5.0,"I absolutely love the style and the comfort of these. I did actually return them unfortunately because they were very unflattering on my body style. Even though they didn't work for me, I would still recommend."
5.0,"looks great, gift, well received"
5.0,Nice and stretchy and good length for a headwrap. Beautiful color
5.0,This is a nice ring to have. I have a job where I wash many dishes and not once has the color faded from this ring from repeatedly dipping my hands into hot and chemical-water.
5.0,"Really wasn't sure what to expect from this, but I bought this on a recommendation from my sister. She is a pretty thin athletic type and I am a non athletic apple shaped person so, what works for her doesn't always work for me. But I have bee pleasantly surprised that this belt has been great! It holds my pants where I want them and I'm not constantly having to pull them up, and it does not dig into my belly while doing so. It is the most comfortable belt I own. So far it is the perfect belt. I will be back to order in more colors!"
5.0,Needed a thick sneaker lace roses are perfect
5.0,Me encantan.
5.0,Loved the value for the amount in the box.
5.0,Awesome piece with a nice presence but not over the top.  Well made and sturdy.

5.0,Love these earrings and would buy them in every possible color if they offered them. Super lightweight and beautiful colors!
5.0,Very satisfied with the product
5.0,If you’re one of those guys is has a little bit bigger head and always find sunglasses off the rack that pinch your head These are the ones for you. The temples are adjustable so you can make them as long or short as you need and they don’t squeeze your brain!
5.0,"Product is exactly as described. My only complaint is that the bead cannot be removed from the necklace without cutting the cord. While the necklace has held up, it does feel and look a little cheap."
5.0,"Love them. Not to big, fit Well, delivered fast. I really like the springs in them. They help so they don't hurt your ears after a while of wearing them"
5.0,I have to tell you I bought many clothing items off of Amazon and this specific item really impressed me with how well the shirt is stitched and the nice and comfortable the material is. My boyfriend is usually a medium and I ordered a medium and it fit perfect! This shirt is made for an athletic body. If you don't have an athletic body I suggest buying a larger size not a fitted size. I will definitely purchase the shirt again for my boyfriend.
5.0,"Born Lewisa Brown Croc boots are very comfortable. I wear them at work, and I am on my feet all day long walking on a hard surface; the boots have special insoles that Born Shoes are famous for. I bought those online because I was confident of the brand, since I own 8 pairs of Born shoes: 2 boots, 1 flip-flap, 3 open toe shoes with new and improved designs, and 2 boots. I LOVE THEM!"
5.0,Got these as a gift and love them! In particular I like having the larger sizes as opposed to one small/medium/large as the small ones tend to not be very useful. Would definitely recommend. The purple is a lovely color too.
5.0,"I have had this wallet for a week now, and I adore it! It is stylish leather, attractive, and holds everything I need it to other than my cell phone. Some phones may be able to fit, but I don't want to stretch the leather too much. It holds cards, license, check book, cash, change, and receipts. Plenty of pockets. A++!"
5.0,Lovely and affordable way to brighten someone’s birthday
5.0,I like how easy-to-use they are
5.0,Love the two bracelets that I purchased. A fantastic gift and message. Love the little gift bags!
5.0,Feel soft and comfortable.
5.0,"To my delight, my granddaughter was mortified.  &#34;Mutant ninja grandma&#34; she muttered.  Ah they are my favorite now!"
5.0,"I love this hat.  I ordered the size they suggested, but it was a bit too snug.  Hopefully it will stretch out some.  I took this hat on a trip with the Boy Scouts to the Florida Keys, were we lived aboard a 63' schooner for 5 days and went scuba diving a dozen times on several reef areas. The chin strap and the back-of-the-head strap kept it firmly in place the whole time. The drop-down neck cover worked great.  My neck and face stayed free of sunburns for the entire week.The hat never made my head feel too hot.  I love the inside pocket, too."
5.0,Soft material. My daughter love it.
5.0,Fit well!!
5.0,"The best running sunglasses! Lightweight, doesn’t fog up during your run. Very comfy."
5.0,Hilarious sticker on quality material.

5.0,It is beautiful!
5.0,My husband  loves it it’s just kinda tight and he needs help taking it off he wears extra large in regular shirts
5.0,Bought this dress for my engagement party and I cant wait to wear it. I tried it on and its very sexy. Size chart was on point. I found that you can hike the skirt up a little if you want a shorter look.
5.0,My 7 year old uses them for basketball he likes it
5.0,Exactly what i ordered. would recommend to others if they are looking for a great gift for themselves of someone else.
5.0,"Very nicely made, my teenage daughter needed some light weight pajamas asap and these are perfect!<br />Lovely material ( the pants are so soft, lightweight and comfy!) and the top is loose, as pjs should be. She loves them! :) They actually look MUCH  better in person!! I think we'll have to get another few sets in different colours (we got the blue as is on the model- blue top and blue pants) I was actually concerned that some of the colours offered came with a khaki type pant- I realise now that's a plus! Because you can absolutely wear them out to run errands, etc! Love these Capri pants!! So glad they have a drawstring too!!<br />They are very basic and simple but my baby slept so comfortably in these last few nights since we got them- worth every penny!<br />Thank you PajamaMania !! :)"

5.0,"Excellent price, Excellent product, and fast shipping!!!"
5.0,They look great but I put the another brand in my glasses first so I can't elaborate on how well they fit but they look great
5.0,It was to long for me.
5.0,"I got these for my husband because he decided he likes shorts with tights under them. He uses them to lounge around rather than work out, but they must be comfy because he wears them all day long. Even though they are 2 layers, they are lightweight. He wears 2XL and I was worried that they might not fit well, but he hasn't complained which in husband language means everything is good (believe me, if they were too tight or didn't fit correctly he would have said so. I got another brand at the same time as these and he complained about those being too tight)."
5.0,"Super comfortable.  Easy to wear. Great colors.  I'm a little bit of a runt, so the length is a little longer than I expected."
5.0,"I have a safety pin that goes on my spare tire carrier. It needs a key ring which connects to a Carabiner. The key ring I had quickly broke, so I got this titanium key ring as a replacement. It works great. It’s stronger and lighter than standard key rings. I also use it on my house/car keys too. Great product,"
5.0,Super cute and exactly as pictured! I got rave reviews while on vacation! They are really comfortable.  I rather large head😂 and there was no stretching.
5.0,Cute!! I love the look and fit!

5.0,"Got here in a timely manner, and was exactly what I expected."
5.0,I love the dress. The cut out in the bottom is so cute.
5.0,"I'm pretty sure our original ones got (mistakenly) thrown away. We waited a month or two to even look for replacements because I was worried about how much they would cost. Imagine my surprise, and delight, to find these. We added them to the remotes last night and they worked great!"
5.0,Fantastic dress!
5.0,"Great product, Great Seller!!!"
5.0,Perfect fit . Cropped top. Good quality .
5.0,I really like the look and feel of this coat.  It looks just as pictured and I’m really pleased it fits per size.  The material is also not scratchy which is a plus.  I would recommend this to a friend.
5.0,Beautiful skirt when I tried it on. I love the pattern.
5.0,complimented the rose gold band exactly
5.0,great band looks great
5.0,"First day out, the local cops had to have a photo with him. Ebenezer The Evil Dwarf Dog is not only adorable, but toasty warm. Great price, excellent quality. BTW, this item is embellished with actual embroidery, not a stencil."
5.0,Good looking product & decent quality. Good value for the price.
5.0,"It’s the perfect weight, not to heavy or bulky, yet not flimsy at all. I needed a new keychain when I got my new car. I love the sleek design. I had too many things on my old keychain, it was a hot mess !"

5.0,Sparkling!!!  Very festive!!
5.0,"got these to use in some cotton sports bras i usually just lounge in. love that these give some extra lift so it looks more like i'm wearing an actual bra if i'm running errands quick. these were a little too large for the bra since it's built more for light padding, but still worked out for me"
5.0,Great Item.  These are perfect to exercise in.  Thanks
5.0,Lo que esperaba con la compra.
5.0,I love it. My two year old looooves it. She wants to wear it everyday so it has been washed a lot since Christmas and colors are as bright as first day. I wish they had other Disney movies like Zootopia ( Judy specifically) because I would be getting that too. Recommend.
5.0,"I have many watches in a wide range of price categories ($200 -$2800).  This brand is an undiscovered gem. I bought the watch for my brother who has not yet adjusted to the fact that watches have gotten quite a bit larger than the old 38 mil. At 42 mil it looks a bit larger but the details and finishing of this watch are way above its price category (I paid $385).  This brand to me is an undiscovered gem and I would get them quick before they get popular and the price goes skyward. Definitely finished and looks like a $1,000 watch."
5.0,These readers are a great value and they look cool too!
5.0,It’s beautiful! One of me daughter’s Christmas presents.
5.0,I got an X Large and it fits perfectly. The material is soft and the design is just to cute!

5.0,Success with a happy girl who loves the item.
5.0,Exactly as pictured.  I love the color and I like that the logo is small/hard to see
5.0,"Flattering fit, really soft material"
5.0,ORDERED MORE JUST AS SOON AS I SAW HOW WELL THEY LAUNDERED UP.
5.0,Not often you find very good quality clothing at such a good price! I'm familiar with the seven brand and know they fit me well. I'm very happy with these!
5.0,I purchased this for my friend to wear in a fashion show and it fit her perfectly!
5.0,Very useful and much better than a backpack for daily use and travel
5.0,"What a deal. These are exactly what I hoped to find. I wear glasses, so the nose wire is crucial. Good quality cotton, should last a while. Totally satisfied."
5.0,Love this bag. Very easy to Carry with different strap options and like the pockets and zippers. Fabric feels nice and is sturdy bag.
5.0,"I have a small medium head and this fits well over the ears. Got one for my brother who’s head is a bit bigger, and it fits him, too."
5.0,The goes were comfortable and fit well. I booth one for myself and two daughters. We all like them. They are light and not super thick.
5.0,"Cute, casual and comfortable!"
5.0,"The quality is very good, and I like the oval stone."
5.0,I just got this product a few days ago and I can't stop wearing it. I really  like how it was packaged. It came in a little light blue bag and the jewelry came in a little clear plastic bag and there's 2 cards that came in the bag. One is a business card and one is for how to wear the jewelry and how to take care of it. I was really happy that it came with the cards (thanks for the info Jujubeads!!). I will defiantly buy from them again.
5.0,"I walk a lot and need a great sock or I will blister. These work great and the compression is excellent, not overkill like some socks.<br /><br />The sock on the bottom has around 300 miles on it and been washed 8-10 times. The sock on the top about 100 miles and been washed 3 times.  They are dried on a drying rack.<br /><br />I will reorder these socks!"
5.0,"My husband really likes them and they are comfortable. The tighs are too loose, we might need to go a smaller size next time."
5.0,I got sooo many compliments.. People didn’t believe I got it from Amazon.. I went a size up!
5.0,"Very high quality with an attractive style, these are some of her favorites."
5.0,I bought this to try different facemasks with my daughter to have some variety and to see which one she likes the best. This neck gaiter is very lightweight and soft. She likes the ease of use and the pattern is super cute. I definitely recommend this product!
5.0,"I got 2 pair of these for 2 of my grand daughters.They are big into B-Ball! They really are cute and stand out,very shiny! Good price for a little bling!"
5.0,"needed this product to wake up. it works great, had a small hiccup with the app but their customer service was great and promptly got me taken care of"
5.0,When I tell you I LOOOOOOOVE this DRESS!!!! I received sooooo many compliments!!! I would definitely recommend!!!
5.0,"In June I had surgery on my foot which required wearing a boot up to the knee. Going to doctor appointments made it difficult to wear anything I had in my closet. I found these wonderful pants and they were just what I needed. So I have ordered 3 more pair in different beautiful colors. They wash very nicely. I do Iron mine.....and everything else I own. Need I tell you too, that I have received many compliments with people inquiring where they were purchased. What more could I ask for when they were fairly priced, received in a timely manner and shipping was free! Thank you Amazon and thank you for allowing to share my thoughts."
5.0,It fits fine and very much warm here in New York weather which is currently 0°C ..happy with my purchase thanks.
5.0,"Ordered two sizes up, for it to be longer and larger than normal, and it is so very comfy! Will definitely buy more colors if wanted. The purple looks very nice too!"
5.0,I love the dress even the material is great
5.0,I wore this out with suntan thigh highs and wedge sandals. Every time I turned a corner someone would come up and say what a beautiful dress!
5.0,Well made medium thickness fabric. Fabric is soft and comfortable.
5.0,"This top is so flattering that I went back and bought it in more colors and found short sleeve versions for the spring/summer.  It is on the longer side so is perfect for leggings.  It gathers some at the hip so it distracts from any belly pouches.  And the v-neck is also very flattering.  Overall, it draws the eyes to the most flattering parts of the body while camouflaging the areas we tend to want to hide the most.  I highly recommend."
5.0,"I love this band. It is comfortable, fits great, is stylish, and is durable. It is true to color and I had no issue attaching my Fitbit to it. I would highly recommend!"
5.0,These gloves were a gift for my son. He loves them. Would definitely buy again
5.0,OMG  I love how this dress fits it accentuates every curve of my body!!!
5.0,The wife loved it and her Ruger .380 fits perfect. Really quality craftsmanship. Very sturdy.
5.0,"Great product, delivered with lots of care & follow-up."
5.0,Made me look terrible
5.0,My almost 13 year old is very happy with these.  They are polarized.
5.0,Was a gift and he loved it. Good quality product.
5.0,Great for evening driving!
5.0,"The color screams look at me, the entire suite scream rich vibes - it’s flattering for all body types. For $ 30.00, a third of a decent suite, you getting an amazing suit that’s a confidence booster ."
5.0,I got so many compliments the very first time I wore this. I ordered my true size and was happy with the fit. Not to tight and not too large. It’s a great lightweight cardigan. I will be ordering more!
5.0,Awesome purse!! Just too big for what I needed it for. Well made and so beautiful. I returned it but now I'm thinking maybe I should've kept it. It is a purse worth owning especially if you are a Marilyn fan.
5.0,"These are sturdy, don't fade, are comfortable and hold up to washing very well."
5.0,Love these socks!!!!
5.0,Good quality material fits a little small
5.0,"128lbs 5’6, 34C with W long torso and wide rib rage. I’m usually a size 6 in tops and 4 in bottoms so went for a M in this.<br /><br />It fits the torso well for length and overall fits but I’d have more tummy control with the S and probably a better fit around the chest.  That said it’s perfectly wearable and not too loose. It’s not a revealing swim suit and will be great for actual swimming, paddle boarding and boating. You won’t have to worry about anything popping out.<br /><br />Overall I really like it and will wear it a lot this summer. Throw a wrap skirt on it and you’ve got a decent day wear summer outfit."
5.0,A must have ladies... This bra really holds eveything together... Smiles... It's also really comfortable...
5.0,My four year old wants to wear these all the time.
5.0,The material is great and it fits perfect!
5.0,They worked very well.
5.0,I actually misunderstood these shades to be transparent pink. They’re shiny reflective pink. Not my preference at all but great shades
5.0,Love love love quality
5.0,"I’m a 38dd normally and recently have lost some weight. After reading the comments I went with a 40d and it’s perfect. The fabric is soft, the straps are supportive but not fugly and the front clasp doesn’t feel like it’s going to bust open. I’ll be ordering more!!"
5.0,Excellent quality and well made. Will definitely buy boxer shorts again from these folks in the future.
5.0,Got for my wife loved them ready for more
5.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and 120lbs and the Small fit sooo well. I loved it! It is so flattering, and its thick and made well. so no see through mishaps or rips. The length is appropriate, as its not too long or too short, hits a few inches above my knee (but im short). i think it would look even cuter on a 5'5&#34; girl as it would look more like a t shirt dress. I wore it out during the day and at night for a date. The shimmer of the dress definitely catches eyes and i noticed people looking but it was probably bc i looked really good in this dress, so who cares!"
5.0,These are pretty but very dark. The seller has sent two very nice messages offering to send me a different pair. You don’t see that kind of excellent customer service anywhere these days. I’m definitely a fan. Hoping the replacement pair is not quite as dark 🙏🏻👍<br />Edit 6/20/22 ~ Holota sent me Two pairs for free after I told them I thought the first pair was a little too dark. I’ve never had better customer service in my Life! The new pairs are both perfect ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
5.0,"This shower curtain was even better than I expected. It is high quality fabric, and can even be used without a liner. A bonus is that it came with hooks, which I hadn't noticed when ordering it. I definitely recommend this product."
5.0,I love these for my one year old. They are sturdy and flexible at the same time and fit perfectly for her chubby feet lol.
5.0,very nice looking bracelet!!! Its a bit hard to clasp but Im getting it!
5.0,It looks great on her.  She's very happy with how it feels
5.0,"I love how it feels, how it flows and how it fits.  The color is perfect."
5.0,Its tiny but perfect size for a young girl.  Great quality and super cute added to the bead bracelet.
5.0,fits great///
5.0,My husband loves the hat. Well made.
5.0,The elephant sits right in my bellybutton and I like that.
5.0,Nice small token gift. Gave to my friend who is just like a brother to us.
5.0,"I love the fabric and the construction of this lightweight jacket.  It keeps out the wind and the rain when I take my dog to dog park every morning.  I also like the large pockets --- perfect for carrying tennis balls, keys, phones, etc.  Another thing I like is the ease with which it launders and comes out good as new.  Finally, I like the front closure.  It has a zipper and storm flap with snaps, not velcro.  Velcro is the worst closure for a jacket because it gets gobbed up with fuzz  and eventually the velcro doesn't hold the jacket closed.  But this one has snaps so no worries.  My one quibble is the velcro strips on the cuffs.  I would have preferred a snap or two.  I also would have preferred a detachable hood like the Squall jackets I've bought in the past.  But otherwise, this is a great, sturdy jacket."
5.0,Loved this tunic.  Longer top so enjoyed that I could wear with biker shorts.  Wore to outside rock concert and it was perfect.  I don’t like to wear fitted items so this was perfect.
5.0,Very nice simple necklace<br />Great customer service
5.0,My daughter loved them.  She normally wears a shoe size 3 and the size 2 rain boot fit best.  These were already tried in a creek and there were no leaks.
5.0,"This is a really cute hat, but for some reason it reminds me of one my grandmother used to wear.  It's kind of old-fashioned looking but still very cute.  It's really comfortable to wear and I like that it has a chin strap in case it gets windy while wearing it.  I will be saving this hat probably for cooler days since it's dark and will get warm when worn in the sunlight.  It's very well made the inside has a very attractive material."
5.0,Great rolling wheels (every direction) and nice size. Perfect for air travel. Fits under the seat or in the overhead. The front zippered pocket accommodates my MacBook Pro 15&#34; laptop with no problem. Plenty of additional storage space.
5.0,returned the first pair and bought a L. it was too difficult to pull up since I have wrist issues. had to return.
5.0,I bought this dress in black for an upcoming wedding and it’s prefect for the event. I’m 6’1 and plus size and this dress was prefect. It actually touched the floor when trying it on. I did buy it up in size just in case.
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. He really likes it, said it was comfortable. Fits as expected."
5.0,"I was excited about these but I wasn't 100% sure about them when I ordered them. Some reviews said they were really dark so I was a bit concerned with that, but in my opinion they're not too dark AT ALL. They're perfect. They're big though so you have to like that look.<br />Another thing that made me really happy is that the lenses are not too close to my eyes. I wear pretty big eyelashes and I just HATE when they hit the lenses. But they don't in these glasses. I love that they're all plastic which makes them good for keeping my hair out of my face when Im not using them for the sun. Would like to get these in another color."
5.0,I adore this jacket!
5.0,Love these PJ’s. They are super cute and super comfy. Definitely recommend buying them. I got size S and it fits perfect.
5.0,"Great hat, quality made, love this thing"
5.0,The color caught my eye and it fit like a glove
5.0,Is very beautiful
5.0,Liked a lot! No complaints
5.0,The mask is comfortable And adjustable it’s well worth its price I will buy from this seller again
5.0,"Cute little flower was late to arrive, but arrive it did. Beautiful and just as described."
5.0,Fits great and looks super cute. I love how you can move the cuff and clench it to fit your ear.
5.0,My granddaughter love made for the young
5.0,Get lots of compliments
5.0,"This belt is high quality, it is hard to find belts this good. I bought it for a costume but it's so good that I will use it daily. And at this price it's a great deal. I believe that this belt will last me 10 years<br />Edit after 1 year:<br />I love this belt, I am seeing some negative reviews on this belt here and that makes me sad. I hope that the quality didn't change or something cause the one I have is the most solid belt I've ever owned and I will certainly buy another when/if it gives up. Unfortunately it does leave polish on my khakis but it's not visible when I'm wearing the belt so I don't care. Someone in the reviews here says that can be remedied by laying it in the sun for a while, I'll have to give that a try. Seriously though,  this is an awesome belt, you should buy it. All the belts I have owned always get warped, cracked, and shredded by this point. This belt still looks new, and feels new."
5.0,This is so cute for a toddler or preschooler!
5.0,My son normally wears a men’s small to medium I order the medium I am pleased with the fit he said it could be a little bit smaller. hey these colors on point embroidery on point style on .10 out of 10 definitely will order again
5.0,True to size. Nice and warm!
5.0,"I like the way this watch looks. It is comfortable, accurate and the timer works well.<br />Not buried with many functions, this is easy to use."
5.0,"This nacklace is really nice and well made.  I love the nacklace, however, it is very small and I thought would a bit larger. Overall very nice, I am keeping it."
5.0,"I had to be out of town for a urgent reason so I forgot compression socks at home.  I saw these say for wider calves and decided absolutely.  They are so comfortable, easy to put on, gives the compression you need without the pain of other brands. Will be buying more when I get home."
5.0,I am actually quite surprised at the shirt. It fit me perfectly. It is I would say medium soft. Comes out of the dryer with no wrinkles.
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous. Picture doesn't do justice for this dress. I absolutely love it.
5.0,"The watch is great, especially considering the low price. High quality Seiko automatic movement that can be hand wound and is hacking. Watch keeps great time. The only thing I wasn't absolutely thrilled with was the quality of the leather band. It's ok, but I ended up switching it out. Also, if you decide to switch it out, make sure you get the right size band as the lug width is 22mm, not 20mm as it says in the description."
5.0,Great shirt. Looks good and fits my friend! Thanks!
5.0,As a big fan of one piece I think this is a really cool and simple necklace to have. It allows you to show your love for the show and the series overall while not being flashy and drawing attention. I have seen other necklaces like this but the reason I like this one more than the others is that the other are usually just the straw hat necklace. This one has the Straw hat crew symbol on it so people that do see it will know where its from and it can be a cool little conversation starter. It is held up by a thick braided piece of string. I am confident that it will hold up. The only thing is that the part to hook the necklace closed feels a little cheap and it might break if enough pressure is applied but should be fine if taken care of.
5.0,Gift for a friend
5.0,it is well made.
5.0,"This shirt came in a medium, which is perfect for my daughter. She likes that it is simple and unique. She got many compliments while wearing it--and also some pets. It seems that her friends can't look at a crushed velvet shirt without wanting to touch it. Her teacher commented that the shirt had a royal look to it.<br /><br />The shirt is comfortable, and my daughter finds it easy to put an outfit together with it. It's also true to size."
5.0,I love the numerous pockets and very roomy. I’m able to keep everything organized and easy to find.
5.0,"Beautiful, well made, not see through.  My favorite line of nightgowns."
5.0,This is a beautiful shirt.  It still is but accidentally was put in the dryer.  It shrunk a lot.
5.0,Used this dress for my 1 year olds birthday photos. It was absolutely perfect. I would rec come down for photos or special events for your littles.
5.0,Absolutely beautiful..... it was even more cute in person.  I love this sweater and received lots of compliments.
5.0,I love this bag!  So sturdy & cute.
5.0,"According to hubby, the most comfortable shirts ever. They wash great and are wonderfully soft."
5.0,"Love love LOVE! Fits like a glove, sits comfortably high on my waist, and makes my tush look amazing! What more can you ask for a pair of shorts? Fabric is so soft you’d think you’re walking around naked. Perfect for lounging around the house or going out. I’m a size Small, 95lbs, 4’11” with a slight build but modest amount of junk in the trunk."

5.0,I ordered this shirt along with a few others in a small because that’s what I usually wear and this shirt hands down fit the best out of all of them
5.0,"Love these, they are so nice packaged like a $200.00 pair of glasses."
5.0,"i really like it, but it does fit a little small"
5.0,I bought this one for me. I love it.  It  is unique and artistic and well made.
5.0,Very comfortable and washes and drys good
5.0,I really like this dress it's very comfy and flattering I should of got an xl but a 2xl is fine I can wear it to work I'm a size 16 in dresses so it runs big
5.0,I am a size 18-20 and I ordered a 2xl. It fit perfectly and it is very soft. I have not washed it yet so I can only say that the quality pre-wash is great. Very comfortable and I would buy this again and in more colors.
5.0,"Quality great, a good fit."
5.0,"I LOVE THAT YOU  CAN ACTUALLY  FIND A DECENT REPLACEMENT FOR THE. "" BIG FAIL ON OAKLEY'S PART FOR NOT SUPPORTING / OFFERING OEM REPLACE PART'S FOR SUCH EXPENSIVE AND NICE GLASSES!! """" SO THANK YOU!!!""  AND OAKLEY COME ON DO A THROW BACK AND BRING THEM BACK BECAUSE EVERYONE I KNOW THAT HAS HAD THEM LOVES THESE GLASSES"
5.0,"I've gone through a few different hoods like this on Amazon trying to put something together for a costume and each one has been a cheap knockoff of whatever is shown on the product page.  This one however, matches the pictures.  It's not the most elaborate design compared to some others you see online which may have more straps, buckles, and/or a more detailed, leather armor look to them, but this still looks quite good.<br />It's apparently made from a sheepskin, so while not actual cow leather, or even PU leather, it still has a somewhat raw leather look to it, and is also very soft and flexible, almost like cloth.  Compared to real, thick leather, which can sometimes feel bulky, stiff, and flex or fold in undesirable ways that change the look you're going for, this hood weighs itself down and conforms to your shoulders and chest.<br />As for size, I am a lean, athletic 5'11"" male at 175 lbs and the Large fits well.  With just a shirt on, I can tighten the center chest straps to the 2nd-to-last widest hole (with my costume, I may need to loosen them to the last hole but not sure yet).  The under-arm straps I can comfortably tighten to the 3rd-to-last widest hole but the cloak I wear under this for the costume needs to maintain a loose look so I expect to leave these straps on the last hole when wearing the full costume.  Even loosened in this way though, it still stays put and doesn't move around so that's nice.<br />For the price ($49 as of this review), I do think it's a bit expensive for such a simple design.  The buckles on the straps are plastic I think, or maybe thin aluminum, so could definitely stand to be improved with something more solid feeling (and overall better looking), just be careful with them.  This is truly the only nice, legit hood I've come across though so, it's the best and only choice that isn't a scammy cheap knockoff."
5.0,"Just what I needed. If u tend to get too warm in a sweater, this one's for u. It's a quality knit with light ventilation. No cumbersome long sleeves but they are long enough for warmth. So nice to wrap up in. I need to buy another."
5.0,I love how it comes in several pieces as the robes should it looks 100% authentic recommend wearing a black shirt under but cant wait to get my saber for my cosplay
5.0,Vibrant colors and amazingly soft material.
5.0,nice texture
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for! Send profile, a place for my bills with a separate place for my change. Also several slots for cards. Easy snap closure. Love my color! And the price was great!"
5.0,I love this dress! I live in Georgia where fall plays peek-a-boo for about 2 months. This dress is lightweight enough for warm days but can be layered with leggings & a jacket for cooler days. Live the colors. Got tons of compliments. Ordered another one in the green color.
5.0,Loved this clips for my grand daughters shoes but the slipped off a few times.  Would recommend hot gluing to shoe if that is an option.
5.0,"This necklace is beautiful to dress up or wear for a casual day.  On top of that, purchasing from 2nd Story Goods is an investment in hope.  This group of artisans in Haiti is building a new mindset of hope for the future as they use their creative abilities to craft not only amazing items for sale, but a whole new way of life, an economic system built on hope, community, and dedication.  I absolutely love buying from 2nd Story Goods and often give their items as gifts. The handmade items are unique and the investment is inspiring!"
5.0,"Great, no complains."
5.0,bought this for my wife  for her new motorcycle.
5.0,"Even though these fit , my wish would be for a bit of a longer ankle strap . It fits , but is snug , more than I like . Love the shorter heel because at 6 foot , and older , for the stiletto heels { making me 6-5 or taller is no longer ideal }  So these are perfect , will be getting a few more colors . Got my eye on the red pair , and maybe the nude color .  These are cute , not fancy , but cute ~ love them ~ /=^}"
5.0,It’s good material! It’s not a cheap velvet cloak it’s a really nice material and pretty breathable! I looked all over amazon for a cloak and nearly gave up. Saw this one and risked it. And it is definitely what your looking for. I’m 6’2 and it goes to my ankles  it’s great. I’ll be buying again for future garbs! Good product
5.0,Love love love it.  Very Chic.  So soft too.
5.0,Socks are extremely comfortable and don't ride down into the shoes. Definitely recommend.
5.0,The pants ran a little smaller than expected but besides that the suite was good.
5.0,"Great shorts, awesome fit."
5.0,Ordered this first in a large. Couldn’t get it over my head. I normally wear a medium. Then I ordered  an XL. It was like a tourniquet. This product runs way too small<br /> But it’s cute and great fabric. If you’re a small petite person this would work well.
5.0,👍🏻⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👍🏻<br />I actually ordered three of these one for my daughter and my son and my spouse and the real small so they can’t complain
5.0,I really like it it's a little different than what I expected but I love the sleeves and the material
5.0,"The shape is really nice, the fabric is softer than other masks. The clever built-in adjustment is better than those with rubber cylinders that can irritate the back of your ears. Because the straps are not elastic, once you've got them adjusted, they don't pull as hard on your ears. And of course, organic is nice for something my kids are breathing through for 7 hours at a time."
5.0,I can't wait to present these to my soon and grandson! Their names happen to be Guy and Guy II!
5.0,"Boots are of nice quality, appealing color, comfortable!"
5.0,Very sexy  beautiful  and comfortable. Fit well.
5.0,Love the boot. Rubber kind of bottom so they are good for not slipping. Fur is soft.  The size was off though. I ordered a 2-3 big kid for my 8yr old and they fit my toddler size 10. Strange But worked out for my toddler.
5.0,Loved ito
5.0,Very soft and warm. Will be perfect for our family pictures
5.0,I loved the dress they were out of my size so I just went down one. Luckily it is really stretchy! I got lots of compliments! :)
5.0,Perfect size- not too big nor small.
5.0,"Boobs are a little big, or more like, due to my chest size, it opens up like gils, however, I love the dress and will be tacking down some of the gills to keep my boobs from invoking thoughts of fish... The rest of the dress is great. Made pretty well. The belt &#34;loop&#34; (string) broke on one side after trying on a second time, but again, no biggie. Worth what you are spending on it for sure.<br /><br />Keep swimming folks!"
5.0,These are absolutely adorable! My 2 year old wore with a skirt and they fit just above her knees. Good coverage since it was a cold day. Didn't slide down.
5.0,I have bought 2 pairs of the yellow gold and I love theses earrings! They are perfect
5.0,Cute shoes!  My daughter loves them! Was looking for something she could run around in and play outdoors.  She typically wears sandals so hoping she will put them to better use when the weather gets colder.
5.0,Very complimentary to the figure
5.0,this is a life-saver when emergency team shows up
5.0,Thest are beautiful
5.0,"Fit great, great price."
5.0,Love this! I’d been sewing my own masks using tulle fabric so I could breathe. No more sewing. These meet the basic requirement of a mask.
5.0,Nice hoodie - lightweight- runs small so size up - I’m 205 6’1” and got a 2xl.
5.0,My niece LOVED the butterfly wings!
5.0,"Quality! This top is so soft! The colors are nice and it fits well! There’s a little stretch to it and the sleeves are just long enough. I’m 5ft7in abc weigh about 15lbs, I have a long torso and long arms and it was still the perfect length!"
5.0,Love this  top of knee on me  I were as a dress or with tights. Colorful not see- thru and washes well  I get a lot of compliments every time I wear
5.0,i've bought 5 of these already! i wear them with my long boots as i work outside gardening
5.0,Daughter in law packs all the grandkids things that she doesn't want to get wet or sandy at the beach.
5.0,"Super light and visible. A good fit does require that you tighten the side straps, but that's just a quick pull of a strap."
5.0,"was something for my friend for an event, great fit for her."
5.0,"Great product, just as described!"
5.0,Made extremely well. This is my second since it is light and I can keep it in two places in case of rain. Better than a poncho as I can wear it in the city and is easy to put on and off.
5.0,I love this top. It fit great it looks great and feels great. I will definitely order another one in a different color.
5.0,"Omg, I’ve had these for years! They now have holes in the toes and still wear them. I am on my feet 10 to 12 hours a day and they have saved me. They are pricey but well worth it. BUY THEM."
5.0,Well made and fits well.
5.0,Great fit! Very flattering & comfortable
5.0,I get compliments on this all the time!

5.0,Great belt and service!  Would definitely buy from PAZARO again. :)
5.0,👍👍 Liquid Blue shirts never disappoint!
5.0,"Love this bioplast jewelry. They came in various colors for the studs (pack of 10), which I personally love. They are very easy to change out, the studs pop right in and pull out, they do not screw in. They are very secure once in so you don't have to worry about any fall out. The bioplast is extremely comfortable, you can't even feel it. Bioplast is healthier for mouth piercings, metal tends to rub at the gumline causing receding. Bioplasts is soft and prevents harsh damage. Overall these are great for Monroe piercings, I would also recommend for labrets. I received a discount for this product for my unbiased and honest review."
5.0,I like is perfect
5.0,This purchased as a gift and was well receives
5.0,I love this suit.  The top fits perfect and has amazing support.  It is super cute and comfortable.  I am 5'3&#34; and usually wear a medium and that is what I got and I love it and I wear a 36 B bra.  I went and bought the red one as soon as I tried this one on.
5.0,El diseño es bonito pero muy rijido el material
5.0,excellent design and material
5.0,Love the pockets and the flare fit
5.0,This is going on a Caribbean cruise with me.  I love the bling and the soft textures together.  Great gift for young and mature ladies.

5.0,"The shirt was a little thinner than I expected but looks great, was made well and he was thrilled.  He wouldn't take it off for days!"
5.0,Bought for my son in law who works outside and he laughed when he saw them but was amazed the day he wore them.  So yes do work and keep your feet very warm in the cold weather.
5.0,The mask has a silky feel to it and also made well.
5.0,Good quality.  Item is as advertised.  Shipped and received quickly.
5.0,I’m writing this review so I can complete the review lol
5.0,I loved having these to organize on my last vacation.
5.0,"Very happy with product. I needed more but was concerned about thickness , so I only ordered  one set .Wish I would have ordered more because now they are unavailable."
5.0,Exactly like the picture. Only this was the bottom was very slippery especially since my daughter wanted these for gym class
5.0,Fits good very warm
5.0,Got it fast in mail everything fits great looks like a real ring even though its rubber
5.0,"Great fabric, versatility. I have the white one with black stripes in the long sleeve. I wear it year-round and layer here and there. Great for first few months of pregnancy as well."
5.0,A beautiful warm and comfortable autumn and winter fitted dress. The dress hugs the body just right. The material is soft and not itchy.
5.0,"It runs a bit small, but quality seems nice compared to price."
5.0,"Fits well. Much too warm for now (summer), but it’ll be great in winter."
5.0,Came a lot quicker than was supposed to and its cute.
5.0,"This is a great sweater for winter - it’s not so big that it makes you look enormous, but it’s roomy enough to forgive if you ate a bit more for Thanksgiving than you planned. Perfect with skinny jeans or black leggings and boots. The cowl neck is a bit much, but overall I found this sweater super cozy, flattering, and incredibly soft. Purchase your normal size - the medium fit me perfectly and is still flowy.  I’ve gotten compliments from both men and women! I recommend."
5.0,This costume was absolutely perfect! Fit like a glove! And showed all my curves!
5.0,"I love this dress! It can be worn anywhere. Without a petticoat, it's perfect for casual wear; add a petticoat and you've got a cute, cute, cute dress-up dress. They do run small, so follow sizing directions. I am 5' 9&quot; tall &amp; weigh 135#, I usually wear a small, I ordered this dress in medium, and it fits like it was made for me.<br />mama r"
5.0,Love it. Perfect for fall under boyfriend shirts!
5.0,Just found these pants which I was looking for for a while now. These are stylish but not over the top
5.0,"Perfect bouffant cap to keep my long hair contained without it feeling so confined to my head. It's light weight, durable and comfortable. The prints are nice, buttons are a plus and are definitely ear savers. Will purchase again."
5.0,"I purchased these to go on my keyring because I am constantly fishing in my bag for my keys. They would also be adorable on a backpack 🙂  I get comments all the time ""Oohh I want one!"""
5.0,Great for around the house and sleeping
5.0,Good value shipped fast
5.0,"I loved these earrings so much that when I lost one, I bought another pair. I have fairly short hair so I am particular about the size of the earrings I wear. Too big and they are heavy and show too much. Too small and they get lost. These are just right and can be dressed up or down."
5.0,"These are awesome! I wear mine all the time and love them so I bought them for my 5 year old  He wears a 12 and they come with a strap that keeps them on.  I highly recommend, very comfortable."
5.0,"{UPDATE: I don’t think it ever claimed to be any more than water resistant, but this watch will not survive a trip through the laundry. My mistake and no reflection on the watch. Just giving a heads up. I’ll be buying another one shortly.}<br />Last year, I was training and raising two Golden Retriever puppies. In their exuberance at lead training, they managed to strip the crowns off not one, but two wristwatches. I had to find an alternative, and this watch is it. It keeps good time, isn’t too noticeable hanging on my belt loop, and the ‘biner clip is robust enough to take some good abuse. I wear it hiking, camping, and just day-to-day. Love it. Oh: the two Golden brothers have become the big-hearted, loving, full-of-beans brothers that I knew they would. :)"
5.0,Great material and fit! Love it!
5.0,"This is a nice light weight breathable shirt. I really like the color combination and the pattern they chose for incorporating the gray. The sleeves have a band on the end of more thick elastic type material. I went up one size when I ordered this and thank goodness I did or it would fit too tight to wear. Overall I do like it, fits nicely going up a size, perfect for warmer weather, and nice classy appearance. Will recommend to others as long as repeated washings does not cause seam failure or any other fabric flaw."
5.0,"Great fit, nothing negative to report."
5.0,"Very comfy, squat proof, great color. I sized up to a large and shouldn’t have. Easy could’ve fit into a medium or small. I’m 5’5ft, 150pounds."
5.0,Got this to carry in my smaller purses. It is fantastic.
5.0,This cute Pineapple Watch is very well made and exactly as described.
5.0,"This dress is thin, cute, and looks like photos. 10/10"
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for! Looks great, feels good, and works for changing after surfing on the beach ."
5.0,"awesome, I got what I expected"
5.0,pins that came with are to short. used my old ones. still a great item with fast shipping
5.0,Nice material. Comfortable for when you where the mask all day due to covid.
5.0,"This top is so flattering. I have smaller boobs (34B) and this top gives me cleavage. I actually bought this top because I saw it on my friend who is an A and it gave her cleavage too! Beware, the bottoms are essentially a thong though. I will probably just wear the top with a different pair of black bottoms"
5.0,GREAT FIT THANKS!
5.0,My 5 year old loves her glasses case. Easy to open and close. And she digs the colors too.
5.0,Love them! Confortable and elegant
5.0,"I really like these gloves; made of thick silicone, they should last a lifetime and they're so versatile, I have found them very useful. Everything seems so clean after I use them and I scrub everything from dishes to countertops to the fridge to the oven! I ended up buying 2 pairs, one pair for the kitchen and 1 for cleaning the bathroom and will probably get another pair for my carwash bucket. It's takes a minute or two to get used to wearing them, being a bit bulkier than your usual rubber gloves, but it's not a big deal. Plus, I hand wash my dishes so I can use crazy hot water with these gloves."
5.0,"Perfect fit, so cute. Everytime I wear it I get compliments."
5.0,I love it! It is for my cat Simba. Lol.<br />I  attacched it to his colar. Looks cool.
5.0,I love how comfortable they are when you are walking and so nice for the price
5.0,The material and the cut is awesome!
5.0,Better than other products that I have tried. Dries smooth without bubbles. It made my shoes look new again.
5.0,Bought these as a gift for my husband.  He loves them and they look nice on his vest. Good quality.
5.0,My 3 year old loves them as well as my 1 year old. Holding up well for being worn all the time a few times in the wash.
5.0,Using for jogging or powerwalking
5.0,just as described.  terrific!  peace:-)<br />chris
5.0,Purchased for my best friend for her birthday. She loved it!
5.0,It's a beautiful dress.. it's a little on the small side but nothing to worry about if you want to show curves.. Light weight and the side zipper is discrete..
5.0,It's great but I wish the material was thicker so I didn't have to wear an under shirt
5.0,Great Item at a good price!
5.0,light only lights up half the watch thats my only complaint other then that its pretty durable
5.0,"I kept seeing dogs on facebook wearing sombreros & just had to find some.  So I thought Amazon seems to have everything, so I checked & of course they had this set.  I was very impressed with the quality & beauty of these little hats.  Can't wait to take pictures of my dogs & bunnies wearing them!  Then I thought I'd hang them on the wall.  Highly recommend them!"
5.0,"Great bag, gift for my hubby!"
5.0,very comfortable casual shirt
5.0,My wife treasures this.
5.0,Perfect color match for my wedding. Very well made and easy to put on.
5.0,Love the shoes . Soft and warm
5.0,I loved the colors and the fabric!
5.0,"It can be a little tough to figure out how to wear it, due to it’s versatility."
5.0,"They fit perfectly!  Easy to slip on and off. Wear camping, out to stores etc. purchased both Black and Brown"
5.0,"I bought it as a gift for an adult man who is a star wars fan.... I was thinking of it more like a novelty item, but was pleasantly surprised at the quality, and the recipient loved it."
5.0,Got the the job done. Got my knives sharp
5.0,"nothing much to say, it is very pretty, and it can be worn, with just about any  dress style."
5.0,"I’ve always been very picky with wallets. I have been carrying the same type for 15 years, but had noticed the quality had been going downhill the last few times I ordered a new one so I decided to make the jump to the Travelambo.<br /><br />I’ve had my new Travelambo for three weeks now and waited to write a review until I had broken it in. I can tell it’s going to last me a long time. The material and stitching all seem to be of very good quality. I also love the money clip/magnet! That thing can hold a nice wad of cash (16 bills and still room for a few more).<br /><br />It forced me to downsize some of the credit cards I was carrying, but as it turns out, I really didn’t need them anyways. And it’s probably a lot better on my back as well."
5.0,Extra dark is perfect for extremely bright days.
5.0,"Vivid colors.  Seems to be somewhat cushiony, very comfortable."
5.0,Doesn’t look cheap. Better in person.
5.0,Excellent product. I'm very  happy.<br />Thank you
5.0,I adore this dress and spend a lot of time wearing it!!!!
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous and came with matching cuff links really nice.
5.0,Love the dress hate that it was a little to small
5.0,I adore this dress. It's cute and fun but still classy. The top fabric is pretty thin though well made so an under shirt is a must.
5.0,"Very pleasantly surprised!  Got a medium.  5'5&#34; and about 135 lbs.  fit perfectly.  The material is thick, which is actually very nice to hide any flaws etc.  love it!"
5.0,I absolutely love this purse. It was perfect for what I needed
5.0,"Very elegant look for the price point,. It looks like one of those high designers look. Makes it a great gift ."
5.0,"These are really good socks.  The are fairly durable, the colors are vibrant and I get a lot of compliments from, well, just about everyone.  There are a lot of &#34;crazy socks&#34; on the market at this point, while The Dapper Way has not sacrificed quality as many others have.  This is my second box and I will likely buy a 3rd."
5.0,"These seemed well made and arrived appearing exactly as described.  The hinges on the legs we're flexible but sturdy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I just didn't care for how light the unfinished bamboo looked."
5.0,"Love it, easy to wear."
5.0,These sunglasses are currently my favorite accessory. They're so strong and durable I have them 4 monthos ago.  The form is nice; it's not too obtrusive on your face and has a bit of an edgy vibe about it. I purchased these for a vacation and have been wearing them nonstop since. I highly suggest it.
5.0,Hilarious shirt that makes people laugh. Delivery time was exactly as quoted & quality is still good after a couple washes.
5.0,I bought these post surgery after my insission was healed to help my internal healing process. They are not actual compression garments but I could tolerate them because they were snug but not like a tourniquet.  They were light enough to allow comfort and had a gentle “compression”.  I followed directions and ordered one size smaller than I ordinarily wear. They fit perfectly.
5.0,"Awesome glasses,  I have 4 pairs now, amber, clear, and tinted. I have a big noggin and these fit perfectly.  Work great on the bike."
5.0,Get it ....you'll be pleased
5.0,Great dress! I would compare the quality of this dress to an exponentially more expensive swing dress that I purchased from Unique Vintage. I actually like the fabrication of this dress better than my cross-top Swing Dress from UV
5.0,Dress fits perfect and very comfortable.
5.0,non-magnetic and tough was my requirements for a keychain hook and this met and exceeded those so far.
5.0,Beautiful dress. Runs big. I would order two sizes smaller.
5.0,They are very pretty.  I love these crawlers.<br />I look forward to buying more
5.0,"Super sparkly, I was afraid they would be cheap looking but despite the fact that they are comfortably light they sparkle and seem very sturdy, good size too."
5.0,I pretty much love this shirt and it's one of my new favorites! I would definitely recommend it. Great quality!
5.0,Comfy i believe i returned them due to having the same pair already
5.0,They fit the glasses just like the factory pair. Lenses are clear and crisp and just about the same quality as the original set but for half the cost. My frames are in good shape and I plan to buy many more sets of Revant lenses in the future.
5.0,The quality is outstanding.  The price is right too.
5.0,"I love it! It is really great quality, definitely worth it."
5.0,"Love it, fits well!"
5.0,I like to wear with low cut tops
5.0,Worked great for long flight to prevent venous stasis.
5.0,I was looking for a cardigan that would help transition from winter into spring this cardigan provided the finishing touch I was looking for. The material is of good quality and it layers well over a light top. The only down side was that it didn't hang in the front as much as I would have liked but I  can look past this.
5.0,This will work great for a witch doctor costume!
5.0,My work office closed down and moved to new location in the city of Boston. Have to travel there 3 times a week and carry my laptop in my backpack back and forth. Taking a toll on my shoulders. These wheels make it so much easier. I just strap my backpack on and off I go. Easy to carry when bag is strapped on if need be. I like how the handle easily pulls up and down. This has saved my back from aching. I would highly recommend this.
5.0,This swimsuit is amazing. It fits my daughter great. I love that both parts were sold together.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:3fc791945828efeda0958f66b0021f1a]] Watch these catch the light. I really didn't think a gem this color could shine the way this grayish black moissanite stone does. The earrings come with a GRA report. I used the QR code inside of the pamphlet and it lead me to the gem report online. These are authentic and beautiful.  I love understated elegance and these earrings provide that.

5.0,Very nice looking earrings. You wouldn't think it's stainless steel.
5.0,"Love this top...perfect fit and comfy material. And, the rhinestones aren't too overwhelming and are colored to match where overlapping on the colors in the print. Very well made."
5.0,Perfect for my stylish cousin.
5.0,🙋🏽‍♀️

5.0,work well to do what they are made for.

5.0,"It turned out I didn't need it.<br />Good dress for the price, very flattering. It was a little big im 5'9 around 190"
5.0,"I got my ring today. As always I read all the reviews after I purchase. I was honestly scared I was going to get a piece of junk, but what I got was a very nice piece of jewelry. The stone is not transparent like in other reviews. The mounting is perfect and the weight is just right. I'm adding pictures. I will recommend this vendor. I'm adding pictures."
5.0,Nice shirt. Feels good to the touch. Did not shrink.
5.0,"I just received the blue and the green on e yesterday and they are beautiful! My room mate wants the green one and I told her to buy her own...LOL...I love the material, feels nice..."

5.0,Cómodo y ligero
5.0,these are well made and fit well
5.0,"I ordered this pair and the blue pair in the same size for my two boys. I ordered the 6-7 little kids (the biggest size in kids you can get) . One of my son's is a size 6 and The other is a size 7.  The grey pair we received was correct and fit perfectly! The grey pair fit both of my sons.  I was thankful, I was worried they would be too small for my size 7 son.  My son loves them.  The blue pair arrived and was the incorrect size.  I messaged the seller and they immediately sent out a replacement.  It was also incorrect.  They realized they had a batch mislabeled.  Without me even requesting,  they issued me a refund.  Best customer service I've dealt with!  Highly recommend!"
5.0,"This top was a good purchase, it fit well, washes easily.  I hung it to dry, bc it felt like like the kind of fabric that wouldn't react well to bring overheated."
5.0,Gorgeous earrings! Very pleased with purchase. The item arrived as promised.
5.0,protects forearms
5.0,Lots of room but it's short. I had to add a pair of shorts under neath.
5.0,So warm and so comfortable!
5.0,"Fit good, nice for the price. They make me very warm so their nice for the gym and treadmill but I'm ready to take them off after because I'm burning up.<br />They are thick enough that you don't show your underwear. Pockets keep your phone and things close at the gym."
5.0,I love this dress! Dress fits perfectly. I love the color and quality of the fabric.
5.0,"Bought 2 as gifts, but liked the Hoodie so much I'm ordering one for myself!!"
5.0,"Super cute! So glad I bought this. I read the other reviews and ordered a large instead of a medium (I can wear both depending on the store) it’s a little loose but looks intentional with the fit. I love it. I’m 5’10” and it’s not obscenely short, though I’d only feel comfortable wearing it with leggings. I will be ordering more colors."
5.0,It glows in the dark
5.0,These are so cute! I love them! They work perfectly and are so comfortable! 10/10.
5.0,Absolutely love it and going to order again as soon as this ones been worn out!
5.0,"Shiny, classy and priced just right!"
5.0,"Ordered for my mom and I for Christmas as we will be going to Disney! We love the design, super cute. The band is a lot more flexible than some others I’ve had, but still comfortable!"
5.0,"My daughter is 6 years old, and I got this for her thinking she could grow into it. My daughter normally wears a size 6x/7 in dresses. The size 8 fits her pretty well with a lot of room to grow. It does not look oversized, but roomy and breezy. It hits her at the knee but she wore it with play shorts underneath, no problems. Plus, it was 90 degrees and humid and she wasn't overheated wearing this breathable dress.<br /><br />The neck and armholes are sewn well. The bodice has cute pin-tucked fabric and functional buttons. The dress is all cotton and prone to wrinkling. I washed it on gentle, dried it half-way, and then hung it to finish drying. It came out very nice. I would buy more from this brand.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!"
5.0,A little large but not uncomfortable.  Nice clor plaid.
5.0,"Fits perfectly. The color is beautiful. Best PJs year round! Keeps you cool in the summer. In the winter I throw on knee high sweater socks and a cardigan to lounge around. (By lounge around, I of course mean do dishes and get kids ready for school. But now I'm comfy and look cute while momming!)"
5.0,Nice gift to go with a peacoat I gave my son for his bday. He loves it. A bit dressier without trying too hard.
5.0,Got these mask for holiday season.  Lots of smiles for the holiday spirit.  Wash up nicely and good fit.

5.0,Love this top. It was very comfortable on the long hike I bought it for.
5.0,Authentic  nice touch
5.0,"Great quality flannel. Does run a tad on the big side. My husband usually wears an XL, but the L fits him perfectly."
5.0,"It’s a very cute sun dress, light fabric and fits well . Love the style and design ."
5.0,"I adore these socks, I wish they came in other colors."
5.0,"Perfect!  Love it!  Extremely beautiful &#34;butterfly pink&#34; gown, comfortable, and fits true to size (allowing for a bit of shrinkage, if necessary).  I bought a &#34;Large&#34;;  I am 5'7&#34;, 145 lbs., size 12 pants and 38B bra size).<br /><br />I hope it doesn't shrink when washed and air dried, and I also hope I don't have to iron it after air drying.  &#34;1 for U&#34; needs to shift to a 60/40 cotton/polyester blend (and pre-shrunk cotton) so we can machine dry!  Selling unshrunk cotton night gowns is ridiculous."
5.0,My office did secret santa this year and my secret santa was the company's CEO .  This was the perfect gift .They  looks expensive and easy  on the wallet
5.0,"Looked adorable on, good quality"
5.0,Great dress for the beach. Bought in several colors
5.0,I appreciated how the earrings complimented my oval shaped face at times and enhanced my natural beauty.
5.0,"The colors are so pretty, fits comfortably and can be adjusted to any size. Love wearing mine and have gotten many compliments from it"
5.0,Very nice quality.  Just what we where looking for.
5.0,I got this purse as a gift for my sister-in-law and she absolutes loves it.<br />The quality of leather used here speaks for itself.<br />The price is reasonable and the product is good value for money.
5.0,"Really like the colors on the belt, fits well on my wrist."
5.0,I like the cap alot
5.0,"First of all, SO FLATTERING! Perfect compression:stretch ratio 😉<br /><br />I have my whole butt tattooed and it is very difficult to find leggings/shorts that you can’t see the tattoos through… I ordered the bright lavender color in my normal size (L) and to be honest I didn’t have high hopes due to the light color but they surprised me!<br /><br />I have bigger thighs and they did roll/slide a little but not enough that it bothered me. I wore them on a 22 mile hike through Yosemite without any issues.<br /><br />Now for the top, adorable.. I’m a 34DDD and wear a large in most sports bras, the large did fit (low/medium support) HOWEVER It did slide down a little as I was moving around."
5.0,"I absolutely love these pants, so comfortable and flattering.  They really do make you look thinner."
5.0,Bought as a gift recipient loved them.
5.0,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it!
5.0,"Wore it to my grandmas funeral and got alot of compliments on it. All my grandmas granddaughters wore flowers, was not planned so it all worked out, she loved her flowers."
5.0,WoW..I don't know where to start coz I have so much to tell about this goggles. I have used multiple swimming goggles previously but this piece is literally one of the best I have ever used. It comes with a very strong carryon box which is beautiful and stylist. This is a kind of carry on box which you can take anywhere and nobody will lough at you. The quality of the goggles is very impressive. The resizing mechanism feels super durable. Fits perfectly in my eyes and the swimming experience is also 100%. I was surprised when I took it out from the packaging box as I didn't expected that much of quality in this price range. It is a hack of a deal. Trust Me !! 5 starts for the product.
5.0,I ride a Catrike Dumont.  The bike helmet has openings to allow air flow.  I don't have much hair on top and the sun shining through can burn.  This cap keeps my head protected from the sun yet allow air to keep me cool.  I love that it also keeps the sun off of my ears and neck.  This product is working better than I had expected.  I won't be without it while out riding on my trike.<br /><br />It is well made and washes up nicely.  I hand wash them.  I don't want to use the washing machine because my wife uses fabric softener and that will destroy the breathability of the fabric.<br /><br />All in all this is a great product that I really like.  Well worth a full 5 stars!
5.0,Fit great! looking forward to wearing them in the wedding!
5.0,"Arrived in a couple days and was better than expected, wear it everyday!"
5.0,Just what I needed. Great .
5.0,"This purse is lovely.  I put a purse organizer inside it and I really love it.  Have been carrying it daily for over a month and it's still organized.  Plus, the color goes with everything!  Great practical purchase.  Good value, too!"
5.0,pretty happy with it. got it for my mom and she loves it. its really cute
5.0,A friend picked this album up for me on vinyl when they were in Mexico City. Highly recommend it.
5.0,These were perfect and exactly what I wanted. Item was shipped in a very timely manner.<br />Thank you.
5.0,"Wow! I bought this dress because it was on sale and looked cute, and I don't normally review things because I owe Amazon nothing, but... I had to!!! This is WAY beyond my expectations! I looked at the pictures from other customers and all of them looked really good in it, so I decided to try for myself and now I want one in every color. It's comfortable, chic, beautiful and flattering because the A line falls just above your stomach so it hides your love handles! I'm pretty petit but got a medium so it wouldn't squeeze me and it was perfect, just a tad loose the way I like it. I definitely recommend this, one of try top purchases lately!"
5.0,Nice quality and love the fit.
5.0,"very pretty, solid and fast shipping :-)"
5.0,Love pockets. Very convenient.
5.0,Gift. My friend loved it!
5.0,I bought 2 bracelets and they fit perfectly.  I bling like crazy but it doesn't look cheap.  It arrived ahead of schedule so I'm completely satisfied
5.0,"Soft leather great color, fit perfect."
5.0,"Pleased with my purchase.  I have bought bandanas from probably six different sources (not all on Amazon), and these are as good as any.  They are more expensive than some, at $4.99 each, but they are large, 27&#34; instead of 22&#34;.  The quality appears good, although as yet they don't have a lot of wear.  I did wash them once (cold wash and lowest dryer setting, which is how I wash everything) and the colors stayed true.  The three colors I bought (Royal Blue, Light Blue, and Purple) are pretty saturated colors, but I see no fading.  Quite satisfied."
5.0,Using for gingerbread decorating with grandchildren
5.0,"I absolutely love this top.  I don't like anything tight on me, so I bought a large, and it's a perfect fit.  Well made, high quality, and I received tons of compliments on it."
5.0,Fast and love the product!
5.0,I love it ! but It fits relaxed (loose) more than fitting.
5.0,"The size is a bit big but still super cute, can't wait for him to be able to wear it"
5.0,The quality is the first thing I noticed because they are made great and they are super soft!! They will definitely keep my feet warm I bought them for my Husband but I think he is going to have to share because I really like them for myself:) maybe I will buy him some more and we can share!!
5.0,I love this band it's great quality and looks beautiful and fits perfect on my small wrist.
5.0,"I really like these, they are very thin and breathable. Hopefully they last a while but if they keep them the same price I’ll stick with them. The price is perfect for what you get and they are also good looking, too."
5.0,Much prettier in person. Yellow color is more muted and material is not as soft as I would've hoped for still so pretty. Bought as a Christmas gift so I hope my m thinks so too!
5.0,"First ever MK bag in the logo print I have ever purchased. The logo is more discreet which I prefer.  The tote is lightweight and I really like the 4 outside pockets. The tote is a little on the large size but has a very slim profile so it doesn't feel clunky or banging into things when carried. I usually carry small to medium bags so this is a big plus!  I love the pop of red ( cherry) it's just right, not too much.  The handles are long enough to fit over shoulder comfortably even with coat on.  I would recommend this tote."
5.0,Warm and good fit
5.0,this was true to size for our dancer
5.0,Beautiful! I’m in love with it!!
5.0,I love this brand.. fits really nice
5.0,alot of fun to ware for the money.
5.0,Super cute! I love that it’s easy on and off but stays secure. Good quality materials and manufacturing. The colors are great as they pretty much match anything I’m wearing.<br />Only issue is that I didn’t pay attention to the fact that my watch is silver so the gold on the band doesn’t match. But I’ve got a new watch face ordered so it’ll be fine.
5.0,"I usually wear size XL. Went with 2XL, and it's only a smidge too big.  Very good quality.  Came reasonably fast considering it came from the Netherlands to the US."
5.0,"Absolutely perfect- color, size, and, esp. quality. Cannot recommend, enough."
5.0,"Nice warm hat.  Why did this say for men, when the model is a woman?"
5.0,Love it…. It came on time and it’s perfect for having when I have my nails done and need to use the atm
5.0,The parka is great for the chiberia cold days we had in Chicago.
5.0,"This wrap is beautiful. It is lightweight and soft. I wanted something simple to cover my shoulders during the reception line of a military ball. This is perfect. Very inexpensive but high quality. It arrived wrinkled with fold lines, however it took less than 5 minutes to steam it with a hand held steamer (previously purchased on Amazon.) I'm excited to see so many other colors are available. I will definitely keep this in mind for future events."
5.0,Good product. Delivered as promised.
5.0,The fabric is very good
5.0,Great for wearing while playing sports when metal is not allowed. They also have never irritated anyone in my families skin.
5.0,"I don't use them as a support, I use them as tattoo cover ups. Very impressed on the quality and the thickness of the sleeve."
5.0,Not sure about comfort. I don't wear it while I'm charging my watch. Does as expected.
5.0,Great hat but needs a chin strap for windy days on the course.....being able.to wet it snd how it cools your head is fantastic..
5.0,Love this little display.  I am displaying a pocket watch used by the groomsmen in my son's wedding last year and it looks great.
5.0,❤❤
5.0,These are probably the best made pair of vintage WW 2 boots I own. Authentic in every way Museum quality. They are accurate fir vintage civilian attire 1920’s to 1950’s. They are excellent for any WW2 airsoft costume or re-enacting event.
5.0,Very good cheap pair of night vision optics. They are great for latenight driving and really enhance visibility and clarity. Good find on Amazon.
5.0,I think anyone into archery needs these earrings! The design is unique and they are super light. I have super sensitive ears and they did not bother me!
5.0,easy to put on
5.0,Love this shirt. It is thin so I couldn’t wear a different color undershirt but I get lots of compliments on it.
5.0,"Love the fit, i have a big butt and fits perfectly well"
5.0,I ended up ordering a size too big because they were out of my size. But it still fits pretty well. Only thing that can make it better would be pockets.
5.0,These were for the wife. They look great and fit perfectly over her glasses.
5.0,Very warm gloves.  Great for skiing
5.0,"size is right on,  if need to would purchase this brand again. They wash up nicely.  After reading other reviews, I thought the med. would not fit so I purchased large. We have them both, for a 82#, 9 yr old size med is perfect.  we will keep the large and donate to JFL in our area."
5.0,This book bag is big! It fits all my daughters stuff plus extra space. She loves it and loved that it came with a doll. The doll is very cheap though.
5.0,"Very cool many pockets I tore small rip by seam, vendor replaced quickly, no questions asked"
5.0,"Very cute,,,"
5.0,"fast, clean, and not that pricey its all around a good product. The only nit pick I had was just the the necklace it comes with, is a little small for larger guys but all in all was nice that they gave a balled chain to go with the standard one."
5.0,It's exactly what I wanted it's Casio so it looks great and keeps perfect time.
5.0,Love this tie! Bought it for my son for a high school function. We are also black and gold Tigers. Quality material and sharp looking!!! He got many compliments AND I feel like a winner because I didn't have to drag him to a store in search of a nice tie!! Woohoo! We both won! Would definitely buy from this company again.
5.0,It’s very comfortable and it doesn’t slip out at night and it has room enough to cover my dreadlocks
5.0,Very nice earrings. Granddaughter loved them. Nice tight lever back.
5.0,I love stance socks and these are awesome!
5.0,I'm very happy with this bracelet. The factory scent of leather faded quickly and it looks just like the picture. The buttons have held up so far which is impressive because I work a lot and often do physically demanding labor. So a sturdy strap and stylish look gets a 5 star rating from me. Makes me trust buying my accessories from this seller more than others.
5.0,Fit just right. Nice comfortable material. Will order again.
5.0,"These are the shirts I looked for for years.. Glad I found this seller. Shirt is great  quality, fits great and I haven’t  had wrinkles and very comfortable."
5.0,Great quality !!
5.0,"Colors are gorgeous and the scarf is truly oversized, which adds versatility! I did not find the material to be itchy at all, it was fairly soft. I love the fact that this scarf can be worn with so many different colors! Considering purchasing another to give to a co-worker for Christmas."
5.0,No fogging in the mask.
5.0,I like the softness and received many compliments when wearing it.
5.0,Love this dress. The fit is perfect except slightly long on the sleeves. Great length and goes great with my black boots. Would order more colors if they were available.
5.0,"Good stuff, wore it to a govt. ceremony- great hit.  Soft material, very light,  it over shadowed my designer outfit - crowd loved it."
5.0,"I love these head ties. Be careful about getting the longer ones made for women. This is the same style worn by Federer, Nadal, and Del Potro. Stays tight with simple double knot but easy to remove. I have wash mine as the washing machine moves the inner liner so it feels a little off on your head"
5.0,Lovely quality socks. VERY cute!
5.0,"I purchased this as a gift for my mom for mothers day. She loves it! It's simple enough and small, but still decorative enough. Perfect for someone who values the words on the charms."
5.0,Very comfy and cozy!
5.0,I’ve tried a few different types of bands for my FitBit but this is the most comfortable and least bulky of them all. Fast delivery as well
5.0,"Very short boxer-briefs, just as the picture shows. Material feels great."
5.0,"UPDATE: I have had roughly almost five month of daily use with this watch and I am still very thrilled with this purchase. Out of a month of daily use, the watch I purchased has only been no more than roughly 1 minute off; in reality, the watch is a time keeping beast! All the complications (date, day, month, 24hr dial et al) work flawlessly. This is certainly worth the money.<br /><br />Delivered on time and in excellent condition. The watch is every much a delight to look at and fits my wrist well and is very comfortable. I will write a more extended review once I have given this delight of a mechanical watch a chance in the field (I am a journalist). I am very impressed with the quality of the packaging (I will post pics).<br /><br />The watch itself has a nice genuine leather watchband (black) and the watch casing is stainless steal and feels very solid. All the dials are in working order (lunar phase, date, number of day dial, 24HR dial, and a 12 hour dial). I only gave four stars because I have not have a chance to really give this Automatic Mechanical watch from BOYZHE is wll worth the price if this thing keeps time! So far everything works as advertised and I will let you all know if I recommend this watch after some good practical everyday use."
5.0,Great hat!!
5.0,very cute earrings
5.0,It was beautiful and simple at the same time my instructor loved it. It's well made and the inscription was clear to read.
5.0,"They are awesome, great for yoga and megaformer classes.  Honestly I also just wear them around the house."
5.0,"This is a perfect finishing touch for covering a rusty square hole. I got the two pack, one for a 2” hitch on an F-150, and one for a 2 1/2” hitch on an F-350 dually.  Both fit perfect.<br />The 2 1/2” hitch had the inside 2” adapter. The rubber ring was a bit snugger to install over the 2 1/2” outside."
5.0,These are very fun.
5.0,Ordered one size up based on reviews but wish I would not have. It fits true to size.
5.0,This is my new favorite necklace. It's the perfect length for layering with other jewelry. It feels sturdy but still looks delicate at the same time.
5.0,Love this! It fits great and I love that I can adjust it to fit my wrist! It is fashionable and makes me feel more classy with my Fitbit versa.<br /><br />If I find more colors I will definitely purchase more!
5.0,these are not heavy but swing to be noticed!  getting a pair for my sister!
5.0,I love my dress it was a little long in length I cut the dress off and made a belt to it.
5.0,Comfy for wearing area undo the house.
5.0,"Fit perfectly, women’s size 10 shoe size."
5.0,fir perfectly :)
5.0,I love how cute these shirts are. I would buy them again
5.0,"These are good joggers. They are better for a cooler weather around spring time, but not so light for summer. But overall they are good."
5.0,"Very happy with the piece - it keeps good time, and fits nicely with a Steampunk party theme we'd put together.  Beautiful, good quality, and excellent value!"
5.0,My son loves them! Thank you for a quality product. #awesome
5.0,"I bought one for myself, my husband, and my son. We love them :) Pewter is harder than Silver, so we haven't had the issue of denting and scratching that I have with another silver pendant I own.<br /><br />There is a clear coat of some sort that appears to be coming off of my husband's pendant, but he wore it pretty much constantly for months, even in the shower. My son and I have not had any problems with ours.<br /><br />Both my boys have rather large heads, lol, and the adjustable cord is perfectly long enough for them, but also works for me to tighten so the pendant is visible above the neck of my shirts.<br /><br />Overally very cool, original pendant. If you like the design you should not be dissappointed! :)"
5.0,"Love these. The backs are a bit loose, so be sure to tighten them up."
5.0,I love this. I wore it to a funky gallery opening and everyone commented on how cute it was. I will be buying more in different colors.
5.0,"Arrived on time. Perfect weight, fit, feel, and look. I’d give it a 10 if I could."
5.0,"Ordered a Medium<br />Fits perfect, spring or fall type sweatshirt."
5.0,It has good space (even though I filled it too fast 😉) The only downfall is all the Chinese labeling on the front and zipper pulls.
5.0,Me encanta! Muy buena calidad de la tela y costura. 😍
5.0,Love them. They look good and don't bother my sensitive ears.
5.0,Royal purple is a color for my father's fraternity. This is a decent or rather a quality made sweatshirt & the thickness is great.
5.0,Love this jumper just wish it came in more colors
5.0,Super cute top!  Fits great and I get a lot of compliments on it!
5.0,Love the size and colors of this wallet. It is made well.  Very nice wallet
5.0,"I really like this dress . My husband did, too and I received several compliments. The fit is very flattering. Another reviewer mentioned how high the slit is and I didn't find that to be the case....until I sat down. I wore it to a military promotion ceremony, so it was a little revealing for that. It would be great for a cocktail party, happy hour, champagne brunch looking out over one of the Caribbean oceans...but if you're walking and the wind kicks up a bit, you'll want to hold it down a bit."
5.0,Nice summer casual beach dress
5.0,Amazing quality great gift
5.0,A little tight around the top gem but okay enough.
5.0,Perfect!!!!
5.0,"Even prettier print in person. Arm holes and straps cut well to not show bra straps! AIR DRY!! My 5th tank of this style. Longevity of course depends on a number of factors, but I’ve found they’re good for two “seasons”. (Two years.)"
5.0,My wife bought this and this is what she has to say.  I love the fit.  It is very comfortable.  Im tall so i was afraid that it would be shorter than just above the knee; i was wrong it comes right to the knee which i also love.  It fits perferctly all over
5.0,"My son loves these! He loves the designs, and the quality seems pretty good."
5.0,"Great product.  It arrived in excellent condition and included bonus items such as a cleaning cloth, mini screwdriver and soft carrying bag."

5.0,Great quality and love the fabric.
5.0,Love them. I have issues with light and these cover everything
5.0,These are the best house shoes I have ever owned. I am in love with them. Very comfortable and well made. I have all hardwood floors so the cushion and rubber bottom help my feet. Highly recommend and will definitely purchase again.

5.0,It’s as described. Notice the measurements- it is wide. I’m not sure how long it will last it’s definitely plastic
5.0,Beautiful and fun. I wore it for Thanksgiving in New Orleans we went to the horse races. Its a fun hat..
5.0,"I love sperry and these shoes are just as pictured, fits true to size"
5.0,Sturdy earring.
5.0,"Wow, just wow. This is by far the best tee shirt I've ever owned. I was hesitant due to the price tag, but wow. I bought the white vneck. One of the rare white tees where you can't see my bra! So soft and it fits just right. One slight criticism, I wish the v neck was a bit lower (or you could customize your vee depth). It's like a crew, but v shaped."
5.0,"Really cute and such a soft material! Fit as expected, I am a size 8 and got the medium they fit perfect."
5.0,I love the merchandise
5.0,Perfect for 3 year old birthday present. She uses it as a nightgown and dress up clothes!
5.0,I brought a large and it fits good with some excess in case I put on weight. I am 5'1&#34; and weigh 135 lbs
5.0,I tend to lose my work fob to get in and out of the building. Bought one of these and it’s so much easier to keep track of!
5.0,"Oh my gosh, I was a wee bit unsure of this purchase, but when it arrived and I tried it on I am so happy! Love it and cannot wait to hit the beach.  I may work out in it, too!"
5.0,Pic reflex second order. It runs big. I am a size 16 and ordered the largest size after reading reviews. I had smaller hips and butt small chest but larger arms to give you an idea of body type. Very flattering. I loved it!
5.0,It fits perfectly. It’s supposed to be loose everywhere but the waist so it’s a really nice silhouette
5.0,great for traveling
5.0,These headbands are awesome! I sweat so much when I do CrossFit that when it goes into my eyes its just annoying. Well not anymore! With these headbands I no longer have to deal with sweaty eyes. I also like that they are big enough to cover my ears when the workout calls for sprints on those chilly mornings. Best part is the price!!! I recommend these if your looking for headbands.
5.0,Got it for my wife as a Christmas gift and she gets several compliments every time she wears it. My wife's favorite part is that it has pockets.
5.0,Bad ass hoodie!
5.0,it’s so cute and it’s really easy to put on a purse as a cute accessory ^~^
5.0,These glasses are a bit snug but I'm hoping they will loosen up a bit. They look great - much better than the other eye love wayfarers I bough and returned.  These are &#34;premium&#34; as they look classier and don't overwhelm the face. They make such a big difference in how I see the world around me that I don't want to take them off.
5.0,Perfect! My 5 yo looks so handsome in this shirt 😊
5.0,I bought this apron for my daughter and she uses it every day for class.

5.0,Great quality shirt. Very happy with the purchase.
5.0,"I purched these slippers for my grandson.  He loved them, he said they felt good.  They have a grip bottom<br />Where he won't slip."
5.0,"These are so awesome! Love that I have 3 different pairs and three different colors to match whatever I am wearing. Easy button to turn on. You have three different options to chose from. They stay on, blink, or blink fast. Colors are true and everyone always asks where I got them!<br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,"Item as described, fast shipping and delivery, very nice and quick transaction , recommended seller."
5.0,"Sweet little scarves.  My nieces loved them.  They are very cute, but thin— more for style than winter warmth."
5.0,Bigger than I thought but that was perfect
5.0,Love it! Perfect for my vacation in the Middle East
5.0,Husband is very happy with it
5.0,These are terrific and cool glasses and I love using them while while driving or walking in the sun.
5.0,Beautiful...very nice
5.0,Red Bottoms! I wasn’t sure how great the quality was going to be with these little shoes. I have bought a ton of these in multiple different brands and I can honestly these are just as good as the ones I’ve paid an arm and a leg for. I love that these are made with a soft leather that allows my little ones foot to breath.  I am thrilled that my little one can crawl all around & jump in her Johnny Jumper and they don’t come off.  They stay on Great and they Look Adorable<br /><br />I also got the black and white checked pair. I loved them enough to get 2 pairs. Very Pleased
5.0,This is super cute!  I did order a 3XL when I'm usually a L /12 but it worked out because it fit perfect.  Just keep in mind that it runs small and size wayyy up!
5.0,I like the broad shoulders and narrow waist
5.0,I love this dress super cute fits true to size!
5.0,Dog lovers need these!!They are good value and are perfect size for anyone. I recommend these errings and this seller. They came quicker than expected.
5.0,Love these! Comfortable and the size I ordered.
5.0,Awesome little tie. I thought it would go unnoticed but I have received many compliments about it I wish there were more colors.
5.0,I priced gold balls in Macy's then on Amazon. Some were way too cheap. I picked Nathan's because the price seemed good. I got the 7mm balls - perhaps a bit big but excellent quality and easy to wear. Very pretty and what I was looking for.
5.0,"Comfortable,  nice shoes, fix good"
5.0,Great costume and had many compliments on it.
5.0,Good quality pants. Fit great!
5.0,"Unlike similar products, these stay securely attached to your glasses. So lightweight you forget they are on. Wish the colors were not so bold. Then they would be perfect."
5.0,Good shirt for fishing all day in the sun.
5.0,Loved the gentle jingling sound. It was light weight and comfortable to wear. I received numerous compliments on it.
5.0,I love this pullover!!! It’s super flattering and SO COMFORTABLE.
5.0,So in love... Will be buying more colors. Will be posting pictures soon
5.0,"The pattern and dress are both so unique.  Definitely not something I would normally buy, but I'm super happy with my purchase!"
5.0,"Long time amazon shopper, never made a review until now because I thought this product absolutely worthy. So when I shop for glasses I try to accomplish 3 things: Nice Style, Good Price, and a Polarized Lens. Usually you can only get 2 out of those 3 requests. I am an avid fisher, which is why I look for polarized, but also everything looks better when polarized, blues more blue, greens more green, etc. So I bought these for a fishing trip coming up as a cheap stylish pair. Boy was I pleasantly surprised when they showed up. They look great, the price was as cheap as you can get, they obviously were polarized, but what really stood out to me was the quality. I have owned Rayban, Fossil, D&G, Smith, Oakley... They are the same, if not more sturdy than all the other pairs that I have owned. The finish and material is top notch. Somehow these glasses filled all 3 of my priorities with an extra bonus of premium quality. Well done Apollos."
5.0,"I was so pleasantly surprised by how beautiful these pearls are!  I bought them for a costume, but will definitely wear them for regular use."
5.0,"El color, el material, la talla todo es como lo muestra la imagen. Demasiado lindo"
5.0,It is a great gown
5.0,I liked it very much.
5.0,I can never get my bracelets fasten.  This works perfect.....
5.0,A belt is belt. No science to it.
5.0,Beautiful outfit. It really stands out and is a show stopper in the spring or summer time. The price is wonderful for such a unique piece.
5.0,everything excellent
5.0,"I love these shoes. There are super cute and easy to put on and take off. My toddler will often ask to take them off once we get home, so I am not sure if they are uncomfortable for her or what. The shoes appear to be a good size and aren't tight by any means when putting them on, so I am pretty sure the size is not the problem."
5.0,Super comfortable...a little too long. I was expecting cotton but it was a different fabric. I think the fabric is more breathable than cotton though!
5.0,Cropped short wear with a nice top and pair with nice herls
5.0,"Its design style is very fashionable and avant-garde,the fabric is very soft and comfortable to wear. It’s just knee length and it’s the best thing to wear in summer. I’m happy with it!"
5.0,This really worth money. I cleaned my Tiffany silver charm and necklace and it turned to brand new. Highly recommend for easy home care cleaning.
5.0,Love these!  So easy to use
5.0,"Love, love, love. Pay attention to the Hell Bunny size chart; it fits exactly to that chart. Nice quality, medium cotton. Not super see-through, even though it is a white based print (I wore a slip anyway, because it's winter...). SO many compliments! Because of the flat pleat shape, it's not too poofy unless you want it to be and add a crinoline. FWIW, the berries are cranberry colored, with little hints of brighter red, and the belt that comes with it is a cranberry velvet. Pretty."
5.0,"I love it!  I ordered it in gold and silver,.. very nice"
5.0,"I am a big girl and was afraid they would be too small even though I ordered the biggest size, they fit like a glove! Don't be scared when you first take them out of the package, they stretch in all the right places! They look so flattering on and the pockets are awesome! Very warm too!"
5.0,Loved this jersey ! Got it for my sons friends b day present and he loved it ! Great quality and fit as expected
5.0,My husband is a chef and he has to wear masks everyday to his job. These are very nice masks for him. You can even put a filter in them
5.0,Beautiful dress!!!
5.0,Heavy duty and comfortable.
5.0,Fit well and provide great compression.
5.0,"I normally wear 7.5, but due to the previous reviews, I ordered a size 7 and it fits exactly right. Oh, I really love the mauve color (exactly like the picture)."
5.0,These are great. Comfortable and don't show panty lines. I bought 2 sets.
5.0,Nice bikini at a great price point.  I am a 34C 125lbs 5’5 and got a size small.
5.0,"Ok, I took a chance on this dress. There was only a few left in the tan color I got, and it was sized a XXL. I don’t normally wear that big of a size. But with the type of dress this is, I figured a if it was a bit big it wouldn’t hurt. Just didn’t want it right on the tummy. Large or XL is what I normally wear, depends on how it’s made, I’m 5’4 and around 170lbs, give or take a few. Size 12 jeans.  I’m not curvy and sort of apple shaped, I have broad shoulders and a bit of a tummy. That being said- this fits me great! It’s a bit baggy at the top, but the straps are adjustable so nothing is hanging out. It’s such a soft material and the bottom skirt part is lined so it’s not see through. The waist is elastic, and has a faux drawstring that isn’t adjustable. Fine with me, it fits perfectly around my middle. I am so glad I got this. And the size I got was on sale too, so I got a great new summer dress at a great price!"
5.0,I love this set! Must buy!
5.0,I like the size and that it lays flat on the nose.
5.0,Beautiful &#60;3 elf sack please restock more and put more items!! I love elf sack!!
5.0,"These pants were bought as part of a costume for a church program, and they fit as expected."
5.0,Its so much better than i had expected especially for the price! Highly recommend it for anyone
5.0,This is a nicely made shirt. The fabric is a better quality than I expected at this price point.
5.0,Must order more they are so beautiful but waiting for a sale
5.0,I am so pleased with this product. Like other reviewers I was nervous when I pulled it out of the bag and had a little struggle getting over my thighs. This looks so good under my clothes and doesn’t bulge out like a lot of other products I’ve tried. It definitely is comfortable and makes your booty look fantastic!
5.0,Beautiful  well made highly recommend seller 5 ***** worth
5.0,tHE RIGHT SIZE FOR ME; GOTTEN A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS ON THIS BAG.
5.0,Love the quality of the product!
5.0,Grey is not as dark as it looks in  the picture. Still nice though
5.0,A great addition to my dr.strange outfit.
5.0,Nice quality....happy with purchase
5.0,"I ordered these underwear in a medium, even though I'm probably a large in underwear, because of others' reviews and I'm glad I did. They're still slightly big but manageable, I still wear them all the time. I bought the neon set as well in a small and those definitely fit better, but these are great for athletes. They're super comfy and don't chafe against the skin. I would absolutely recommend sizing down !"
5.0,It was package with a black velour pouch. It looks exactly like the picture. My friend loves it.
5.0,I bought this tee shirt for my daughter for Christmas and she does not want to take it off. Very comfortable.
5.0,"So soft! I'm 5'7"" and they go right to my ankle."
5.0,"Very nice. Love black spinel. The blue larimar bead is very tiny, but the bracelet is well made & I'm glad I have it."
5.0,I’ve not got to try it out much but love it so far. If you want to put layers on you need to go a size bigger. I got a large.
5.0,Very nice pendant. Shipping was very slow though. Allow yourself some time to receive it.
5.0,"These are great shirts however, cat did snag fabric and caused hole. So they are not super durable."
5.0,good price and look great
5.0,This is a very comfortable and cute tee shirt for fall.
5.0,"These pajamas are perfect!  They fit well, and as expected by size.  I actually bought several pair in different colors because they’re so comfortable.  Nice and soft to wear to bed."
5.0,"Great product, just as expected."
5.0,"I love that these are like little hoods, they have made wrapping my hair at night so much eaiser. The old one I had was basically like an oversized bandana and I would always fumble with it trying to get it on right without my hair unwrapping. Now it only takes me about 10 mins to get it done."
5.0,Ordering more! Great storage!
5.0,Such a beautiful satin robe! A great buy.
5.0,Great quality watch. The band feels high quality as well and I've gotten several comments. It honestly feels like I'm wearing a one hundred dollar watch or more. Great casual and semi formal watch.
5.0,"Feels well made , just as Bebe dresses."
5.0,These save me a lot of laundry
5.0,Love this dress the material is just fabulous i wished there was more in more colors
5.0,"Glasses are very nice , clear and colorful Will be purchasing again!"
5.0,"It was a gift, exactly like the picture in color and style, very nice wuality"
5.0,This costume came with everything you see advertised. Great quality! The only issue was the skirt runs small. So if you have a big behind or thighs I would go 1 size up. The skirt has no stretch at all..
5.0,I loved these so much I got 2 pair! They tone the body up in a flattering way and are comfortable. Highly recommend
5.0,"This request was received by the stipulated date, good quality, fair price, came well packaged. I recommend it"
5.0,Love love love this top! Bottoms are a little small and hang in the cheeks a bit.  I'll buy another pair of bottoms because this top is so cute.
5.0,"I have bought from this company 2 times before. The quality has been very good with all 3 I have purchased. As you can see from the pictures, the stitching around the belt demonstrates the quality the closure is just right and the 2 others have been used for quite a while with almost no signs of wear. These take a long time to get here though, over 2 weeks. It would be nice if the shipping time could be reduced. I would also like to point out the belt is gift ready. It came in a cute tin like the other 2 with tissue paper and that adds such a nice touch. The quality is great for such a lean price. I suppose that make it worth the wait. I received a discount for an honest review"
5.0,Awesomeness they look great on my wife
5.0,This cloth saves every piece of my silver jewelry. The silver shines again the moment you wipe with this magic cloth. Nothing but strongest recommendation!
5.0,Cute and comfortable! Sizing is on point. Love it!
5.0,Good pant to wear with a small heel shoe.  Looks  great.
5.0,This is just what I needed. Thank you.
5.0,My Godzilla-obsessed son loved it!
5.0,Flexible and comfortable to wear. Fragile so I would suggest being gentle when bending the sides. Definitely recommend!
5.0,"People always ask me about them, I’ve ordered twice already lol"
5.0,Totally Wicked!
5.0,I love this hat because you can wear it with any outfit.  It is really cool when you wear it with suits.
5.0,Not disappointed at all with this outfit!!!
5.0,We have to wear hair coverings at work but don’t always have them so I ordered this! I get compliments on it all the time.
5.0,My daughter and her friends loved this mask!
5.0,"I have gone on several trips with his bag, it hold up well and is very attractive."
5.0,Gave this as a gift to a friend that just got a Subaru. High quality materials. He loved it. You will not be disappointed.
5.0,It was a gift for a friend as far as I know she loved it.
5.0,I have Plantar Fasciitis and I’ve been wearing compression socks for a year now . I bought these because I needed some new socks. I was very satisfied with the way they are made. They are comfortable and the length is perfect. I loved all the different colors they came in . I would buy them again .
5.0,No more lost pin keepers. Great product. Great service too. Arrived as promised and work great
5.0,Great product. Very sturdy.
5.0,Great for the price. I wear it to work with leggings and get compliments when I do it's too short to go without and I'm only 5foot3. It runs small so order up a size. I'll be keeping the large but it's slightly to snug on the arms only. Still worth the guy for sure!
5.0,My boyfriend absolutely loved his gift knew exactly what episode this watch came from on doctor who
5.0,"I really like the material, color combination and fit. It’s a sold sweater."
5.0,Good fit for a tall girl. Granddaughter loved it!
5.0,Great cheap hat.  Used it as part of a trump costume for my almost one year old and it fit perfect.
5.0,I got so many compliments on this shirt when I wore it.<br />It's comfortable and roomy.<br />Bigger than I thought it would be but I am ok with that.
5.0,"In black, they are not plaid, although they have a bit of a black/grey dot pattern. They fit exactly the way they should for my size. They are very light and comfortable and can be worn with most any shirt from tee to polo."
5.0,"This is just as cute in person as it is in the picture.  I'm normally a women's size 6 and it fits me great. My daughter tries it on, she's normally a youth size 16, and it looked humongous on her."
5.0,The perfect gift for our principal who is a super fan of Stranger Things
5.0,"fun to throw on with the right girly stuff.  very pretty, dainty.  very happy and would purchase from this seller and products again"
5.0,Really good quality. Doesn’t look cheap. Fringe was all straight and the same length. Would order again or gift/recommend to a friend.
5.0,love this product. bought some for my 83 year old mother who wanted something safe and soft.
5.0,"love it,"
5.0,My husband loves this tie tack.  It is very nicely designed and is the perfect size.
5.0,This is by far the best designed belt I've ever used. I actually increased my weighted dips because it's a much better fit than other brands and the plate doesn't slam into uncomfortable places. They have great customer service too. The buckle broke after 7 months of hard use and they replaced the whole belt for free. Highly recommended.
5.0,"I've had these for about four months and wear them everyday. I live in Florida and have hardwood floors, so these work perfectly for keeping my feet cool and clean (I can vacuum and sweep every day but there is still sand). I always wear them when I'm cooking, the cushion in them is nice for standing on hard floors for an hour."
5.0,I liked that it fit perfectly
5.0,It fits and it works well.
5.0,Granddaughter love it
5.0,Wife Loves Them. What more is there to say.
5.0,Great quality. The bag is spacious enough to contain all of my daily stuff yet not too big. It even has a water proof part inside the bag!
5.0,"Since I wear contacts, I don't want prescription bifocals that I have to wear all the time. These readers are really convenient since you don't have to take them on and off constantly. Perfect for knitting and watching TV since you can see up close and far away without removing them. Also, when you're in a meeting and going between looking at a speaker and taking notes."
5.0,Super cute. The picture on it was little off color but still looked cute. My son loved it
5.0,[[VIDEOID:1ccca5c0a52327e3c8402cc577ce0051]] So much better than those silicone bands. I have so many different ones to dress up or down. This one is good daily option.
5.0,I bought this shirt for my young adult son. He was very pleased with the fit and feel of the shirt.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:abfb2edf8dc87313903f1be0cd9b8b3b]] These gloves exceeded my expectations. The material is very soft inside and out, they are long enough to cover my wrist, and they are super cute! Not to mention that the touch screen finger tip is an embroidered flower and it works really well!"
5.0,Look really nice too me...perfect!
5.0,"For the kid sizes, they fit as expected. For the adult sizes, the shirts seemed somewhat small for expected though the pants were as expected to a bit generous in size. Both adult sets seemed to have a bit of shirt shrinkage with first wash."
5.0,great wallet .like it alot its got that old rustic look to it i really like it
5.0,I read many of the reviews and the most common comment was buy 1 size smaller than you normally would perfect advice. The shirt fit great and I would have bought in other colors.
5.0,Very cute and fits well! I added a tutu under it to make it look fuller!
5.0,"They are wooden, and light weight which is cool. I'll prob paint some detail on it and should be easy being it's wood. The earrings are clip on, not heavy, again very light weight which is great. Honestly very happy with this!"
5.0,Better made than I expected. Solid quality plastic with a little weight to it. So far its survived 2 weeks of abuse from 3 boys. My only complaint is the sound quality could be better but still isn't terrible.
5.0,Surprise! What a beautiful ring!.The frame of the ring at the top and half of the sides is smoked and the bottom is silver. The top has the compass design with a gold star. I couldn't be happier!
5.0,"Very cute, light material and flowy. Perfect for a hot day at the park."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful and great quality 👍
5.0,Perfect fit.  They hold up in the wash.
5.0,Gorgeus
5.0,Love these glasses and the best part when you need to take them off your eyeglasses stay in place. The side polarized lenses are the best.
5.0,Vey cute
5.0,"This is a great coat. Perfect sizing, nice weight. A little pricey but perfect for my extended trip in the fall."
5.0,Great fit and very comfortable
5.0,I bought this for my husband - it fit perfect.  The design is well applied and it is just a cool shirt.  I did not dry it to avoid any shrinkage as he didn't have a whole lot of room for shrinkage.  It washed up well - he enjoys it.  I received this at a discount for my honest and unbiased review - it was well worth the purchase and I would purchase from this vendor again for sure.
5.0,"Looks great, fits great! But I've only worn it 3 times and it's already starting to get worn out and pilly."
5.0,"This swimsuit is absolutely adorable. I feel so confident wearing it. It has just the right amount of coverage yet still looks sexy, unlike most one pieces where I feel like an old woman wearing them. Haha. The quality of the material is outstanding! Should hold up to a day at the beach or by the pool no problem. I don't feel like anything will pop out or off while wearing it. My top is a size D yet i'm a small/xs, I have a hard time finding one piece swim suits that will fit my top. This fits perfectly! Has the option of being strapless so you can get line free tan. Can't wait to show it off this summer. I highly suggest buying this swimsuit. Great price as well.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest review."
5.0,"Beautiful, great price - thank you!"
5.0,These satin head scarfs are very comfortable and soft. They do not pull/damage my hair during the night nor do they fall off.
5.0,"Beautiful comfortable dress that can be dressed up or down. I wear a M/L, got a large “just in case” and wish I got a medium as it is a bit too big around the waist. It is very forgiving and comfortable though!"
5.0,"My son loves this gaiter. Of all the ones we own, this is his favorite. Wears it to school as required mask. comfortable & breathable.  Will be back for more."
5.0,This is a beautiful chain!  It is very well made and looks great on.  Nice size!  Recommend to any one.
5.0,Got this as a present for my Godsons 10th birthday and he ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT.  Wears it everywhere. Super cute as a gift !
5.0,Love fit and look
5.0,"Purchased as a Christmas present, so haven't given it to the lucky girl yet but this set is absolutely gorgeous! Deep blue stone that catches the light beautifully, lovely silver settings. Super excited to see what she thinks."
5.0,ғeelѕ good тo walĸ ιn and dιrт eaѕιly coмeѕ oғғ
5.0,this is a beautiful piece of jewelry.  I bought if for a co workers daughter she loved it.
5.0,I love this top. It’s so comfortable and I love the built in bra. It’s perfect for working out
5.0,"Very comfortable socks, perfectly fits. Liked it so much. Had issues with finding perfect socks. For summer it will be great for office use. Recommend to sell with different color though. I would definitely buy them next time."
5.0,I love this scarf - so soft and just the right size.
5.0,"Great fleece vest to wear indoors as a ""sweater"" in colder weather or outdoors in the spring/fall seasons. Good quality, nice fit for women. Not too bulky, not too fitted."
5.0,"The product: While it has yet to be worn for more than a week (so I can't attest to its durability), a visual inspection in the hand puts the StrapsCo NATO on par with both Maratac and C&B's &#34;Premium&#34; line in terms of the quality of materials and construction. However, I would give five stars for their service alone, as while there was a little confusion when the order was first filled, StrapsCo was phenomenal in staying with the issue until it was closed. Will definitely buy from StrapsCo again."
5.0,"My daughter complains about every pair of shoes she has (3 years old)...saying the back hurts or the strap digs into her heel or they are too tight for her wide feet. I got her these in a size 8 i think and my sister bought her another one the same day to surprise her. We were going to return one but she loves them so much. Her feet dont stink and she has room to wiggle in them since they are a weird mesh(but really strong). Of all the shoes she has, these are the ones she always grabs."
5.0,"I apologize for not having pictures, but these were used for my winter wedding in 2018! My bridesmaids were navy blue and my dress was ivory. The ivory looked so beautiful on all of my girls and even me. They include a pin or clip that you can hold the piece together. Very soft and cozy."
5.0,I really love this jacket!! I wear it with everything and it gives good coverage with style. It’s really cute!!
5.0,"This is a bit narrower than I thought, however, I don't want to return it.  I'll keep it to use when I want to carry a much lighter and not bulky bag."
5.0,Super cute - fits my 2.5 month old just fine.
5.0,Beautiful product and well made  Very well made!
5.0,I live in the southeastern region of the US. It is warm to very hot here most of the year so I needed a lightweight robe and this fit the bill perfectly. I enjoyed wearing it so much I bought another one! I'm retired so I don't go out every day. This robe is so comfy to lounge in all day. 😌
5.0,Ordered this about 4 days ago along with other clothes and it came yesterday. I got size large. I have 28in waist and 35in hips(136lbs) and 36B bust. It fit perfectly!!😍💜
5.0,A must have my husband love it
5.0,"I ordered a small, it’s a little short but not too much. I wore it for Easter definitely was more fancy than I expected but very pretty and comfortable! Would recommend"
5.0,"These are super soft and my 4 year old loves them. Best I can tell, they stay in place and don't bunch up. Colors are nice and they stay bright after washing. We've had them for about 3 months and they are holding up well."
5.0,This is a super cute V neck waffle knit top!!! You could wear this top over a swimsuit. I wore this with a tank top underneath and white pants. It’s so adorable! It kept me cooler the entire time I wore it!
5.0,"They are a little tight on my face, but the glasses are really cool.  I love them!"
5.0,The bodysuits are perfect for a tall two year old.
5.0,"I liked the 6 xmas earrings and the price is great, too."
5.0,Good variety of colors. Fit really well. Easy to clean at a price you can't beat
5.0,"I bought this for my girlfriend as kind of a ""toy"" ring, yet still pretty.  She actually has expensive jewelry, but she wears this all the time.  She likes everything about it.  It does sparkle a lot, has a super color ~ kind of champagne as I recall; and she loves the antique looking setting."
5.0,Used like I supposed to
5.0,"I love having pins on my knitting bag(s), but I'm tired of losing them and not being able to find replacements. These locking backs are the answer!! They easily lock so tightly that I can't get them off no matter how hard I try, and I have very strong hands (decades of playing piano, typing for a living, milking goats, and knitting). The included ""hex key"" works perfectly, and makes it so easy to remove the the back if you want to move the pin to a different bag. I'm sure I'll be ordering more soon, as friends always get me cute pins for birthday and Christmas, so I'll need locking backs for those!♥"
5.0,"Color fades after a good number of heavily chlorinated swims, but they hold up well, stay tight, but are forgiving and flexible."
5.0,This product is great for the price
5.0,"I really love this skirt! I'm normally a 14 and the large fits like a glove, very cute, and high quality!"
5.0,Perfect for New York fall weather. Super cute! Love it.
5.0,"Product was nice, I liked it. Product was as stated and they did send the correct item. Would recommend to friends and family."
5.0,My wife loves this piece
5.0,"Love it, love the design and it looks great on him."
5.0,Love this hat!! And love the ability to put whatever patch I want at the time!
5.0,"Good product for the money, fit TTS"
5.0,"My daughter loves these sneakers, great color, great look. She wore them all day long and walked a lot in WDW with them, and never got tired. Great product!"
5.0,Only complaint is I want to order more and they are unavailable. Fit great and are are long enough.
5.0,I checked out a lot of different sling bags and this one is just big enough and just small enough.  It holds tons and is easy to carry.  It's new but it seems like it will last.  It comes in many color options; I chose the blue which look really good.
5.0,"Had a good time wearing this dress at a friend’s Octoberfest Dance party!  Learned how to dance the polka while wearing and it had room to move. Good quality. I did wash the white mini blouse first to soften it up, and I ironed the dress, apron and blouse before wearing. The embroidery on the dress was backed with massive amounts of stabilizer so i cut the excess off. I washed the blouse and apron afterwards, air drying the apron so the lace wouldn’t shrink. I didn’t need to clean the dress, but it is dry clean only.  You do need a generous bust to fill the bodice or it will sag in front (one of my friends wore the same dress)"
5.0,Fit perfectly.  I love Gloria Vanderbilt jeans.
5.0,"I am a huge fan of anything with the crescent moon and stars, so this was no different. I wanted it as soon as I saw it! The only question was, what color? So I decided on blue :) The shipping too about 3 weeks and after a week I was checking the mail everyday hoping it was there! So, if you want an idea of how long it will take; 3 weeks or so.<br /><br />It was delivered in a small shipping envelope and the necklace itself was in a small zip-lock bag. As I mentioned in my other review, it would have been a nicer touch had it been packaged in a jewelry box. I think it would have had even more of a wow factor.<br /><br />The necklace itself is beautiful! I love it! It is so simple yet unique and very light weight. The swirl design is beautiful and more intriguing than a plain solid moon shape. The small pendant hanging off is beautiful as well, it is almost in the shape of a heart which I like. It is a little bigger than I expected, but it will definitely get plenty of attention!<br /><br />The pendant glows just as it said it would and it looks magical! All it takes is a little light to 'charge' it up and you are ready to go! I've already worn it a few times and it always catches peoples eyes in darker or shaded rooms. I love this necklace and I plan on wearing it everyday. It can go with just about any outfit. I also want to include that this necklace has a lobster clasp for those of you interested.<br /><br />* I was able to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, fair and unbiased personal experience.<br /><br />My evaluations are based on my personal experience with this product. I am not at all influenced by the seller or by the discount that I receive. I will not give a product 5 stars unless I believe it truly rates it.<br /><br />As an avid Amazon shopper, I look to the guidance of other reviewers and reviews in order to weigh my options on whether I should purchase a product because of other in depth reviews.<br /><br />I hope my review will help and guide you in your choice to purchase or not purchase this product! :)"
5.0,The product was shipped and received in a timely manner.  It looks exactly like the picture and is a very nice hat.
5.0,I know what a 6/8 feels like vs. a 3/4 and a medium feels like a 3/4. thankfully the material is somewhat stretchy so it doesn't make the outfit uncomfortable.
5.0,Loved this dress a perfect fit for a business meeting
5.0,Perfect hose but I ordered wrong size. Dr orders to wear to prevent blood clots. Need 2XL not XL. Really like the quality of hose & style with toes out.
5.0,Very  good product
5.0,Very very nice item my lady loves it
5.0,I have wanted to order this jacket for a while i am so glad i did it is perfect very comfortable and goes great with alot of my out fits. I also ordered a purse from amazon that's a perfect match great quality as well.
5.0,Very nice earrings. Match a necklace I have.
5.0,the color is perfect.  Nice bag.  Good price.
5.0,"Great necklace! All 3 glow so bright, definitely worth the price!"
5.0,"I received this vest shortly after I placed the order. I felt it fits well, and I found that the quality of the lace is very good. After washing it did not fade, I like it very much. It is softer and more comfortable to wash with a softener. I would consider buying another color."
5.0,"Got a TON of compliments on this dress from strangers and people I knew, to the point I question the rest of my wardrobe."
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful, these are my favourite earrings. I love them, my boyfriend loves them, I get compliments every time I wear them. Worth every penny."
5.0,"These are possibly the most awesome rain boots ever. Fit is great, and I have just enough room in them to wear heavy socks if I need to.  There is good cushion inside,  and the shafts is not tight on my calves. Plus the design is seriously cool."
5.0,ive worn them quite a few times and i'm a little rough on shoes but so far so  good.
5.0,So much easier to see my LCD navigation system display in my car with non-polarized.
5.0,Fits perfect and soft and just a wonderful product
5.0,worth every penny!
5.0,My daughter loves these shoes.  She is thrilled that she can change the colors of the lights!
5.0,"Customers, they nailed this. When I say they, you know who you are."
5.0,"I'm so glad I can get low magnification readers! I use the 0.50 for reading sheet music on my keyboard and music stand, and they're 5% of the cost of a thorough eye exam and 1 pair good single vision glasses!"
5.0,These pjs are so comfortable!  They fit beautifully.  I love the softness both inside and outside.  And they look good too!
5.0,"Very nice, I didn’t pay attention to the dimensions so I didn’t realize how small it would be. But it works great for me so I don’t put too much inside. Great design, very cute and lightweight"
5.0,"Just received the item in the mail and it’s exactly as described. I love the quality of the material; it looks sturdy enough to travel frequently with. I tested it as soon as I got it and was actually able to fit 4 different pairs of shoes in it! I put in a pair of sneakers, stiletto heels, ballet flats, and flip flops. It’s perfect because I can bring a pair of shoes for every activity. However, I have small feet and wear women’s size 5 shoes, so other customers with larger sizes may not fit as much as I can."
5.0,Perfect!!! The emblem chain is in the pocket!!! Love this purse!!!!
5.0,I’m wearing this outfit to my daughter graduation in a few days I tried it on and I like the way it fits on me
5.0,"love it, it fits my glasses perfect and looks really nice. Not cheaply made at all. I would highly recommend it. It has nice lining and the outside is fabric. It has a little bit of a textured feel to it."
5.0,"Although its a little long,it fits great.Worth the money for sure.AND IT CAME EARLY!"
5.0,There very cute and just the right size! Packaging was perfect and delivered quickly!
5.0,"Super soft! Nice screen print, not plastic-feeling. Runs a bit big. Still love it though!"
5.0,very lite
5.0,I use it to secure my badge holder and it works great.  the breakaway snap holds secure but will break off with some force.  The clip works well and I love the entire look.
5.0,Made well. Very dependable and compact.
5.0,These Fruit of the Loom men's briefs are much better then Haynes by far.
5.0,Cute little pair of earrings
5.0,"beautiful, product matches the discription"
5.0,Perfect length.. Tucks in behind. Colors are great.
5.0,I bought this to use as a purse and was a little afraid that it may be too large but its perfect! With that being said I would have loved a handle on top but its very well made I am extremely happy with this purchase. FYI its too small for business use and book carrying use you'll need an additional bag.
5.0,"I love these earrings. They are the only ones I wear now. They are very versatile, from casual, to work, to party. Each time I wear them, I get a lot of compliments. Some people think they are expensive diamonds. A little tricky to put on correctly, but worth it."
5.0,I like this as a tight-fitting shirt to wear while swimming.
5.0,"I cannot believe how good of quality this is for so cheap.  Absolutely adorable, my niece is going to love it.  This is the 5-6, I took a pic next to a postcard and a soft reader's case so you can see the size comparison.  Sorry, I wont post a pic of my niece wearing it."
5.0,I liked it but got the wrong size so returned it.
5.0,My man loved this !!!
5.0,"Such a darling piece of jewelry. I haven't tried wearing it, I just got it last night, but I did notice the chain looks a bit fragile, which is okay because I have plenty of other chains I could use. The main symbol looks to cool and will go well with my costume. I hope to post some pictures up of the finished results soon."
5.0,I bought for my 10 years old doughter.Realy stylish very comfortable.She loved .I really recommend this glasses .
5.0,Looks great. Came fast. Comfortable and the stones are still attached.
5.0,Used for a costume. I had to order one size up.
5.0,I love these trinkets for the size
5.0,"love my Freshwater Pearl Peacock necklace, just perfect for several outfits I have, it looks nice, simple and well made. love the size too, you can use it with casual or formal clothing, love it."
5.0,"Whether it's cold/hot or anything in between, I love this mask! It's a light cloth material that doesn't stink like some other masks do. It's super light and it gets rid of the wind-buffeting sound you get when not wearing a mask. It fits smooth, but not to tight. I highly recccomend this mask to all my motorcycle buddies. Sastified and more."
5.0,Stocking stuffer for my daughter.....she loved them!
5.0,"I bought this bag months ago in anticipation of a trip to Niagara Falls.  I chose this because I liked the size (I needed something to hold sunscreen, ponchos, etc.) and I didn't want anything too large that would be heavy to carry around. This bag was absolutely perfect! I had room for all my necessities without the extra bulk of a typical backpack. Be warned, if you want something to carry extra clothes or items for a long trip, this isn't going to work. But it was perfect for a day of tourism. It was surprisingly comfortable to carry, even after walking several miles each day of our trip. Another feature that made me pick this bag was the waterproof fabric.  After walking near the falls, none of the items inside the bag were wet at all. The phone pouch on the strap was too small for my phone in its case, but it is a convenient place for my keys. Also I like the side zipper at the back, which was perfect for carrying my passport wallet. I purchased the pink bag, but could definitely see this being used  by a man if it was a neutral color  I am very happy with my purchase and I would definitely recommend this bag."
5.0,"The shipment is very fast.<br />I think this ID holder with lanyard is just what I want. You can put some cards and cash into it, which is very convenient. I'm not sure whether the holder would be deformed if I keep too much things into it for a long time, and I'm a little worried about that, so I just keep 4 cards and some cash into the holder now, it works well."
5.0,It’s cute but I can’t figure out how to tie it on my head
5.0,"This dress is completely perfect! Fits great! I'm 5'6 about 165 pounds large hips, thighs and butt, small ish chest and I ordered my usual size of medium. It's not too loose, not too tight,  not too short, and not too long.  Will be ordering more colors.  Can be dressed up,  or casual.  Just buy it!"
5.0,Although I have not received the gray set I have received the black set they are very nice will be very warm. Size is correct fit well.
5.0,AAA+ very happy with fit and quality!!!
5.0,Why pay 40 bucks for one when this works great on .my pointed toe boots with 14 in. shafts.  Highly recommended.
5.0,Beautiful :)
5.0,"For coming from China, I received these VERY quickly!! They are very cute and I love the colors."
5.0,"I can't say I've worn them much, but they're definitely well built and look pretty convincing, almost as if they're the real thing. They come in little holding bags, which is super cute and convienent! Definitely recommend"
5.0,I like the glasses<br />The are made well and block out the sun great for Honolulu
5.0,Have these tags on all my bags and keychains.
5.0,"I honestly love these. They are very good quality, and scratch proof. I talked them up so much at work 4 of my co workers ordered them and also love them"
5.0,"I am very impressed with this pocket watch. I purchased this watch to accent my western look after buying boots and two hats from Amazon. I also like the fact that it is a mechanical watch,not battery operated. You&#34;ll never have to take it in to a jewelers for a costly battery replacement."
5.0,as advertised.  Excellent value for money
5.0,Necklaces were as described and arrived within the time period. Would purchase from this vendor again.
5.0,"My shoes (not pleaser) came apart. That platform came off but I was able to glue that, but then the straps came off! I couldn't glue the straps back on so these ankle straps saved me from having to spend $100 new shoes!"
5.0,I am an artist and I stand a lot-  these feel absolutely great- I plan to order more pairs thanks for a great product at a great price!
5.0,A standout piece! I got a lot of compliments on this.
5.0,These are absolutely gorge
5.0,Muy buena la tela y  es tal cual tiene su laz.
5.0,Best bar I've owned
5.0,I am 5ft 1 and about 140ish lbs.  I have a pear shaped body and I wear normally a medium top and 4/6 jeans.  I got a size 6 in this dress and it fits like a glove.  It is very flattering and flowy.  Made from a good quality material and is not thin/see through.  I'm definitely going to get this in another color!
5.0,Best Purchase Ever
5.0,Good stuff. I have and will continue to buy again!
5.0,These earrings are really pretty. It is hard to see the Phoenix in the filigree since it is such a stylized design. They are small and not too dangly. I like them. 5 stars.<br /><br />#ElegantDanglingSterlingSilverEarrings
5.0,Thin material but perfect clear print and fit!
5.0,"LOVED THIS DIRNDL! Was PERFECT for my trip to Oktoberfest in Munich. It was made of amazing quality and fit like a glove. I am 5’10, 150 lbs and 34ddd bust so I was really worried. I ordered the large and the medium, the large was too baggy on my upper back. The medium was spot on. Definitely worth it!!!!"
5.0,But I should have gotten a size larger
5.0,En las instrucciones se confunde la letra B y la  D.

5.0,Still use
5.0,First time ordering clothing off of Amazon. I have to admit I was a bit nervous. My daughter will be walking in a wedding as the flower girl & this suits her wonderfully! Thank you!
5.0,"It's a very nice watch and I enjoy it. As others have noted, the weak link is the acrylic crystal. If you wear it to the office to work and to mow the lawn on weekends, it should last five years or so. If you work on machinery every day, you might want to consider something with a glass crystal, and maybe some protection.<br /><br />Some people claim that the chronograph alignment is off. I don't know their situation, but I have several Timex chronographs. You have to align them once, and perhaps again when you change the battery (haven't gotten to that yet). If you search on W223 NA 222-0950012, you should be able to find the generic Timex manual, and starting on page 30 is how to set up a ""Type 3"" chronograph (which this is). If you follow these instructions, I'll bet your chronograph hands will line up properly. If you don't, well, ..."
5.0,They are perfect except one of the smaller ones came broken..
5.0,Just received this wallet & I am in loveeeee! So cute & pink!
5.0,good fit warm
5.0,Read reviews to see about sizing and they were right I fit XL but in this jacket I ordered a 5x and it fit perfect
5.0,Love the pink beanie. I was able to get beanies with lights in them for all the guys for a Christmas. Of course those girls wanted one for ourselves so when I got myself the pink one I loved it. It's thick keeps my head warm and the light is pretty bright. Would make a great gift and I would definitely purchase again.
5.0,This is a super sexy dress. I feel amazing when I wear it
5.0,I was nervous that it would be to short but love it. You can dress it up or down and material is thick.
5.0,Easy to pull on and give the right amount of compression.
5.0,Perfect fit and I love the colod
5.0,Great…. Beautiful. Ordered as a gift then ordered 2nd pair for myself
5.0,"Had the worst time tying on a fly while fishing, because, to wear sunglasses I had to wear my contacts, but those don’t work up close. These stick on lenses go on my sunglasses, so now I can wear contacts and sunglasses but still see the eye of the hook to tie on a fly. I bought a couple of cheap but well rated sunglasses and a couple sets of these lenses , and I’m good to go."
5.0,Love this bikini it’s very comfy and so gorgeous to wear especially around the house. Looking forward to being seen at the beach in it.  Also like wearing it under a pretty floral dress and skirts.  Need more Pink like this I will buy those too.

5.0,"I was totally please with the size and color. Perfect fit,"
5.0,Nice size bag & good to take on trips to keep certain items
5.0,"The color and construction of the shirt is great.  Solid towards the top, front, back, and arms, as well as solid panels running down each side, and mesh 2/3 of the front and back.  The solid material is very silky to the touch and the stitching is great (the shirt looks like it will hold up well over time).  I wish there was a tag showing laundering instructions, but other than that it's a really nice looking shirt that is comfortable and breathable enough for sports/activity but stylish enough to wear in a casual setting."
5.0,It's not as soft as other sleep shirts. That's because it's thicker and not transparent. Which might be what you're looking for.
5.0,"These were used to help fill bags for homeless women. They are as described - warm, fluffy, and pretty!"
5.0,"They’re cool, I wish you guys had a slim design on these floating buoys but it’s all good tbh. Idc about the looks, as long as they float and does what it’s supposed to do, no worries even while I’m out there on the beach, pool, lake, river and especially while I’m paddleboarding or kayaking."
5.0,"Perfect for my four year old granddaughter, who has been showing a huge interest in getting her ears pierced!<br />The picture I shared is missing some of them because she got to them before I took the picture.<br />There's 258 pieces, in all."
5.0,"Fit my 1 year old well for her Birthday, and it washed well."
5.0,"Bag arrived on time, is very nice sized and sturdy, will do the job perfectly."
5.0,Love this tote bag! It's larger than I expected which is great! I've already washed it my hand and steamed it with no color bleed or shrinkage. I can't wait to wear it this fall!
5.0,They’re exactly what I wanted. They fit perfect. Thank you!
5.0,Buen precio y calidad
5.0,My 3 years old love them. Specially because they look exactly like mine that she wants to wear all time.
5.0,THE SUNGLASSES LOOK REALLY NICE AND FIT WELL.
5.0,My mother bought me this amazing belt to complete my set for eventing colors. I find it more fun/festive and easier to customize to my size than my leather belt. I cut it down to my 23&#34; hips.  It ties my look together and is easy to clean.
5.0,Very nice hat arrived on time good pink Floyd dark side logo patch
5.0,I bought this item to protect I nice Samsonite Leather bag I bought at Beat Buy. This product is easy to apply and makes my leather bag look awesome! I highly recommend.

5.0,I'm a size 14 so I got the x large fits like a glove I love it 😘🥰
5.0,Its long enough in the front and back for me to move around without flashing anyone. The weight is really nice. It's a very flattering dress.

5.0,"Great style, fit, comfortable, price.<br />Could not ask for more<br />👍❤️"
5.0,"I love this jewelry! My package arrived in a little metal box, great for gift giving, the items were securely packaged and came with 20 inch chains for each pendant! The gems are high quality, a little smaller than expected, but cut very nice. The price is great and I plan on ordering more from this seller!  Thank you for the quality of your items!"
5.0,"We got this as a gift, and I was pleased to see how well it was packaged and how classy the necklace itself was. Our friend loves it and wears it every day!"
5.0,She loved it! Still wears it everyday! Meant a lot!
5.0,"Bought for my 7 year old daughter and 8 year old niece. They both love them. Very delicate. Fishnet-type material, and it gives quite a bit. I think they will be able to wear them for quite a while because of this, as long as they take good care of them. They could get snagged and damaged easily."
5.0,Love these! Perfect for kids 10 and under. These helped with eliminating headaches.
5.0,"I bought these for work and I love them. They are dainty, shiny, and secure. Doesn’t bother sensitive ears! Super classy!"

5.0,"Love this! It is lightweight, adjustable and great for running!!"
5.0,"I ordered a medium but I normally take a size small but  the medium fits perfectly. So the suggestion would be to go up a size as these sizes are smaller than U.S. sizes. Good quality shirt for working out, absorbs sweat and is eye catching.  I get a lot of compliments on these types of shirts at the gym. Highly recommended buy."
5.0,"Beautiful. Gave this for my girlfriend as a promise ring. She loved it! I thought it would look smaller, considering everyone's review. This ring is beautiful! Super high quality, and does not turn your finger green. She has had the ring on for over a month, and It looks like new. No missing pieces or green fingers. I recommend this for that special someone."
5.0,"This is one of my everyday go-to wardrobe items. It's both comfortable and stylish. It also works well as a maternity and breastfeeding top, although it doesn't necessarily look like one. It's loose around the waist, but without looking baggy. I love it!"
5.0,"I buy these for my kids (I have 3).  Mom hack - someone always looses a glove and voila - you have an immediate replacement with this pack.  And they still match.  They are not &#34;playing in the snow&#34; type gloves, but they do the job for cold days/<br />If I had a dollar for every glove or mitten that went missing over the years...."

5.0,"Purchased as a gift for my husband. He is very pleased with the quality of materials, adjustability, and comfort. He's a marathon runner and needs a band that keeps his iWatch in place while running and sweating. He's been wearing the band for two months without any problems. Haven't had to wash it; no odor. And we're pleased with the reasonable cost. I will definitely buy again."

5.0,Bought big for our daughter to grow into- great deal!
5.0,"A wide belt, so make sure that is what you want.  It is not one that is not laminated, but says &#34;genuine leather&#34; on it and comes in a gorgeous box with the punch tool and directions, in case you need to shorten the length or add another hole--very easy to do.  I'm hoping it holds up in the long run, which I expect it to.  A good purchase!"

5.0,"I love this dress!!!! This my second time buying this type of dress! It is super comfy!!! I received a lot of compliments! I bought me a size Large & it fit me perfectly. I like when reviewers buy their sizes becuase it helps me a lot so here are mine: I am 183 lbs, 36B bra size, 5’6. It fits me a little long but nothing to wear I’m tripping over it. Get it, you’ll love it. I don’t think it would look like if you’re a shorter person. Just FYI."
5.0,Much larger than anticipated because it is square 6mm X 6mm. A chain with a beautiful gold finish large enough to be worn alone. Excellent quality
5.0,"Love it, light and beautiful."

5.0,"I bought this robe for my 11 year old son. It is very soft, warm, and fluffy and he loves it. Perfect!"
5.0,"It is just a beautiful dress, the material is comfortable, weightless and looks dressy. I am a heavy person @ 5.2&quot; and I bought the XL this time although the chart suggested 2XL is my size. I had bought this brand before in 2XL and the fit was larger than expected...so just be aware of this."

5.0,"I purchased because of the magnifying glass, but it's really nice and I get lots of compliments.  Happy with purchase."
5.0,"This dress is very flattering and looks great! I almost did not get this dress because according to the size chart, the chest is 39 and my bust is 43-44,"" so I was worried this would be too small. I am 5'6"", 195lbs, 38D chest and this fit me fine, but not much extra room the way I like clothing to fit. I love the zipper feature and prefer the dress with the zipper slightly down. I am currently exclusively pumping and this zipper allows access so that I can pump, which is an added bonus. In addition, this dress has pockets, which is a must now for any dress for me. The material is great and not too thin. I loved this dress so much that I ordered another color.  Highly recommend."
5.0,Nice piece for cost
5.0,I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loved it! Got here quickly and it looks great on him!

5.0,"Beautiful ring. I’m so in love with it ,"
5.0,"I love my socks.  I wear them with my snow boots when I go out to take care of the horses.  When I first saw them, I thought they would be too bulky, but they do not make my boots feel too small.  They are soft and cozy to just wear around the house too!  Great socks for a great price."
5.0,These earrings are better than most more expensive earrings are. I have gotten many compliments and they are so comfortable I want to wear them everyday. They got here when they were supposed to and I believe they will outlast most of my expensive earrings.
5.0,"Love the fit, fabric is great esp if you have kids and dogs  Can be dressed up or beach casual.<br />Do need to use care when washing w other items due to the Velcro latching on. I put in laundry bag with other rip  skirts and solves issue."
5.0,"Purchased the belt online, and ordered wrong size, received response on email and phone with clear instructions, a few days later I have the belt and proudly wearing it to work!"
5.0,"Super arch support.  We have tried many different types and shopped our arches off.  These are by far the best feeling.  Worth the money, especially in shoes that have little or no support."
5.0,"The perfect wallet for traveling, very comfortable, light weight."
5.0,"These are comfy... just as all the other reviews say.  Super soft and stretchy and substantial...not too thin. I have already recommended to my girlfriends.  I ordered another pair in the camo (black) and the fabric was a little different.  I liked these the best (Flake Ice Beige)  I wore them with a oversized ivory sweater and they look cute with a gray hoodie!  Highly recommend.  I got the XL and I'm 5'4"" 195 lbs  Would not advise to size up (you may even be able to size down...I don't wear my pants tight)"

5.0,Great wallet. We’ll made and holds Apple AirTag perfectly. Lots of pockets. Metal money clip is a little stiff to work with but holds bills well.
5.0,"I wore this instead of a hat to my mother's funeral in July.  This piece is very easy to wear and it covers the entire face if you're looking for a partial covering, this isnt the peice for you because cutting it would ruin the edging. Caution to those of you who have long eyelashes or wear falsies, you cant have the mesh too close to your face. :-)  I would buy again, it served its purpose well."
5.0,Love this shirt! So stylish! Can be dressed up or down. Great purchase!

5.0,Dress fitted as expected.Flowing elegant look.Good material not too light not too heavy.The only disappointing factor was the incorrect colour.It was not the colour I had ordered
5.0,They were a perfect fit!
5.0,"I started off buying a medium and a large to see what I would think would fit my niece best for a Christmas present. Once I decided, I realized that I loved the other size for myself. Next think I know, my niece will have a green one, and I now own a green, blue, red and purple one and plan on buying more. The fabric feels awesome, great length for leggings, and I finally found a shirt that actually fits my long arms. I am 5'7 150lbs, DD bra and a medium works great for me without it still being super tight. It's a perfect fit for comfort and what I like.. Great purchase! Highly recommend."
5.0,Great boot very stylish
5.0,My daughter loved that these looked just like her favorite Ty  beanie boo! Perfect size!
5.0,Nice ring....honest seller from over seas
5.0,"I am 5.3 feet and 130lb, and the medium size with 31 Inseam fits me well.  The fabric is fantastic, really comfortable to wear, and looks great.

5.0,Hilarious!
5.0,I am so excited to wear this out with my daughter! The material is very soft and light so it won't be too hot this summer. Size was perfect for both of us. I was worried about my mommy belly in a jumper like this one but the cut hid most of it and I feel very confident. Order your normal size as we did I hate having to go up a size. Thank you for this great product!
5.0,i USE EVERY DAY STILL LOOK LIKE NEW
5.0,"Great Quality, Great Comfort and Fits Perfect!! My daughter enjoys wearing this as it is smooth and easy to put it on and off !!!"
5.0,"This is a nice simple top with a chiffon edging.  Great with jeans, jeggings, any pants.  The fabric is thin - good for spring, summer and fall with a light sweater - easy to steam or press.  I used it right out of the package and steamed it - ready in no time.  I like Laksmi tops - I have 2 others and I trust this brand and style."
5.0,Ok sock for the price just a lil to big for me
5.0,Love them. Feel great and I love the butterflies.
5.0,"Love this bag, it is larger than I thought and works out great for me.  Was shipped and arrived as expected."
5.0,Beautiful. I just washed it because I dropped my coffee on it and it didn't even got stained. I like the fabric. I could order an S because I'm not always M but because of the reviews that said it was smaller some times I didn't. M fits me good anyway but I like things tie and this one stretches. I love it
5.0,Bought this as a gift for someone else. It's very pretty and fit just as expected.
5.0,"Very comfortable fabric, loose and flowing.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  Will purchase again"
5.0,love this dress! Wore it for my first art showing! got tons of compliments
5.0,Gave it as a gift and was perfect
5.0,"It fits well I only made a little adjustment to the neck because I didn't like the round neck and I take the sides in 2 inches because I lost weight by the time I was ready to wear it, overall the material is very stretchy so the only problem you might have is if you're too slim."
5.0,I was looking for cute bow neckties for my collared shirts and bought these for a good price . They arrived faster than I expected and they also work great with my blouses!
5.0,"I like this shawl, but it is very fuzzy and when you take it off you are cover if little fuzz balls. Very warm."
5.0,Great hat! I never look good in hats but I thought I looked really cute. I also love the sun protection.
5.0,"Worked great, definitely solved a problem."
5.0,fits small to med and is gorgeous &#60;3 It fit me wonderfully once I made adjustments to the back area.<br />I am tall 5'9 and have an athletic build but I made it work! Loved it.
5.0,Sooo lovely! It applies very smoothly and the glittery finish is gorgeous- I'm tempted to use it daily! Saw it from a Korean beauty vlogger's video (Sunny!).
5.0,"super comfy and exceptionally warm; I had leather lined gloves before, which didn't keep my fingers warm in cold Colorado weather; big difference in warmth of the wool and fleece lining of this glove, highly recommend it; it's true to size and stretchy"
5.0,"Repaired a pair of bedroom shoes from llbean that my dog had taken a liking to. Found if the lace pulls out of the threading needle, sharpen the lace and try again.  It worked for me."
5.0,"Comfortable fit.  The straps are a little bit thicker so they don't hurt your ears.  Would definitely purchase again,"
5.0,"Awesome,  my wife loves it."
5.0,Worth it for a roaring 20s party. It really completed the look
5.0,Design print
5.0,I love it. It’s so easy to use and the cleaning takes no time at all. I use it all the time.
5.0,"Great fit and nice quality!  I hope that Amazon continues to carry this brand.  If so, I will purchase again."
5.0,Nice dress but way too small.
5.0,Fun birthday hat. Worked great for the occasion & the hat was big enough for an adult male head.<br />A highlight of the birthday celebration.
5.0,love this so much!! Fits perfectly. Super cute summer dress and very very flattering. Even has pockets!!!
5.0,"Very soft, fit as expected"
5.0,I love this wallet! It's well made and so cute!

5.0,"Great looking band... great quality, good price... Recommend!"
5.0,"These masks hold up to constant wash and wear.  No fading of colors, no shrinking, no pilling of fabric. Score of A+"
5.0,I love this dress! It is so comfortable. I am 5’3 and the length was perfect for me. I ordered a xxl.
5.0,This hat is simply beautiful and elegant. The ribbon is a tad bit darker than the hat and I think it looks wonderful. The hat came rolled up pretty tight and when I opened it I could tell it needed some &quot;work&quot; to get it shaped right. I turned it upside down and stuff a small blanket on the inside to help mold it. The next day I hung the hat up and let the wrinkles and creases around the brim fall out. It took a couple of days and some massaging to get it the way I wanted it. The little extra work paid off because I simply adore this hat. I wear it while working in the garden to keep the harmful rays off my face and shoulders. It fits nicely and I even measured my head circumference to see how accurate the description was. I'm right at 22&quot; and this hat fits perfectly. A chin strap is attached to the hat but I haven't had the need to wear it yet so I just push it up inside of the hat and on my head. I'm pleasantly surprised at how much I adore this hat. It's perfect in every way. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
5.0,"For the price, these are awesome!  Look very slick."
5.0,Love the flow of this kimono.  Beautiful colors!  Great for summer.
5.0,It's the exact same as the original.
5.0,The swimsuit is amazing and fits perfect
5.0,Need more elasticity
5.0,"I love these sandals! I wear them ALL the time at home, and occasionally out shopping, if raining. I have all the colors, except mahogany. I have many pairs of pink. When they start wearing down, I buy another. They are non-slip both inside and out, unless you walk on something slippery."
5.0,"Cute and fashionable. The red is a light red/pink.. just like the photo, not an American flag red. Fabric is slightly see through so it has to be worn with a cami or lacy bra if you’re feeling scandalous 😉"
5.0,Straps were a little weird... decided to reimagine the whole outfit by getting rid of the straps and the belt loops for a more tighter and cohesive fit. Definitely happy with the purchase! Just had to make it my own! (Which is highly recommend) :)
5.0,this was one of my best amazon purchases
5.0,This is a lovely dress I can't wait to wear it to church.  The fabric is nice and comfortable the length is perfect. I'm 5'4 and it come a little below the knee.
5.0,Excellent Valentines gift. Can't go wrong.
5.0,Good replacement band. Fits great
5.0,This was a gift to mother.  She was very happy with the set and couldn’t wait to wear it.
5.0,Lovey
5.0,"I read the reviews prior to purchasing, and saw that some people complained that a few fell out quickly. I used Shoe Goo (shoe glue) when installing and these things are LOCKED!<br /><br />Best Advice:<br /><br />1.  Mark you clear locations with sharpie<br />2.  Pre-drill small holes with drill/drill bit<br />3. Apply a small glob of glue on prestige’s hole<br />4.  Use drill to screw in cleat until flush. (Slowly)<br />5.  Wipe excess glue off with wet towel/paper towel before it dries.<br />6. Message me promptly saying thank you 😊<br /><br />These things are AWESOME!"
5.0,So cool it's sophisticated and cool at the same time I took it to Europe and it was with me at every dinner no matter the setting or what I was wearing. I bring it to Vegas in a couple weeks. And I bought it for my friend for her birthday. And I think you should buy it too

5.0,I just love how cute it looks...I'm satisfied with it glad I decided to get it...
5.0,I got for my mother who has nighttime circulation problems in her feet and ankles due to neuropathy. She says they definitely help. The only issue she had (which is common with compression socks) is the top band was tight and left a mark.
5.0,Looks great! Wish it would have come with a nice chain. I would have paid for it
5.0,"Really nice strap! This is my second strap from Watch Gecko and they always come through. The PU is soft and the buckle is nice with laser etched ZD.<br /><br />If you have 7” wrists, understand the strap is a bit large. I had to add a secondary keeper for left over strap.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I really like it and think it compliments my SKX009 really well."
5.0,For going to the office
5.0,"got the &#34;large&#34; size.  5 foot 6 inches; 160 lbs:  good fit. way it's designed it's a bit baggy and not form-fitting, but I perfer roomy, so am quite pleased with it.  Arcadia: is like an &#34;off white&#34;, with very light brown hues woven in. Thin material- so it's not too heavy."
5.0,"Beautiful earrings that are nice quality. The backs screw mechanism has a stopping point where they become secure in place. These will not fall out. My 14 month old gets a lot of compliments on these. &#34;Hi pretty baby, I like your earrings!&#34;"
5.0,"Excellent quality of gloves, very warm. Just quite small...I'm very happy I ordered medium, I normally wear small and these mediums are snug."
5.0,It's genes head! On a pin! What more could you ask for? Well it doesn't come with fart noises but you can make those yourself!
5.0,Great Bolo Bracelet! Love the adjustable style and the stone in the Tigers Eye are just beautiful!!!
5.0,These are cute and I get a lot of compliments on them.
5.0,"Looks nice, functions well, great Christmas tie."
5.0,Love the fit.<br />Arrived as shown
5.0,I'm a fairly large person (Ok very big short and fat xD). And I was afraid these might not fit once I read the comment about them being too small.. BUT THEY FIT PERFECTLY ON ME! Not tight at all &#60;3 It's very heavenly and adorable perfect tights nothing wrong with them at all! Just buy them now.
5.0,A favorite of my son's! It fit well and he loves it.
5.0,Not what I am expected but I still love them
5.0,"I love this! Wanted something warm but not so heavy I was uncomfortable indoors. Colors bright as shown. Like that the bottom is not elasticize, but falls nicely over jeans or stretch pants."
5.0,Used to hold my sail card on a recent cruise. Loved showing my favorite college off.
5.0,"It's good quality, I thought it would be cheap but it wasn't! I definitely recommend this to anybody! I love it!"
5.0,Christmas present is for Granddaughter. I'm sure she will love it. It looks well made and color is great. Anything that is shiny and sparkles..
5.0,"Great product, perfect for training and looking juicy. :)"
5.0,"It is very beautiful and shiny. The only problem I did have, was that it was all tangled, so I did have to untangle a few knots, but other then that, I'm very satisfied! It even came in a nice box!"
5.0,Beautiful dress! Fits great! Love it
5.0,"Using the measurement chart provided, the vest fits just right! The quality of the fabric, the buttons, and the metal buckle on the back of the vest are all very nice - and it is very well made. Definitely worth the price!"
5.0,"Love! They are super soft and are true time size! May even by another pair, same brand."
5.0,This top is so much fun to wear
5.0,I really like these! I have two other pair that are actually men's or unisex and was happy with them. Didn't know if I would like more of a women's shoe or not. But they are even more comfortable than my other pairs and I am extremely happy with the fit and look of them. May have to order more in other colors!!
5.0,I am very happy with my purchase of the cord locks and how quickly they were delivered. So easy once I figured that out.  Makes my mask making experience so much easier. Great product and nice customer service.

5.0,Really cute and great dress
5.0,It’s a nice heavy chain with a nice clamp
5.0,My son loves these and wears under his jersey for baseball. I had to return the first pack way too big. I sized down to medium. My son is a large. So much cheaper then buying name brand and they work just the same. Wish they came in maroon :)
5.0,"I ordered the Chambray blue polka dot/red pinstripe set and I LOVE them! They have a gintage/look and feel to them.. The fabric on the ones I ordered is almost like a denim material, so instead of being stretchy all over it has a stretch band in the back and a tie in the front.. My little girl is 2 years old and at first I was concerned that it would be a little too tight, but it ha's just enough room and she kept it on for just over 2 hours, which is a record for her LOL. It really stayed put! 5☆ product, very well made and I will definitely consider getting a few more in different colors!<br /><br />**I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A STEEPLY DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW**"

5.0,"Love it! My second one. Have one in black and then had to get one in cognac. Get compliments all the time.It came in a huge box with tons of tissue paper in every place in the purse. Beautiful and richly made. I have Coach purses and Dooney and Burkes, these Joy and Iman are my favorites. It is big. It's a TOTE. So I expected and wanted it to be big."

5.0,"Love! Love! this dress/lounger. I can't wait to wear it during & after the holidays. Love the fabric...I ordered large in Red, which is different than on the model as shown...it's more like a perfect Rich bright red-orange. I really love the color.  I'm keeping this one, and ordering another color in medium..."
5.0,This purse is awesome and looks far better than the picture. I receive so many compliments on it.
5.0,Very danty. Love it
5.0,"Quick delivery. Great Company. The product is as advertised. Recipient reports, &#34;Covered eyes feels weird. Can see out of mask, if there is enough light. Fun and creepy.&#34;"
5.0,"CUTE Cute cute... perfect way to keep my feet warm, dry and clean. They fit me perfectly, because it appears they are made short and wide... which is what I need and common well cut (I did buy size up just incase)."

5.0,You know you play golf better when you look better. Thanks for the hat.
5.0,FAVORITE SHIRT EVER
5.0,Great dress for my bridal party .....my MOH was ecstatic..colour and style matched the wedding theme
5.0,"This is a great watch.  Like the leather strip, large dial with numbers big enough to read.  Great purchase!"
5.0,These are my favorite and most long lasting pair of sunglasses that I own.
5.0,"I love this dress. I bought it to wear to a wedding in August in TN. It was a hot one. This dress was perfect. My only complaint - I bought the Red Floral dress, it is NOT red. It is more of a burgundy/maroon color. It still worked fine. But I had my eye on red. I got lots of compliments on this one!"
5.0,The only watch you'll ever need. Cheap and basic with that classic 90s style.
5.0,Beautys!
5.0,I get a lot of complements.  They are very comfortable and also I like the design and the fact that they are genuine leather.  For me they ran true to size.  I purchased the gray with lining and the other two w/o lining. I am happy with my purchases.
5.0,"Great little wallet, holds essential passport, credit cards and ID, and is slim, easy to carry with easy access, and it's cheap."
5.0,Very happy with this product. Nice quality for the price.
5.0,"Love the hoodie and delivered right when it said, great job"
5.0,This dress was exactly what I was looking for. Very lightweight and is exactly like the picture!
5.0,Amazing customer service and product will buy again loved it thank you!
5.0,"This is a very soft, warm top that keeps you warm without overheating you. I wore this for a workout and it not only wicked away sweat, but it also kept me odor-free. Very, very nice. I am eager to try more products from this line."
5.0,Love the soft feel.
5.0,These are great! Good quality and good price. Bigger than I thought.
5.0,"I took a chance on this dress despite it not having any reviews, I have absolutely NO regrets! I already own the cocktail version fo this dress and when I saw that there was a long one, my heart stopped. It came and as soon as I put it on I felt like a movie star. That being said, the slit is very very high... I, fortunately, don't really have a problem with this because it seemed to stay in place and didn't feel like I would be exposed in any way. There is some side boob, it's a flashy dress and that's just all that there is to it! It does lay a little awkward in the hips but I think it's just because I made the straps on the shorter side. Overall it's an amazing dress!!!"
5.0,"The Men's genuine full grain oil tanned leather jeans belt with silver buckle is the real deal.<br /><br />This is simply a great belt.  I received the 34"" size which is perfect for my oldest son.  This fits jeans and jean shorts easily.  It is an attractive belt that is over one inch in diameter.  This is a light tan belt and is perfect not only for jeans in my opinion, but to pair with a pair of khakis for a more formal look.  The silver belt buckle is fashionable and works easily.  It holds up pants well.<br /><br />My son has now worn this belt with jeans and with shorts, and looks good in it.  I think this is a good quality belt."
5.0,"I work at home on a computer for my job AND I'm an online student.  The hours spent in front of the computer screen have caused chronic headaches and chronic eye strain and dryness.  I bought these glasses before my semester started in the fall and it's been 3.5 months and these glasses have been life changing!  I will never go without them again, because I hardly get headaches anymore and my eyes have been so much better with the long hours looking at a screen.  Thank you!"
5.0,This is very beautiful.
5.0,Love these great style sunglasses!
5.0,I will be ordering more! So comfortable!

5.0,Well made and good quality.  Great with leggings
5.0,"I like the look of them and I like the feel of them they fit more like a large than an extra large for but like the feel of them but after they’re on eight hours or so they get really tight, especially at by the knee and they’re not real easy to get on a compared to other ones they have moved to the top. Yes I would buy again."
5.0,"These have excellent arch support and I was able to wear ALL day without any foot fatigue. I did not have time to break in prior to going on vacation and did experience some redness on my pinky toes, but that is normal for me. During vacation I did some light hiking, went in the water, on the beach, and all day on paved walking paths and these sandals wore excellent. I especially like that they have traction and are very comfortable to walk in all day!"
5.0,Perfect and adorable!
5.0,This necklace looks very nice and comes with a thick chain.  The only drawback is it’s the loop that you connect the chain with is fairly small.
5.0,I finally got to my jewelers to have it put on. It fits and feel good on my arm!!! Too soon to tell if it is going to stay nice.
5.0,This dress fits perfectly.  It's super awesome
5.0,Band is more comfortable and the nylon material does not make my wrist sweat.
5.0,Fits really well. Super cute and comfy. I bought this to go with a high waisted wrap skirt so it looks like a crop top for dining and walking around. Perfect.

5.0,I feel in love with this color. The yellow was exactly as pictured.
5.0,"They arrived when they were supposed to, they look great, and the lenses are really clear! I'll add pictures later."

5.0,We gave this as a gift to the kid’s school crossing guard. He loves it! He put it on his hat to wear everyday.
5.0,Draw string could be better!
5.0,My toperiery dog loves the shades.
5.0,"Unlike some rash guards we have used, my son doesn’t complain about getting this off once it gets wet. That is reason enough for me to give this 5 stars! I like that this protects a bit more of his neck than his last rash guard. I was a bit concerned that the white fabric would stain, however, despite his best efforts (ha!) this has washed great every time. I highly recommend this one!"
5.0,I wear these a couple times a week and have had them for three months now.  They are holding up well.

5.0,"These are very cute!! They came ahead of time and arrived in very good condition, except that the posts at the back were bent, as some other customers mentioned. That was easily resolved however, and they are very cute. I can't wait to wear them!!"
5.0,"Love the cut, design and fabric. I'm about 37/32/37 and thought I might need a size 8 but I went with a 6 since I am losing weight and it's not overly tight in the wrong places; should fit perfectly by the time I go on vacation.<br />In addition to the style having a very slimming appearance due to the cut, the inside of the front panel is lined with a no-stretch mesh similar to organza."
5.0,"Ok so, was gonna do 4 stars but I love this bag! It's  kinda small after the matching wallet goes in but I love this bag! Super cute, get lots of compliments and am contemplating ordering it in red :)"
5.0,"They are a nice thick blades but I did need to put a sharper edge on them, the cutting edge is kind of dull from the factory but it’s not a complaint, I don’t think they’re supposed to be razor sharp or they will nick easily probably."
5.0,"I love this dress. I have it in black, as well as the light pink color, and it's a staple of my summer wardrobe. So comfortable, and surprisingly glamorous when you throw a belt on and some jewelry. The fabric is a nice weight and quality, too. It's oversized and flowy, exactly as expected. Size down significantly if you want a tight fit."
5.0,Wide around the ankle and upper part of boot but comfy and get lots of compliments
5.0,well made<br />good weight<br />only looks like costume when you get it up close to your eyes<br />stones are well set<br />good size/2 inch pendant

5.0,Arrived quickly mask just as expected
5.0,Very nice product good quality. Recommend
5.0,It’s true to size. My co-worker & I both ordered a size medium. The only problem I had was the strap kept falling down.
5.0,"At first glance, the left half looks much darker than the other side, almost black. But with the mask fully on, the dark actually makes it look more like the anime."
5.0,my son absolutely loved this robe and it fit perfectly
5.0,"Great material, excellent socks. Pretty nice to have them. High quality."
5.0,Very nice looking. Arrived on time.
5.0,"Amazing skirted leggings - seriously love these. I normally wear a large in leggings, a 12 in jeans. There are asian sizing so had to go with the XXL which fit good to slightly loose. If you love the comfort of leggings but would appreciate the added modesty/coverage of a skirt - these are for you! These can be paired with a black flat for work or church or with a tee for everyday. SO COMFORTABLE!"
5.0,"This is a very nice dress. Simple, can be dressed up or down.  The fabric is soft and stretchy, yet not overly clingy (covers my bumps and bulges nicely!) I followed the size chart and ordered one size up- so it fits perfectly.  It is about knee length.  I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and I can honestly say that I would have purchased this at the full price, it is worth it."
5.0,A really nice dress to be dressed up in and clean in wear it day night lounging around everything so nice

5.0,This is the second set of these masks I bought! Fit very nicely very comfortable not to smothering but feel confident they are protecting! And had lots of compliments
5.0,I ordered this one for half the cost that I paid for the first one I fell in love with-and had to have-in Deer Valley on a ski trip. I wear one or the other literally 4 out of 7 days a week! I call them the &#34;Magic Vests&#34;! They completely make your bum disappear!
5.0,"I am so in love with this ring!  I recently purchased it to wear in place of my real wedding set while we vacation in Mexico and I honestly am so excited to wear it, even more so than my actual wedding rings!  I love the rose gold and it could probably pass as a real engagement ring because it is good quality and crafted really well.  It is very feminine and beautiful.  I might actually start wearing it as a right hand ring because I love it so much.  A great purchase!"
5.0,"I love these, great for and great print.  I was so happy to see these in a big kids size 6. As someone who wears a women's size 8-8 1/2, these fit great"

5.0,loved this prayer shawl!!!
5.0,"Was very pleased with the way it looks. Very pretty and a good size, not too small."
5.0,This is a gorgeous set. I got it to go along with a rose gold ring. I have sensitive ears and I was able to wear this all day without any discomfort.
5.0,These pants are comfy while helping to hold you &#34;in&#34; all the right spots! I love the vibrant colors and patterns the most though and wear them to teach Yoga!
5.0,"The color is true to the picture.  Fit is perfect.  Handled the wash great.  Hung it to dry.  No fading, no pills, no pulls.  HIghly recommend."
5.0,I’m 6’ feet 400lbs and it fit me tight but that’s alright. It’s just for my zoom meetings. It covers everything up  top but is still cool and thin with a nice breeze on my legs.

5.0,This dress makes me feel amazing! I love it and might buy more. Not see through at all
5.0,The Bud Lite tank top is the male equivalent of the female &#34;little black dress.&#34;  Good for any occasion.
5.0,Love this! The top arrived a week earlier than stated and was in great condition.  The wine color is really pretty and the material is not too thin.  True to size. Does not cling to belly or other problem areas.

5.0,I LIKE THE LENGTH OF THE BOOT THEY ARE LIGHT WEIGHT AND ALLOW MY FEET TO BREATHE
5.0,The gold detailing make them extra special and the thick wedge (without the angle) is perfect for height and comfort.
5.0,"I like the FRESION BAGS CO. MESSENGER BRIEFCASE BAG as it can be used as Backpack, Briefcase or Shoulder Bag. When used as Briefcase both Shoulder and Backpack Straps are hidden away in enclosed compartments.<br /><br />The FRESION Messenger Bag is lightweight.  Construction is of retro looking Grey/Brown canvas with leather  straps, zipper pulls, handles and accent. There are nine (9) zippered pockets showing on the outside of the bag and one inside. I like that all the little compartments have zippers which keeps smaller items from falling out. The largest compartment will house a computer and there is three inches of space for business meetings materials.  The internal zipper section is here also.  The computer space is padded with an elastic security strap over the top.  The other large compartment is good for quickly needed files, calculator, pens and pencils.<br /><br />Even when almost empty the case will stand on its own.  This facilitates putting items into the bag, finding things and removing used documents.  The Backpack Straps have their own zippered compartment. They are totally out of the way when not in use.  The same is true for the shoulder strap which fits into a slotted compartment on the cover material of the backpack straps. There is a slotted compartment on the other side of the bag.  When the bag is used in shoulder or backpack mode the carry straps fold away into these same two compartments and secured with magnetic snap. There are two “D” rigs on one end of the bag. All of the interior is lined in a satin type material.<br /><br />Recommended  Five  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  Star<br /><br />Thank you for looking at my review.

5.0,2/17/18 Review I love this dress size Small fits perfect good stretchy material
5.0,When I got an apple watch my only regret was I had to give up my ceramic watches which I loved.  After my white band that I got when I purchased the apple watch got all dirty and marked up I start looking for another watch band.  I found this one way down the list of the many available bands so I purchased it.  It need a few links removed but that was so easy I was concerned that I had done something wrong and that it was surely going to fall off my wrist - but it did not.  If I could have this is all colors I surely would.  And it feels good on the wrist.
5.0,"Because of reviews and how I wanted this to fit me, I went up a size and got an xxl, in this photo I’m 5’6” and 190 lbs about, I wear a 12-14 dress. I also don’t have skinny arms and they didn’t squeeze at all."
5.0,Beautiful dress! Fit my daughter wonderfully!
5.0,Nice craftsmanship. Very sturdy and looks great
5.0,"The Belt looks really nice and clean. No complaints, it's exactly what I was hoping it would be. The only thing is the dark brown side is super dark and you can barely tell the difference. I strictly bought it for the black side so I wasn't concerned but just giving you a heads up. The packaging is really nice and it does come with a tool to remove the buckle if desired. Looks expensive, I'm really pleased."
5.0,"Nice hat, good price"
5.0,"Beautiful, Yet smaller than expected!"
5.0,LOVE THIS TOP!!!  I get compliments on it every time i wear it!!
5.0,My daughter really loves these earrings. She purchased them for her cartilage  piercings. They look very nice.
5.0,Love this really looks authentic. My friends thinks it’s the real thing.
5.0,I love this dress. The fabric isn’t a true flannel but it is a lightweight cotton. I wore it with leggings and received several compliments.
5.0,"It perfectly fit our daughter! We've made her day by presenting this to her! She was so excited that even made a special performance for the whole family of Tchaikovsky ""Swan Lake"" dance :-)"
5.0,"super sexxy! i love this company, never let me down!"
5.0,Great watch perfectly described
5.0,Exactly as desdribed
5.0,"I was skeptical to order bc there were not any reviews yet, but I had been in search for pants like these and everywhere I looked they were selling out quickly. They must be trendy this season. But they shipped on prime and fit perfectly. Very soft, thin fabric but are not see through (thank goodness!) I am 5’ 2” for reference and they hit right at my ankles and are high waisted, so if you are taller they will be slightly cropped. Hope this helps"
5.0,absolutely love these shirts there great for any kind of physical activity
5.0,"Feels nice and snug, yet material is smooth and not thick.<br />Front pouch is very supportive."
5.0,Love my jeans.! Fit perfect and they are so comfortable. Going to be purchasing more soon.
5.0,So warm and comfortable. It makes a very fashionable statement. You're bold beautiful and your going to show it.
5.0,My son LOVES these socks! Great buy!
5.0,Used them driving all day in the rain today and they worked great.  Definitely improved driving in these conditions.
5.0,"These are really nice earrings. I've been wearing them since I bought them and I don't even know they're in my ears. They're comfortable, pretty, and I've had no kind of allergic reaction. I wanted this set because I have helix piercing on one ear and I wanted to wear the smallest size there and the middle or larger size in my lobe area. Unfortunately, for me, the smallest size was too small, so I had to settle on the middle size for my helix piecing and the largest size in my lobe. They still look terific!"
5.0,"Lightweight,  simple, fun, punkesque. Id prefer more of a steel color or matte black."
5.0,nice shirts. I have several of the and get complemented on them. Just be sure to wash them inside out.
5.0,This is a beautiful carving. I love that the necklace is adjustable.
5.0,"This t-shirt is made of the really soft, silky cotton that I love.  So comfortable, and looks great too!  It is definitely form fitting, with the XL a good fit for my size 14, 38D frame. I would not want it any tighter, and would consider even getting an XXL if they made it.  That being said, I love something that accentuates my feminine shape, and this fits the bill better than almost any others I've seen.  It hangs well and tapers nicely. The length in body and sleeves make it flattering even for larger, middle aged women like me.  The longer sleeves also give a good proportional look when paired with an infinity/circle scarf.  I wish it was available in more summery colors, I'd love to make it a wardrobe staple.  I haven't washed it yet, so I am hoping it will hold up well."
5.0,Beautiful watch. The face is large enough that I can see the time easily. Goes great with my 1920's themed outfit.
5.0,"Gorgeous color, fits perfect. Received a lot of compliments. Very comfortable. Exactly as listed, and size is as listed in chart."
5.0,This is a great rain boot...I normally wear size 10 but I bought a 9 and they fit perfect...
5.0,"Beautiful craftsmanship! My wife loved it, bought it so my 3 yr old son could give it to her for mothers day...she wears it everyday!"
5.0,Perfect fit. Thick enough to not be see through but thin enough not to be too warm.
5.0,"Great watch band, looks good on watch very nice quality and was easy to put on the watch!"
5.0,"I have been looking for some good cargo shorts for a while. These are breathable, fit perfectly and seam very durable. I am looking forward to buying a few more pair. I would recommend these for anyone looking for some good shorts with a great price tag."
5.0,Bought this dress for a wedding and it fit perfectly. The blue and black was elegant but understated. Would definitely buy again.
5.0,"sturdy , welll made"
5.0,"When I first saw the socks, I thought they were way too small. However, I tried them on and they were perfect! I bought Medium and my shoe size is 9.5 men's US size. The colors are exactly like the pictures."
5.0,Soft and warming
5.0,Fantastic stylish coat for my Asian wife I don’t like to buy anything produced in China but we or she made an exception
5.0,"Feels nice and light, perfect for summer and such vibrant colors! I feel so beautiful when I wear this<br />I’m very busty and it makes my girls show more then usual, but in a classy way. I mean, if that’s possible."
5.0,These are so beautiful. They were wonderful for my wedding.
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress. A girl I follow on IG reviewed it as a good piece to hide Endo belly (excessive bloat) and it really does ! The lack of waistband makes it comfortable on our sensitive bellies. It's also really flattering! I think I could have worn a M or L at 5ft 146lbs. I got the large, and it fits well. I tie up the ends, but plan to hem it some. The material is incredibly soft, and the rich purple color is just as pictured. Plus, pockets !"
5.0,Darling
5.0,"It was a birthday gift for my daughter who was losing her hair, she loved it so much that she went online and bought more!"
5.0,"These little slippers are what my 3 yr old niece picked out for herself. They are adorable! They fit perfectly, are washable, and they keep her from sliding all over the floor. Would definitely recommend these!"
5.0,Good quality and the spring is firm so it holds very well compared to many others.
5.0,Mom love it
5.0,"I haven't gotten a chance to wear it as I don't get married until May, but the look and feel of the ring upon first observation looked great. It fits just like the test rings I tried on in a jewelry store and will most likely be buying two (one bigger and one smaller) so that if my fingers swell or shrink, I can still have a ring to wear. Great ring especially for the price. This ring will cost you $200-$400 from a jewelry store.<br /><br />I will update later this year once I've had a chance to wear it for a couple of months."
5.0,Love them all got 8 so far you could just go ahead and send me a nice little gift for my loyaty
5.0,Very cute little party dress. I would recommend it
5.0,Excellent customer service!<br /><br />Belt is a bit skinny but made very well.
5.0,Good shirt but fits was to big.
5.0,It's super cute and seems to be holding up really well :) I definitely enjoy having it!
5.0,"I thought this was only the earrings, but it’s a self piercing set! I only needed the earrings but thought it was cool how it came with an individual ear piercing mechanism that hold each earring. I will definitely buy again if I plan to self pierce. I did use some alcohol to clean the studs before putting them on— oh you know just to sanitize them a little. So far it looks good!"
5.0,Expensive but no place else to get one and this is what my wife wanted.
5.0,Beautiful pants
5.0,"Gorgeous, as described, bright colors. Son will wear it this weekend for his bday party."
5.0,i liked it and its cool
5.0,"I Love everything about this watch. Only one complaint, the writing is barely legible. I thought the words were supposed to be in black, these are plain like the watch color so it’s pretty hard to read the inscription."
5.0,Love it! came in 2 days!
5.0,Like how it looks on. The hidden compartment is a good idea. I carried my phone and ID in and no purse. It felt fine and not bulky either
5.0,"IT'S THIN (IT'S SLIM) WITH ROOMY CREDIT CARD HOLDING POCKETS AND LICENCE HOLDER, IT ALSO HAS THAT ""RFID"" BLOCKING (PROTECTION) THINGY WORKING FOR IT"
5.0,This sweater is super soft and doesn’t feel itchy on. I received a size Large and I typically wear medium (34C and 27 waist)but this fits me fine as a baggy tunic sweater. I like the scalloped hem and mock neck. Looks very cute on and would pair well with leggings and knee high boots. I look forward to fall/winter weather so I can wear it!
5.0,"I didn't check the size and the pendant is larger that I expected, but my teen daughter loves it, so it's a win!"
5.0,"I am using it and it is light enough for summer, yet keeps me warm enough in my air con office"
5.0,"These are super cute and even come with a storage box, my only issue is they were too small to thread my string through so I was unable to use them how I planed, they aren’t the best quality but they would be a super fun add on to any jewelry"
5.0,"Earrings look exactly like mini water bottles.  The bottles are really clear, as though filled with water. So cute!"
5.0,"I have a 6” wrist and this fits fine.  I’ve gone through many Fitbit Charge2 Bands that broke off and finally found one that is unbelievably durable.  This one I’ve worn daily for three months and it doesn’t show any wear.  My previous ones got dirty and worn looking within a couple of weeks but not this one.  It’s also very comfortable so much so I bought the same in 5 other designs.  At the rate this one is holding up, the other five straps will outlast my fitbit.  Very impressed with the quality of this strap.  I definitely recommend it."
5.0,These have withheld ample abuse and have stood up better than my old pair of rainbows... I recommend for a cheap go-to flip-flop.
5.0,"These bands are exactly as I expected. They are light weight, durable and easy to attach. They're exactly what I was hoping to get!"
5.0,I was very pleased with this purchase.  It looks and fits great!
5.0,"I love this charm! It's absolutely beautiful. I was expecting it to be 3D on the front of the charm and flat on the back, but it's not. It's 3D all around and I love that!"
5.0,This was my first purchase of Jess and Jane.  Love the Jess and Jane Cotton Tee shirts. I bought more.
5.0,A great fit at a great price!
5.0,My child loves the hat and it fits as expected. Decent quality for the price we paid.
5.0,Appears to be well made.  Very comfortable and with ample room.  Not too long so as to get in the way of my wheelchair wheels.  The 3/4 sleeves are great as are the two patch pockets.<br /><br />I had hoped that the fabric would have been of a heavier weight making it more suitable for winter time but this will certainly suffice for months of warmer temps.
5.0,Lo recomiendo. Excelente....
5.0,I love these warm soft cozy socks and they’re super cute. I will be ordering more!
5.0,It's Ok looks pretty!!!
5.0,Love this dress. It fits and looks great!
5.0,"I am obsessed with these pants. The sizing is a little odd (I wear a 6-8 in most pants but had to get the 4 in these, and they are still quite roomy!) Once you find your size, you will want to wear them EVERY DAY! So comfy, as flattering as cargo pants can possibly be, and an AWESOME zippered cell phone pocket so you can grab your camera and snap a photo without rifling through your backpack. Probably the best pair of pants I have ever bought (and now I have them in almost every color!)"
5.0,I love it. A dramatic retro look without destroying your wallet.
5.0,I have not worn it but received it and it's quite beautiful.
5.0,I use this to hold business cards and it's wonderful.
5.0,This bracelet is nicer than I imagined from the photo. It's easy to put on your wrist with the adjustable leather strap.
5.0,My grand-daughter loves these shoes so much! Fits perfectly & protected her feet when splashing puddles :-D
5.0,Nice medium size Handbag.
5.0,I love love these slippers!  Well made and so comfy.
5.0,"Perfect for a man to carry various items like phone, camera, etc.  Good quality."
5.0,Absolutely love these! Only thing is I wish the top band was a bit bigger (longer) for better tummy control. I am 5’4 and weigh an athletic 165. I went with the mediums and feel like I should have got smalls instead. They are so soft and light weight and feel like second skin. I ordered 3 pair and plan on grabbing another pair in a smaller size! They are definitely squat proof too 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
5.0,Great Aviators with a solid build and good fit. Sharp look with the reflective silver lenses. Polarization isn't too intense that it's difficult to use my smartphone (I've had glasses that made this difficult). I would definitely replace these with the same if I lost or broke my current pair.
5.0,I’m 5’ 5” and I weigh 129 pounds I purchased a medium because I don’t like things to fit snugly this fits amazingly well I wear a D cup bra and wanted to make sure that the chest area was large enough. This fits perfectly. It’s super soft and very comfy. It’s Flowey and looks great does not wrinkle easily I washed it and hung it to dry and it looks perfect no wrinkles. I thought the price was great and I would highly recommend I love the green color that I chose but considering purchasing others in different colors. I love it that much highly recommend
5.0,🤩🤩🤩
5.0,Wear it all the time. Well made.
5.0,"I bought these for my indoor garden and the bright white LED lights.  Before these my eyes frequently hurt and seemed to dry out.  These are a life saver and wish I would have purchased them long ago.  I highly recommend these glasses.  Method Seven has many other types as well for the various types of lights (LED, HPS, HID etc..)"
5.0,I like every things
5.0,WISH IT WAS LARGER FOR JOKERS TO SEE BEFORE THEY GOT TOO CLOSE !!<br /><br />LOVE THE QUOTE !!

5.0,"Wow. What a great looking watch. I have been searching for daily wear watches that A have a clean sterile dial. B easy to read with good lume. C good water resistance. D good build quality and easy wearability. Purchased one stainless case and one bronze case. They meet all qualifications, 200 meters wr, great movements(nh35 is a Seiko 4r35) easy to read. And a screw down crown. Great buy. I would highly recommend. San Martin is very well liked among the watch loving community."
5.0,Yay!! I really like this. I have ordered and returned 3 dresses and the 4th one is perfect! You should get it 🤗
5.0,"These are way more lovely than I would have expected for shoes that are advertised as &#34;costume&#34; or &#34;Halloween&#34; wear.<br />Even better, they are so comfortable! I don't mean they're cushy orthopedic shoes, but they're not at all painful to stand and walk around for a long period of time. I have painful bunions on both feet which make high heels excruciating for extended wear, but I spent a night walking around, going up and down stairs and dancing without taking breaks and my feet were fine!"
5.0,"Got this for my sister's 25th birthday, she's a Halloween baby and this was perfect! bigger than I expected but looks great."
5.0,"If you’re truly in between sizes, you want to go down a size instead of going up."
5.0,"Love these shorts! I am ordering additional pairs I love them so much. Comfortable, fit as expected, pockets are super helpful & fit my cellphone, and tucks my tummy in nicely. The bottom of the shorts aren’t super tight, which is nice. Good, comfortable fabric that thankfully isn’t see-through!"
5.0,good cheap sunglasses wish they were polarized tho :(
5.0,excellence
5.0,"These rocks were not in uniform sizes. They are cracked, chipped, and take several thick layers of paint to stick to the surface. Not really a great product for children or family when you have to keep figuring out a way to fix product errors"
5.0,I am really happy with this order.  The hat is a perfect neutral. It arrived clean without any odd smells. The bill was flat and easy to shape to my liking. I love that it is adjustable. The extra strap is hidden by a second layer of material. I cannot feel it at all when wearing the hat. Its very comfortable.
5.0,Nice color and is very<br /><br />Comfortable
5.0,Ugh shoes are always high quality and so comfortable! Love these
5.0,"love this pin, I wear it all the time"

5.0,love love my shoes have them on now
5.0,I ordered a size up as the reviews suggested. Love this swim skirt. Full coverage.
5.0,I love these. I have since bought about 3 pairs. They work really well for my feet.
5.0,I love this suit. It doesn't come up past your belly button like the picture but it is right below it. I use to always wear bikinis but since I've had a child I wanted a little more covered and this is perfect.
5.0,"It’s a great investment… amazing quality, true to size"
5.0,Holds the crowds attention. Well crafted!
5.0,I love this shirt it is very cute I wear a extra extra large and it is perfect highly recommended
5.0,"Was looking for a cute, waterproof bag to take to amusement parks or sightseeing while on vacation. I love this one because it zips on the inside so I don’t have to worry about someone trying to open my bag and steal stuff. It really works for keeping your stuff dry in the rain, but still looking stylish at the same time."
5.0,Bought these for my nephew.  His mama loved them and the look
5.0,Great product. Not for larger heads
5.0,Excellent quality for a good price.
5.0,"I fit L, order L but was a litter big"
5.0,"Just got this bikini today and I love it.  It fits my lovely curves well and for only $27 after taxes, I feel it's a bargain.  The drawstring bottoms will be nice for active water diving or sports. It's great that the top isn't a halter top because when the halter always pulls and makes my neck hurt.  It looks exactly as the picture shows.  I would recommend it to others.<br />Oh, btw... I'm 5'2&#34;, a size 12 with 36DD top and ordered the smallest size available, an 0X.  It would definitely fit a taller girl, too, as the (not adjustable) shoulder straps are a bit loose on me."
5.0,They arrived promptly and are well-made. I know I'll wear them often. They look exactly as they do in the pictures.
5.0,"This is the great workout bra I’ve been looking for:  no padding, easy off and on, good coverage and  great price.  I hate sports bras that have to be pulled on and off over your head, this closure is secure and easy to use.  I also wanted something that I could take traveling, wash out in a sink and dry the next morning.  This fabrics is lightweight and quick drying .  It is also nice enough to wear as an everyday bra."
5.0,Love it just don't wash it with dark cloths or it stains
5.0,"Very good product, I loved it, I would not hesitate to recommend the purchase or store or buy it again in this way. Excellent."
5.0,Well made fast delivery
5.0,"they fit perfect on my 8 year old,,she loves them ,and have gotten lots of complements thinking of getting 1 more pair"

5.0,They’re great for work
5.0,"These are extreme flattering, not see through whatsoever, and they are of high quality material. They are now a staple in my wardrobe and I will definitely be getting more!!"
5.0,Bought these for a friends birthday gift. She absolutely loves them! States they hold up well and look just like her good girl.
5.0,Great quality material! Loved the fit and how the skirt portion was loose and flowy. The slight shimmer of the lace on top is a nice feature. A great dress you can dress up or dress down.
5.0,My wife loves it....very soft and comfortable.
5.0,Perfect A ++++
5.0,"I usually wear a size 12 or 14. I took a chance on the size 12 and they fit well. They are comfortable.<br /><br />These are a little short, but provide adequate coverage. I normally wouldn't buy ""distressed"" denim, but these are cute. The pockets make sure nothing important is exposed by the small tears. ;o)<br /><br />They came through the wash fine. Didn't shrink and the hem did not ravel more.<br /><br />Can't wait for warmer weather so I can wear them!"
5.0,"Gift for my wife, which she loved.  Well made piece."
5.0,My best friend since 1978 was touched by the f gift and still loves it
5.0,Excellent earrings and on time delivery.
5.0,I got these for my daughter who has started collecting bracelets.  She loves them.  Fits her wrist perfectly.  The colors are bright and beautiful.  She never takes them off and not one has broken.

5.0,"Love it the colors, the fabric overall I ❤️ It!"
5.0,I use it to play golf. Nothing to dislike. 👍⛳
5.0,I am in love with this pendant! The necklace clasp does pull my hair and irrates my neck but the pendant easily slides off so you can put it on other chains!
5.0,Purchased both colors and loved them.
5.0,"Just grand, these will be the perfect accessory for many occasions...can you say Thanksgiving and Christmas?"

5.0,Wonderful bag. VERY ATTRACTIVE and special. Also sturdy.
5.0,Love this shirt it fits my son perfectly and keeps him warm
5.0,Love this scrub cap. I bought it to brighten up my day when gowning up in PPE with covid patients. I have received so many compliments on it from hospital staff and coworkers. The sweat band at the front is very comfortable but I do have to fold the front under slightly so the front of the cap isn’t too far down over my eyebrows. I may just have a small head though!
5.0,"So cute, soft and warm. My kiddo was absolutely in love with it, and the price is good! Fits perfectly for a 5T or a bit bigger."

5.0,Shirt is great it's what I expected fantastic thanks alot.
5.0,"Have this bag in three colors (saddle-like, white, & metallic).  Love the leather, colors, style and size.  Also have the larger Lexy bag in black leather and suede.  Love all four!  Makes keeping contents organized and easily accessible a snap."
5.0,Very nice!  Love the colors and the design.  Thank you!  Happy to purchase this beautiful necklace.
5.0,"I got this for my sister. I was curious and tried it on and it fity big head pretty good! I was stunned really!  I have a pretty big head , 7 3/4 hat size . I may keep this and get her something else. I like the muffler , it has ear straps and snaps on to the ear flaps as well. The top of the hat is insulated with fleece. Very nice!"
5.0,"It is a very good bra, fits great. Running while wearing these is easy"

5.0,Beautiful earrings! I have sensitive ears and these don’t bother me at all. I always get compliments on them when I wear them!! Has a nice sparkle with the gems around the dream catcher.
5.0,This dress is so comfortable and perfect for those summer days.  You could practically wear it all day.  I wore this to my sons graduation party and it was perfect!
5.0,I bought this a bit large because I didn't want it to be too tight on my arms. It fit well and covered enough of my chest that I didn't feel too exposed. Cute and comfortable!
5.0,"Purchased for my wife, and she likes it. If she's happy, I'm happy."
5.0,I was unsure of the quality because of the low price but when it arrived I was extremely impressed. Beautiful!
5.0,"Beautiful sweater!! WOW! Very soft and luxurious feeling. Fits perfectly and the sleeves aren't too long. Nice cuffs on the sleeves. Beautiful openwork. Now I just need to find the perfect camisole to wear underneath. This is nice enough for a night out on the town, but comfortable enough for the Fall days coming up.  Perfect!"
5.0,Fit great true to size.  Good quality!
5.0,My son needed a Jeweler's Loupe for his college class to help identify plants and bugs/insects on them.  We weren't sure what we needed but this product fit the bill.  Works great and really helped with seeing what was needed.

5.0,Got lots of compliments on this! It's very comfy
5.0,Super awesome set for the price!
5.0,Very nice belt for casual pants or jeans. Good quality and well made
5.0,It’s so hard to find anything avenger related for little girls and once I saw this dress I got it immediately! We received so many compliments on this dress at Disneyland and she told me she loved it. I highly recommend this dress
5.0,I'm 5'4 195lbs bought xl fits nice and comfortable
5.0,"Light weight, perfect sizing chart.  Zippers are strong.  Slot of thought went into this product.  Vest has a removable backing that can be unzipped and rolled into secret compartment on hot days.  Can be left up for crisp days.  Stylish collar accent.  2 inside pockets, several outside pockets.  Cheap looking velcro pocket pieces, they will do the job, although thicker better placed velcro would look better. This vest would be a great gift for general fishing folks."
5.0,"Beautiful black leather wallet.  It was exactly what I was looking for: thin and carries all my cards/cash.  It won't perform the miracle of taking an inch thick wallet and reducing it down to nearly nothing, but it does carry quite a big and does so in as minimal a package possible and very stylishly.  Definitely recommend."
5.0,"Never had a pair of boots so confortable, from box to walking. I used them this week on a trip to Lake Placid, walked the trails, hiked Whiteface Mountain, walk the town, used them everyday. I am a solid size 7 and it was perfect fit even with thick socks. They have a little stretch but adjust to the form of your feet and the boot itself is very flexible, better than wearing sneakers. And they look fantastic with everything you wear. Will buy another pair."
5.0,"These are awesome! The fit is great, not thin material, holds you together nicely without looking like it and COMFY!!! What? Yes!! It’s true.  I bought more for myself and teenage daughter. She loves them too"
5.0,Great quality runs a little small but will even fit a big head like mine. Nice wool cap. Lot of compliments and where did I get it questions from other dashers
5.0,handsome ..luxury piece...great price
5.0,I would have preferred a smaller  version but beautiful. I intend gifting them!
5.0,Absolutely love this dress! The material feels great and flows with your body shape. I also like that it’s not too short either. Highly recommend this dress for any formal event or wedding guest.
5.0,Very soft and the color stays after washing. My son loves them!
5.0,"This shirt is a MUST HAVE in ALL 3 colours! Can wear year round too! Even though this has long sleeves, it is a cool, thin, flowy, super comfy material. I wore it Sunday, it reached over 90 where I live and the heat index was 100+...I was perfectly fine & looking stylish in the heat! LOL<br />I ordered the other two colours yesterday! Get them NOW! You need these."
5.0,I'm normally a medium but this fit perfect in a small. Not too tight but not baggy. Just right. Love the material as well. Would buy again!!
5.0,This bandana is brightly colored and exactly as shown. One Love. Stand Up.

5.0,Good compression and has pockets. The size small fits perfectly.
5.0,Wore to sisters birthday party and got a lot of compliments..Im  wearing a xlarge love it..fit just right .....
5.0,"I've struggled for years to find a pair of briefs that fits just the way I want! I don't want granny panties, but it seems like so many pairs I try are unflattering and cut into my body creating extra dents and lumps. Then when I order a size up, I feel like I'm wearing a diaper or have a saggy butt.<br />BUT FINALLY - THESE BRIEFS ARE GREAT. Soft, stretchy and they cover my booty and don't dig into my tummy. They stay in place and don't ride up. They're really cut exactly how I would want them to be. I'll be ordering more packs of these!"
5.0,"Extremely comfortable. I'm using it as shower shoes while I'm in the desert. Its good for walking over big rocks, but the front has a tendency to scoop sand up more than the $1 shower sandals that they sell at the BX. I'm still overall satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,"Color is still great months and months later, very strong, doesn't get caught in my hair!"
5.0,Great product. Had My daughters name embroidered on it & she loves it
5.0,It holds more than I thought
5.0,Me gustó mucho! Muy cómodo
5.0,"This eyeglass holder is a perfect solution for keeping both my regular and reading glasses safe and easily accessible! It is sturdy, and well-made. I recommend it highly!"
5.0,My 14yr old daughter HATES dresses. This was the only dress she found that she would wear/liked.<br /><br />It fits just right. And she looks beautiful in it.  Definitely recommend this dress. We bought it for her for her 8th grade graduation.
5.0,I love this dress.  It is something I can wear for any occasion!
5.0,The bag is not as bright as it looks in the picture . A good bag
5.0,Better than expected. I didn't know it had the original logo on the back. As an old school Metallica fan who had the original it was cool to see. Takes me back to the good old days. Buy it now you won't be disappointed.. oh it fits as expected
5.0,I got this watch to replace one i had similar. I was surprised on how light weight and tiny this watch is. I love it!!! Good price. All functions work great. Water resistant and easy to use! Great Buy!!!
5.0,So much better than I expected.  LOVE IT
5.0,"Its a very big pendant with an attraxtice sturdy chain. This will never break. Love it, great price"
5.0,Love this watch band very comfortable to ware and is washable.
5.0,Fit well and looks good
5.0,Does the job. Soft and breathable.
5.0,These socks fit super great!
5.0,cubs win
5.0,The watch is really classic. Elegant and a lot look more pricey than what I paid for.
5.0,These are awsome i got sooo many compliments on Halloween about these.
5.0,Very pretty and very warm.. would love to use it for going into stores as it’s gorgeous but it gets way to sweaty.. winters coming though
5.0,Fits true to size for me. Very cute and good quality.
5.0,The 2 pieces
5.0,I love the socks they would make a great gift they came individually package meaning I can give some as a gift and keep some for myself they’re so warm and great quality and love them so much I will definitely be buying more. Shipping was also very fast came right in time for Christmas gift!
5.0,Conjunto muy bueno a muy bajo precio
5.0,"Super cute, good quality outfit.  My little one is on the small side so the 12 month was a little big on her but not noticeably big.  There were snaps on the side of the neck hole but the tee shirt stretched well so I didn't need them.  The tutu was full and great quality, also has diaper cover inside.  The ribbon came a loose several times because it is a good thick ribbon that needed to be tied tightly.  The embroidery was perfect.  No complains and I highly recommend this outfit.  The headband has pearls and little jewels inside of the flowers that were gorgeous."
5.0,awesome shades had them for a year now!
5.0,It was a gift for my husband.  He loves it.  Lots of inserts for his cards and a separate place for his lincense.  Great wallet!
5.0,I think a large would look better for my body type 5' 4&#34; and 175 lbs but I plan to lose weight😒
5.0,"I love this shirt. When I first opened the package I thought it would be too short but once I put it on I realized that is not the case! It fit wonderfully.<br />It is so soft, like that worn in feel. It is lightweight so it is breathable which helps when keeping up with little ones. I would totally recommend this shirt!"
5.0,"Usually it is hard to get a denim dress for such a low price.  But here you have it, a denim dress that is really very reasonably priced.  The sweet part is that it comes with a belt too which is a plus.<br /><br />The length of the dress is appropriate as well.  Short denim dress always look very good.  The denim quality is soft and the color is nice too. It is hundred percent cotton so that is a nice touch as well.  Cotton is really the most comfortable and natural fabric to wear.  And it biodegradable too which is good for the environment.<br /><br />The fit is sligtly loose but with the belt, you can create a better fit so again not a big issue in any way.<br /><br />The dress is good for casual and semi-formal occasion and will look nice with  some jewelry.  The sleeves are puffy and they really make the dress look a lot better and attractive.<br /><br />Overall, very good price on the dress and good quality too, love it!"
5.0,I LOVE the elephant charms! It's exactly exactly what I was looking for! I added the elephant charms to my  necklace and bracelet.
5.0,This was the perfect piece for my son's baseball themed room. He loves it!!! Very nicely made!
5.0,My daughter loves it. Runs a little big
5.0,"Wore this out for date night, and got tons of compliments.  I love the fit, fabric, and style of this top.  Such a classic and classy look."
5.0,My son is very pleased
5.0,"The wings are so cool! My son got lots of compliments on these and many have asked, &#34;where did you get them?&#34;<br />At the mall they cost $80+!  So glad we found them on Amazon!😁"
5.0,So many compliments!<br />My 2 year old calls them sparkle boots and she loves wearing them!
5.0,Bellos para mi princesa
5.0,"So soft!! Absolutely love, thinking of purchasing another one! Was so comfy to wear and worked perfect for my leggins and big sweater look!! I purchased an Xl so it would be big!"
5.0,These gems allow your crop to be the best and most stylish. These easily slip onto the croc and they stay in place. They don't bother my feet while walking which surprised me. They can easily change out so you can wear the jewlery that goes best with what you have on for the day. A must have if you have crocs
5.0,"Lots of variety, and all very beautiful. I'm going to have so much fun with them, I can hardly wait to get them out and start creating."
5.0,so cute!
5.0,Great frames
5.0,The receiver loves them. Good tailoring and well fitted.
5.0,Perfect for Disney visit and Halloween
5.0,Fits perfectly and feels great!
5.0,"Love the length on this vest. Goes down almost to low hip  length, which makes it that much warmer!"
5.0,"Overall, I am happy with the purchase. The bag is slightly larger than I expected, but not too large. Mine doesn't have the bad smell that other reviewers talked about. I also read a review that said the &#34;leather&#34; looked like a wrinkled plastic - you can tell it's not real leather, but it's still attractive and doesn't look cheaply made. I haven't used the shoulder strap because the attached handles are long enough that you can put it on your shoulder."
5.0,My job 50th anniversary party
5.0,Muy buen artìculo!
5.0,Be careful when screwing these on. The backs are flat and easy to lose grip on.
5.0,Very nice chain.  Looks very rich.
5.0,My daughter loves this shirt.  Fast shipment and fit as expected.
5.0,Great product. Someone said size up since it shrinks but I have not experienced that yet and I have washed it a couple of times. Cant wait for the summer.
5.0,Great product. Drastic difference in the look of your shirts.
5.0,Works as described . Grand daughter loves it.
5.0,I love these earrings and I always get compliments on them!
5.0,"Good tongue for staying put, and high arches."
5.0,Good quality in this price range
5.0,"Fits as expected. Not see through AT ALL! So comfy. Also, what was important for me was that the waistband didn't cinch too much! Definitely will buy again"
5.0,"A little small, but I love it."
5.0,"Lovely little ring.  Though adjustable, it's on the small side.  I'd say it maxes out around a size 8 with a tiny bit of overlap on the back so it doesn't pinch.  I wear it stacked with other rings and it does fine.."
5.0,Nice and comfortable.<br />Just as expected 👍🏼
5.0,Exceeded expectations! Soft flowing fits great! I had bought to use as a costume but wearing it for every day too!
5.0,Fabulous Bag!!
5.0,Fit my 18 month old perfectly.
5.0,Well I purchased you for my brother and he seems very happy and satisfied will probably purchase again
5.0,"Well made.  Fits my 5-year old, and would fit a man with a normal neck (mine is 19”, so I didn’t bother trying).  Everyone who saw it thought it was great."
5.0,"They are the exact color, so comfortable, I love the high waist and they definitely run true to size. They are definitely worth a buy."
5.0,"I love this top. I have several. The bra top is beautifully made and feels soft against the skin. Recover Design bra tops have solved a major wardrobe problem for me - adding just the right amount of coverage under tops and shirts with plunging necklines. They also look great under tops with wide ballet necklines - the kind that barely hit the shoulder top. The Recover Design bra top straps and neckline peek out just the right amount. The look of Recover Design bra tops under clothing is both pretty and elegant. I've tried many other brands of bra tops, and only those by Recover Design have the right look as layering pieces. The company is also fabulous to work with. I had to do just one exchange, and the owner of the company contacted me directly to take care of it. All of this makes me feel very loyal to this company and its product."
5.0,Got this pair for my wife in Valentine’s Day. She loved them.
5.0,Exactly as advertsed
5.0,Love this.  It arrived early and I immediately put it to work.  Protects my keyless entry remote and looks great.
5.0,"This thing is awesome. It's heavy, and good sized. Granted the finish wore off in places after I've been wearing it nonstop for 2+ years, but still. The cord snapped almost immediately because of my activities, but i just put it on a normal string and it only fell off the the jump ring came unbent after 2 years. So new string and all was well. I love this, and almost cried when I thought I lost it a few times because of how attached I've grown to it. I would recommend this to any supernatural fan out there."
5.0,Son loves fabric and fit.
5.0,loved it we had it for quite awhile until it broke at school one day.
5.0,"I really like this new sleek design of the clasp, lays flat and is comfortable"
5.0,Comfortable and keeps the time correctly
5.0,"My son LOVES his new soft, fuzzy warm jacket! So... I Do too! The zipper is sturdy, it slids smoothly; and the fit is most becoming! Great buy! Five stars! ☆☆☆☆☆"
5.0,Tools make it easy to adjust
5.0,Bought again cause the last one is starting to wear out after 2 years of heavy use
5.0,"Perfect for a 10 year old cutie pie that just wants some long socks to wear under his boots, but is also adorable and silly. Not too big for a small kid. We tried many, kept finding ones that are too big and finally landed on these"
5.0,Perfecto 👌
5.0,Perfect for a little dancer
5.0,Nice color and nice fit.  Good bargain
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted, big enough for all my stuff without being too bulky, small inside pocket, only complaint is that the rainbow is missing the color purple XD"
5.0,"Love this item, it fits true to size and I would recommend this product.  I would also order again."
5.0,I am usually a 14/16 US. I got a 2XL and it's a perfect fit. Well made. Good material. Perfect for work or a nice outing!
5.0,Fit as I hoped and super comfy !
5.0,"Beautiful colors, soft, nice fit"
5.0,"This scarf is surprisingly high quality for the price. It is huge, soft, and incredibly warm. Looks exactly like the picture."

5.0,Love the fabric and fit
5.0,Nothing great buy
5.0,Perfecto y los colores muy lindos
5.0,"they are great for my not quite two year old grand daughter, we have hard woods and she can walk around with out sliding. They are warm and soft as well. I want 6 pairs for myself. I will be buying these as she grows."
5.0,"Very well made and so beautiful!  It holds my phone, compact, lipstick, ID & money with no problem.  I received tons of compliments!  Love that the strap can be easily hidden inside the purse.  LOVE IT!"
5.0,"Beautiful bracelet, the beads are so beautiful!  It is better than in the picture for sure! The shine and color are just top grade A++++"
5.0,"It looked just as I thought it would, and looks great in the velvet bag too. :)"
5.0,I love these shoes!!!
5.0,Looks exactly  like the picture and amazing gift for my friend
5.0,My granddaughter got lots of compliments how pretty her dress is.  It fit her perfect and she love the material
5.0,Fits 2 umbrella and helps organize my coat rack. I can also just take it when I need to step our and makes it easier to carry the umbrellas or even a water bottle.<br /><br />Great material!
5.0,These bands keep my apple watch in place. Can be loosened or tightened to different wrist sizes. Me and my daughter can share them.
5.0,Really nice color!
5.0,I like these wool caps.....
5.0,"I bought a medium and it fit perfectly. Straps are adjustable. It’s not to loose or too tight. Great length for me, just above the knee. I am 5’1."
5.0,"Very pretty. The charms are small, but you can still tell what they are, and the necklace looks very dainty and nice. Its not quite a choker, just about collarbone length. It’s a girly, subtle way to show your Star Wars fandom!"
5.0,"I loved this! It fit as expected, arrived as expected and met all my expectations. Will order again and different colors next time!"
5.0,These sunglasses are solid. I was surprised with how well they were made. They have spring hinges. They are a bit tight but flex enough for my big head. If you have an abnormally large head they may not fit you well.
5.0,Love!!
5.0,"I have been looking for fit over sun glasses for a year that would be comfortable. I have bought 3 pair that ended up in the trash. These are the most comfortable sun glasses. They are very light weight. And the lens are very clear. When I got these, I went right back and purchased the black pair."
5.0,"They are warm, comfortable and stylish."
5.0,"Good quality, very nice fit."
5.0,I ended up going with a different choice so I wouldn’t have to tape my boobs. I taped them to try on but it was uncomfortable only because I probably taped them wrong lol since I’ve never used tape before
5.0,Great value for the price - used this as my carry-on/purse/beach bag on my vacation to Fiji. Looked just as nice as a lot of the designer bags people had.
5.0,"this is such a comfortable nice fitting dress, the fabric feels amazing and comes in other colors.  it is the perfect go to dress."
5.0,"Just received them, little bigger than I thought but OK. Quality seems good, but I will update if they flop. Overall happy."
5.0,"After purchasing my first sweatshirt i just has to have another! My sister say mine on me and i ended up,having to ut also purchase one for her also. We are larger ladies and ordered 3x. I am 5ft8in and weigh 195lbs if that helps!  great sweatshirt not overly heavy but not thin either!"
5.0,Daughter loves wearing it
5.0,My favorite hat now.
5.0,Great value. Extremely well made.<br />Looks good on my face
5.0,I love this band. I wanted a “loop” band and bought a couple silicone ones but I wanted to try something different because of my job I wash my hands a lot and also sweat a lot. With the silicone bands it always felt wet under the band. This thing fits nice and is comfortable. It also doesn’t trap sweat underneath. Breathable and comfortable. I was worried about it loosening during the day but it doesn’t. I really like it.
5.0,The belt is of a decent quality and construction. It has 'Buchanan' engraved/printed on the end - this isnt evident in the description. The belt will not beep in a TSA metal detector - How cool is that!!!
5.0,"nice ball cap, fits well and good, made of good material."
5.0,Genuine replacement watchband.
5.0,Nice shirt. My 9 year will like it and I will like the fact he will be easier to see. Good bright orange.
5.0,just perfect and the material is very nice. Turn around time is good
5.0,For my daughter; they look great
5.0,Love the Tee
5.0,These underwear fit great and are so comfortable to move around in.
5.0,Belt is super cute and fashionable. Ties in the front making it easily adjustable for many sizes. Perfect accent for my dress!
5.0,These sunglasses are amazing I’m in love with them! They are super cute and I bring them everywhere with me ...they remind me a little bit of the raybans sunglasses that have a similar style to this
5.0,For the price and quality it’s a decent boot. Fits well and looks good in jeans.
5.0,Amazing seller AAA+++. All perfect.
5.0,"Nice Wallet, fits my cards and nice feel to it.  Would buy again!"
5.0,I've had this exact same watch for well over 15 years.  It's absolutely perfect for work purposes.
5.0,"Very nice shoes. I am interested in another pair as well for the color... I would like the orange colored bottom ones as well lol but, I also wish they were slip on instead of lace up. As a note, I had visited a Sperry store locally but one of the sales people kept nagging me so I left. I found the same pair here for a few dollars less and free shipping. Lesson? Let customers shop, that store lost a sale due to three different employees and one of them three times, asking over and over if they could help. After the first &#34;No thank you&#34;, I should be able to shop freely."
5.0,"Very nice cap, to bad it's made in China but I couldn't find one made in the US of A!<br />Pretty sad when we cannot even have a cap made in our own country especially considering what the logo is on this cap!"
5.0,"Kush sunglasses are the best sunglasses I’ve bought over the last few years! Great colors, perfect design & shape, great price point, just the perfect sunglasses. I’ve lost count of the amount of pairs I own/owned, I really like em!  These all black ones are my new favorite besides the all blue ones!"
5.0,used for replacement
5.0,Works well. Quick ship
5.0,Perfect place and replacement band for my watch.
5.0,Warm hat. Doesn’t make your head itch either. Warmer the the smartwool 250. Also somewhat water resistant.
5.0,Excellent! Daughter loved it. It is too big for her (which we knew it would be) but we wanted her to have room to grow.
5.0,"Love this dress! I'm 6'4&#34; so it was short on me, everything is, but I wore it to a work party with black tights. I was the talk of the party! It was fun and I felt sassy in it! Can't wait to wear it again next year!"
5.0,Good quality and the shirt is true to the image in the photo
5.0,"Leggings are comfortable, easy to dress up or dress down. Nirlon is the only brand I order from for leggings. I've had a pair for almost a year and I wear them regularly. And dry on low heat. They still are in great shape. A little faded but no holes. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"It's pretty clear the cost is almost solely for the pendant--which is a definite plus! The pendant has a nice weight and sits quite neatly once on. The only thing I found I didn't care for was the chain it came on; it feels like insulation rubber and was quite crumpled when it came. It wasn't exactly an easy fix--I either had to manipulate the loop the pendant sat on, or cut off the end of the chain--but the extra struggle wasn't insurmountable, and made me love this necklace even more!<br />I originally planned for this to be for a Bellatrix Lestrange cosplay, but it's probably going to become a staple in my wardrobe!"
5.0,Perfect for my needs!
5.0,Kid loves for his jujitsu
5.0,[[VIDEOID:c5d372ea59a70249c7f96b7ebf7cf2ea]] This dress is even more beautiful in person. I bought for my daughter ‘s 5 th birthday. She looked like a princess and she loved it!
5.0,These are great arm covers. I use them to protect my arms from skin years and/or bruising.
5.0,"Just as described . Good quality , you could dress it  up or down."
5.0,I got this as a present for my boyfriend since I am forcing him to go to a black tie wedding and buy a suit. He loves these. They are so fun
5.0,"Needed a clear bag for a music festival, and for the price, chose to go with this clear cross-body! Great value and was spacious enough to hold everything I needed (glasses, wallet, keys, and even a water bottle). Was comfortable around my shoulder and sturdy. Definitely going to continue using this bag for game day and events when needed."
5.0,"I love it...bra size 42 G, so doesn't close but rest on collar bone region nicely. Glad I bought a size 3xl. Even bought  army green and red."
5.0,Very nice product. Quality made. There is a lot of knock off products on the market that are poor quality. This is not a knock off! Happy with the purchase
5.0,Love my sunglasses
5.0,"Worked great for blocking out the sun when driving! Simple clip on to your glasses, and that's that."
5.0,"soft, breathable, great for all year around.<br />one of the best materials to feel on skin"
5.0,Loved the color
5.0,Great dress fits well!!
5.0,This is a very attractive hoodie
5.0,"Cute, don’t really need to iron it"
5.0,Very nice. Good fit. Newphee loves it.
5.0,Very comfortable. Love it.
5.0,Súper<br />Cómodo y te mantiene caliente 👍🏼
5.0,"Its a great hat.  Don't be fooled by the price, t fits better and is more comfortable than the more expensive similar style hats.  Looks on my head the same way it did in the picture"
5.0,My mother love it.
5.0,"Solmate mismatched socks are my favorite footwear -- I have 5 or 6 pairs of my own and this year, I gave at least a dozen pairs as gifts. Five of the gifts were to people who were recovering from accidents, surgery, or illnesses. Some were for birthdays, or to say &#34;thank you.&#34; All of the recipients were grateful for the socks' warm, cozy comfort and the fun, bright colors."
5.0,"With the pandemic, there is need to wear a mask when social distancing is not possible running on trails. That means frequently putting on and taking off a mask when passing people outdoors. I got the idea to hang my mask like glasses and specifically looked for ones I thought I could attach to a mask. With the stretchy loops on the end of these ones, they worked great for attaching my mask. Now I can bring my mask with me running and only put it on when social distance isn’t possible outdoors. I gave them away to family members too. We all love them!"
5.0,"I have been looking for so long for footies that come up over my wide foot. I am a 9-1/2 wide foot.  All I can ever find are ones that barely cover the tips of my toes and fall off the heel. These are wonderful. They cover  and do not slide off. The design is sleek and fits well. They are sheer, and do not bunch up. I have so many other brands that i now will get rid of! This is now my go to brand. Love them"
5.0,Really soft material and just heavy enough for cooler weather.
5.0,The material is very stretchy and I bought the XXL and after wearing it for a few hours it began to drag and it seemed larger on me than usual. Try going for a size smaller.
5.0,My son asked for this ring for Christmas and it was so much easier to order from amazon then the companies website.  I even got a better deal.  Ring seems very durable and its just what my son wanted.
5.0,Fit pretty good under my ski helmet and works good to keep out the cold
5.0,I think it's just beautiful
5.0,Great fit. Wash well
5.0,They work great & I like the design. Great company to buy from can't wait to order another pair!
5.0,Very good quality for the $.
5.0,"This dress fit my body perfectly. The material is lightweight and hugs my curves just right. Arrived sooner than expected. Packaging was intact. I had to get it altered but I expected that being 5'0"""
5.0,"Top quality timepiece, especially for the price.  Looks great, too."
5.0,Great lounger
5.0,"I normally wear a size medium but based on reviews ordered a small. Im 5’7 and it falls right at my feet. I love the orange red color and the dress fits as expected. The fabric is light weight which means it’s cool, but it is also a tiny bit see through. I haven’t washed it yet so I can’t speak on how it’ll hold up but so far I’m satisfied with my purchase."
5.0,"Comfortable material, flattering for plus-sized people."
5.0,great choicce
5.0,Arrived fast. They are EXTREMELY oversized (which is stated)
5.0,"This oversized sweatshirt dress is too cute for words, especially in the patterned fabric. I am 5'3, 108 lbs, and it fits loose and large on me, but it is exactly the style I was looking for. It doesn't look huge when I roll the sleeves up and wear it with black tights and short boots. is well-made--the seams are serged nicely, and the fabric is heavy enough to see me through very cold winter days when the dress is layered over a tee or turtleneck. I washed it as soon as I got it to get rid of the slight fabric finishing odor and to soften it. Since it is already big on me, I didn't worry about tossing it into the dryer and I think it didn't shrink enough to be noticed. It fits me like I it does on the model, and the side pockets are a plus."
5.0,"Made of a thinner fabric great for warmer days, very soft inside and fit nicely."
5.0,Great product and people have commented on it ever since I got it.
5.0,Great quality and fit true to size!
5.0,pants fit perfectly are quality made an excellent product
5.0,"Beautiful, got it for gifts and they love it"
5.0,"Exactly as listed, good quality for price"
5.0,"Seriously, put this in your cart right away or keep it on your wish list!<br />I've had this dress for about 8 months now and I completely LOVE it! I'm most likely to purchase the same dress just different patterns/print. I'm a 5'2"" lady with a bit of weight, however, this dress compliments me in all the best ways.<br />The fabric is soft and very comfortable in the winter and summer months (in the Midwest). Easy to clean in the washer and I personally hang dry the dress. The pockets are reasonably deep and can hardly tell when you have stuff in them, which is great because then you don't look bulky. In my photos I actually have a set of keys in each pocket. The dress is perfect to dress up or dress down in, it really fits a lot of different occasions.<br />This dress is just completely worth the purchase! I wish I could give it more stars! Hopefully, whoever reads this review you get to enjoy the dress as much as I did and enjoy the world of pockets. Good luck dress hunting!"
5.0,"Fits great, awesome product. Will buy it again"
5.0,I am usually a M/L though based on the reviews I decided to order an XL and it fits great!<br />Love this bikini!
5.0,These bracelets are wonderful these are gifts. I give you five Christmas star thank you so much.  Mrs. Clause Please stop sending coupons you do not honor
5.0,Great hat for Mets and baseball fans. Fits all heads.
5.0,Fits perfectly and stays put!! Also has great coverage despite the light color. I removed the padding but the nice texture still covers up nips. Loved it and bought other colors!
5.0,Love this bag. So roomy yet super light and the size looks right on me. I am 5 foot 3. The only suggestion for improvement I have is to do something about the two pockets on the side. The openings of these pockets are so small that make them not usable at all.
5.0,Looks great. Super gift for Son in Law. Have not seen worn because of distance.
5.0,"Very comfortable, perfect for!"
5.0,"It runs large but it comfortable, so I will keep it"
5.0,Even better looking then the picture. Fits perfectly on my wrist not to big or too small. Would buy it again.
5.0,"True color, better quality than expected. Exactly what I wanted, matching entire ensemble—including hat—for local Derby Day event."
5.0,As pretty as the earrings look; they are even more beautiful on my ears where they belong!😊<br /><br />Will post picture in 2 days from 6/4/20. 🥰
5.0,"Great beanie , very comfortable and representing a great school in the Ragin Cajuns of Lafayette  Louisiana.<br />Geaux Cajuns!"
5.0,"An adorable rose gold girls ankle bootie.  They look flashy and stylish and will delight your little girl! Sure the shiny, glittery finish will wear off in spots, but for the price you can’t expect it to last forever.  Overall the boot is pretty durable.  Kids are rough on shoes!"
5.0,"It is very nice, much larger than thought."
5.0,Such a cute dress! Fits TTS.
5.0,This is my second set of these and they are great.  They are comfortable and hold up to washing.
5.0,"I have fairly large hands but thin wrists (yeah, well, not particularly flattering, but there's nothing I can do about that!) So these fit great. I think for Indian bangles, these are just about the largest size you can buy, right?  There's no way I'd be able to get them on all at once, but one at a time is do-able.  They really are pretty, and are nicely finished (they're not rough looking).  The thicker ones are sturdy, but the really thin ones (the size of the red ones, with chips cut out), they will bend if you put pressure on them.  I like them so much, will only wear them occasionally, and adore the fact you can mix and match 'em!"
5.0,looks real and very pretty
5.0,Looks exactly like the picture. I get so many complements on this suit.
5.0,Fit great! Made great for the price! My daughters feet aren’t wide at all so they are a bit wider than I expected.... but the bow on the top of her foot makes that not an issue! You can’t even tell!<br />Pretty shoes
5.0,My new best hat
5.0,This was a gift for my daughter to add to the Fitbit Alta I gave her. She absolutely loves it. They come a variety of colors to mix and match and she enjoys matching them to her outfit of the day. The Fitbit Alta has been a benefit to her weight loss journey and the additional colors makes it just a bit  more fun to coordinate the Tracker to suit the outfit or mood of the day. These are very easy to change and they fit as good as the original band. I would recommend this product.
5.0,So much awesomeness made packing a beeze!
5.0,The wife loved it. I didn't know this until after I bought it but apoerently women are super picky about purses so I was especially pleased to find out she liked it so much.
5.0,Got these for my wife. She says they fit slightly large but not enough to worry about changing your expected size. They are comfortable and she says she likes the drawstring a lot.
5.0,"I love this keychain although I did use it as a charm for my custom Apple Watch Charm Bands. The sizing is pretty big, similar to the sizing of a half dollar coin. The material is stainless steel so it won’t tarnish or turn colors. It also has some weight and thickness to it, it’s not very lightweight which will speak to its durability. The writing on the keychain is clear and readable. My clients loved it! Used for a 12yr birthday and 12yr anniversary charm"
5.0,Good as described. I bought this for my mom and she loves it! It feels very soft and comfortable. The overall quality is beyond my expectation for this price.
5.0,Bought as a gift for my mom. She loves it and keeps it warm!
5.0,"I got this for one specific event, my friends wedding. The outfit she wants me to wear does not have any pockets and I have to have my phone. The clear window allows me to use the phone without taking it out and there is a divider inside so I can put my ID and a credit card to carry around that day. Perfect for what I need!"
5.0,"Protects me from the sun and protects people from seeing my face so i dont have to talk to people i run into out in public, big bonus"
5.0,"This is a nice outfit to wear casually.  The product fits well. It is a spandex type material and not cotton.  I am 5’3, 165 and it fits me perfectly.  The shorts stop right above my knees and the shirt fits just right. I do wash and hang to dry simply because I don’t trust it in the dryer."
5.0,"I really love this watch. It has a nice weight to it, the detail in the dial looks fantastic, and it is a great price. I also am grateful for such an awesome experience with the customer service. Initially, the watch band had a minor defect in the pin in the clasp and within hours of messaging the seller about it, they had a complete new watch band in the mail. I will absolutely be seeking this seller out again for future watch purchases because of this experience."
5.0,Great goggles for the kids for the pool
5.0,Very pleased with the product. I purchased as gift for my Mother and it was damaged on the seam when she opened it. We were able to get return and replaced for her and she loves it.
5.0,This is a thick shirt/ jacket. Soft in the outside but a bit itchy on the inside. I wear a long sleeve shirt underneath so it’s not an issue. Well constructed.
5.0,I love it so much! no smell at all and perfect for college. Its very roomy and fits my texts books and college materials.
5.0,Great dress true to size and length
5.0,I’m a nurse and love these compression socks! Great support!
5.0,"We bought this as a christmas gift and had it shipped directly to him.  He absolutely loved the hoodie and it fit great, we bought one size up because hoodies should be bigger and comfy.  His mom checked it over and found no defects with the hoodie  like others reported.  She did comment that the hoodie wasn't as thick as some other hoodies, but I think the cost reflects that.  My Ecko hoodie that I love cost me 65 dollars and it is so thick and warm and has lasted many years.  This was a lot cheaper as we paid 24.99."
5.0,"so cute, really enjoy this dress"
5.0,Great keychain with very functional components. I haven’t added kerosine to see how well the “match” works. But keychain seems well made. Heavy and sturdy.
5.0,"I love these! There's little threads hanging from it, but they don't fall apart. Got lots of compliments and they fit my hands (I wear medium sized hospital gloves) perfectly. They stay on easily and totally completed my outfit."
5.0,Very stylish jeans I bought them for my teen son who has really big heels he actually was able to get them through the skinny jeans but turns out he doesn't like skinny jeans so I returned them and was refunded with an Amazon gift card all is well
5.0,"Very comfy, fits perfectly"
5.0,"I really liked this hat, bought it for a trip to Mexico and it worked out great. I went in the pool and the ocean, cleans up nicely!"
5.0,"Exactly what I needed for everyday use,  I lose rings a lot, and like a casual wedding band for running errands, I find icomfortable.  I have no complaints with Amazon or company in how quickly they fixed my problem"
5.0,"I LOVE this style of dress especially with the halter top!  Although, I am returning the Pink/yellow because it is too light of a color for me, I purchased the mint green color from Floerns brand already and choosing between two other colors as well!  The dress fits perfect, the material is soft and stretchy enough to move around comfortably.  I purchased size Med and for reference I am 5’4, 125 lbs 34’27’34.  I really recommend this dress and do not say that lightly."
5.0,Got it for my bf and he looks so sexy in it!
5.0,Wear it every day. It's very comfortable even in tennis shoes.
5.0,"super cute, i love it"
5.0,Better quality than expected. Nice case included
5.0,"I purchased the 24mm version to replace the leather band on a Suunto Essential. It fits perfectly and seems to be well made. The relief in the design is a bit more pronounced than what can be seen in the pictures. This band is fairly thick too, probably about 3/16&quot; where the pins go through, tapering to approximately 1/8&quot; at the opposite ends.<br /><br />I ordered the black version and it has a nice matte finish. My only complaint is that it has a chrome finished (appears to actually be polished stainless steel) buckle and I would prefer black, but I knew that when I purchased the band."
5.0,This is a beautiful bracelet. I wore it for my son’s wedding and can’t wait to wear it again. Nice quality.
5.0,Totally beautiful bracelet
5.0,Well I ordered the extra large according to the measurement charts. They were huge. Had to send it back for a large. Love the fabrics and the way it falls on me.
5.0,"Breathable, lightweight tanks with a variety of colors. I wear a medium on a cut and large on a bulk with regular shirts. With these tanks it’s a size down I wear the small tanks when cutting and Mediums on the bulk. Loose at the waist and goes to far down my belt line but I just tuck the rest in."
5.0,This was a big hit with both myself and my daughter. It had a lot of wrinkles but a little steam knocked them right out.
5.0,Great product at a great price
5.0,I received this hat really fast. It's perfect for what I need. Thanks!
5.0,"Nice fabric, fits very well, I was hesitant about the Large / X Large I often battle with, but the XL was the one.  Very Modern and makes a cool statement. Informal but sophisticated."
5.0,Great option for resale!
5.0,I purchased this as a gift for my mother and she loves it so it gets five stars. She even asked where i got it and if they had more similar pieces for necklaces and charms.
5.0,Le encantó a mi sobrina
5.0,The zippers slide easily and the size is perfect.
5.0,"I love it, it's comfortable"
5.0,"One of the clothing purchases I've made from Amazon. True to size, very soft, color true to picture. Flattering and not too long. 5ft4 135 lbs 36D, got large for a loose fit."
5.0,I only just got it an wore it to the gym but it’s super comfortable material. I’m 5’10” 155lb and my chest is not that big but it was really snug I almost want to say tight and much looser on my waist area. My waist is about 28” and I got a large. (Waist being the smallest around my torso) It fit snug on my hips though that is more like 30”. I love it though I might try a size bigger to see if I like it a bit looser on my chest.
5.0,"I love this bag.  Everything was as expected (right color, size, quality).  I can hardly wait to use it."
5.0,"Cute, easy open."
5.0,Awesome T shirt of OG Harley Quinn!<br />The graphic is great & is purposely screen printed to look a bit distressed but not overly distressed. The layout for the artwork is simple but eye catching as it features a large image of Harley & her name on it so it stands out. I love this shirt & easily is my favorite amongst my other HQ tees!<br />I would definitely pick up this shirt again & I recommend getting this is you're a fan of The TRUE ORIGINAL HARLEY & you prefer CLASSIC HARLEY as opposed to the New 52 GARBAGE VERSION of her.<br />Thanks to the seller for such a great shirt!
5.0,I love these bracelets me and my best friend have been enjoying them
5.0,This coat was a little snug. Usually medium tends to be a little loose fitting but this was not the case with this coat.  This coat is extremely warm I've worn it with just a long sleeve tee in 20 degree temperature and did not feel the cold at all.  I am very sensitive to cold temperatures and haven't wanted to use any of my other coats this winter because of the warmth this coat affords me. It is very well made and completely insulated.  The pockets are lined with a soft fleece that keep your hands warm even if you are not wearing gloves.
5.0,My wife loves this. It is her go-to loungewear in our hot climate.
5.0,"Soft scarf, nice print; is as described.  Will do business with seller again."
5.0,Excellent product. Beautiful and good quality
5.0,"If you have someone that loves Westies, they will love this. It is great quality with a thick outer fabric.  It is also larger than it appears in the pictures. I took pictures with a soda can for perspective. Great makeup or other all purpose bag."
5.0,"I have several of these bras. I like them a lot. I have very small breasts. These bras fit me better than any other bra I've ever had. They are comfortable, provide good support and make my breasts look larger. They wash and dry well.  I recommend these bras."
5.0,You can dress this up or down--really like shirt!<br />My husband likes it too! Wore out on a date with skinny pants and wedges and dressed up with jewelry! Hides all my flaws while still looking flattering! Would buy more in different colors!
5.0,"My first watch was a little blue and green affair that looked like a lily, and when you pressed a button, the lily flipped up and a little frog sprang out on a spring. Then aged 11, I got a Casio F91W and have never looked back. The strap breaks for me, on average, every three years (I wear it tight and the plastic strap gets bent 180 degrees regularly), but besides that I've never had a problem.<br /><br />I thought briefly this year about getting a smart watch, but the fact is, you simply don't need a watch to do anything else than the Casio does. It tells you the time, lets you time things, and sets alarm to remind you of the time. It has one brief, and it sticks to it. And it does it forever, without complaints, without worries about it being stolen, and without ever running out of battery. I keep all my old watches, so my room is like a graveyard of Casio F91Ws, and not *one* of them has run out of battery - the only reason I'm having to get another one is because it's so cheap, it's easier to buy one than have it repaired. More money for Casio, I figure.<br /><br />If you want to carry around a piece of expensive digital technology with the time on it that will regularly fail on you because you haven't charged it in 12 hours, get an iPhone. If you want a watch that tells you the time, there's an entire community of Casio buddies all over the world waiting to notice your watch and ""Hey, you've got the Casio too! Aren't they cool?!"" - and then say nothing else because the Casio is so Spartan, so obvious, so reliable in its simplicity the only real question you ask is ""Do you have the backlight?""<br /><br />Long live the Casio F91W!"
5.0,Some reviews said they are too small.  For me they are perfect and just what I was looking for.  They are lovely and sparkly and match my ruby & diamond bracelet that my husband gave me for Christmas.
5.0,"Fantastic leggings, same quality as some &#34;other&#34; leggings that have a much higher price tag.  Not see-through at all.  They are a tiny bit large in the butt area, but as a petite person (only 5'3&#34;) and someone with hardly any &#34;junk in the trunk&#34;, they would probably fit someone with normal proportions very well, and it's hardly noticeable anyhow.  Also, FYI, the waistband on these are also the normal elastic waistband.  I will definitely be buying more of these though - great quality and I love the variety of solid colors to choose from!"
5.0,Fit perfectly! I’m a size US 4. Very cute. Highly recommend.
5.0,Very happy I purchased these masks. I get a lot of compliments.
5.0,I have had so many wonderful complements on these earrings...I love them..Thank you
5.0,My niece love this as her graduation gift.
5.0,It was exactly what I wanted.  I am a woman 5'4&#34; 150 lbs and I ordered a medium.  It is a little big on me which is what I wanted.  Not too heavy for california winters.
5.0,"This is a crazy good value. Feather light, well constructed, plenty of pockets. People pay more for a cross body strap. You can't go wrong."
5.0,"Beautiful,just love it"
5.0,Love them<br />Comfortable<br />Soft<br />Breathable<br />Much better than paper face diapers for covid
5.0,"I love the look and feel of this watch.  However, I am returning it as the second hand only works when the watch is placed flat on a table.  When you put it on, the second hand points to the six and doesn't move.  Otherwise, no complaints."
5.0,"Great material. Very comfortable, light weight. Want to buy one in every color."
5.0,I ordered L just to be safe and I’m glad I did. It fits perfectly. Fabric is soft and feels good to the skin.

5.0,"bought this dress at Costco, loved it so Much went searching for it and found it on Amazon. It’s soft and perfect, I have washed and worn it several times and it holds up."
5.0,"Love these, they go with everything.  Because they are a continuous loop, they can easily go on/off and fit anyone."
5.0,"Absolutely love this jacket. I had a north face jacket very similar to this and I honestly like the quality of this jacket more. There is a chest pocket and inner pocket. Perfect to store a cell phone or in my case,  dog treats lol. Jacket keeps me warm and is light weight. I would say this jacket is true to size. I was going to order a size up but I didn’t. I have a larger chest and the L fit perfect."
5.0,Got what I expected. Attractive and comfortable and fit perfectly. Normal shoe size 8.
5.0,Well-made and super cute for your little one. Also bought a beanie/mittens set I thought matched well.
5.0,I love it. I bought a medium but had to exchange it to a Large too tight on the breast area.

5.0,"Awesome yogas! Thicker than i thought, with the perfect amount of compression. You cant see cellulite through them, or undies when bending or squatting.  True to size!"
5.0,These made go gifts for my co-workers.
5.0,I accidentally ordered this dress size 18-24 months and my baby is 5 months. I put her in it for this review just to show what it looks like. The material and quality is great and I am excited to have her wear it out when it fits. I like the denim top look and the skirt with stars is so cute. This would be great for an occasion like Memorial Day or a holiday like 4th of July because of the stars. The little hole in the back is a cute touch too.
5.0,Great way to keep my most often used keys organized.
5.0,Awesome bag and is my go to bag to bring to my daughters swim meets....don't have to worry about it getting wet!  Love the green color as well
5.0,Best socks I've ever purchased. Perfect for my needs. Doesn't get smelly and keeps my feet dry.
5.0,it is very cute and just what I expected the picture doesnt really do it justice.
5.0,"This is a lovely pendant. Well crafted, and such a wonderful color. I especially love the way it sparkles when the light refracts on it. Nice chain and it is adjustable. I am very happy with my purchase."
5.0,its fine
5.0,These are stylish and comfortable.  I hope that I don't have to check out how well they float!!!
5.0,"I love the length of these shorts, you can wear on errands and feel modest.  Lovely colors, I have 4 different pairs!  And no tugging to keep them in place.  I usually wear a size large leggings, size 10 in jeans and large is perfect."
5.0,I bought this for my daighter’s birthday and she loved it.

5.0,Love the colors!! Super cute!
5.0,I love these socks. Perfect everyday wear. Wished they came in different colors other than white.
5.0,"cute, comfortable, and fits as expected"

5.0,wears it all the time
5.0,"This necklace set, which I bought for my girlfriend, arrived in perfect condition.  The wood is beautiful and the craftsmanship excellent."
5.0,Great fit and nice style. Best part was the price. They wont last forever but for the price who cares. Reall nice for boating and outdoors if you need to read gauges or charts and such.
5.0,"Looks elegant and beautiful. I get compliments EVERY time I wear it. Great for work, or a nice night out. You could wear it with jeans too. I'm so glad I bought it! Funny thing is that I was disappointed at first cuz I thought the whole thing was made out of sweater material, but am so happy with the way out looks and fits. It is my go to jacket when I'm not sure of the occasion. It won't disappoint!!"
5.0,For the price I’m surprised how nice the bracelet was.  I ordered four total for Christmas presents for my family and each one loved them so much. All fit them perfect for it being one size fits all.
5.0,"good quality, my partner loved it"
5.0,kinda thin but ok
5.0,"I teach Middle School Art and have been really kicking up the painting side of things.  I was looking for palette knives to have my students use when mixing their paints.  Even plastic ones were somewhat prohibitively expensive (when I have 80 students and I KNOW not all the tools will survive), so these were fantastic. The actual spoon dynamic allows them to scoop paint and do it in moderation, and obviously the mixing is very doable. These are a great size for my need, and can be rinsed clean after use along with brushes.  Best of all, if one breaks, gets lost, or simply gets to the end of it's natural life, they're cheap and quick to replace.  INCREDIBLY SATISFIED!<br /><br />(Not sure is this is the endorsement the seller was looking for, but for me, they are TOTAL WIN!)"
5.0,A very good buy.
5.0,Amazing gift for my boyfriend
5.0,The price is great for this pretty well made wallet. Very durable.
5.0,Daughter loves her new slippers! They are so soft!
5.0,"I've purchased a few of these for my Apple Watch band collection. I use them to replace the buckles on bands that I just don't like. I'm not a fan of painted blacks or glossy silvers, so being able to replace them with matte or brushed silver is great."
5.0,"Awesome shirt! I'm a huge Mass Effect fan and I've been looking for an N7 shirt forever but have been unable to find one I really liked, and this is PERFECT! It looks great with my N7 leggings. The graphic quality is amazing and the shirt itself is incredibly soft and sturdy."
5.0,"My hubby loves these for sleeping & lounging - very soft, and the elastic holds but is not binding."
5.0,the sunglasses arrived on time as promised no damage very good quality i would reccomend to anyone
5.0,Like heavier material
5.0,I ordered it in XL and it fit perfectly.  The quality is excellent.  I will be ordering another set.
5.0,Perfect for my mask or grasses!
5.0,"These are great pants. Comfortable, feel like leggings even though they look fancy. I'm 5'10 and have a big butt and these pants aren't too short in the ankles and I don't have to keep pulling them up. (32 XL)  I'm gonna get them in different colors for sure."
5.0,My favorite shirt. Have it in many colors and have worn this style of years. I love the softness and thickness of the cotton. Makes it a &#34;nicer&#34; tee shirt than others.
5.0,Very cute dress!! Fits a size 4/5 little girl. It’s a nice winter or fall dress to wear with leggings and a jacket - and she loves unicorns. They have similar dresses at the Children’s Place store but I like this brand better!! The material feels nice too.
5.0,Love this dress. So flattering. Nice fabric and the pockets are fabulous.
5.0,It is the most comfortable belt I own now. It is very easy to put on and quick to adjust. This belts magnets are strong and they do not move when they are attached.

5.0,So cute. I get tons of compliments.
5.0,I am a size 16 with a large chest and this is absolutely a perfect fit! So excited to wear it!
5.0,"I wasn’t sure what to expect when I ordered this cute little dress. I am a tall and slightly bigger gal, and nothing every fits. This was awesome! Fits up top and it is long and flowy... I see some summer trips wearing this cute little number and it has snack holes! AKA pockets"
5.0,"I had a double mastectomy a couple of months ago and I am suppose to use a compression bra which is very uncomfortable. I purchased the compression tank tops because they are more comfortable than wearing a compression bra.<br /><br />I've purchased this same tank tops twice and in different colors. As I improve after my surgery I will buy more again. I just love them, they really look beautiful and they feel great against your skin. They make me feel good!"
5.0,This vest is extraordinarily beautiful... I love the rich color and the way it fits!

5.0,THESE SHOES ARE EVERYTHING! I love the way they fit like a glove on my feet!
5.0,"I bought this for the skin on my Predator costume, and it's actually perfect! It fits well (very stretchy). I am 5'7"" and 175 pounds, and XL fit me perfect. Shipping took about 10 days, but it arrived sooner than I expected. If you are looking for the skin layer for a Predator costume, look no further! This is perfect!"
5.0,Great beachware
5.0,Perfect! Comfortable and my headaches are now gone.
5.0,Pre
5.0,I love these boots but make sure you order a size smaller than what you wear. I ordered a size 11 originally because they don't sell half-sizes (I wear 10.5). 11 was way to big so I bought 10. It fits much better!
5.0,It fits really nice.
5.0,Fits well  and will be great for my vacation
5.0,This is great for late night reading when our house temp drops.  I wear a short-sleeved nightgown and my arms often get cold.  This solves my problem!!
5.0,"Quality stretch gloves! I was thinking they were just going to be like the cheapy big box store type...NOPE! Way better and solid color! No faded black, Colors are vibrant. Highly recommend them!"
5.0,Good quality at a good price.
5.0,"Bought these a couple of weeks back for just over $25. They arrived 2 days later and that night I used them for biking.<br />The vision is good. As mentioned before, they are blue lenses. But the color didn't bother me.<br />These things are huge and seem very solidly built.<br /><br />The only issue I have is that if you wear them for more than an hour or so they give you a headache as they are so tight!!<br /><br />So, for biking glasses - Excellent<br />Day to day normal use - Not so good"
5.0,The pictures don't do this dress any justice. I was trying to capture how beautiful the green is without success. It's appear faded but it's a nice deep green. I love it it's nice and stretchy. It's a nice style too.
5.0,Fits great and doesnt chaff my wrist like many do!
5.0,"Perfect just what I order, liked!!!"
5.0,Nice its a good purchase
5.0,They were a perfect size. Went down one size yet they are stretchy. Truly everything I like in jaggings. Comfortable and not super cheap looking.
5.0,Bought this for my 1 and a half year old for our beach vacation. It was a life saver. Great quality and so cute!
5.0,"I love the hat.  It's perfect for running, without having to wear the typical goofy running hats.  Keeps the sun off of my face without making my head to hot.<br /><br />I has a velco, adjustable strap in the back, which is great.  I wear a 7 and 5/8 size fitted baseball hat and strap has just enough room for my head.  If you're head is any bigger, it won't stay secured."
5.0,So comfortable! Love love love it! Fits to size. No need to size up or down. Washes well.
5.0,A1
5.0,Good party favor and snow day fun.

5.0,Great value and nice scarf!

5.0,"fits perfectly....Grandson loved it!!!! great price & quality of product...VERY SATISFIED,Thanks!"
5.0,great fit and quality.. totally worth it!!!
5.0,"Excellent socks. Exactly what I was looking for. I bought these to wear with my Minnetonka moccasins. They don't show at all, fit perfectly and do not slip off my heels like some other no-show socks do. Plus, they are 83% cotton. I was happy to find something in a natural fabric with just enough polyester and spandex to have stretch and durability. Thanks guys! Good job."
5.0,"Hermosas , me encantan y parecen de buena calidad"
5.0,"Fast Delivery, good quality, who could ask for more."

5.0,it's a little tight with certain hairstyles  but I still love it!
5.0,I absolutely adore these headbands. I bought them for my 9 months old and they fit her perfectly. They are just as pictured and arrived a lot quicker than I expected. There is no wiring in them. They are made of cloth only and are super soft. I tried them on just for good measure and they do fit. But I don't think they'd shrink back to fit my daughter if I wore them. I can't wait to have her wear them this coming spring
5.0,"Bought this hat for the second time, in grey color (I gifted my first one to my friend) Really cute beanie!! Will buy again if needed."

5.0,Vendor was great to deal with on original size being too large and exchanging.

5.0,[[VIDEOID:a057f0c5dfe6fa7d6636cd80748f0835]] Perfect 🤩
5.0,I really am happy with this shirt.  The material is very soft and the medium fits like a true medium.
5.0,I've worn these slippers often for 2 years and they've held up beautifully -- I've worn them outside in the garden and gotten them a bit dirty and I just throw them in the washer. But the real test is that I am COVID confined at home and have worn them EVERYDAY for 4 consecutive months -- and they still look and feel good. They do not deserve a poor review since they were never received in the first place by the previous reviewer. They are not hot on your feet and you forget you're even wearing slippers. I love them. I got the plaid ones with a bow -- ADORABLE.
5.0,Totally adorable. Good quality. Loved this product!

5.0,"I am 5'9&#34; 172 lbs. I was a bit skeptic about ordering this dress at a size Med but it is perfect!!! Perfect length, perfect fit!!! I ordered the gray and the blue. If the quality and the fit is as good as the 1st, I will invest in the multi color. It is so comfortable, I would wear these 24/7 if my lifestyle would warrant it. It' a great dress that you can go grocery shopping in and wear it in the evening just by changing a few accents. I wore them with my Merrel winter boots and ia sweater under my winter coat and I looked great. I am looking forward to wearing these dresses in the spring with sandals and jewerly. It is an amazing dress and so flattering. It us do nicr to ditch the jeans for a change and feel feminine"

5.0,I loved the way the caps fit! They are easy to put on and adjust to your head size. All of my hair is contained inside the cap. :)
5.0,"I love this dress! It’s lightweight, soft and cool. Perfect for summertime. It did fit a good bit larger than I expected. Still super cute. I love the length and the pockets are great. It’s very stretchy and you can see pretty much everything underneath it so you’ll definitely need slip or something under it.<br />I really enjoy just throwing this dress on because it’s cute and easy."
5.0,"I wanted something to act as a beach cover-up, and this is perfect. Great product for a great price!"
5.0,"Got this as a dramatic play apron for my almost two year old. She loves the apron, not as much the hat, but she hates all things on her head. Both items are adorable, made of quality fabric that I'll hold up to children and messes,"
5.0,Love this shirt. Super comfy!
5.0,I like it and was worth it for the price
5.0,"The are a little thinner than some.  If you wear a long top, as I do, all is well.  I find them to be quite opaque.  (I guess it depends on your size.)  Overall I am very satisfied!"
5.0,These socks are the most comfortable socks I have every owned. They are so soft feels like you are walking on cushions and I'm loving the different shades of pink (my favorite color). They have became the only socks I wear for my workouts and to work ( I spend 10-12 hrs on my feet daily) and afterwards my feet never feel tired and sore like they used to.

5.0,"This silver-plated necklace was lovely. Make sure you see that it is silver-plated and not sterling. But the stone was real. It was pretty. It is a good size, not too big to be overwhelming but noticeable. It is pretty versatile and will work for a great deal of settings and people. I think it would be good for anyone from a child to an adult.<br /><br />I thought it was unique. It came packaged nicely. The quality seemed good.<br /><br />It was very comfortable to wear.

I understand that nurses used to  earn their white cap on graduation.<br />it was made of very high-quality materials and comes in a flat plastic pack. She and my son-in-law had a wonderful time trying to figure out how to put it together so she could wear it.<br />In case you're wondering if you should get one or shouldn't get one for a nurse who's recently graduated please do, she was absolutely delighted with the gift."

I haven't taken it off since the day I got it.<br />The center piece is a beautiful color, and has pretty little cubic zirconia jewels on both sides.<br />As I've said, I've work this every day, and have not had a single problem. All of the jewels are still in place, and in don't see them falling out anytime soon. The middle piece is held by 4 small posts, and it's in there very tight. The ring hasn't turned my finger colors, and has easily held its shape.<br /><br />I received this item for free, in exchange for my honest, and unbiased opinion."
5.0,I wish that there was more colour choice. I HATE pink. However the bras are good and will do their job perfectly.

5.0,"Diaclaimer** I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.<br />I have had the sunglasses for 3 days now and and with 3 boys trying them out they have taken a beating! But they have withstood it all! They have been stretched by a toddler, stepped on, thrown in a diaper bag and still are great! I would definitely recommend these! They came with a soft case, hard case, cleaning cloth and a glasses strap making it a good deal! They fit all my kids ages 3-12"
5.0,IT DOES NOT GET ANY BETTER!!!
5.0,little costly but excellent  quality

5.0,"This necklace is so stunning! It looks very pretty in the pictures, but it is absolutely gorgeous in person. The necklaces comes in a very nice red velvet box that is embossed with Uhibros. The box is a great statement for this beautiful necklace and a great way to present it. If you give this as a gift, the box makes it even more special. I am attaching a picture of the closed box, where you can see the top. I am also attaching a picture of the Uhibros Sterling Silver Heart Pendant Necklace in the box.<br /><br />The chain is an eighteen inch chain. Attached is a picture of it on my own neck, in case you want to see the length on a human. It is a twisted rope style. It is dainty, but durable and well made. The clasp is easy to use, and the chain is very sparkly. The pendant has a large turquoise stone that is extremely sparkly! It catches light very well, and glitters from across the room. The setting for the stone is a four prong, and the stone is well set. The turquoise stone is framed by two overlapping hearts. One is a simple silver outline of a heart. The second heart is made of a bunch of tiny cz stones or maybe Swarovoski clear stones. Whatever they are, they make what would be a pretty necklace - stunning! The necklace is the perfect size of a daily wear necklace. I attached the picture of the pendant in my hand to show the size better in my palm.  I have worn the necklace several days in a row and it is not tarnishing or discolored.<br /><br />The Uhibros Sterking Silver Heart Pendant Necklace is a fantastic choice for a gift. I am going to buy my niece one of these for her 10th birthday. It is a a necklace she can be proud of, but it isn't so expensive that it would be too much responsibility. I did receive this product at a promotional price, in exchange for a fair and honest review. This review is not influenced by that at all. This necklace is extremely impressive, especially considering the very low price!"

5.0,"I'm 5'1, 135 lbs, chest 35"" at ribs out to 40"". I have the red wine colored one. It says XL. I don't recall if I got it from this particular seller (my order history isn't going back far enough?!) but they're all from basically the same place. I really love it! Ended up buying a few in different colors and lengths and sleeve styles! I like the material alot because<br />as I recaII I don't think it really wrinkles very badly- I could be wrong though maybe they just don't show much."

5.0,"I read most of the reviews and choice a size XL based on sizing chart and reviews. For myself this was a little too big, it could have worked but my back was fully together and I still had too much room in the top and waist.<br /><br />I immediately reordered in a L. The quality was much better than I expected at this price point and it is beautiful.<br /><br />I will adjust my review if my opinion changes when my new one arrives tomorrow.<br /><br />For size reference I am 5'4&#34; 153 lbs size 6/7 us jeans size 6 dress and a 36C/34D bra depending on brand. With an hourglass shape."
5.0,These earrings are so cute and very comfortable to wear.
5.0,"I bought the shirt because I started yoga, the shirt stretches with me when I bend into a pretzel. And it absorbs sweats OK, because I use it in hot yoga.  I like the shirt because it fits me well, and because I'm a plus size gal it's important that things fit me well. And if you're a plus size Girl, I would recommend this product for you."

5.0,Love being able to listen to music while keeping my head warm
5.0,"The jacket fits more tailored to the body, its not wide and 'baggy'. I'm 6' tall 220 lbs - got an XL and it fits great, but don't expect to wear a thick sweatshirt under this jacket unless you're a bean pole."
5.0,I got one set for 5.99 and another for 9.99. For that  price it is pretty good.
5.0,Great! My son is two and he wore them for the Battle of the Bands at the Georgia Dome! Both he and his friend had them and they loved it!
5.0,Exactly a described
5.0,"Perfect for those occasions where your normal fitbit band wont cut it. Fancy but not too fancy, super comfortable, and very pretty. Love mine! There is a learning curve for popping the cover on and off but once you get it, it really is simple."
5.0,I have balls that are too large for most toys including OxBalls products. This fits like a glove. Just the perfect snugness and has a little weight. Ordering another to see if I can double them up.

5.0,"workout clothes but I’ve realized the pants aren’t too small, I’m too big.<br /><br />~ determined!"
5.0,I purchased this to see if I could get relief from my autoimmune pains. I have tried a few compression shirts before but none with copper and I have to say that I was a bit skeptical as to how it could possibly help me with my joint and muscle pains and they seemed to help provide some relief. I'm not saying its some miracle shirt but I definitely felt some relief especially when I had some soreness from working out. I like the way that it fit. It was tight but not so tight that it felt restrictive. I am  happy with the results thus far and hope to have more relief with some time! I was given this item at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.
5.0,"Just as described, soft, warm and comfy"
5.0,"So much fun, ages 3 to 70! Ypu cannot help but smile. Watch Kristen Hampton Good News PTT for inspiration."
5.0,Went outside my comfort zone for this and it is great! Going to pair with a white denim jacket for a summer work outfit.

5.0,The seller and product are amazing
5.0,dark black. They're perfect
5.0,I am a size 16 and the blazer fit well. It is made from more of a cotton material so it doesn’t have a lot of give but there is some. I could fasten the button but my breast size is a DD so it looked better unbuttoned when I was sitting. Standing there was no issue with it being buttoned. I wore it casually with jeans. It was part of a 3 jacket purchase that I made with the intention of sending one back but I kept them all they were so great.
5.0,they are gorgeous but so heavy
5.0,"Really like the drape of this fabric as well as the rich color. The fabric fringe on the sides gives it a fun, sexy touch!"

5.0,"Adorable, love how its long in the back, looks just like picture"
5.0,High quality bought three.
5.0,"Great product when there is a need to cover your head and ears from cold weather. The down seems to be distributed well. I purchased two, one for a gift for a friend and I’m sure it will be appreciated in this cold weather we’ve been having lately. I’m glad I saw a video on this down hood  from someone who had purchased it and gave their review which was spot on. Thanks!"
5.0,Fit my 8 and 11 year old and have held up over a couple months of softball/baseball games and practices.
5.0,"This is a beautifully designed, sturdy, well- and cleverly-made little item, and looks very nice in use. The clasp is also excellent. I was specifically looking for a cross, and bought this as a zipper pull for a red winter parka which has black faux fur around the hood, so the zipper pull's colors are perfect. (It also comes in a number of other colors.) When the parka's zipper is pulled up, the cross hangs at about the level where a necklace would hang, which I also like (its whole length, with the tether and clasp is around four inches) . The price is also very good."
5.0,Very breathable.  I wish the color was more true to picture but will order pink next time. Price point is awesome.
5.0,Good and cheap
5.0,The fabric was stretchy while remaining thicker than a typical legging. I think these will hold up well for a longer time. The print is very pretty and looks exactly like the picture.
5.0,love this item fits well
5.0,I absolutely love this dress!!!!! I decided to go up too sizes because I was unsure of the material. It fits perfectly. I love the grunge/goth look so this was a perfect match for me.
5.0,These are good socks I wear a ladies nine wide and these are large size I will try a medium for more support
5.0,Perfect - she loved it!
5.0,This is beautiful and eye-catching.
5.0,Bought for my 8 year old son who is very interested in cooking! He was so excited to receive it! It fit well for him and the fabric is a lightweight cotton! We live the pocket in the middle too!
5.0,The shirt is super soft and drapes beautifully. I took the rhinestone off like others. It had no real purpose. The shirt is so versatile. I wore it one day with yoga pants and another day with a nice skirt and boots.
5.0,"I purchased these rings for my niece who turned 13. She really likes them, and her mom said she wears them often. They are a great accessory."
5.0,Very comfortable for daily use at home
5.0,"Used for two years. Held up well. Slight wear and tear, but I reckon I can get another year or so out of it"
5.0,Fits just as I expected for both children.

5.0,"These are so cute, and my 10 year old Harry Potter-obsessed daughter loves them!"
5.0,Very prettty cross..I like the Celtic cross ..even though I am Greek Orthodox..
5.0,"Came just as expected, no flaws and can't beat the price!! They're only about a 1/2&#34; but people see them and I have gotten lots of compliments. Will be getting the other color and maybe a back up pair in case I lose one. Can't beat it for under $5!!"
5.0,"These are flat (in terms of dimension) hoops in a round shape that hang down to the very top of my jawline. (See add for measurements, etc,) The gold is slightly wider at the bottom. I think that makes them more interesting and classy. The 18k gold plating is nice and shiny and looks like real 18k gold. They are light weight and comfortable. One of the best things about them are the secure clasps. One of mine is a fraction out of alignment, but with practice I've learned to secure it. The clasp is a lever-back. It consists of a hinged piece with a hole that you press forward to slide over the post (stem). Very cool."
5.0,This swimsuit is really nice it fits perfectly the straps have a place where you can change the tightness and the fabric isn’t thin but it’s not thick so it’s hot when you wear it if you think the swimsuit I cute then you should buy it!

5.0,Work great! My kids love them and enjoy wearing them when we go to concerts
5.0,"These actually work pretty well, my glasses never seem to fit on my face right plus with my oily skin they fall down a lot so these help keep them on my face"
5.0,"Gorgeous dress! My daughter was in a wedding and it fit her amazing. My daughter is also a little busty and it fit great around the bust as well. Def a great choice for a bridesmaid dress. Cute, flowy, comfy & gorgeous!"
5.0,"I like most things Nike, so when I saw the trunks, I couldn’t resist. Fashionable, comfortable & of all things, Nike. Can’t wait for the nice weather! Couldn’t be happier, looking for my next pair!"
5.0,I LOVE these socks. I have varicose veins around the ankles and since they are not so tight it doesn't hurt them. Will order them again for sure.
5.0,It’s everything I expected
5.0,Amazing quality and so cute!! They do run a little bit small as in the top isn't very stretchy when putting on but once its on it fits great! Can't wait to wear it to the beach!
5.0,My daughter was able to put these on easily by herself and it held all the water out. They are also easily adjustable.
5.0,For $15 so comfy and cute!! I’m 5’1 147lbs and I got a large! I’m very happy

5.0,I love these kooky glasses & got two colors!
5.0,"Love the design, how it fits and feels. I bought size M, I'm a 30/30 in pants 5'7 150lb. Also it was free shipping and shipped almost next day!"
5.0,I needed these gloves for cutting mosaic tiles. They protect my hands well. Just what I need.
5.0,"I'm very pleased with this watch. I have had multiple people ask me about it thinking it was something much more expensive and one person told me that I could have claimed it was some expensive brand and he would have believed me. I've only ever had it get stuck once, but since its fully mechanical, all I had to do was slap it and it started right back up. I haven't had any problems with it since. If you need to look fancy on a budget, this is a great place to start. The only real issue I have is that the spring runs out overnight, so i have to reset it every morning, but thats kind of expected with this type of watch. Other than that, I am very happy with this watch."
5.0,I keep these in my car.  Love being able to just slip them on over my glasses instead of getting out my prescription glasses.  Great product.  Fits well over my glasses.
5.0,We just got our glasses today and we love them!  Thank you so much!
5.0,Dress is then but perfect for Halloween costume. I ordered size up a good thing I did. Runs a little small.

5.0,"Very nice quality, the locket is substancial and made nice,, magnetic closure was very nice. Like<br />the chain and durability of it."
5.0,Cute for Halloween....
5.0,"I made sure to read the reviews on this dress before buying, and I told myself I still wouldn't be disappointed when it arrived if it wasn't as good as I was hoping.<br />It is! I am so pleased. I'm a big ol' girl these days and wanted a nice lounge dress that would be easy to dress up if needed for the warmer months ahead. This is perfect. I ordered a xxxl because I wanted it to hang nice and loose and I could've went down to an xxl and been happy. (I am 5'5 and 230, I carry all my weight in my lower half) I cannot recommend this enough for the price. The material is nice overall. A tiny bit thin but not in a bad way at all. Love it!"
5.0,I am diabetic and these socks are the most comfortable socks I have ever worn. Have 7 pairs and wear them daily.
5.0,the color is awesome.
5.0,Peach in color. Beautiful cover. Very lightweight.
5.0,"Got one for a costume and a second one for regular use, I like the low profile and how it fits"
5.0,Glad I could even find them.  They were a perfect replacement.
5.0,I wore this at our cabin on the lake. Love it!

5.0,Great! I bought it as a birthday gift for a friend and she loved it.
5.0,"This mask has changed my life completely. Ever since I bought this, I got off drugs, alcohol, and i brought my grades up. I don't think I would still be alive if it weren't for this mask. I was contemplating suicide, I didn't want to live anymore because I had nothing to live for. It gave me the hope and the strength I needed to push on. So far, I've donated to over 2 charities from the donations given to me fro wearing this mask. It is, and always will be my best friend."
5.0,"Excellent double lock security that can be padlocked (TSA locks fit or other brands), no vulnerable zipper that can be defeated with a BIC pen pushed into the teeth as on 95% of other manufacturers luggage on the market. Lots of handles, wheels and extended handle for easy transport. Reinforced corners and sturdy aluminum construction. Some dividers inside and an excellent affordable price. Local luggage shop sold a different aluminum model for $1,000.00 and this is so much more affordable! No dislikes, and fits airline max size limitations. Not too big, not too small."
5.0,Fit perfect for my calculator watch. Will buy again.
5.0,Cute and comfy. Would buy again.
5.0,"I wasn't to pleased with the purse when I first received it and was mad at myself for not saving the packaging, but it grew on me quickly and I have received so many compliments. The purse is nice and sturdy and it is beautiful. I like the fact that there is multiple choices in fashioning this purse. I highly recommend it. I think my initial disappointment was based on the fact that I don't like big purses and it was bigger than I thought."
5.0,Looks great. Very satisfied with this strap.
5.0,Very thick others are really thin very satisfied
5.0,Beautiful dress. Fits perfectly.

5.0,"It arrived super fast!! The fabric is super comfortable and wavy, looks great and is super flattering, colors are just like in the pictures. I love that it has big pockets, and the length is great to use with flats or heels."
5.0,"Time will tell if this watch holds up. But it looks amazing, feels nice and I am looking forward to more from them."
5.0,"Love the material, but it is a little too heavy for my liking. It is super cute and looks just like the main picture. I am 5'8 and I got a medium...which is a bit short on the torso but the arms are perfect! I like the little detail on sleeves and on the bottom of it."
5.0,Excellent charm. Fits the genuine braclet
5.0,"Recipient loved it!  Great color, fun to wear!  Great conversation bracelet.  Recipient works in a rest home so patrons ask her about it."
5.0,Bought this for my 16 year old son.  He loves it.  I love the color and the logos on it.
5.0,Super comfortable and holds its shape well. I love the gray.
5.0,I purchased these last year for me 9 year old daughter's slumber party.  I did test them first and indeed a couple did not work and the rubber bands on a few broke during the party festivities.  They were a hit though and even a year later my daughter still uses hers. (One of the few party favors that doesn't quickly make it's way to the garbage or misc garage sale pile.)  As I am getting ready for the next party I am buying more.  Even with a few duds the value and fun factor make this a great buy.<br /><br />**Update**  I just received my shipment.  I tested all 80 lights (2 sets) and they all worked with the exception of one that was dim.  The bands on these sets are much more durable than last year and I did receive them in the sets of 4 in packaging. I am very pleased with the purchase again this year.
5.0,Great buy!!!!
5.0,Awesome strap. Carried my camera for hours with no strain or discomfort. Fasteners seem sturdy and well-made.

5.0,"Great quality watches, and my niece and nephew love them! The colors are vibrant and they're just super cute."
5.0,The quality and texture are great design is great too.
5.0,"I have skinny fingers and my ring constantly spins on my finger. I tried the rubber corkscrew looking ring sizers, it fit my finger better, but my ring still moved. I tried 2 different  hard plastic ring sizers they worked a little better except I had to do a ton of extra trimming on the smallest size it came with, then eventually lost it, because you have to use a adhesive that would slowly stop working in 5 days. I tried the spongy adhesive, it worked great until I washed my hands then it washed off. I’m so happy I tried this. The top of my ring stays on the top of my finger, the ring Sizer stays on my ring in the same spot I attached it. I love it, and it’s the only thing I would recommend to anyone."
5.0,Makes my watch look great
5.0,"Love this! I use it for my classroom key, because I'm not allowed to keep it on the same lanyard as my badge, and I don't want it on my personal house/car key lanyard. The fabric is silky, and the lettering is holding up really well for being in and out of my pocket several times a day. No creases or peeling!"
5.0,received my item right away and very satisfied!
5.0,"Great hat for my mother-in-law to wear at her grandson's baseball games, football games and other grandkids sports. Highly recommend!"
5.0,Was perfect for the purpose I wanted it.  Crafting purposes.
5.0,beautiful ! love it
5.0,Material is nice true to fit. Wear it to a church Banquet.
5.0,"I have used these ever since I was little. For someone who likes 5 second hairstyles, this is a must have. I constantly get asked when I wear this how I put together such a perfect bun."
5.0,"Love this dress! It’s soft, well made and super comfortable! I wore the dress to work today and received MANY compliments! Will be purchasing another one in a different color!"

5.0,So comfy---like walking on clouds.  Highly recommended.
5.0,Love love love this bag! Absolutely perfect
5.0,"I got these and I thought I wasn't going to like them, but after wearing them for awhile they're my favorite. They aren't as compressed as other brands I own, but they also make your bum look great. For the record I'm 186lbs and 5'4. I would say the waist comes up fairly high, but I'd rather have that then than the leg be too long. Overall, love these the price is right and I think they're great addition to your workout wardrobe."
5.0,This necklace arrived on time as promised. It is a very nice omega for the price.
5.0,Wonderful... I added them to the album that I made my great-nephew... one for his older brother and one for each of his older sisters.  I hung them onto the front of his album on a long charm chain along with a key ring.  Gorgeous.
5.0,I am 5'10&#34; and usually wear size 14-16 and was beyond pleased with this dress.  It is one of the most COMFORTABLE dresses I have ever owned and I got SO many compliments on the dress.  I want to order one in every design!
5.0,What great bows! My daughter has a tiny head (1 month old) so I tied a little knot to make them fit currently. But love all the colors for the price! She will be wearing these for a LONG time!
5.0,"Great value! It was cheaper than renting, and it looks incredibly good. The quality is excellent."
5.0,I'm looking for more like this one comfortable!
5.0,Exactly as described!  Ships fast!
5.0,Skirt part is nice and flowy. pockets are handy too. Top part is more fitted but very flattering. Not heavy either so very comfortable.
5.0,Perfect case for my cheaters and easy transaction. Thank you TruVision
5.0,"Nice earrings! I have tried clip earrings before but my earlobes gets very red and sore. The advantage of the screw-back system is that one can adjust the pressure on the earlobe. I use them the whole day and they stay in place without irritating me. Also, they look nice. Examining them close, you can see that they are non-metal and the finishing is not very precise, but they are light and I think they are good for the price."
5.0,My daughter in-law loved it. I gave it to her for her first Mother’s Day.
5.0,Roomy and soft  Great casual top
5.0,Bought the dress for my daughter and it was perfect!!!  She’s a size double zero and 5’9” and the fit was perfect!

5.0,Perfect for keeping in your pocket or pack. Sturdy readers
5.0,Buen producto. Un poquito grande pero bien
5.0,"Great suit. It comfortably fit a 3XL sized man, but I think 6' is the upper height limit. Looks great from the outside and it's not a terrible experience inside. Just be mindful that the suit can get hot quick and if you are a heavy breather the window that let's you see outside the suit can fog up."
5.0,Me gusto no es de muy buena calidad pero esta bello.
5.0,These heels are beautiful! They are well made and fit true to size. I love the Nina brand and look out for their shoes when I’m buying. They are silver which make them wearable with just about any color!
5.0,looks super good quality
5.0,"I was surprised to see how beautiful it is.  I was imagining that it probably would be too big/small.  But, boy was I wrong.  It is just right and the details are clear.  Not too thick/thin.  Again, just right!  Wore it for the firat time today and it didn't bother me while wearing it for 8 hours."
5.0,"Good product, good size..."
5.0,Great coat. Really cute.
5.0,"The watch is absolutely beautiful. At first when I ordered the watch, it did not track time accurately.

5.0,Too cool - I have people asking me to take pictures of me and with me all the time.
5.0,Cute & simple. Fits my yoga mat well
5.0,This necklace is so gorgeous in person! I love the layered chains and love that they don’t tangle together. Highly recommend!

5.0,"LOOKS GOOD, I REALLY LIKE IT, NICE LOOKING REGARDLESS OF THE LOW PRICE, I WOULDN'T MIND BUYING ANOTHER ONE FOR SURE."
5.0,I hate spending big money for Under Armour when I don't have to. They make great stuff but it's hard to have any variety in your gym attire buying that or Nike on a budget.<br />So I've lost about 55# so far so I had to replace all my gym clothes. And for the first time I've had a decent enough body to wear tank tops in public! These are great for the money and plan on buying these again!

5.0,"My son recently joined JROTC and my husband has been taking the opportunity to teach him how to dress properly as a man. Shirt stays were something of an abstract idea to me before now. I had heard the term, but I assumed they were something like cuff links. Um... NOPE!!<br /><br />These clip to the top if the sock and the bottom of the shirt. They (at least this kind) pull the shirt firmly, but comfortably, down so that it does not come untucked from the pants. Luckily, this comes with two sets, so I get to see my handsome son looking fresh in his JROTC uniform AND my gorgeous husband all dressed out in his suit. It really makes a difference that I never noticed before,<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM FREE OR AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY FAIR, HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN. I HAVE IN NO WAY BEEN COMPENSATED BY THE MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR OR ANY OTHER ENTITY ASIDE FROM SAID DISCOUNT OR FREE ITEM*"

5.0,"This is my third pair of these to order, they are that good!!! They are true to size,  just measure and your set. I work 12 hour shifts and these are great. I highly recommend."
5.0,Happy with these.  Great fit on my size 10 feet!
5.0,Is good but I not right size is too big
5.0,A great value for the price
5.0,"We recently moved to WA and my husband needed some sweatshirts to throw over his thermals for warmth.  I purchased the Russell sweatshirts for a great price and was pleased to see how well made they are.  Take in mind they should be washed before you wear them but they were true to size, thick, well made sweatshirts."
5.0,Wow
5.0,My wife loves it.  Great present!
5.0,This is super cute and fits my girl well
5.0,It looks better in person
5.0,"Good band, It looks cool but most importantly it hides the end of the strap and is very easy to take off. Literally just a pull and its off."
5.0,Super cute! I'm a cat lover.
5.0,This is the 7th time i have bought this particular watch. Six times i have bought at Wal-Mart for about $15 and this time i bought for less from Amazon. They last about 3 years and then the band breaks. The batteries last 10 or so years. They are advertised as being accurate to about a second a day. All have gained or lost less than than 3 seconds a week. A real bargain!
5.0,"Exactly as described, good quality."
5.0,"My granddaughter loves horses, thanks"
5.0,This beautiful watch I purchased for my husband. He like it so much only time he takes it off is when he is in the shower!!. Now that's love for him.Thanks
5.0,Excelente mezcla de colores armonicos sobre una fina tela de algodon lo que lo hace fresco y elegante.  Para multiples usos con solo cambiar el top.
5.0,Just got the masks and they fit wonderfully.
5.0,Me and my children love these lots of colors
5.0,"Adorable, she loved them"
5.0,"I'm a size 8 and this tutu fit perfectly, with plenty more stretch. Love the short length, and color. Only real complaint, is it has a funky smell, but I'm sure it will air out."
5.0,Beautiful and made well
5.0,"It's hard to find nice quality rose gold jewelry items that are actually rose gold- this one is stunning! Highly recommend, especially for the price."
5.0,This is a very nice watch/bracelet.  Had just one review but i took the plunge.  I would call it my combo wristwatch.  The watch is the same as in the picture on Amazon. Can be adjusted to your wrist size by taking out the extra links. Previous watches that I got from Amazon had to be returned because of the clasps not closing and slipping off.  But this should work for me. Looks expensive and classy for the price. More of a dressy watch than an everyday one which is the reason I got it. Hoping it stands the test of time. Looking forward to rocking it for many years to come.  Plus shipping was fast & timely. Thanks Amazon & Taylor Cole.!
5.0,Fits perfectly!!!  I love them. Nice throw on and go type outfit. Perfect with ugg or tennis shoes. I got the grey and green set and navy blue and red set. I will be ordering more from this company. I order size XX-Large cause of the reviews. And it fits perfectly.
5.0,"These are the best I have ever gotten, I use for bike riding and car work, heavy duty yet comfortable and light really great"
5.0,Which of course sounds like they are disposable but they’re not. They do occasionally break but then so do the expensive pairs. They rarely scratch and having multiples that are easy to look through while blocking the sun is A+.
5.0,Haven't broke'em in yet. But i like what i see.<br />Came with a lil bag to hold'em in too.
5.0,Item came on time packaging is very good they fit very well and gives lot of support I'm a 34b or c bra size I order medium and these were perfect !!!!
5.0,Perfect for I need it for
5.0,"I like unique style, great fit and quality!"
5.0,Perfect choker for my little black dresses. Got lots of compliments each time I wear it.
5.0,For perfect for my 10 year old daughter- looked great too!
5.0,"Love this! I got it for my 2 day backpacking trip in the great Smoky mountains. The color, fit, and material was exactly what I hoped for. Very comfortable and a great extra layer for the cool mornings."
5.0,There is nothing bulky or fancy about this mask. It does the job when pairing with an outfit and dressing up as frankenstein. Easy to fold up and store etc.
5.0,"Great belt, a little pricey, but my son loves it."
5.0,"I bought these to cover an acral lick granuloma on my dogs front leg (she is a 50lb Lab/chow mix) so she would stop licking it after applying medicine.<br /><br />They were slightly snug, but not tight. I added vet wrap to the top to keep them in place while keeping the bottom open so the granuloma could breathe. I have large wrists and these are pretty snug on me,  but not uncomfortable. I liked that I got 9 pair, and since I only use one at a time for the dog I can wash and reuse. They do have a seam on the inside, so for her I turned them inside out so the seam would not press on her leg. The color green was the same as the photo.<br /><br />Very satisfied and served their purpose. Washed on without issues."
5.0,The top fits like a regular shirt at your regular size but the crotch part is wayyyyy too big unless you size down!
5.0,Top is a little more difficult  to get on and ensure full coverage the bigger your breasts are but the adjustability faction is huge!
5.0,"Sparkly gold, not cheap looking. Husband did not want to wear but once he put it on he wouldnt take it off. XD"
5.0,The outside of them were drenched one night when I was pushing carts at Walmart in 10° weather with wind hands were warm and dry as a bone when I took them off a must have for outside jobs
5.0,Got so many compliments. Super comfortable
5.0,"This is really cute but I'm not to sure about the material. To me it wasn't really all that soft but my daughter didn't seem to mind. I did wash it with extra fabric softener and that seems to help. But for the price, ide buy it again and just make sure to wash it beforehand with lots of fabric softener. The colors are cute and didn't bleed in the wash. It's well made and doesn't feel like it will rip right away. Plus my daughter absolutely loves them. So only then how they feel when you first get them, they are great."
5.0,This is an inexpensive necklace to wear to holiday parties.  I received a lot of compliments.
5.0,"What’s not to like? Sturdy, good quality"
5.0,Great quality tshirt!
5.0,Love them....
5.0,AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME. No other words can describe this except AWESOME.
5.0,These are very pretty earrings.
5.0,This dress is perfect for a daytime wedding and an evening retirement celebration.
5.0,"Awesome tote bag. It’s the perfect size to hold my hydroflask, wallet, laptop, and I love the inside pocket for small things like my keys, phone, and chapstick."
5.0,Looked pretty and expensive. The box and package it came with was an additional surprise. Really loved the gift.
5.0,Love it.  I wanted one bag to hold all travel necessities.  This one will do it.
5.0,fit as expected. received on time.
5.0,Amazingly soft and easy to conform to your needs!
5.0,Pretty In Pink!👅
5.0,"This bag was exactly what I was looking for! I use it as my everyday work tote. It is spacious and seems to be very well-constructed. It has four different pockets on the outside, so I don't have to dig around to find my keys or my phone. It's big enough for me to toss in my overnight toiletries bag or my huge 64-oz water bottle. Plus the price was great. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"Purchased product because glasses were constantly fogging up while wearing a mask.  After using Anti-Fog Spray for Glasses they no longer fog. Also, it works great on sunglasses and mirror in the shower!"
5.0,I love this outfit. It’s perfect for the cooler weather. The top and bottoms have a nice squeeze to them to hold in all those loose belly parts. ;) I will buy another set this winter. I also like wearing the top under T-shirts to stay warm.
5.0,loved them very comfy.
5.0,"Love it. Beautiful, comfortable!"
5.0,great value for the product.  and great wear also
5.0,Beautiful dress. Fits as expected
5.0,I really love this earring. It's very cute. It arrived very early. I received it a week before it was said to be delivered. I even received candy and business cards to contact her and view more of her products.  It's very comfortable. I'm so happy with this product. Jujubeads makes amazing jewelry and I will definitely  be shopping here again.
5.0,"I bought this for my 15 year old daughter who wanted a dolphin necklace and she loves it. The charm and chain are both sturdy.  I was concerned looking at some other necklaces that the chain would be too thin and cheap, but this one is great."
5.0,"I like how it is not just the waterproof part like some that are advertised. There is a fleece soft lining on the inside leg. I got them for my son for his school camp trip and they are perfect. Comfy, warm and lots of pockets. Buying more in different colors!"
5.0,These are my new favorite sunglasses and I don’t think they are nerdy at all!  Love the polarized lens and the simple design and look.  I am getting lots of compliments on these too!
5.0,"Order came quickly and the bag looks exactly the same as the picture. It's a fantastic size and is so comfortable to have one. I originally bought the bag for when I travel rather than carrying a handbag which gets heavy but I started using it the day after it arrived and use it for so many things, day in the city, day at the beach and even just every day stuff. I love it!!"
5.0,I love this dress and I just ordered it this week and it was delivered. I’m so happy with my purchase.
5.0,"Bought as a birthday gift for my 7-year-old nephew, fit as expected and he loved the shirt."
5.0,I finally found my favorite sunglasses these are so nice and very classy looking. They look like if they were designer sunglasses. I will buy again.
5.0,Can't wait to wear the necklace. I like
5.0,I love these. They keep my feet warm and are very comfy to walk around with.
5.0,"Perfect fit, well-made, super cute"
5.0,I love this bra!!
5.0,Love this dress. highly recommend. fit great! if you are looking for comfy in a dress this is it!

5.0,Super cute and great quality! My daughter says they look just like mine!
5.0,I love this necklace. So worth the price!
5.0,I bought this to use when I go walking and want to cover my face without a mask. This is a great fit for anyone and is lightweight and very convenient!
5.0,"My mom enjoyed this dress, decent quality"
5.0,Love this!!! Will be ordering more in the future...
5.0,It is perfect for my small calves. They warm and comfortable but run small.
5.0,"Great stretch, fit to size, very cute and sexy , definitely worth the price!"
5.0,Couldn’t find these frames anywhere…so happy I could get them and at a very good price!  Quick service.
5.0,Just as described. 😊
5.0,Bought for wife who is a dog mom. She loves it
5.0,very cute! very thin but perfect
5.0,I finally got a gift for my wife that she actually likes. I decided to get her this instead of a cheaper Chinese knock off. It was worth it; she wears this everyday and loves the the fact that it was actually made in Ireland.
5.0,"I usually wear a small, but got a medium to make sure there was room to layer a long sleeve under it. I’m glad I did! I would suggest buying one size up if you’re going to layer as it fits snug. Also, a very soft material!"
5.0,I used it for all my church’s . It truly is one of the best I’ve used I’m buying another one I love it it is everything thay say it is 100%
5.0,The product too good for 5 star.  Good brand and it didn't let me down.
5.0,"I normally wear a size 8.  My feet run a little wide so I was a little leery about ordering my normal size.  On the basis of other reviews, I ordered a size 8 1/2.  They fit perfectly!"
5.0,"I absolutely love it, is everything I expect it, well made and just beautiful"
5.0,The item was exactly what I thought it would be 👍🏻
5.0,"I was worried these weren't going to be what I wanted, but they are great. They even came with a couple extra backings which is always nice to have."
5.0,"I love my synglasses, but moat if all  eyelove the fact that I'm helping people less fortunate by making a purchase."
5.0,Great fit and style
5.0,"Love this design! Including this, I've purchased three different lockets so far. I definitely recommend this if you want a necklace diffuser for your essential oils! It also come with a couple of glow-in-the dark balls, so it can look pretty cool!<br /><br />I am definitely a satisfied customer!"
5.0,I am very happy with my umbrella.  It is exactly as advertised.  The navy is a dark navy.
5.0,"Very cool, gift for gf, she gets compliments on it all the time :)"
5.0,They are everything they were advertised to be. However the stitching up the front accentuates the snatch and that's a little weird if your shirt's not long enough.
5.0,I Love it!
5.0,I just ordered every color I was very satisfied
5.0,I love it and I love the way it fits. this is a really cool necklace and the quality is really good. I am looking forward to buying some more items from this brand.
5.0,These glasses are great the size is right on. Just one thing to note be aware of stop lights as the red and green can neutralize one and other. I knew this from a previous red lens  pair that i had but it can catch you off guard if you dont know. It seems to be older lights.
5.0,My husband has had issues wearing conventional belts due to Parkinson's Disease.  This belt is a God-send.
5.0,This bag is so pretty and is so convenient for when I want to spent a few days/nights away from home. It holds a lot of clothes if packed correctly and the stylish design is perfect for anyone who doesn’t want a plain duffel bag. It’s very Saturday and I love that there’s a shoe compartment so there’s no need to walk around with an extra bag for a change of shoes.
5.0,"Love these glasses! They aren’t too big or too small, but just right! Love the burgundy color on my caramel skin!! And the edges are gold, too cute!!"
5.0,This dress is extremely comfortable.  I have washed it several times and the colors are still very bright.
5.0,Love this purse
5.0,"It is made very well, strong and sturdy weld. I bent it quite a bit with pliers so that I could adjust the size to my 6 year old granddaughter. A younger person would be able to push/pull without pliers I am sure.<br />So having said that you can see how durable it is. The color changes nicely and it has made a little girl very, very, happy. (Me too)"
5.0,Super cute and arrived in Walmart packaging brand new and still inside the covering bag.
5.0,"I have wide feet. They were a ""little"" tight from the beginning, but after a few wears they began to loosen. Love they have grips at the bottom of the slippers. Truth be told, I went for the look and prayed later that they will fit. Lol"
5.0,Love .
5.0,They have a swimsuit liner and fit perfectly.
5.0,"Fantastic book that explains the Scandinavian traditions in a logical and detailed manner. If paganism interests you in any way, then buy this book NOW! The way Varg Vikernes exposes patterns and connects the dots will be a fresh breath of air in a &#34;scene&#34; where most &#34;pagan&#34; authors seem to tell us the same thing we learned in school. This goes way deeper than that, you wont be disappointed"
5.0,"These are my new favorite jeans. They are soft and comfortable (like pajamas, as advertised), with a nice drawstring inside the waistband for a snug fit once they're over the hips. I get tired of always hitching up my jeans, even the high-waisted ones, and I don't like bulky belts under a tee (I'm too short-waisted to tuck in a shirt), so it's a relief to have jeans that stay up yet smoothe over the belly. I could wish for slightly bigger pockets, but pockets at all in comfy pant that don't look bulky is an achievement. I also got the skinny jeans for my highly athletic and also very curvy daughter who has trouble getting pants to fit her powerful thighs and tiny waist simultaneously. She really likes them, so depending on your personal style, either jean will work for a comfortable women's fit. I've only washed them once but that went just fine."
5.0,"The material is light and very comfortable. It’s not constricting, and very warm"
5.0,"This is my favorite pair of work pants! I’m 5’6” and 130 lbs, my legs are short proportionally to my long torso. My mom got me these in a medium petite in black for a Christmas present. They’re amazingly comfortable, *flexible* (I work at an elementary school so I’m squatting down to talk to the children about a million times a day), and they’re so cute. They are high waisted about up to my belly button and the waistband actually stays put all day, it doesn’t ride down in the back like all other dress pants I’ve had. Even though the waistband stays put, I love that they have belt loops, if I want to wear a belt to match my outfit. The material is thick enough to hide the excess fabric that comes from tucking in your shirt and doesn’t show panty lines. I’m planning on getting more pairs in different colors and maybe even a second pair in black because I literally miss these pants when they’re in the wash haha."
5.0,Hasta ahora cumple con lo requerido
5.0,I got these for my running shoes after my doctor suggested inserts for pain relief. These work great! Easy to cut and fit to my shoes and very comfortable. Highly recommend.
5.0,"Love these ultra comfy undies by Mamia. My second time buying them and I will buy again because they don't cause pain and stay where they're suppose to whether I'm sitting, standing, walking, stretching, bending or running."
5.0,Great bags.  Very durable and they hold a lot of groceries
5.0,"I love the Arctic Cool products, and keep buying more when something new comes out. Last summer I had a cooling shirt, towel and headband for our days in Yellowstone Nat'l Park -- what a lifesaver. No need to question the worth of these products."
5.0,Wish they had an XS but this dress is perfect for work. Super comfortable and j adore the pockets.
5.0,Nice shirt.  Runs big.
5.0,This dress fit as expected and is really comfortable to wear.
5.0,"This is a great shirt. Very well made and much better than expected. It's not a typical t-shirt, more like a jersey type material."
5.0,This particular two piece set is exactly as shown in the pictures. I don't use this as a workout set by as a loungewear set instead. The material is not good enough to be working out in the gym. It's also a little bit larger than I expected and I got a medium. Overall it's a good purchase but in my opinion not for the gym.
5.0,My daughter loves it. Good price for what seems like a quality sterling necklace.
5.0,"This wallet is fantastic. The wallet is sleek and looks great, while holding everything you need. This is a premium quality wallet that I highly recommend."
5.0,Smells like leather! It's nice and lots of pockets! I love it!
5.0,"I'm so glad I didn't listen to the other reviewers that said this dress is shiny and didn't fit well.<br /><br />I got the black dress in a medium - I'm 5'6"", 148 pounds with an hourglass figure.  This dress is incredibly comfortable and super sexy. Depending on how you accessorize it you can dress it up for a date night or dress it down for a night out with friends.  I'm going to order another one because I love it so much."
5.0,"They are great every day pumps, very classic"
5.0,Arrived faster than quoted. Neat little item at a very reasonable price.
5.0,Purchased as a gift for family member.  Needed them asap they arrived on time and are so much nicer that they looked online.  We were pleased.
5.0,"Beautiful soft leather. Holds everything I need a wallet to hold, without looking overstuffed. I absolutely love this wallet!"
5.0,Soft fabric. Great quality
5.0,OMG! I was spketical about this outfit. But I must be honest I fits perfect I can’t wait to wear it next weekend. Thanks for the fast shipping‼️❤️❤️
5.0,very beautiful well fitted so many compliment people cant believe the price
5.0,My girlfriend enjoyed receiving them for Christmas.  She has worn them out several time and has received complaints each time.
5.0,My son loves these and he's going to order another color.
5.0,Small just like I was hoping. Its so adorable.
5.0,My teenage son ordered these and he likes them.
5.0,"This product not only looked exactly like the photo when it arrived, but I also received it way sooner than the estimated arrival time. It was very surprising! Thank you!"
5.0,Cute but comes apart easily
5.0,"They fit great, stay on, and I get so many compliments on them if they happen to be showing out of my shoe.  People think they are part of my shoes and they can't believe it when I tell them they are sock/liners."
5.0,"High quality shirt for my son. Fit is good, maybe a little big for the boys small size. Would buy again."
5.0,"Nice quality, fits nice and is very cute."
5.0,Looks wonderful and my daughter is happy. She wears a 00 to a 0 in juniors to womens. And the small fit her perfect.
5.0,"Beautiful necklace and earring set, simple but elegant. A good value and a good gift idea."
5.0,My granddaughter will be graduating this weekend she lives blue
5.0,[[VIDEOID:52552fb4f7c85420908b6ad455882004]] I wear them often and I get plenty compliments
5.0,"Really sparkly, fun scarf for a party or night club statement."
5.0,"Very good price and nice goggles! Has great suction, and is comfortable to wear with alot of stretch!"
5.0,"That are do chick, love it."
5.0,"I'm an athletic trainer for a high school, when it became time to get a new sling bag I searched all over, but all the main Athletic Training brands (Cramer, Mueller, Medco etc.) either are extremely overpriced or very cheaply made. A colleague of mine turned me on to tactical bags as they are durable and practical with the amount of pockets and webbing to attach tools to.<br /><br />The additional pouch was what sold me on this product. Possibly the most used piece of this product as it contains all my football equipment tools in it.<br /><br />Overall the quality of this bag is very durable for everyday use. Not a huge fan of square zippers as they sometimes can be hard to close all the way with one hand. Other than that, no issues. If any Athletic Trainers out there are searching for an alternative to over priced sports med sling bags, this is a very good option."
5.0,Love it! Holds everything I need with room for more.
5.0,They fit good looks nice came in early
5.0,Love these cardigans! I'd buy one in every color if I could!!
5.0,Wife loves them. She thinks it makes her sexy. I agree.
5.0,"You have to get used to the claw fingers but after you do, they work great."
5.0,super cute...my wife loves it...she is petite and the xsmall fits as expected...
5.0,"Snug but not overwhelming, great for around the house tops and really comfortable."
5.0,The bracelet is sturdy and comfortable.  Very easy to adjust the length.  Unfortunately There weren’t instructions in my package but Amazon had them on the product detail
5.0,"Love these earrings.  Not very long, but the pale colors are gorgeous and will complement lots of pink, lavender, and blue clothing."
5.0,"Wonderful Product. Found it looking for TN GameDay attire and have since bought additional buckles and belts, trashing all of my old belts and wearing only Mission Belts."
5.0,perfect fit is a great product
5.0,This is a great hand bag !!!<br />I have had it over a year now still looks new .<br />I love that you can wash in the washing machine and holds up !!
5.0,These are perfect for long waisted ladies or yoga so your back isn’t showing. When stretching or bending everything is covered. Lots of wiggle room without being baggy. Not an over the ankle to the floor pant. Soft to the touch and on the skin. Nice everyday wear lounger too
5.0,They help keep the feet from sweating so much when wearing muck boots
5.0,so soft
5.0,I finally found a hat that fits my large cranium.  The white front is a bit generic but an artistic Sharpie user can certainly decorate it.  It seems good quality and it's definitely nice not to have to put a hat on the largest setting to get it to kinda' fit.  My next search is for hats this size and proportions with logos I like.
5.0,I read a million reviews on these and decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did. The outfit is super comfortable and fits my 5'3 frame perfectly you can dress these up for an occasion or just lounge around the house in them. Great buy! Will be ordering another color soon!
5.0,I love it. I use it for my cartilage ear piercing at the top of my ear and it's perfect. No more earring backs catching my hair every 10 seconds. It came super fast. I will buy from this company again.
5.0,"Oh man, what a good send. One out of 5 orders on amazon have to be ""ok."" This is 1 I. 50 cause these fit so great and help with self esteem and supportive fit. Being bigger this pregnancy and finally finding something to fit right!? Yes!"
5.0,Very durable and great for the money
5.0,Fits as expected and arrived quickly. Really like them a lot.
5.0,I like it. It's exactly what I expected. I only wear it when i go out with the wifey.
5.0,"Great quality belt, much better then the ones purchased from flea markets (which is where I've always bought the others).  Quality is great and priced about the same as those at flea markets."
5.0,Very nice.u will like this.
5.0,"I got this model after getting one for my son 15 years ago.  I loved it then, and this is the same model at half the cost.<br /><br />Has not disappointed me.  Yes, the bezel scratches easily, but it keeps running, is accurate, and shows me the date at a glance.  I don't like showy watches, and this one is almost unnoticeable, which is the way I like it.<br /><br />Settings may seem a bit odd at first, but the manual is easily found online.  I am so glad that Casio still makes this model.  Am one happy consumer."
5.0,"Love it, but it fits a lil snug if you have hips"
5.0,"If you spend a lot of time outdoors, or just driving long periods of time, you will inevitably get tanned on the arms.  To combat this unnecessary darkening of the skin, I went out and looked for arm sleeves.  I knew they were around for a while, so I looked for something they didn't have before: cut-out for your hand.<br /><br />When you wear these, to get maximum protection, you can insert your fingers through the cut-outs for the hand, and you will be covered all the way til the fingers start, which is a even more protection, yet allows all the movement and sensory required by daily and mundane activities.  So while you go out for a run, you get maximum protection, and when you need to grab that bottle of water, unlike a pair of gloves, your fingers are free and available 100% of the time.<br /><br />Fabric is just thin enough that during my walk, I noticed that they are actually somewhat cooling.  The stitching is fairly well-done.  Size feels like custom made to fit me.<br /><br />If you drive for a living and hate the farmer arm tan, you will love these arm sleeves."
5.0,"This is an excellent hat! Stylish and soft as hell, I get so many compliments on it. I did need to trim some loose black threads from the brim seam on the front, but it was easy to do and I haven’t had a problem since then. Very highly recommend."
5.0,Love this!  Arrived about 3 weeks early too!
5.0,"This dress is sexy, i'm 170lbs and well i'm full figured and ordered this dress in a medium it fits perfectly and i feel sexy in it. Don't mind that it rides up a bit i'm just wear it with stockings. The color is as pictured so i'm very happy."
5.0,Love the euro wallet .I have had many before and the last one just wore out.
5.0,"Beautiful. It is one iof my favorite purchase at Amazon. I recommend it,"
5.0,Love love love these readers!!  They are lightweight but sturdy.  I usually buy readers at the dollar store but these are great quality and the price is right.  I would buy these again in a heartbeat.
5.0,"Well, we absolutely LOVE Stance socks, so of course we knew we couldn't go wrong by ordering these!  Great fit, as expected! We love Stance and we love SF Giants!"
5.0,"I love this Klimt ""Tree of Life"" mask--It is so lavishly detailed and is a perfect print of the original painting.  I so enjoy wearing it.  So many people compliment me on it each time I wear it.  Such a pleasurable face protection!"
5.0,Perfect for what I ordered it for !
5.0,"Awesome product. I got it for my guy because he always wears beanies and listens to his headphones.<br />Now he only has to do one of the two.<br />He could also talk with his phone off of him while just using the beanies Bluetooth to call me, that was neat."
5.0,It was perfect for the occasion.  I received lots of compliments.  Quality material.  Very happy with my purchase!
5.0,"These are great for catching sweat and blocking sun. Unlike some other brands I have purchased, these stretch in both directions and have nicely sewed edges that don't roll up. They are very soft and feel great on your skin. However, it's important to note that these are only one layer so don't meet requirements for other uses."
5.0,Beautiful color. Great keychain
5.0,"Comfortable, affordable and patriotic!"
5.0,"This is a beautiful dress for my granddaughter to be a flower girl in my wedding. She is small, but it only needs minor alterations."
5.0,"Really pretty, I'm 5'7 and it hits at my shins. Perfect over my bathing suit and at the beach. Has a drawstring right under my bust. Very flattering."
5.0,"Nice and lightweight, perfect for summer. Washes well."
5.0,My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this hat. She will not wear the gloves but specifically asks for the hat. She already pulled the bow off but that is an easy fix.
5.0,"All of the other jeep caps say they are for very small heads even if they say one size fits most. I wear 7 5/8 in a fitted hat, and this fits great. It is well made. I guess it will be warm, but it's only Oct1 so no real chance to test for cold. The cuglog tag is dorky but I'll just take the stitches out on that."
5.0,Cute. Good quality. Great gift
5.0,Perfect for watching the old shows
5.0,Can be used for more than a shirt
5.0,Love these sunglasses! So prefect and cute!!
5.0,"This was purchased for my brother in laws birthday gift. Perfect guy gift. My sister said he likes it and needed a new wallet. (What can I say? I guess I pay attention well to details)... I love how this wallet has many options for your cards and such. Also you get the security knowing that it's being blocked by people trying to rip you off if they stand too close. (I always think about that). Better safe, then sorry. I haven't personally held the wallet, because I had it sent to my sister's house who lives out of state. But I'm really glad my brother in law approves. I highly recommend this gift idea."
5.0,"Nice product! Colors are as shown on the picture, materials are not cheap and the price is reasonable. Highly recommended."
5.0,"Inexpensive, perfect for football season."
5.0,"Great Socks , Got Them For My Sister s Christmas Gifts And She Said She Loves Them They Fit Good And She Is A Size Eight Or Nine In Women's. She Said They Are Really Warm And Fuzzy And Definitely Would Buy Some!"
5.0,Perfect fit and well made.
5.0,Wow great hat.  Love it
5.0,"Bought this for my daughter, she loves it."
5.0,Love! Will order from him again!!
5.0,Beautiful design. It's kinda uncomfortable print tho when I wear it. Kinda itchy feeling on chest. And rough on chest.
5.0,"Love this bag! It was exactly what I was looking for. It's not big and bulky but still fits all my stuff. I use it on outings with my toddler. It has many compartments, I can store supply cups in the outside compartments as well."
5.0,All is ok
5.0,Looks great !
5.0,Perfect size for my small nose! And great price.
5.0,"I love these fleece lined leggings.  They are so soft and comfortable.  The fit is perfect.  I'm finding, I don't want to take them off!"
5.0,"I purchased these glasses for my 67 year old red/green colorblind uncle.  They worked wonderfully!  His eyes needed no adjustment period, the glasses worked immediately and the smile on his face seeing these colors for the first time was priceless!  Highly recommend trying these if you are colorblind.  If they do not work for you there is a 60 day money back guarantee.  These glasses are a life changer!!"
5.0,Love this bag.  Just the right size.
5.0,Perfect. No complaints
5.0,Perfectly awesome love the hat
5.0,I have used these for myself and wanted to get some layers for my daughter who rides horses.  It gets cold in her barn during winter riding and these work great along with other layers.
5.0,Arrived quickly.  Very comfortable.  Shipped nicely.
5.0,"I am very pleased with my purchase! This lightweight and comfortable strap hold my reading glasses out of the way, but close to my face for quick use! I am very oleased with the product, the fast shipping and the price!"
5.0,"Nice Watch, I love it. Will definitely recommend."
5.0,the shoes is great.. perfect fit.. much more then i expected.. thank you under armour.. thank you amazon.
5.0,Great dress!!  Particularly at this price.  Order today and you'll be happy.
5.0,"Very nice quality, true to size. Nice product"
5.0,Came in looks great. Well made and Daughter loved it.
5.0,These shorts are so cute and trendy. I am usually a size 4 and ordered the size small. I am 5’9” and they hit my waste perfectly without feeling uncomfortable in the crotch area (y’all girl problems). I will be ordering more colors and styles!
5.0,My dad loves these pants
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE these shorts. I live in Southern California therefore I am constantly wearing shorts. These shorts are so comfortable, and the size is actually the size I always wear. That was refreshing, I'm so tired of ordering 2X clothes and I actually needed to order a 5X from certain companies. These are TRUE TO SIZE, YAY!!!"
5.0,It has become harder to drive at night. It feels as if every car has its hih beams on blinding me. These glasses fit so nicely over my prescription glasses (both pairs I have) and reduce the brightness & glare of oncoming headlights while making everything crystal clear. They are also great for reducing reducing eye fatigue on long trips.
5.0,"I wanted a hemp shirt. The style was secondary.<br /><br />This shirt is about half hemp. I found a 100% hemp shirt on another site. More money for that one, but that'll be my next hemp shirt. This one here was a good starter shirt, though.<br /><br />I wear it now as a base layer. It seems to somewhat share that no-stink quality that other natural materials like merino wool and alpaca have. That surprised me, considering that the other half of the material in the shirt is cotton."
5.0,"Perfect accessory any time of the year for a suit, sports jacket or coat!"
5.0,"Purchased for a UTV trip in SD in November.  That is more of a snowmobiling time and location, but gave these gloves a go none-the-less.  Worked very well on the road with no windshield.  Took them out in the cold (-10 deg F) to scoop snow recently with no issues after 45 min.<br /><br />They are super comfortable on both the in and outside.  Did not test them too much with touch screens, so cannot comment on their ability."
5.0,The shirt fits exactly as a 2X shirt should fit. It feels so good on super soft.I love it and I’m gonna order more
5.0,"I bought this shirt for my son, since he is tall and slim and needs dress shirts. I bought the 14.5 since he wears a small size, even though he is just over six feet tall. The shirt fits very well and I’m sure he will wear it often.<br />The color is bright and vibrant on this shirt. I got the Aqua blue, but I’m sure all of the other colors are just as bright and rich.<br />The fabric is light (65% Polyester / 35% Cotton) and comfortable to wear. The shirt fabric doesn’t rub on the skin or make you itchy, so it is good to wear all day long. You want to look good, but comfort is most important.<br />The shirt is machine wash/dry and low iron, so easy to maintain. Of course, if you use a dry cleaner that is fine, but it is good to know you can just wash normally and not have to spend extra money.<br />The sleeves fit well and it is easy to button and unbutton the shirt. The buttons are sewn on well, too.<br />The shirt collar stays in place very well and overall this shirt looks really nice on. It would be great for casual or dress up occasions.<br /><br />*I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review."
5.0,There is nothing to dislike about this bracelet it is absolutely gorgeous. The way it falls on your hands the way it looks on your hands it's beautiful absolutely beautiful!
5.0,I received this adorable necklace an exchange for my honest review. This arrived is a nice black box to keep it protected and used for storing. The necklace has a beautiful turquoise stone nicely placed within a circle. The chain is a nice length and ensures the necklace sits perfectly. I would wear this with a cute dress or plain shirt and jeans. Perfect add to any jewelry collection. The photos do not do this necklace justice.
5.0,Made my mom happy! Looks nice. Just a bit bigger than what the picture leads you to believe but so worth it.
5.0,These are great! Fits like a glove - my son loved him so much I have to buy a second pair now I had to give them mine.
5.0,"Out of about six pieces of jewelry purchased for Christmas, this was my wife's favorite. Absolutely beautiful. Will buy their jewelry again."
5.0,"I am 5’3 157 lbs, A cup. I got a medium it was a bit too tight. I should have gotten a large but I love the dress, the material is quality. I plan to lose weight so I am still happy with my purchase."
5.0,"Had to watch a you tube video to figure out,but they are great for my 5yr old sneakers. Teachers appreciate them as well ;)"
5.0,Really cute and comfortable...a great fit and I really like the material.  I would buy again!
5.0,"This dress is CUTE and it fits really well! I’m 5’5”, size 20/22, apple shape, large arms, large bust, and I bought XXL skeletons. The material is thin, but it’s also super stretchy. The material skins over my belly, and I love the way it fits. It looks great with or without a crinoline!"
5.0,"This ring looks very unique. It is big and manly, so don't order it if you like medium to small sized rings. It fits as expected. Very happy for what I got for just a few bucks!"
5.0,"A beautiful little set for an excellent price, I got the NOVMAY scarf and hat set for my significant other, and as we are entering December I have found her wearing it every day! It is warm, cozy, soft material that is knit in an attractive pattern that seems to go with just about any of her outfits that she chooses to wear it with. She loves the warmth, and soft nature of it, and even when holding the baby he is playing with it all of the time. A great warm set at a great value, the Novmay hat and scarf bundle will keep you bundled and warm no matter where you live – but it has been perfect for us in the harsh New England environment."
5.0,"Bought these oversized men's sleep pants to have something inexpensive and comfortable to sleep in, PLUS they have POCKETS.!!!! Most women's sleep pants size too snug, and don't have pockets. I wasn't even sure what colors I was going to get. When they arrived,<br />I bought inexpensive large size lady's T-shirts in whatever colors co-ordinated, and TA-DA... comfy, cozy jammies I've been loving at a fraction of the price. :D"
5.0,"Beautiful dress! I’m 5’5” and 110lbs with a large chest. The size small fit perfectly! The black fabric gathers lint easily, that’s my only complaint. It’s so pretty as is, but for my purpose, I shortened and tailored the sleeves, and made a flashier belt! Also purchased a full petticoat for fullness! Perfect for our family photos."
5.0,I saw the notice that it runs very small so I ordered the appropriate size
5.0,"Super cute, great quality and fit perfectly!"
5.0,"Well made, as described! My son absolutely loved it. Perfect length on my 12 yr old."
5.0,Purchased this for the longer chain. Havent worn the others yet. Great quality and it holding up through several wears.
5.0,This the evolution of the watch it is a new breed of watch which companie both world
5.0,A little smaller than expected but still great. Hugs in all the right places for my curvy gals
5.0,Only had it for a couple of weeks but it's made it through a three day rain storm and now 85 degree heat and it works fine.<br />Really like the fabric.. much better than what I had before .
5.0,These masks came in an XL size - was just right for my husbands face.
5.0,Purchased for a DYI spa day party.  So soft and comfy
5.0,"my bf loved the shoes.it looked really good, he hasn't told me and problems of the shoes since Christmas so im guessing its great lol"
5.0,Great hat for my 11 year old kid. Dressing up as Wilbur Wright for school project.
5.0,"They look super adorable, they just run on the bigger side"
5.0,Husband loves it. Good quality.
5.0,Fit well didn't shrink
5.0,To small for the size. I ordered xl. They fit like a large. Maybe they’ll stretch over time?  But super nice quality sock. Ill hand them out in stocking stuffers.
5.0,"Very pretty, good quality for the price."
5.0,"nice replacement, fabric looks really durable"
5.0,These earrings are a good buy for the money. Super cute.
5.0,"Super cute, my toddler loved them"
5.0,Somewhat small and I even sized up one. Still such a pretty silly dress. Thin material- this is more for summer.
5.0,"These are amazing!!!! I was worried about them breaking, but so far so good and I was wearing them as my daily rings."
5.0,fit very well
5.0,"Bought these as a gift for a friend.  They are great - quick service - we'll see how they clean after being used, I hope they don't shrink!"
5.0,"I ordered this three-piece luggage set in Burgundy. It comes with three suitcases which are 20, 24, and 28 inches. They can all be stored inside the largest suitcase when not in use, which is handy in a limited storage environment like a dorm or apartment. The smallest suitcase is an ideal carry on. The handles and wheels all work well and the hard-shell exterior is sturdy while remaining lightweight. The TSA locks (built in!) are easy to use. We have only used these for one trip as of this review, so I don't know about long-term durability, but so far, so good!"
5.0,The socks will be given to the homeless on Christmas.
5.0,"I really like this ring. The band is not too thick so it is comfortable to wear. The stones look nice, and the colors are just as in the picture. Very happy with my purchase!! It is decent quality for the price."
5.0,"This is an amazing belt!  I saw this was being offered at a discount to test and review, when I went to order it though, it kept changing the design on the belt buckle.  The one I originally saw was really nice and sleek looking, but it wasn't an option to buy.  I would take one star off for that, except that when I saw the belt that I ordered for my husband, it was such an expensive looking belt, it came in this brown box that would be great to give as a gift.  He loved the way it looked and tried it on right away.  He's in the process of losing weight too, and this was a size 38, which he thought would be too big for him but it was actually fairly small, so if ordering, I would order a size up.  The belt buckle was very nice and the belt itself is made of very good quality leather.  It looks very expensive and he loves to wear it with all his clothes now.  I ordered the coffee color and it's the darkest color, pretty much looks black which is what I was wanting."
5.0,It's good. I got these for $2 at TJ but sold out.<br />So I bought more. Love these. My stepmom and mom is happy.
5.0,"A previous reviewer was correct, you do have to slide these cuffs on to get them to fit properly.  But they are really cute, and you get a half dozen colors to stack or mix and match with what you're wearing.  Have received lots of compliments on them!  Now I'll be on the hunt for ones a little more dainty for my ears to mix it up!"
5.0,I absolutely love this necklace!!!! It is gorgeous & I have to say the back of the necklace is just as beautiful as the front! I think it is reversible! ♥️😍♥️
5.0,It's cool!
5.0,Very sexy and fit just right 😄
5.0,"These look great, fit great. High quality and easy to wear."
5.0,Just as pictured..Over-priced.
5.0,Beautiful..better than the picture!!!
5.0,It is easy to put on and it covers the back of the watch which I love! I have sensitive skin and it is hard for me to wear watches because the back of the watch would normally break me out. I will buy more colors and i received many compliments.
5.0,I bought these for my 2 year old granddaughter for her beach vacation this summer.  My daughter thought they were super cute and just perfect for walking in sand and the ocean!
5.0,It was perfect! I'm about 5'6&#34; and weigh 200...it was perfect. The tulle and the slip underneath came down past my knees. I will be purchasing in another color!
5.0,These are such great skirts and the shorts underneath are sooooo comfortable. I have bought several other brands and the shorts underneath always seem to be tight fitting.  The design patterns are exactly as seen on the site.  The colors are great.  The small fits perfect. The quality of the material is very good.  I was really impressed so I bought 6 other colors/patterns. I have 5 more in my cart.  These are going to be my new summer wardrobe. Absolutely love them!
5.0,"Teeny tiny - just what I wanted. They do not irritate my skin nor have they turned green like so many inexpensive small earrings. They're great for my 2nd and 3rd ear holes and do not detract from my main pearl or dangle earring. That said, I love them so much, I have started wearing them in all three!"
5.0,I got these for my 9 year old daughter. She loves them and they fit really well. She says they are comfortable and block enough of the brightness.
5.0,Bought this for Norway in winter and really glad I did.  It kept me warm and dries quickly when wet. Ideal for cold and wet conditions
5.0,The fabric is very soft. It fits perfectly. The dress accentuate all my curves.
5.0,"Super cute parasol! It really blocks out the sun, and folds away small enough to put in a small bag. The little strap to hold it closed is a bit flimsy, but it is holding up against windy days. Overall my favorite parasol/umbrella to take due to its cuteness!"
5.0,Quality and comfort!  Definitely Worth the money!
5.0,Got a size larger than my daughter wears and they fit great!
5.0,"This is my perfect back-up umbrella.  Tiny and fits pretty much anywhere I need.  I love it!  It's a nifty thing to carry when it's not yet raining, but forecasted to rain later."
5.0,I love this band. I wear it everyday. I actually replaced the leather band from my Samsung S2 with this one. I think it makes the watch look more stylish
5.0,"I love this top!  It looks great on its own, and with a sweater over it, making it wearable throughout the year.  Shipping was fast, too.  I would definitely buy more of these tops if they were available in other colors/patterns."
5.0,Great color! Like vintage style. Fits great.
5.0,comfortable and great color.
5.0,se ve más pequeño si fuera un talla más pequeño bu
5.0,"Fits great, stylish and comfortable"
5.0,This is beautiful!
5.0,"Purchased for my husband and it loves it ... well, at least as well as one can ""love"" a mask, I suppose.  He says it fits well, adjustable, much more breathable than others he has tried."
5.0,"I love these tanks so much!  I think they are very flattering.  They have a little bit of compression to them, so they're body-hugging and slimming.  Now, they don't have the kind of compression to hold in a lot, so don't expect miracles, but they hold in just enough to make you feel like a slightly slimmer version of yourself.<br /><br />They are not too short.  I hate when shirts are too short and they ride up and the little belly pooch starts to stick out.  These don't do that.  I really like the way the fabric feels on my skin.<br /><br />Now of course, if you're not into body-hugging and are looking for more of a loose fit, these are not what you want.  But I wanted something that made me feel slimmer and a little bit sexy when working out.<br /><br />I've enjoyed them so much I bought a second pack that I wear around the house on hot summer days.  They're so comfortable, I'll wear them to sleep too."
5.0,Very Nice shirt and washable too-!
5.0,"I ordered these earrings and received them within a week, the shipment even included a free gift! These earrings are more appealing in person then they seem in the picture and I am very happy with the product. Will order from them in the future.<br /><br />Thanks"
5.0,Fit perfectly. Very cute.
5.0,GREAT fit! Ended up buying another one in blue!
5.0,"Such a beautiful dress, got it for a wedding, fits perfect, got a size up and I'm glad I did!"
5.0,"Good quality item, fits nicely and doesn't feel tight on me."
5.0,It's so comfy you forget your wearing it
5.0,"This was a gift and the recipient was thrilled.  Her comment - &#34;beautiful, where did you find it?  I love it.&#34; - told us all we wanted to hear."
5.0,Muy juwno
5.0,"Although these day-date watches are not being made anymore, I was able to get this one from new old stock and it works perfectly. It has kept time to within one second per day, and the other functions are working properly."
5.0,"great fit, sizing is accurate, and Beautiful. Thank you"
5.0,Pretty as well I got the set and this is another stand out!  Detailing is one of a kind.
5.0,Great bracelet! I was happily surprised about the quality and detail of the charms and the bracelet itself. Grand-daughter LOVED it.<br />Would highly recommend.
5.0,"Soft quality material, good fit and quite comfortable."
5.0,"These have been a great asset to my accessories. I love using them with my 3/4 off shoulder shirts. I use them quite often, totally recommend them."
5.0,I sent this to a teenage girl and hoped it was exactly like the photo. It was just like the photo. It's thick and very pretty. The necklace is a beautiful blue leather band. Very nice
5.0,"I ordered this belt for my husband who wanted to try the adjustable belts.  Not only did the order arrive promptly, but my husband was very pleased with the belt.  We found that it ran a little shorter than described, but it still fit him.  It is very well made."
5.0,"It runs small, I reordered in a larger size and it fit perfectly."
5.0,It's very comfortable. I can sleep in it & or wear out running errands. Great on cold mornings & nights.
5.0,"These shoes are super cute and comfortable. Perfect little heel height. Great with jeans, skirts or shorts."
5.0,"My husband normally is very picky about the shirts I buy him.  This one he absolutely loves.  In fact, he will wear it, wash it, and wear it again the next day.  Fits perfectly and is very comfortable.  Best birthday gift ever!"
5.0,"Love it, bought more. Sexy, sturdy, amazing price, thick straps, great support, I feel like I'm wearing lingerie from Frederick's. Makes this big boobie Ruby feel sexy and supported in an economical way. I bought the Amazon Basics lacy full coverage panties to wear with it and<br />me-ow."
5.0,Came in a earlier than expected and looks good with soft fabrics
5.0,Gorgeous dress that is a little small so pay attention to the sizing chart. It’s a good resource but we still needed to go up one more size because the front buttons bulged. It was super nice quality though and packaged very well. Highly recommend this item.
5.0,Feel
5.0,Rugged yet classy! Would make any Hollywood welder smile👍
5.0,"Bought it for myself, my daughter ended up loving it so I ordered another!! Recvd it in 2 days both times. And... the price was right !!!"
5.0,I read the reviews that they run a little small.  I usually wear an  8 or 8.5 so I ordered a 9 and the fit worked great.<br />Cute shoe and looked exactly like the picture.
5.0,"I’ve received many compliments when I wear these shoes! And they are pretty comfortable, and I have feet issues!"
5.0,these work great
5.0,These are great quality shoes and look very nice.
5.0,When I put this things on everyone on the field just stares in fear knowing that I have everything I need to destroy everyone on the field . I think it works well for both paintball and airsoft tho I use it for paint ball. Learn how to use the vest tho. Get comfortable with knowing the back slots. Don’t reach for your pod from the top and make your your pods aren’t broken . The Velcro clip will hold the pods just be cautions not to pull out your pods from the lid! It’s not really heavy tbh. Everyone is different but I don’t think it slows me down. It also protects you. You don’t really feel anything aimed for the chest ribs or back. You can get shot in the legs tho. So shop for leg protection as well.
5.0,Theses tank tops are great for working out.  Wear out to the store they wash great . So pick sone up great price's as well.
5.0,Fits Pandora. Arrived on time. Item as advertised.
5.0,Hubby loves it! I bought it because his other one had bad sweat lines from the Texas heat and I thought this one might not do that. I was correct! He has been wearing it for weeks with no issues!
5.0,This is a beautiful little necklace.  Looks great with another piece I already had.  Item was shipped and received very quickly.
5.0,This 100per cent woven Cotten gown is comfortable cool
5.0,Beautiful! But it's a little too small :( better start my diet 😉
5.0,Fit a little large which is exactly what preggo me was looking for
5.0,Love this bag! I use it for a work bag so I would like maybe one more pocket inside but beautiful and durable.
5.0,"Great, fun little watch. It is kinda flimsy though. Well, not the watch itself really, it's more the jumper rings. They come undone after a while so the feather comes off along with the face of the watch. I'm still giving it five stars because the price was reasonable, and it really is a fantastic watch. I hardly ever took it off, I'll probably buy it again!"
5.0,For fun play
5.0,The t-shirts are true to size. They fit my daughter perfectly.
5.0,"El artículo estaba súper padre, colores hermosos y de buen materia, el detalle que le quedo grande a mi hijo, pero acepto,  fue mi error no fijarme que eran tallas para adultos solamente y no para niños..."
5.0,They are excellent! Great choice
5.0,Just what I ordered m
5.0,"recommend , great socks."
5.0,Great dress that can be dressed up or down.
5.0,"The HELLOICE Kobe Black Mamba Necklace is a treasure. Featuring an iced-out design with dozens of sparkling CZ stones and 18K gold, every Kobe Bryant fan should own this special necklace.<br /><br />The photo is intended to showcase the HELLOICE Kobe Black Mamba Necklace. Notice the awesome Black Mamba detailing including hand set stones. Beautiful!  Deep emotions are evoked by HELLOICE’s loving artistry in remembrance of Kobe.  This is truly a necklace that I will always treasure.<br /><br />I highly recommend the HELLOICE Kobe Black Mamba Necklace to everyone."
5.0,High Quality. Fast shipment. Comfortable strap. Light weight. Exactly as described. Very happy with purchase. Thank you.
5.0,True to size and very nice after losing my schnauzer 💜
5.0,I have been looking for a few years for something that not only would help me firm up my belly but also help support my back. Not only does this fit the bill for fitting size wise it does not slip or bunch or move around wearing it. In time as my weight loss progresses I will be getting  a smaller size and turn this one over to my partner or give to someone else who is trying to decrease belly size.
5.0,Love this outfit!!!! Looks so good on!!!! Feels great!!!! Easy to wear!!!!
5.0,Colorful and comfortable. Like these mask holders!
5.0,Wanted a slipper to wear without my feet getting hot.  Perfect & very comfortable!!
5.0,"They're good socks, Brent."
5.0,"I have been wearing glasses for most of my adult life.  I have been searching for a sunglass solution for just as long.  I have had an awesome pair of prescription glasses but in addition to being very expensive they require you to take off one pair of glasses and put on another.  This product is great, no more taking my sunglasses off and wondering where my glasses are!  The case for them is sturdy and easy to keep in the car or my purse.  In addition I love the design, there is no gap where the sun can ""sneak"" in and blind me!  I liked them so much my husband bought a pair.  No, I don't know the seller, I'm just a satisfied customer."
5.0,"I love this dress!!! Fits like a dream, I’m 5’4, a size 16/18 and I don’t look pregnant! Most dresses that have the empire waist can sometimes make a curvier lady such as myself look 6 months pregnant, which I’m not...please never ask, just always assume she isn’t until you hear it out of her mouth. The pockets are deep enough and hit perfectly on my hips, so they are useful instead of annoying. I can not wait to order more colors, I may just live in these this summer and fall ❤️"
5.0,Liked!
5.0,Love these sports bras! So comfortable and fit like a glove. Lots of support. They wash and stay comfortable! Colors are cute and vibrant.
5.0,beautiful necklace fast delivery thank you!
5.0,Better than expected. Will buy more from this seller. Very pleased.
5.0,"Love it, bought another in different color. Fits loose, washes well, pretty."
5.0,"We got our 9 year old son the SyncUp watch from tmobile for Christmas but he didn't like the bands they came with. These bands were compatible and totally changed the look of the watch from being somewhat ""babyish"" to more of a sleek look."
5.0,Great look and fits perfect
5.0,My grandson loved it!  Exactly as described
5.0,This is adorable on my daughter. Very happy with this purchase!!! Fits as expected!
5.0,"Great quality, almost exactly like one I bought from an expensive chain store but a fraction of the price."
5.0,"Very soft, suede-like material. Fits very comfortably around shoulder, has much room in the main compartment and zipper pockets as well as open ones on the inside. I got this one for my mother-in-law and she loves it. She did get it dirty on an outing but it brushed right out thankfully. I would recommend using something like scotch guard to protect it since it is so light in color though. Truly a beautiful, stylish and functional bag! Priced just right. I would definitely recommend it."
5.0,This the way an umbrella should have been designed to begin with. Love it!
5.0,"This is a very nicely designed hat that is not only insanely light, but breathes well and keeps your head cool on hot days. I am a distance runner and use this for running. It works great! It stays cool for quite a while and allows moisture to escape through the clever vent holes. The hat also looks nice and has a handy little zippered slot for cash or a credit card. The orange color on it is a little odd, but not a deal breaker. Other color options of this design would be nice in the future. I still give it 5 stars however because it is very well crafted and does its job well!"
5.0,So cute and comfy! Perfect with jeans or leggings. Glad I got two!!
5.0,"Bottom is a bit small and the top is a bit large, otherwise it fits good enough."
5.0,Got it as a gift for my dad. He loved it
5.0,"(A) Pros:<br />1) Comfortable to wear<br />2) Looks pretty in the sun<br />3) The dress is above the knee<br />4) Good stitching<br />5) Like the color<br />6) You can wear this, with anything or daily wear<br /><br />(B) Cons:<br /> 1) A couple of buttons, was not fully threaded<br /><br />(C) Outline of the Dress<br />1) 100% cotton<br /><br />(D) Images & Video:<br />1) Images: Shows how the dress looks, in the environment<br />2) Video: I'm examining the material<br />3) Note: The writings you see in the images, are my dialects"
5.0,"Comfy for my wife, although it's a bit loose around the thighs"
5.0,"This wonderful wallet has not one slip pocket, nor card pockets, nor change zippered pocket, and the storage inner zipper does not hold your passport as it is too small. I would gladly pay more for this wonderful double kisslock old classic train style wallet, to Urban Expessions, if they would sew in these standard amenities, for this classic wallet. I bought it especially because it is not leather but vegan, in order to save the life of a cow or calf or bull. Thanks again for this wonderful wallet!"
5.0,"Purchased as a birthday gift. Three months later, child still plays with them so masks have proven durable."
5.0,Incredible bang for your buck.
5.0,We needed a quite statement for city council in Dublin. Just what was needed !!
5.0,Great quality hat. Shipped faster than expected.
5.0,I love it for our family. I have a 2015 CBR600RR and had to stop riding unless we had a sitter bc I didn't feel safe with my 9yr and his tiny arms barely holding on. Then we found this!!! We go out riding all the time. He says he loves it now. It's a great feeling to share the love of riding with my kid.
5.0,Good gift idea
5.0,Light weight. Nice fit.
5.0,Is very nice and elegant
5.0,Ordered these in size small for my petite 15 year old daughter. They're cute and comfortable. Fit about like they should

5.0,The product was perfect arrived right on time had no complaints
5.0,good choice
5.0,Hubby loves his long sleeved T-shirt. Comfy and warm. Great gift for a cheesehead!
5.0,"This dress is so beautiful, and it has POCKETS! I’m going to wear this on New Years Eve and I can’t wait, it looks like it’s worth atleast $30 with the quality of it. It’s a very low cut but that’s exactly what I was looking for. I ordered the small, weigh 127 lb, and my boobs are like a 36C if I would take a wild guess."
5.0,Love this dress. It’s so flattering - I reach for it over and over again.
5.0,Very nice material soft and comfy but looks dressy
5.0,This is worth every dollar. It fits nicely and quite sturdy. I bought another colour (the gold frame) and planning to buy more.
5.0,No to bad but my son did have a problem with them fogging up a bit other then that the fit is really good and in low light he could still see.
5.0,Our 4 year old is going to love handing these out to his classmates this christmas!
5.0,Great product and price!
5.0,Got for Mom.Fits great and comfortable.
5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE! These are by far the sturdiest sunglasses I have ever bought. They have a cute rose gold tint when you look out of the lenses. They are super lightweight, and definitely a bargain. For the price I was expecting something flimsy, but I was pleasantly surprised when I got them. Would definitely order them again and highly recommend."
5.0,love this watch band!
5.0,"I love these shoes, I have 6 pairs all size 9, I was at feed mill they had a pair of size 10 I tried them on, the rest is history,I have gave all pairs away except paw print"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:f1c2bb248a46d435674a068d13a04077]] Amazing so many options !<br />Cant wait to use them for the holidays 😍😍😍
5.0,looks great on the charm bracelet
5.0,"Beautiful skirt fits well except the waistline, but I have gained a little so I don’t think it was the designers fault."
5.0,"As an experiment I used this to replace the stinky leather band on my daily-wear work watch. It has been amazingly easy to adjust and clasp and unclasp. No stink, and many positive comments on its appearance."
5.0,Great quality tshirt.
5.0,My husband loves these. They are so comfortable he says.  The sweat band sewen into the liner helps so much when riding with a helmet on. We do about 200 miles when we ride and on a hot day these are great.  And the best thing about them is that they are made in the USA 🇺🇸
5.0,Love these pants. Pockets are just deep enough and they are super comfortable.
5.0,my most favorite hat!
5.0,"Love this!<br /><br />Perfect for fall or cool days. Looks super cute with black leggings and boots even a puffer vest for extra cool days.<br /><br />I like the color, it has specks of other colors so is not solid at all. Looks super cute.<br /><br />Comes with a hood so you can wear it if it start to drizzle or if it's real windy. There's drawstrings on the hood so it can be tightened up if needed.<br /><br />It's long. I like that. Like a mini dress.<br /><br />Has a pocket on the front middle part of the sweater for your sunglasses or phone just be careful because it's a loose pocket.<br /><br />Well made. No loose threads anywhere. Nice even stitching.<br /><br />Comes in a plastic bag with a retail tag so this could be gifted.<br /><br />Love the quality and color. Well made.<br /><br />Sample provided for my evaluation and honest review."
5.0,Good product and excellent quality
5.0,"I received this robe as a gift - in the lavender color.  It is an absolutely lovely, very lightweight robe that is perfect for travel and all but the coldest days.  It flatters every figure, since the double-tie belt (attached inside and outside ties) can be made as tight or loose as you wish.  It is wrinkle-free and lays very nicely on your figure, even after being washed.  I love this robe, and wanted another, but the price has gone up substantially, since the last purchase, and it was only available in two colors.  :-("
5.0,"Very soft and comfortable, bought two more sets in different colors."
5.0,This is the 3rd piece of Serafina Jewelry I have gotten and I love it . I especially love the floating stone in the middle
5.0,I love this costume! Got so many compliments on it and it was so comfortable!
5.0,"LOVE IT!!! It's super loose and comfy- and it looks adorable with a belt or necklace, flats or heels, anything! It's very modest- loose around the waist and hips, ¾ sleeves, and a high (but not choking) neckline. I'm definitely gonna buy more!"
5.0,This is perfect!!  My 3.5yr old granddaughter picked it out to contribute it to her preschool class' dress up corner.
5.0,This outfit is really cute for my almost 2 year old. I got a size 3-4 yrs old since some reviews said it ran small. My son is a 2t and the size was a little big but not too big. He's pretty tall for his age so I'm glad he will be able to grow into it a little and wear it longer throughout the year. I LOVE it!
5.0,"This scarf is pretty, and really soft. The color is exactly what I wanted. It’s decorative but also has the thickness and softness to keep you warm. Not sure about other reviews that said it sheds because I have tested it a bunch of times and there’s nothing that comes off the scarf. It’s oversized in a good what!"
5.0,"Super classy, perfect size.  LOVE it and will use the handbag again."
5.0,"Great dress, very comfortable, will be nice for the derby party and a wedding"
5.0,"I love this piece!! I already had the silver one, so the gold was a must! It's my favorite! Not too big, not too small, but classy and spicy!! I plan to order two more just because I'm afraid I may wear them out!!"
5.0,This shirt is really pretty and really comfortable. It was a little big so I suggest ordering a size down.  I would recommend ordering a large if you normally wear extra-large
5.0,I love this skirt. I wear it all the time. Super comfy.
5.0,My new “go to” dress! Love and got compliments in it at work!
5.0,very comfortable and so cute
5.0,"I love that this pullover hoodie is 100% Merino wool.  I'd much rather wear Merino wool than any other fabric when hiking because Merino wool works well at both warming and cooling which is an issue when walking 4 miles or so at a time.  This pullover feels lightweight.  The sleeves are a bit long on me for they come down to about the middle of my hands but it's easy to simply push them up.  There is a front pocket that's rather like a shirt pocket that's over one side of the bust area.  My rating is 5 stars for a quality pullover that can be layered or worn alone.  Although it's not thick enough for the chilliest weather, I think it's perfect for those days that start chilly and end up warm."
5.0,"Sturdy, best I have ever bought!"
5.0,The quality of these shoes is superb i will be buying more for my little girl. The shoes are very comfortable and versatile. I love how they can be worn in any weather including diff outfits!! Love how my little girl can't take them off easily. Color shown is rose gold.
5.0,Loved the embroidery.  Material felt great.  Got lots of compliments.
5.0,the kids are having fun with the new belts
5.0,Love this band! Super comfy and strong material. Skulls are cute! Lots of compliments!
5.0,Just enough compression. Loved the colored stitching!
5.0,Bought a vest for my husband and did not come with a battery.  This worked great!
5.0,Arrived early in perfect shape. Works wonderfully exactly as described would order again Large is really exlarge
5.0,Looks and feels great. Soft material. Nice tie string. Stretches when needed.
5.0,Perfect for costume!
5.0,My daughter loves them super cute
5.0,I love wearing this mask. Its very soft and fits good. People always compliment it.

5.0,"Completely satisfied with the quality, price, and shipping speed.<br />It is great to find a bundle of 3 shirts. Now my son is set for the remainder of the year!"
5.0,Big and roomy.  Perfect for a beach bag!
5.0,Was amazing
5.0,"For about $11, you can't find a better watch to be honest in my opinion. It's pretty durable and water resistant. I actually bought a second one of these just in case, but the first I purchased 2 years ago is still holding up pretty good."
5.0,"Suave, cómodo, excelente"
5.0,"Very tinny, but cute!<br />They look interesting when you try them on.<br />I like them! ✨<br />Plus, they pass the test - they didn't move during the night. 😄 So not to worry that they could be lost, it's good shape.  👍"
5.0,"This is what I was looking for. A nice looking black hat, not to flashy but not so simple it would be boring. Glad I bought it"
5.0,Arrived on time. Perfect fit. Too cute to be under ugly Christmas sweaters.
5.0,Great glasses love the fit feel and look.
5.0,My husband love the shirt ! The shirt is very soft and can be dressed up or down.
5.0,Definitely not as good as the original keeper  but I have been using it for about a year now it hasn’t ripped and it keeps my shirt in place that’s all I had asked for.  The only con that I will mention is some of the rubber knobs have rubbed off —But that is the reason I bought two!
5.0,everything I expected and a great price.
5.0,"Before I ordered,  I checked their sizing chart and saw that I should order up a size (XXL instead of an XL.) It fit perfectly and was very comfortabe! I felt like it was just a tad too long (I wore it with leggings) but my husband said it looked great! I would order it again in another color."
5.0,I have been very surprised at the quality of this product. I ordered two and was so pleased I ordered two more. I am a violinist and have been giving them to friends and family.  This is after my third order. Still amazed at the quality. Will keep ordering as this has become a staple in my life as a gesture of thanks to the musical people in my life.
5.0,Like the hat but putting the charging plug into the port is a bit tricky because the hole is quite small.  Hat is not stretchy enough
5.0,Bought As a Christmas present. She loves how soft and warm it was.
5.0,Great shirt! High quality.
5.0,"Great looking watch, stylish, keeps good time.  Can't beat the price!"
5.0,Super cute and soft!
5.0,Great value! Great quality. My husband uses these for his running shoes
5.0,"These are really comfortable ankle length bootleg athletic pants!  To me, they are the perfect exercise and casual pants, and could be worn for exercise, or as every day wear.  They are not see through, and are the perfect length.  I usually wear a Women's size 8/10, and the medium size fits perfect.  Not too loose, not too tight.  I'm so glad the sizing is accurate according to US sizes. Go ahead and order your normal size!<br /><br />These leggings are made of cotton and spandex.  The result is a very comfortable pair of pants which are breathable, wick moisture, and wash well.  These look great after being washed, and retain their color and shape.  I also appreciate the wide waistband, which provides a flattering fit for all sizes and shapes. I usually wear ankle length pants from fall through spring, so I will be getting a lot of use out of these.<br /><br />To me, this pair of leggings is unique because it can be worn to exercise in, or worn as every day clothing.  Most leggings are one or the other, but this is the perfect balance of not being too thick, thin, or spandexy.  I exercise a lot, and also wear comfy pants like this around the house  a lot, so I will be getting a lot of use out of these.  I had the opportunity to test out these pants at a discount during a promotion for an honest evaluation.  Honestly, these are my new favorite leggings.  They are great for all seasons, and are very flattering, especially since they aren't made of thin material.  And most importantly, they are very comfortable.  I am impressed with the great quality and fair price as well. I love wearing these around the house, and to run errands."
5.0,Love them!  I would definitely recommend buying them.
5.0,I  love it. Would buy another in the future.
5.0,"Wow, this dress fits great! I was worried when I received it and saw the material, thought that it was thin. However, once it was on it felt pretty thick and not see-through at all. It fits like a glove and really hugs the curves. Also, the material is a bit stretchy so its a very comfortable fit. For $25 it is worth it, I am very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Dress fits true to size and is very classic. Well worth it!
5.0,I love this lapel pin
5.0,I am not one to write reviews (but I will be quick to review them before I purchase a product! terrible isn’t it?) In any case I was a bit skeptical at first. I recently purchased a pair of ColorfulKoala and I was a bit disappointed. (They felt great but were thinner than what I expected. I felt they were more lounging leggings than active legging but I digress) For these leggings to be under $10 the quality really surprised  me. They feel great on and held up great during my morning workout (Sydney Cummings ❤️) I am 5’5 and around 180lbs and the medium fit me fine but a bit long Next time I’ll do the 25 inch inseam. The band did roll down a bit during movement but I think that is because there is no string to make it tight  around the waist. I would highly recommend these to ANYONE AND EVERYONE! For the price you can’t beat and and they are great!
5.0,"Reference I am 5' 5"" usually a 22W.  I ordered the 2x.  It fits well.  Hit a the top of my knees.  I carry my weight in the tummy.  I personally would like it a bit looser but then again I could lose weight to make that happen, so it isn't a manufactures issue!"
5.0,I love all the charms
5.0,This was a gift and was well received.
5.0,Great material and nice socks
5.0,"Very good quality thermal for kids, true to size as I found out,quick responses from customer service."
5.0,Really happy with these!
5.0,This dress is gorgeous.  Very good quality at a great price.
5.0,"I absolutely love these head bows!!! They are perfect and adorable. They also seem to be well made, they came just as pictured!"
5.0,"We have a bed and breakfast and use these for the room keys.  Guests keep stealing them!  Ha Ha, not a problem."
5.0,Loved the fabric and bright color.  It fit perfectly.
5.0,Great Great Great
5.0,Great price! Great hat! My dad loved it for his birthday.
5.0,I love this pendant.  It is exactly like the advertised picture.  I bought it as a gift but I'm tempted to keep it.  It is a real value for the price.
5.0,"Perfect for winter,  warm and fits well for a hat that is ""one size""."
5.0,I really liked this shirt! I’m 5’2” and 100 pounds. The small was great. It’s great with leggings or jeggings. I’d highly recommend this!
5.0,excellent design and material
5.0,Me gusto mucho este producto. Uso estas bolsas para cuando compro vegetales en vez de usar bolsas plásticas. Muy conveniente y son reusables. Son fuertes y vienen en diferentes medidas. Empezar a hacer pequeños cambios y no usar tanta plástico
5.0,Love them. Great gifts.
5.0,These leggings are so soft and comfy!  Highly recommend.
5.0,"Could’ve fit a little hit more nicely, it pretty snug"
5.0,"Sturdy, durable, easy to carry. Fit hubby's HP laptop perfectly with tonssss of room for other things. He uses it as a make shift briefcase with all the space lol. It's great. Wood definitely recommend. No issues so far."
5.0,It’s was so beautiful
5.0,Description is on point
5.0,they are super comfortable kinda off blocky when you first get them but that didn’t take long to get them a little warn in
5.0,"This necklace is exactly as it appears in the photo. I like it very much-lovely colours of lapis, nice weight and comfortably enhances a sweater neckline or low neck top."
5.0,So sweet
5.0,"I got this leggings with special promotion- only $3! So I didn't expect too much.  However,  it feel so soft and so<br /> comfortable!  Pockets both sides are really useful.  It is not really high waist, below the belly bottom.  I have scars from my operation, and leggings are not enough high waist to cover which is ok to me.  Only issue is back is not enough high.  I am so used to wearing high waist leggings and I feel little weird.  I can still wear yor working, yoga and daily uses.  Also the ankle parts  are not hemmed.  I am 5""2 and 110 lbs and  i normally order XS.  Since there is no XS opition, S is perfectly fit.  Not too loose.<br /> As oveall, it is good deal and I am so happy!"
5.0,Beautiful! nice quality and fit. I will order another one with different colors if available
5.0,Cute! wearing with leggins cuz it is too short for me to wear as a dress
5.0,Very boho. Super cute! Loose fitting.  Constantly get compliments on dress! Fits great! Buying more in different colors!!!!
5.0,"Love the look, feels soft and stays in place!"
5.0,Looks exactly like picture display
5.0,Fits my 13 yr old great!! Not much to comply about when we are forced to follow rules.
5.0,Beautiful Sweater
5.0,"These flip flops are made of rubber and do not have water absorbing foam, so they do not stay wet after use in the shower. This is a surprisingly hard feature to find, given that it's the only feature I can really think of for a shower sandal.<br /><br />Five stars."
5.0,Makes my butt look good and is super warm!! Told all my friends and ordered the other color!
5.0,ADORABLE!
5.0,Superb!  Very stylish and classy.  Perfect fit.
5.0,"Beautiful, I love these earrings"
5.0,Best invention ever. My glasses couldn't be adjusted to where they wouldn't fall off my face due to part of the hinge being damaged. And it was no longer under warranty that it could be replaced. Didn't really want to have strings holding my glasses on my face. Found this product and bought a large pack in case I lose one. It is discreet and I don't have to worry about losing my glasses.
5.0,"The Glo Bag is terrific!  My husband gave me one for my birthday and I love it.  I was using a soccer bag for my swim locker, and a large zip bag for the work locker / showers after running. With those bags, I had to jam them into the locker sideways. And, then try and unwedge them after my workout. The Glo bag fits in a locker upright, and has a front, full zipper for complete access to the contents of the bag (without removing it from the locker).<br /><br />With the Glo bag, your shoes, clothes, and toiletries stay separated and organized.  The designers have thought about everything with the Glo bag.  At the back, bottom section of the bag, there are screened-grommets/air vents, so I place my shower flip flops at the bottom and they dry out due to the vents.  And, there is a top handle and backpack straps.  I wasn't sure if I needed the backpack straps, but it turns out that I use them most of the time when transporting the bag to and from the car.<br /><br />There are pockets on the exterior of the bag for organizing.  Plus, the Glo bag comes with a toiletry bag and a large zippered bag for wet items (I use the large zippered bag for my work clothes).  I also got a Glo water bottle!<br /><br />The bag is large enough to hold shower shoes, toiletries, a large towel, change of clothes, and running shoes.  For swimmers, you'll need to carry your swim fins and pull buoys in a separate mesh bag.  But, it is better to keep those items in a separate bag anyway -- plus, when you head to the pool, you take those items with you (they don't go in the locker).<br /><br />I highly recommend this bag.  The design is great and the quality is good."
5.0,"Very cute watch. Slip knot closure, so it's easy to get on and off."
5.0,So worth it!! Bought an expensive pair and they tore easy!! These are tough - held up to my 8 year old!!!
5.0,I think this is Beautiful! And very true ! I can't express what this means to me.. I lost my Mom recently and wearing this makes me feel close to her..❤
5.0,Love the saying.
5.0,Very pretty. I love them
5.0,"Super cute!  Fits perfectly!  I'm 5'11&#34; and am always worried about length when buying dresses online, but this one is perfect!  I love the style, shape, cut and POCKETS!  I teach so I am always in need of pockets!  It's an adorable dress for the summer and will also work for the fall with a sweater.  I love it!"
5.0,It is a very good quality suitcase and light so easy to carry for my son. The handle is not the best for his little hand though but he loves it. The size is perfect.
5.0,"Fits great, light weight. Would purchase another color for sure."
5.0,"I absolutely loved this product. Perfect for a casual day or a workout. I am 5'6, 165 and 38b and i got a size L and it fit perfect it really gives a nice form to your body. The material is strechy and very comfy. I'm very satisfied with my product."
5.0,Fits and works perfect.
5.0,..... you get what you pay for.Good stuff.
5.0,Just what I was looking for.  I use this for my Surface Pro 6.
5.0,Made with quality materials. Fits perfectly and looks great.
5.0,"These cotton bags are the perfect way to start going green. They are extremely durable, easy to clean, and slightly larger than the standard plastic grocery bag. And not to mention they are very affordable!"
5.0,ordered them previously and had to return the UK size 8.  size 10 fit a size 10.  They run very narrow but her foot is very narrow.  she is delighted with the boots for a late Christmas present!
5.0,"Love it. Very flattering. Very nice material. Seems like it will last forever. Not see through at all. It’s hard for me to find tanks that are flattering that fit because I have big boobs, 38DD. I’d order this in a couple more colors!"
5.0,"Shoes runs small needs to or,der a size up USA SIZE"
5.0,"Great basic accessory which suits any style of the outfit. Very trendy these days. Can be combined with other necklaces. My personal preference is to make it shorter, but it’s not critical. I liked the original box it came in and instructions how to clean sterling silver. Thank you for it. Overall the product is great looking, lightweight and exceptionally good quality."
5.0,"I love the material. Not flimsy, hugs curves in the right places without being too tight"
5.0,"I love this dress. It fits true to size, comes in at just the right point (right under the bust) and doesn’t make you look chubby or is not form fitting. This dress is a perfect fit, thinking about ordering a couple other colors!"
5.0,Durable and beautiful enough to wear everyday. I Recommend!
5.0,"Perfect fit, material & on time"
5.0,Great fit and style! I wish the material was softer-other than that it is pretty much perfect.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:9bcfd8e2c188eef05403fe50c60d8db5]]
5.0,"soft, comfy"
5.0,"These are great quality, comfy shirts that fit perfectly. They are very flattering the way they hug without bagging around the waist or coming in too tight in weird places. I like the colors and material, which reduce the appearance of sweat."
5.0,"I love this piece. The color is very pretty and the material soft and comfortable. I'm 5'7 and it hit me just right, not to short, not to long.  I plan to buy another one in a different color. You can dress this up or wear casually."
5.0,"Good fit, almost as comfortable as my Oakley fives. Great polarized hunting sunglass, especially for the price. The case is an added bonus to keep them from getting scratched in my hunting bag."
5.0,I got the navy and it's beautiful. I have several sleeveless dress which are great until you go into a restaurant and the ac is blowing on you. This shrug is just right for keeping my shoulders and neck from getting chilled. I'm usually a size 12/14 (at least on my top half) and this fit perfectly.
5.0,"This blanket is comfortable, very soft and warm.  Have washed and dried twice so far and has held up well."
5.0,cute colors. breathable mask. I wear it to lacrosse practice and they work real good.
5.0,I bought two watch bands on Amazon for my Tissot watch. One an alligator grain in brown and this one. I tried the alligator grain brown one first - and it was just ridiculously stiff and looked more like a bracelet than a watch band. It was clearly uncomfortable as well.<br /><br />I then switched it with this Alpine one in black. I am impressed. Size was perfect for the closed loop Tissot latch and it was much softer and more comfortable. It also wore better and looked a million times better with a snug fit. You want to wear a band that looks good and wears comfortably.<br /><br />My wife also did the “smell” test and this watch band is almost all real leather. The other band only had a faint smell as it was probably made of more man made materials - than actual leather. The softness and fit is excellent. Great value for the price.
5.0,Beautiful scarves - and perfect Christmas gifts for the cold weather.
5.0,"I think this key chain would make a great gift for that someone you don't know that well, or someone who has everything. This is a really nice keychain with the saying Stand tall wear a crown and be sweet on the inside. It is stainless steel so fingerprints do show on this, and it is on the smaller size for the price. It is just really classy and makes me smile when I see it."
5.0,There just what no whated!
5.0,I’m a bigger girl and it was super flattering.
5.0,Ordered one size up and it's perfect!
5.0,"comfortable, great fit"
5.0,I saw some negative reviews about this product and I can say I certainly Do Not agree.  These cuff links are the awesome... Sturdy and great attention to detail.  Maybe they will last a life time maybe not.  But I am enjoying them while they last
5.0,Quality product! A repeat customer.
5.0,"I just got this today so this could change. This came true to size. I think it’s pretty overall. It sparkles just fine. The profile is low, so even though it’s larger, it looks believable."
5.0,"Great, warm and true to size my husband loves it. Keeps him warm when he goes out to have a cig on chilly mornings."
5.0,"Sweats are great, good quality, true to size, very comfortable."
5.0,love them wish i could get new ones
5.0,"They look fashionable and compress providing stabilization when on your feet all day long.<br />I am wearing a small with shoe size 8 and they fit correctly.<br />Will buy more, also for using it at the gym!"
5.0,"I didn't think that I would like this tip after ordering it.  but, once it arrived I was pleasantly pleased!  I think that I will order other colors, because it is so comfy and soft!"
5.0,Gala event which was inter galactic
5.0,"A little large for my small bean of a head, but cute and great that they have buttons to hold my masks all day.  They save my ears!  I’m looking forward to using daily.  Company offers to send an additional free hat too if you e-mail them!  Bonus!"
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for. Pendant is just the right size, not too big not too small, and came with a great chain. I get compliments all the time!"
5.0,Good quality and size.
5.0,"I returned this item as the side pouch was  for carrying an ambrella, not a water bottle. The Bag<br />is of good quality and would be a good  fit  if you need a small bag without a side area for a water bottle."
5.0,"the fabric has an expensive 'hand' and the fit is excellent! Extremely comfortable, no wrinkles...sure wish there were more colors to choose from! I would buy them all!"
5.0,Cute shirt. My dad wore a blue crush velvet tux in his wedding so this was perfect gift for him at my wedding. Not the softest material but fit nicely
5.0,Perfect fit! Absolutely beautiful.
5.0,"Very nice detail and fabric. Warm, fits exactly how I thought. It will shrink up a good half size near a whole size. So but one size bigger!<br />The color is very accurate to the picture."
5.0,Love the shirt! Very colorful and bright! Can't wait to wear it.
5.0,They r the best I have seen. So beautiful on my sweetheart.
5.0,This purchase DID NOT come with the shield/plate for the Apple Watch - you must buy it separately
5.0,"Love this product.  Gentle on jewelry, but tough on tarnished silver.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has sterling silver."
5.0,I was surprised by how comfortable it is being a bra with high support.
5.0,Visually beautiful! A conversation piece!
5.0,So beautiful
5.0,Glad they are bigger so my 2 year old can grow into them. Great sandals!
5.0,"Great for the price, more of a choir dress than a nice dinner dress."
5.0,My son wore these to the prom.  They are beautiful and a unique design.  He will surely enjoy them for many years.
5.0,Excellent item. Case look great and very functional
5.0,as discribed an well made
5.0,"Been wearing this consistently, not once taking it out, for months. I've had no irritation and seen no tarnish. Still shiny, gem still sparkles. Very happy with it, especially for the price."
5.0,great warm jacket that keeps you dry and visible on the roadways
5.0,Perfect!  The color is really pretty and does not look cheap.
5.0,"The leather ends and excellent seat belt material are what I'd expected for this strap, but the best selling point was the non-metal adjustment buckle. Switching between guitars with different tunings during a performance, I don't want to scratch or dent my valuable instruments during the transition, and that extra small bit of insurance that a moment of clumsiness won't cause damage is worth the price."
5.0,Live my shirt!
5.0,Great tshirt! And nice fit and material also.
5.0,"Fit great and were comfortable. No cutting into my ankle, squeezing my toes, or slipping off"
5.0,Works very well with no issues.
5.0,Great turnaround time the shirts are perfect for baseball season
5.0,"Excellent! I love it, it fits great, the color is great and I received tons of compliments!"
5.0,"Essential item for daily life, I am fully satisfied with the purchase"
5.0,Awesome deal/ everyone at work wants them now! so pretty
5.0,"This is purty darn nice. Quite nice, actually. The sapphire is a dark blue but you can clearly see it's blue. Too often, sapphires tend to be almost black. The chains is thin but seems sturdier than the usual functional type that get sold and has a very nice feel to it. This will look really good with sweaters. I hope to get the ruby one soon."
5.0,Very nice Happy with the product
5.0,My wife absolutely loves these sports bras. They are super comfortable. And they have the right amount of support.
5.0,Nice Sturdy and structured Bag. Holds Everything. Great.
5.0,"Love this purse. It looks great, can be worn multiple ways and doubles as a wallet.  The charging aspect is wonderful. Wish it came in multiple colors."
5.0,I love my fossil band. It's easy to move the extra links. It's comfortable and it's SHINY!!
5.0,"Love, love. Many compliments"
5.0,"WOW!!! This is a great bag. I am 5'9&quot; and about 205 pounds and this bag EASILY fits 5 sets of my clothes, underwear, socks, toiletries, AND (most impressively) my size 12 shoes in the side pocket. VERY Pleased with this bag."
5.0,"This dress is the perfect size, shape, pattern, and very flattering. I have many designs, but this is my favorite."
5.0,Oh my goodness. This is one of my favorites and it’s quite different. What a find for my jewelry collection
5.0,Couldn't believe how nice these looked when I tried them on. I have a round face and the rectangular frames balanced it well. The arms extend out as well so less worry of them breaking. Shipping was a bit longer than expected so order early if you need them by a certain time. Otherwise quality glasses and great price!
5.0,"Soft, comfy & sexy! I was worried about it not covering my large rump after reading reviews and was happy to see that it does cover all of the essentials.  The color said pink, but it looks more peach/ coral to me (which better suits my taste anyway). I love the shade,  but it's worth mentioning if you are expecting a traditional light/ soft shade of pink.<br /><br />Recommendation: size up. I am 5'3"" with a ""thick"" frame. I ordered an XL, L/M would have been too small."
5.0,The product was purchased for my grand daughters birthday<br />She loved it
5.0,"The color isnt really red but it is painted well with some detail imperfections, so I spray painted mine, I plan to go back and add more detail. That shouldnt stop you from purchasing because it gives you a foundation to work with, it is a tight to get on and off but I plan to make some minor adjustments, but I am also 5'10&#34; about 220 pounds and I have a big brain. I still like this helmet though adding to my collection!"
5.0,want to by more love it
5.0,"This is absolutely adorable, soft, comfy and high quality."
5.0,Very pretty and inexpensive earrings that look expensive.  Perfect size.
5.0,"I bought this for my 20 month old son with not much hopes considering it was so inexpensive however, I have fallen in love with this! He gets so many compliments, and it really does look so stinking cute! The shirt didn't shrink when washed, which is a major bonus point for this momma. And both the shirt and the shorts are interchangeable so that you can mix and match with other clothes if you choose to do so. The material of the shorts make it very cool for this summer weather, and the shirt is very breathable as it's thin. Definitely happy with this purchase"
5.0,Beautiful necklace for end of school year gift
5.0,I liked it so much that I ordered second one for my brother.<br />I recommend it to all watch collectors
5.0,I liked the gloves because they will protect my hands from the sun... Fit very good.
5.0,cuuuter than buttons! ;)
5.0,Came fast and are great.
5.0,Super cute & lightweight!
5.0,"With these green earrings I now have red, white and green bows to wear at Christmas time.  The size is just right and easy to be seen without being &#34;big.&#34;"
5.0,Perfect fit!  I'm 5'7&#34; and love the fit - hits the ground when i stand still.  Excellent quality.
5.0,I have these with silver mirror lenses and I must say for inexpensive sunglasses these feel really nice. They are very light weight yet sturdy and have little details that I find attractive such as little metal B insignias on the end of each arm.  These were a gift but I would not hesitate to buy another pair.
5.0,My 9 year old grandson loves soccer.  He loved this!!
5.0,"Wears well and keeps its shape, quality product... Thanks!"
5.0,Well made set! Much higher quality than I expected for the price! Beautiful set!

5.0,Just what I wanted! Madd my watch more comfortable.
5.0,"My search for a comfortable hipster is over, these are wonderful! No adjustments needed with a whole day of wear. I will definitely buy these again."
5.0,"Very warm Hoodie and comparable to car hart but less expensive. Work construction and go through a lot of these and so far it's holding up great.  Only negative is that the hood string does not have a channel it's strung through, so it falls back into the hood."
5.0,I feel special when I wear this necklace.
5.0,"Packaged perfectly and trees arrived very healthy, will be ordering all of my trees from this nursery."
5.0,Cute! I love 💕 these glasses. FYI I am over 50 and I don’t feel like they make me look ‘older’.  I feel these are excellent quality and very stylish.  I can pair the readers with many of my work outfits and not feel “aged”.  I plan on buying a 2nd pair😃

5.0,I love it. Fits perfect and looks great. I'm going to another one in different colors.
5.0,Looks great. Happy with purchase.
5.0,"Amazing dress. So beautiful 😍. I wish it came in more prints and colors. It fit as expected according to measurements. The top is not a stretchy type of material, so the fit will be unforgiving for someone who is even one inch larger than the listed measurements for a particular size."
5.0,Stance socks are the best
5.0,I get lots of compliments.  use it as my work bag. zips easily and is comfortable on the shoulder
5.0,Bottom is narrow just Fyi

5.0,Perfect 100 % Satisfied
5.0,"good price, nice color !"
5.0,"For the money you're putting in, definitely getting more than your money's worth in these glasses. Look and feel good, have held up for a few months so far, worthy of an alternative to more expensive pairs."
5.0,"Love it, very comfy and looks classy"
5.0,"These are the perfect size for a tragus piercing. After years of wrestling the backing out of the way when putting in earbuds, I decided to buy much shorter studs and see how they worked. They are a bit tough to put in without a mirror and/or someone to help you. At first I didn't think the back would be long enough, but once on they are the perfect length."
5.0,VERY Comfortable. Love them.
5.0,"Love the size, and fits great on my shoulder."
5.0,Great little purse for my 6 year old daughter!
5.0,Good bands. I wear them for soccer every week.
5.0,"Great dress!  Can be dressed up or down, worn alone or with leggings/jeans, and with chunky sandals or heels/booties. Comfortable material that fits well, so it’s a great buy for the price.  I am 5’6” and 121 lbs  and purchased a small (dark purple) which fits and sits perfectly. Would definitely purchase in another color should an occasion arise."
5.0,"Very pretty and good quality, will order another pair in a different color"
5.0,I love it very much but it was way to small even though I ordered a size up
5.0,This bracelet is so dainty and adorable! It is a Christmas present for my daughter and I just know she is going to love it!
5.0,perfect for my trip to Canada
5.0,"snug on the hands, but I hope that means they won't come off!"
5.0,"I love my clear bag.Just what I need for work.Very lage, holds everything I need.I think that this was a very wise purchase for me."
5.0,"LOVE THEM! I got them when there was a deal for 50% off so I decided to get them because I needed a slip on sandal. I will be ordering more pairs. The comfiest, softest slide in sandal ever. I am usually a 9.5 but ordered the 10.5 and it fit perfectly. I would say to order up a size."
5.0,"I love these headbands. My 5 month old and 2 yr old both wear these comfortably. And apparently they wash well too! One of them must have been stuck in a shirt when I did laundry, as I found one when I was emptying the dryer. And it held up suprisingly well!"
5.0,"So far my son loved it.lights worked properly i had no need to charge the shoes both of them turned on perfectly fine...at first i was hesitant about buying this product because a lot of reviews said they had issues with the lights turning on. So far everything works great, it comes with a charger and two small remotes. Good purchase i'm satisfied"
5.0,Beautiful perfect fit & great quality
5.0,These sunglasses were nice quality and worn around the pool the whole weekend!
5.0,Bought these as a gift and they were priced right !  It's a keeper!
5.0,This cord is great I use it for necklaces and can't beat the price!
5.0,"I loved the texture, this are great"
5.0,was a great gift and the price was great.
5.0,"The quality in the fabric is really good, I’d say is really good to wear in chilly days and probably sunny days because the fabric is not so thick nor too thin. I’m loving it already as a women I find it hard to find a legging that doesn’t push your butt in and that it is not see through!!<br />I love the color  and the way it fits in me!<br />Thank you!!"
5.0,Great love them still holding up perfect
5.0,Comfortable and warm. These mocs really keep my aging feet from hurting and getting cold when I'm hanging around the house.
5.0,"I really like this sweater! The colors are very pretty. The description is ""dark red,"" but the darker color is a purplish-maroon, then a lavender , dark grey , and the top third-ish is white. It's a thinner sweater material, but it's warm. The white isn't very see-through, but I probably wouldn't wear a bright red bra under it... It runs true to size, maybe a tiny bit big.<br />I definitely like it and might get it in another color as well."
5.0,Love the watch. I wear it every day.
5.0,I bought this for my granddaughter when her father died. She wears it most of the time so I do get to see it from time to time. That has been a year and a half ago and it still beautiful.
5.0,I got this for my best friend and she loved it! It came out the way it is shown.

5.0,I LOVE this top! Super cute and comfy! Fits great on all the right places!
5.0,I gifted this necklace to my granddaughter and she loved it!
5.0,"This cropped hoodie is as cute as it gets! I use this for dance, but it also works fine for athletics, or even with a pair of jeans for going out. Super cute, nice fit, I love it! Photo shows size medium—I went down with sizing (I’m between medium and large for tops) and the large was a little baggy for me. It’s whatever you prefer, but if you’re between sizes, you can go either way depending on what you like."
5.0,This is exactly as advertised. It’s beautiful and thick also. It will definitely keep my husband warm when it’s worn.
5.0,Me lo regalé yo☺️
5.0,Awesone little necklace. Cant beat the price and quality is pretty good
5.0,"The craftsmanship is very pretty.  Cloisonne with rose gold, crystals, and silver filigree.  Large elegant ring.  The opal appears to be man made, but I don't know for sure.  Even if it is man-made opal, it's very lovely.<br /><br />I've bought 3 of these so far.  My goal is to buy matching rings for my mother and me.<br /><br />They sent a size 10 instead of a size 8.  I'm saving the size 10 to give as a gift.<br /><br />My size 9 ring is a bit too big for my liking although it slides over the knuckle like it should.  However, I was able to modify it with a 1/4 inch piece of skinny silicone ring adjuster coil that I bought on Amazon.<br /><br />So, I ordered a size 6 which fits my mom's ring finger perfectly.  She's tickled pink.<br /><br />We both love the rings.  Now we have rings to wear with our genuine opal and rose gold bracelets."
5.0,Light weight with pocket! Very comfortable!<br />Love it!!
5.0,"very comfortable to wear, Im claustrophobic and asthmatic so wearing the shield was tough for me but with the goggles and a mask was much better"
5.0,Sending kids to Disneyland for Christmas. Putting tickets andothergiftsithebags

5.0,I bought these as a gift.  I'm reordering for myself!
5.0,"I was looking for stainless steel or surgical steel earrings that I could sleep in, shower in, and that could be dressed up or down. These are perfect! They match my belly button rings from a different seller perfectly; same exact colors too!"
5.0,I like how it fits shows my traps and shoulders when I work out material doesnt stick to u on hard workout
5.0,I just love these dresses. They’re so beautiful and I get so many compliments when I wear them. I have 2 different colors and styles right now and just ordered a third. I like that they’re a modest length and not too revealing. I can wear them to work for special occasions. The lace isn’t as delicate as one might think either. It’s pretty sturdy lace and can be washed nicely on gentle cycle. I’m also not afraid of the lace catching on every little thing. I can add a belt and it looks nice. The dress has some give to it so I can move about comfortably. All the designs are beautiful and I’m so glad they add new styles frequently. It’s a classic look for anyone and a wardrobe staple. Highly recommend!
5.0,Wore it to awards night! Lots of compliments!
5.0,Service was as promised. Very good product. GOD bless you.

5.0,"A little small for d cup, but they stayed put all night!"
5.0,These shoes are gorgeous and fit perfectly on me.  I bought both these and the black ones and I'm seriously in love with both pairs.
5.0,72 inch lacing is a little long but the way that these laces are made they can be shortened easily but with the Rocky SV2 boots 72 inch is what they call for. Quick shipping and very reasonably priced.
5.0,Super cute. My sister loved it
5.0,"I’m giving this to my niece along with cash.  Got it in the mail and it is very nice.  It comes with care instructions that I’m going to print off and put in the box.  The quality is very nice and the box it came in is very presentable!  If we have problems I’ll be back on here but loving what I received, cannot wait to gift it!"

5.0,So far very nice  I enjoy very easy to read
5.0,Purchased to give to a friend .
5.0,Have been wearing it whenever I am out in the sun.  Works great!  Easy to keep on and comfortable also..
5.0,"Es una cadena linda, delicada y justo lo que buscaba!"
5.0,Everyone loves it!
5.0,"This dress is like a second skin. So comfortable, effortless, and flattering. The print is really fun and the fabric is wrinkle resistant, which means you can wear it right ou it of the package. I'll definitely be buying more."
5.0,I like this product.  It’s for a upcoming event.  Perfect 👌🏽
5.0,Fun pants for the beach!’
5.0,These are gorgeous! The color choices and sparkles are so beautiful

5.0,"Es práctico, fácil de usar y cómodo. Lo uso como complemento de mi ropa de trabajo. Gracias"
5.0,"Material feels thin, but it works fantastic. My ears stayed warm riding with just the cap down to 10 F.<br /><br />I think the design allows for room at the ears on purpose. But I wish the ear flaps were more fit to the skull in stead of bowing out. But my head is small, so it is probably just me."
5.0,"I have these earrings in today.  I always get compliments on these.  The rose gold is beautiful.  For me, it gives it a more classy look.  The size of each earring is ... hmmm... a bigger than a pea sized.  So, if you are looking for a simple pair of earrings, this is not them.  These bring ATTENTION to your ears.  They are great.  I love them."
5.0,"If you are questioning this. Don't!! I squealed with excitement when I opened my bag. This is the cutest damn thing ever. It's definitely a mini back pack, but it's the perfect size for like a wallet, keys, compostition book sized notebook, tablet, makeup bag, snacks. Pretty much everything. I am posting a photo of the front pocket open, the large pocket open, the matching wallet inside it. Hope this helps anyone stuck like I was!"
5.0,"This band is beautiful on the galaxy rosegold watch. Thought it might be bulky, but is quite comfortable."
5.0,runs small order a half size bigger
5.0,Fit perfectly and very light. Will be perfect for summer
5.0,"I love this jacket, ordered a small on scottevest, it fit but when I started to put things in the pockets they started to make the jacket a little tight, so I went with the next size up. Ordered it through amazon and go it a few days later. Thought it was a little big but when I started to put my items in the jacket everything fit without looking like I had anything in the jacket. Love the conceal carry pockets on both sides of the jacket. The only things that I would suggest to Scottevest is to make the waist line of the jacket elastic and to make it waterproof. This jacket is  very warm and windproof plus you can remove the sleeves to wear it like a vest."
5.0,"Perfect for what I was looking for! I tend to use the crossbody strap so I can be hands-free, but I do like the fun, short strap that came with it. I like the little wristlet that came with it, and I use it for my keys do I always know where they are. This works for me!"
5.0,My fiancée loves this purse/hand bag very much!!!!!
5.0,Very good product. It attaches to the pants very good. Thick fabric. They are also flexible to adjust according to the size of your kid.
5.0,Beautiful! A little daintier than I expected.

5.0,Beautiful cover up

5.0,Super cute and top is like a wide band of scrunchyness but can be worn as top and skirt cause of it light weight fabric not see through absolutely love it and versatile length can be adjusted to preference
5.0,"Very nice sweatshirt, I’d compare it to Champion (for less $)! I bought it for a friend, guessing his size: it looks great, he loves it! Speedy shipping, great seller!"
5.0,This dress superseded my expectations.  It is a beautiful color and excellent quality.  I've worn it twice and have received the most compliments.
5.0,Vibrant colors. Soft material and not thin. Very happy!
5.0,Super cute. Great quality for the price.

5.0,This bracelet is Awsome nice and wide well made. Thanks amazon
5.0,"This is a great looking small billfold. Easy to use, has all the compartments I need. I love it!"
5.0,"These slippers are very comfortable.  I would order the next size up if you prefer to wear a thicker sock with them, as they ""just fit"" & it's unknown if they will stretch with wear. They are well-made & have a rubber sole with a thick fluffy cuff!💞"
5.0,"This dress is made very well, it is thick enough that you do not see through it and very stretchy and flattering!"
5.0,Awesome color! I didn't want an ordinary Coach and this is Not!
5.0,These were purchased for my husband. Upon opening the package I could tell they were excellent quality. My husband is very happy with them and says they are very comfortable and incredibly soft!

5.0,It worked great on my steel toe Red Wing work boots!
5.0,"I have a love/hate relationship with leather wallets.. I do my best to avoid a leather wallet if possible because they generally are not as durable when it comes to outdoor activities etc. The one thing that leather does have going for it though is that it doesn't feel cheap. That's something I have had a hard time finding in an alternative material. So I've been carrying a leather wallet because of this. I was skeptical of the RFF wallets because I thought they would feel cheap. However, I decided to give them a try and I'm glad that I did. The wallet is stiff and has rigidity. This makes the wallet have a premium feel to it. I was concerned that it wouldn't but after getting it in hand I was shocked at how nice it felt.<br /><br />Most minimalist wallets are too minimal in that there is no where to store a bill and the ones that due add bulk that is usually unnecessary. Jake got his design right with the cash strap. I don't carry a lot of cash but I like to have some emergency bills on me though and this wallet allows that with it's clever design.<br /><br />Overall I'm very impressed with this wallet. Kudos Jake and Recycled Fire Fighter!"
5.0,I use these as chemo caps and they are great. Lightweight and very comfortable. They are really well made too. I will definitely buy from this vendor again and I love that they’re a small business. Packaging was great and I loved the personal touch.
5.0,"Love this, got a lot of compliments. Soft and wears well."
5.0,Order up one size. I love it
5.0,Husband commented on it and he never notices anything.
5.0,"Bought this for my wife since she’s a big Harry Potter fan (books and the movies) She loves that they’re wood and that they’re extremely comfortable, wears them all the time :)"
5.0,"Once the problem with the size was worked out, the shirt looks good and feels good."
5.0,Usually buy a medium or large and bought the S/M in this...fits perfectly! It’s supposed to be a little oversized. Love this sweater and was impressed with the quality...especially for the price!
5.0,"I wanted a nice pair of dress slacks.  They fit good and are very comfortable, and they wash up nicely too!"
5.0,Perfect. Worked well on a 16 inch chain I have. Highly recommend these little chains to anyone.
5.0,Bought as a fathers day gift for my dad.  He loved it.  Thank you for the prompt shipping.
5.0,My daughter loves these pjs! She wants to wear them every night!
5.0,"Los lentes me parecieron excelentes, se ven de buena calidad y lucen muy bien, me gustaron muchísimo"
5.0,I wear a womens size 9 and it was perfect.  Might not have worked for a smaller shoe size
5.0,I absolutely love this dress. I received so many compliments! I’m going to order it in every color. I’m 5’4 180lbs and I ordered a large. I still had some wiggle room in my dress which I loved! Girl buy this dress you’ll love it!
5.0,They are great quality and look good on
5.0,Feels like real leather.
5.0,"I am 5'4&quot;, 165 lbs, 34DDD, 42&quot; hip, and 27&quot; waist. I ordered this dress in a small. While I did find me to be adjusting my cleavage, I would not have gotten a different size. I would recommend shape wear with this dress if you care about lumps and bumps showing through. I did not wear any shape wear and I felt comfortable."
5.0,"I love these. They have a silky feel, a true high waist & a chic classic look to them. Great flexibility of dressing up or down. I am only 5’ tall so they are not a cropped length on me but I definitely expected that. I followed the provided size chart & ordered an XL for my 40” hips. The XL fits like a glove. I typically wear medium so definitely pay attention to the size chart measurements for this one."
5.0,"Love these so much, I got them in 3 colors! Practical, comfy, business casual and help to keep me warm in an overly air-conditioned office."
5.0,Fast ship and looks great!
5.0,Love the hat and mittens. My baby is 6 months and 18lbs so they hat fits just right with a little extra room. I will definitely be getting a bigger size but for now it will do. She looks adorable in this.
5.0,I'd suggest sizing up; they are more fitted than joggers. I'm usually a Medium and ordered a Large. Super comfy. Nice material - more of a silky material. I can see myself wearing often!
5.0,Super pleased with this tankini top. Love the optional strap. Fits true to size. I love it!
5.0,My husband loves these no show socks
5.0,Not too loose and not too tight.  Held my thick sweater sleeve up all night!
5.0,"Very cute top. The fabric is soft and very nice. It's not too sheer, and works very nicely as an exercise top."
5.0,outstanding looking good
5.0,"They are soo stylish, and conform to the shape of your fingers and hands. You can see the quality just by looking at them. They came packaged soo well."
5.0,"These Tanzanite earrings will go perfectly with my necklace, rings, and necklace.  The light blue color is stunning; these earrings will complement any outfit.  I shall wear them proudly."
5.0,I LOve this bodysuit. It smooths out my mommy tummy & tucks all of my extra bits in.
5.0,"I could not be more pleased with this hat. I gambled on the sizing (used Tilley sizing chart) and picked 7 and 3/4. I have a large head and measured at 7 and 1/2 but based on reviews went a few sizes up (placed a two fingers under tape measure to make sure it would not be too snug). It fits perfectly (even when biking at ~20mph without straps on it did not fly off). The hat is well made and came shipped without any damage. I love the mesh at the top for increased ventilation and the hyperkewl technology seems to work to some degree (more of a novelty). I have received loads of complements on the appearance (grey) and the brim holds it shape well. Easy to wash, it floats, and keeps the sun off my neck and head perfectly. I bought it for backpacking but use it for fishing, cutting the grass, gardening, etc. I was a little hesitant about buying from a 3rd party seller but it came well packaged and it was $75 for what seems like a $120 hat. Only downside is that when my pack is loaded up to the top brain the hat can rub up against it due to the wide brim (only a minor inconvenience). Overall great purchase!!!!"
5.0,Good quality. I appreciate this for cutting my husbands and sons hair. It’s worked well.
5.0,"awesome!  buy all the colors available!  comfortable and fits perfect, great look and style!"
5.0,"These pants are soft and so far durable,  I have washed them twice so far and they have kept their color and softness.  I ordered mine a size up just because I don't like my sleepwear clingy,  but I could have ordered my size and been fine. The colors are bright on them, I was worried they would be faded or fade quickly,  so far that is not the case. I am 5'3"" and they are long on me, but at my height I expect that, so it wasn't a surprise.  The pockets are great and easy hold a cell phone when walking around the house. It also has an elastic waist with a draw string so you can adjust how tight or lose you want them. I would definitely buy these again!"
5.0,Great product! Very durable with quality material.
5.0,I liked the protection it gives the fobThe color is cute.
5.0,This sweater is true to size for me with the perfect amount of “baggy-ness”. It’s incredibly comfortable. It’s not super thick sweater material. It’s right between long sleeve t-shirt and sweatshirt.
5.0,I was very satisfied with the purchase of this bathrobe and would recommend it to other customers.
5.0,I love these shorts!  They are comfortable and lightweight.
5.0,As pictured!!!vibrant colors!!
5.0,"I wore these for a 1940s theme work event and they were adorable. I got a ton of compliments and they were quite comfortable. Not too hot. They held up well, too. I was working and they didn't end up dirty or dingy or with holes.<br />I bought apricot and the pale peach color was just right."
5.0,"What can I say, they are chap, but for the price you just buy them over and over again. Love these, they are a fixed item in my accessory collection (especially since I always have a backup)."
5.0,My child loved
5.0,great hat!!!
5.0,"I bought this shirt AFTER reading a lot of reviews, so instead of buying my normal size (Medium), I bought a XXL and it fits perfectly. I washed it and it didn't shrink. It's soft, and it feels like a secod layer of skin. Love it. Just what I wanted. If thinking of buying one, be sure to go at least two sizes up your normal size"
5.0,Came promptly and looks just like in the pictures. Very impressed in the quality (I'm extremely picky). Pics are from trying it out (just received it) before washing and wearing.
5.0,Nice and thin you can double over if you want it thicker. Great for a mask at work. I can keep around my neck when I'm not around people then easily pull up when needed!
5.0,Fits well and good material
5.0,My brother in law is a vap enthusiast and was in love at first sight. as was I so I got me one too. he is a welder so the belt clip works perfectly and cool having a backup battery and juice poutch. he uses a large mod which I worried would not be big enough but it it even a huge 3 batt large mod.
5.0,I love the coat but it was too small and the sleeves were way too short. I returned it.
5.0,This was a gift for my wife. She says it is a nice organizer/wallet.
5.0,Ordered 1st pair and they were just a tad small. Bumped it up 1/2 size and they were perfect but lost them to the super chewer in the house. Ordered again. Comfy and well made!
5.0,"Great hat, Bailey's always great."
5.0,I am IN LOVE with these shoes!!!  The price was beyond reasonable and they are SUPER CUTE AND COMFY!!!
5.0,"Same Isotoner quality!  I love that the have the grips for driving, no more hands slipping on the steering wheel!  But these are TRUE GOLD color.  I was not concerned about the color when I purchased these, so I am very pleased with them and would definitely buy them again."
5.0,"Though this dermal top came in a tiny bit bigger than I anticipated, it's still REALLY cute!! I've gotten SO many compliments since wearing it! It came in about 3 days after ordering, but was definitely worth the wait! And the minimal amount for most dermals in a tattoo shop is $10, and tops with any sort of semblance of elegance are going to be +$20. So, to say I am satisfied is an understatement!"
5.0,Awesome jeans
5.0,"The bow ties have such a vibrant color to them, its amazing! I get compliments from left and right. And the cost was inexpensive, so its so worth it!"
5.0,Life changing- Cash envelope system made simple. Wish it had a coin area but fine without it.
5.0,"Note the strap that goes underneath your foot. Managed to miss that when I bought these, but found them to be an advantage. I have a heavier duty pant that I'd prefer to wear anytime it's snowing or at a windchill under say 20 Fahrenheit, but this is a solid pair of lightweight pants to run in for anything above that temperature."
5.0,"These gloves are the best .  I put caps on 10 & 30 ml. bottles and my thing and fingers don't blister , they give me a very good grip."
5.0,Cute ! It's a unisex kindof hat
5.0,So adorable I can't wait to give it to my sister she's gonna love it best birthday present ever! Thanks!
5.0,I loved throwing this top on with some leggings<br />  Great look for anytime!
5.0,I was unsure about the sizing as I'm on the thinner side but have some junk in the trunk. Ordered a large fit great has plenty of stretch.
5.0,Washes well.
5.0,Needed a new lanyard for my work badge and wanted something with UNF logo on it. This fit exactly what I needed and was decent quality.
5.0,Exactly what my daughter wanted!
5.0,"pant is as depicted, little tight in waist but very comfortable fabric and fit. would buy again"
5.0,This was a gift and I have not yet heard if they liked it or if they didn’t I’m assuming she did.
5.0,"These are very nice lanyards - they hold your glasses snugly and are durable, as well.  They are also colorful.  My husband loves them!"
5.0,"buen ajuste al cuerpo, la parte superior es un poco ancha en relación a la parte inferior,cómodo  suave y de buena calidad"
5.0,"This is my favorite belt! It looks great, thick and holds the pants beautifully while looking stylish."
5.0,Got this for my 3 year old because she’s always wanting to wear my jewelry. She’s loves it and looks forward to putting it on when going out. We’ve had it for about 2 months now and no changing color or itching so far… so big plus!
5.0,It fit perfectly.
5.0,"This is a nice thin swimsuit, at a very affordable price."
5.0,My daughter loves it. looks just like the picture.
5.0,Very cute. Item is not exactly like picture but still very cute and good quality
5.0,I’m 5’1 135 lbs and the large fit perfect. Definitely size up if you have a belly because the waistband is tight. These shorts are perfect! They look like a skirt but they won’t go up if it’s windy. Very lightweight slightly sheer but if you wear black underwear it shouldn’t be a problem. They do look wrinkled but the wrinkles could be part of the look.
5.0,very stylish amd I love the rhinestones
5.0,loved the ring looks great.
5.0,WOW!  LANDS' END DOES AMAZING PRINTS ON 100% COTTON!  THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL SHIRT.  I BOUGHT THIS PRINT IN THE TUNIC 3/4 SLEEVE AND A SHORT SLEEVE FOR SUMMER.  BEAUTIFUL FABRIC AND WASHED GREAT.

5.0,Love love love these dresses. If you are a short girl like me with the small waist and a big booty-this is the dress for you. It accentuates the small waist and hives a bigger bottom.

5.0,love them selection excellent
5.0,"Fits good and great looking hat, well made."

5.0,"These are very comfortable, and fit with all my shoes.  I will definitely buy again."
5.0,Best mask I got so far on amazon tried different ones so I ordered the 5 pack the next day so I’ll see how it goes with the 5 pack plus it is welled stitched a big plus for me holds up better that way
5.0,"Comfort, warmth, stylish. You get it all with these uggs. I ordered a size 7 and it fits perfectly. I usually order a size 71/2 in shoes for added comfort, but 7 worked for me this time"
5.0,love all of them

5.0,"Update: the company reached out to me to find out how the product worked for me.<br />I explained that based on the size chart and another review, the socks were too small and I could not use them.  They promptly sent out the correct size for me.  Amazing customer service!!!  (Original review - Based on another review, I purchased the S/M for 8.5 size feet.  They are extremely tight.  It is a struggle to get them on.  I wish I would have ordered the L/XL. The design, feel, and quality are great.)"
5.0,The stretch on this is little but it’s very soft
5.0,"Nice fit, nice material and great style. Fits just right. I'm 5'5' 185 pounds and it's purrrfect!"
5.0,Looks like a much more expensive piece.
5.0,This a beautiful bag. I love the colors.I had a drawstring years ago. I'm so glad they are back. It looks a lot more expensive then it was. I shop on Amazon a lot. I can always find something I like. The bag was delivered quickly and was wrapped very well. Thank you Amazon!
5.0,We bought these for my husband and he loves them. The are pretty slim fit and they are super comfortable. He loves the big pockets and the color.
5.0,Nice keychain. Very durable and looks great.

5.0,It's beautiful fits great!

5.0,I love these! Perfect for day to day wear or during working out. They stay in place and do not ride up! I will definitely purchase again!
5.0,"This wig is great if you can blend it in with your natural hair! The wig is not itchy it's very full,holds a curls you can use with curlers and I noticed the color isnt too shiny which makes it seem natural. What I did to make it look natural is leave out my bangs and edges ,I also sewed clips to make the wig secure. Follow my Instagram @unapologetically_sarah97 for more wig try ons !"
5.0,"Purchased it for my 3year old for a superhero themed birthday party.  It was a little big for her as expected,  but I'm happy to know that she'll be able to use it  for Halloween for the next few years."
5.0,"Very nice! Added bonus, you get two bracelets! Very pleased!"
5.0,"Very comfortable dress! Super soft cotton, like the best t shirt you’ve ever owned, but with a nice stretch to it so it hugs your curves. Great quality and can’t beat the price. Will buy more from this brand! I’m 5’6” and 140lb and the Small fit perfectly."

5.0,This dress is so sexy and fun!!! Love the length .. the sleeves.. just what i was hoping for!<br />Im 5'2 and 180 lbs and 36C ..i got an XL and it fit perfectly.. i read other reviews about the sleeves being the tight ( i usually wear a size L ) so i got a size up ... still fits in the mid section nicely and length is above the knee.  I may get in another color :)
5.0,Loved these! They fit well and feel good.  Will be getting more.
5.0,"I love these all cotton lounge dresses and wear them often. Only this brand which I’ve bought for years. Why.  Because they are consistently well made, wash great and are super comfy.  Highly recommend."
5.0,Awesome. I would recommend this item to anyone
5.0,I really like the skirt but it must be ironed or taken to the cleaners. It is really cute though so when I feel like ironing I wear it.
5.0,Product was accurate to the description and picture. The price can't be beat. I would definitely order from them again!
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised at the value of this watch. It is not cheap and flimsy. It is a very nice piece for the price. I'd compare it to that of a Timex.  It looks very nice.

5.0,It's cute and awesome
5.0,This purse is a really cute summer or fall purse! I love the style. It has a magnetic front but also zips. The straps are adjustable. There is a secret pocket inside and side pocket and a pocket on the back. I would recommend this purse.
5.0,I really like the look of the pendent. It is nice quality.  nice and pretty.  The chain is nice also and has different loops that allow you to adjust the length of the chain depending on our neck size or shirt you are wearing.  It is nice and dainty with smooth edges.<br />I received this item either free or at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
5.0,"Another delicate pair......not overwhelmingly &#34;in your face&#34;, just sophisticated and pretty. I am pleased!"
5.0,It's beautiful and love that it's adjustable!
5.0,Es suave y muy bonito
5.0,"Such a cute little keychain it took a few days for it to all fall in place, because it did come a little smashed<br />But is very cute!"
5.0,This dress is a showstopper in a way that doesn't reveal to much skin. The sleeves are spaghettini straps that can be adjusted and the sides of the dress has pockets. The dress is ankle length and is designed to fit more at the top and bell out towards the sides and to the ground. The rainbow on the front is eye catching and I get compliments whenever I wear it.

5.0,Love it. It’s comfortable and fits well.
5.0,"Great quality! It's fairly heavy, so if you have a sensitive head, this might not be for you.<br /><br />It looks better in person & is perfect for Halloween, cosplays or just connecting to your inner god(ess) of mischief!!"
5.0,I have enjoyed wearing this cardigan
5.0,The pocket watch was the perfect size! Thank you!
5.0,Cap is great
5.0,"This dress is very cute, true to size, color is exactly as pictured, and the material is nice (not too thin, not too thick) and soft.<br />I ordered the blue one on size XS (I'm 34B/ Waist: 25.5&quot;/ Hips: 35).<br />I prefer to use this dress with seamless panties as panty lines show a bit on it."
5.0,One of my favorites from the Attitude Era!  Happy to have it added to my belt collection! 💯
5.0,Very Comfortable and easy to adjust.
5.0,"I really like these glasses and have worn them every time I go outside since getting them.  I have a cornea problem that makes my eyes overly sensitive to light and they help with night driving.  They fit well and provide a crisp view.  Wish the lenses were a bit more sturdy as they wiggle a bit when I wipe them, but so far they are holding up."
5.0,Comfy and looks great..!
5.0,One of my favorite pairs of socks.
5.0,"These are great.  I wear them as everyday jewelry and they are so comfortable that I don't even know I have them on.  The only down side is that sometimes they get hung up and when they pull, it really hurts!! other than that, I love these and will be purchasing a couple more sets to have.  I wish they came in other colors or with stones on them."
5.0,GREAT VALUE..... SOOOOO PRETTY AND SOFT TOO....
5.0,For the price this was great. Needed for a costume. Ironed it a bit and used some spray starch to firm it up. Adjusted easily and looked good.
5.0,Beautiful necklace. Bought for my goddaughter. Quality very good for the price.
5.0,Hard to find sundresses on plus size.  This was perfect.  Received many compliments.
5.0,Great fit. My daughter loves the feel
5.0,"It Nice shopping experience. I got my watch faster then I expected, and it was nicely packaged. As for the watch itself, its a thing of beauty the first day I put it on and went out had nothing but good complements on the time piece. I'm happy with the shopping experience as well as the product"
5.0,It’s a very nice and nice looking belt.
5.0,"I went by measurements and got the x-large listed. It fits perfectly. Like a glove. The material seems very durable, not too heavy but won't leave you cold if you wear it out at night. Not stuffy, even the mask fits perfect with the eye caps and I don't feel like I might suffocate."
5.0,"It's beautiful! It is thin, but not sheer at all! It's like sheets. I love it, beautiful gunter green color!!! It's not to the floor and in 5'6"", but its close... right at the ankle."
5.0,"I am going through a 70's phase, I wanted some stylish glasses to go with my collection"
5.0,"I love this shirt!<br />I am a size 16 and I ordered the XXL, it fits great. This is so flattering I bought both colors. I wash it in cold water and line dry so it doesn't shrink.<br />The sleeves are not too tight (I have big arms) and the neckline is not too low to wear to the office but is still appropriate to wear for date night.<br />I highly recommend this very versatile shirt."
5.0,Great product. I bought it for my wife and it has pretty good longevity.<br />Great value for money I would say
5.0,Love these socks! Very cute an really good quality. Not too thin! I plan on buying more!
5.0,"So I'm 5'8, about 190 and I got this dress in an XL and it fits so well! It doesn't feel tight and I can move freely in it. It is such a cute dress. It looks a tad bit sheer so you may want to wear something underneath like a slip or tights. Also, you may want to use something to get rid of the static cling."
5.0,Son Unos Lentes Muy Como y Elegantes
5.0,Super soft material with a very nice print. It’s a nice length and looks great with casual clothing. It would make a very nice gift.
5.0,it is very pretty - it looked super tiny but no problem with size  - fits an adult just fine!

5.0,These are amazing.  I will be buying another pair soon.  I have not seen anything so cute that I could wear over my glasses.  I am very happy with them!
5.0,"Super soft for sleeping and lounging. Adjustable straps and snaps make it as revealing as you're in the mood for. I suspect the fabric will shrink and/or bleed but not a deal-breaker for me. I like these so much I'll be buying them in white, too. 5' 6"", 28"" waist, 39"" hip, and the Ms fit perfectly."
5.0,I don't wear it a lot but it's just fun! So many people love it and crack up
5.0,Super fun piece!
5.0,This is a good product to buy. The fabric is really soft and the fitting is perfect. This is the exact same thing as it shows in the display. I have already washed it and the color is the same it was and the best part is it didn’t shrink. Give it a try
5.0,Love this ring!!! It’s so cute and doesn’t rust or make my finger turn green! Def buy it if you’re debating on it!!
5.0,"Good quality hinges, and polarized lenses. It would have been nice if they included a screwdriver as some of the screws are recessed and if they start to come loose it may be a pain to tighten them. The glasses come with a bag to protect them as well as the bamboo tube. Overall, I'm very happy with the glasses and have no complaints."
5.0,"If you like color than this is great, because you get two in one! Easy to wear and wrap, definitely recommend!"
5.0,Excellent quality product with a clean and stylish design. The product met my expectations and is exactly as described.
5.0,Fits true to size. Snug but comfy. Would buy again.
5.0,"Absolutely love these! I have the NVGTN biker shirts and love them for the quality and fit. These are a perfect dupe! NVGTN is very hard to get your hands on and triple the price. These are a great alternative and fit just the same. Squat proof and sweat proof.  They're flexible and breathable... definitely not tight around the thighs line other biker shirts. They don't ride up and the double ribbed tummy compression works great. There is a bit of gather in the crotch but honestly it's not that bad. Im 5'1"" , 117lbs, athletic build and got an extra small. They fit perfect and super stretchy. Best part of this is the great customer service slip included with your order. They guarantee to 100% help if any issues occur."
5.0,Beautiful dress. I love the material and the color. I will be ordering more colors soon. The material is very soft and stretchy.  I wear and xl but a large would fit as well. Thank you

5.0,"Nice box!! No damage. The wallet is so cool, just a little big but anyway is wonderful for me. Now I will use it for like 2 months and see what happens in quality, but the package is really good."
5.0,Fit perfectly felt good

5.0,Beautiful charms! Fit mine's and my sister's Pandora bracelets like a glove! Very bright though for some reason our bracelets are a tad darker silver but the charms are still very cute. My big sister loved her new addition.
5.0,"I had ordered it for me but when I saw it was quite large, I opted to give it as a Christmas gift to someone a little bit bigger, so in a way it came in useful. Very nice color and good quality."
5.0,I love this little bag. It has all of the compartments that I need to separate off my stuff and its not bulky.

5.0,Gave as Christmas gifts. My friends LOVED them.
5.0,"I'm only rating this to help with clearing up the sizing confusion. I ordered a 3xl because I plan on wearing big sweaters with it, I'm normally a 2xl and it's actually a bit too big but I'm ok with that. So I would suggest ordering the size you normally wear.  Also it's not really a &#34;coat&#34; it's more of a jacket."
5.0,"The R.E.D. design aside, this is a great hat.  I've washed it multiple times (by hand) because I sweat a lot when I ride wearing it.  Its always kept its shape.  But it is nice to see a R.E.D. marketer with a quality product."
5.0,I love this dress just what I wanted. It’s amazing
5.0,Very happy with this bracelet. Looks great and fits nicely. The magnet clasp works very well.
5.0,"It fit very well, not Tight but Loose like a sweat shirt should , it is light in weight but warm"
5.0,"Dress is perfect! Just as described! I love the fabric as well, should be great to travel with! 😊"

5.0,It's exactly what I needed---it is very soft and lovely !!!!--
5.0,I wear these at work. They are worn inside my Crocs and take a beating as I walk and stand in one place for almost 10 hours a day. This is my first week wearing them. Time will tell how long they hold up. So far so good.😊
5.0,Exactly what I wanted! I couldn't be happier.

5.0,"This quickly became my favorite pair of sunglasses. They're comfortable, they're very blue (which I love), and they look great! Ralph Lauren sunglasses are my go-to glasses and I'm very glad I decided to spoil myself and bought these even though they were pricy."
5.0,I really was scared of ordering it at first it came in 2weeks and fits the same as any small size swimsuit. I have size 32B and have a bigger butt but it worked out fine. The bottoms isn't as cheeky and they are tie bottoms which I really love. The color is just like the picture and the top is padded.
5.0,good fit.  realistic.
5.0,Its truly beautiful. No regrets
5.0,The chain was very beautiful..just to thin for my needs.

5.0,"Awesome set, especially for the price. I was really impressed."
5.0,"This pair of glasses are great, this is my 4th pair bought since I gave 2 of them and last one broke ""my fault"". Let me tell you this glasses look great, make your vision great and I never felt so comfortable while driving my motorcycle. Day or Night the vision is improved, sun doesn't affect that much and car lights won't make you crash, It does make it look like HD vision, No joke, I never write reviews but been wearing them since over 2 years ago and would never go back to expensive glasses again."

5.0,"love these boots, the only problem I had, was the box was torn all to pieces when I received them."
5.0,"I’m 5’2” and bought the small. Because it’s a maxi, it was of course a bit too long for my height. But the dress is great quality. The color was true to the picture. Super comfortable and love the pockets!"

5.0,Got it for my kids for crazy hat day.  They loved it.
5.0,These look so great! The packaging is simple and nice. Im so excited to give these to our son for christmas!
5.0,"I ordered the navy, grey, and green. The navy I am keeping but I did opt to return the other two. I didn’t care for the grey color and the green one, although my favorite, was much larger then the other two even though they were labeled the same size.  I did reorder to try again."
5.0,Very cute dress.  A little long  nothing I can't fix.
5.0,"These are really well made shoes.  the seam on one shoe was a bit coming off but got them on sale! And no replacement in the same size was available, so we kept them, very happy!  They go well with everything and look really good on the foot!"
5.0,"I love my new Fotbit band, I see no need to order the the stainless band that you can preorder for the Fitbit. This band is more than I could have hoped for. I have been wearing it 24 hrs. A day and it looks as good as new and I have been wearing it for about a month now. I love the two tone band because it will go with everything! I see no need now to buy the expensive one from Fitbit . Took a little while to get it after ordering but it was way worth while for the wait. The price was fantastic and couldn't ask for better.I's so glad that I ordered this band and I never take it off except to change it!!"
5.0,I love this handbag...the color is as shown.  It's not too big but not too small either.

5.0,"Comodas,perfectas"
5.0,Silver Forrest Earrings are my favorites! I have at least twenty pairs❣️These are actually a gift for someone that I know will love them like I do🤗
5.0,"Just the right color, size and texture. Love it. I had searched for the proper fit for me for  a long time and finally found the one I wanted."
5.0,Super cute.  Falls off at the shoulders won’t stay up. I am going to return for a smaller size.  I got an xl.  It’s just too big.  Good material.  Back is pretty.
5.0,My daughter bought it for my husband who is a die hard Kings fan. He loves the old embelem and in turn loved the beanie. He had been looking for one to replace his old one that he had for 24 years. This one is identical in style and quality. Very satisfied.
5.0,"These are great! I am pretty heavy in the thigh area, so I have problems with really tight shorts, especially ones that have elastic around the knee area. These have the perfect give to accommodate my larger legs, and they don't have elastic yet they stay perfectly in place. Not quite as much padding as some other types out there, but I was perfect for a 6 mile ride and probably could have gone much more. Plus, since they don't have the &#34;extra&#34; padding, you can actually walk in them without feeling like you've got a pillow between your legs."
5.0,Perfect buy for the derby party!
5.0,"Crazy looking sock, but does the jog.  I love that I can now wear flip flops in the winter, and my feet stay warm."

5.0,They kept me warm in Maine winter weather.  Need I say more?
5.0,Prompt delivery. Lovely case. Thank you!
5.0,I get a lot of compliments on this ring.  It is unique though a bit bigger (bulkier) than most of the rings I wear.
5.0,I ordered a size larger so it's a little big but it was expected. My daughter absolutely loves it. She's says she wishes they had mommy's size so we could have matching dresses like our boots. The shipping was also fast and hassle free.
5.0,The size chart was accurate and really like the quality
5.0,Perfect fit. My favorite shirt.
5.0,"I've had this strap for a few weeks now and it's been holding up great. Less fraying compared to some other straps that are similarly styled to this one. The fabric keeper is a new style to me and I was unsure of how I would like it, but it is actually really nice. The extra flap of fabric is easy to tuck away and isn't very noticeable at all. The seatbelt material is also very comfortable, much more so than NATO straps made of the normal nylon material. So far the strap has been great, I just hope it holds up over time."
5.0,"Perfect for running, or in the pool!!!"
5.0,"Excellent warmth,and not available locally."
5.0,"Very comfortable, warm, and great for everyday use."
5.0,Awesome shirt. Would definitely recommend

5.0,Works great for those adventurous activities don't want to risk losing or ruining the real wedding band.
5.0,"Super soft, felt softer than my LLR.  Wore them all day for Little League Opening Day and was warm enough in the morning and cool enough in the middle of the day. I normally wear a 16 and the fit was perfect, maybe a little loose around the knees but nothing that bothered me."
5.0,Just the right size for a personalized prayer card.
5.0,Awesome dress! Perfect for the spring time!
5.0,"Very pretty, I bought for my 3 year old Granddaughter, she's now 6. It's held up very well, kids are active and she wears it all the time. I bought two extras for when it breaks or doesn't look as pretty, needless to say, she'll probably outgrow them before using. Good purchase."
5.0,This mini skirt is very cute and it fits me perfectly I think this mini skirt is worth every dollar 💰 and it's actually very comfortable
5.0,These look nice and stay secure. Very happy with them.
5.0,quite sexy.

5.0,Love me some brooks!!!  Very comfortable for the gym and running.

5.0,Looks great and the keychain hardware is connected well. Shipped promptly.
5.0,Wearing these for my wedding.
5.0,love it !
5.0,My dog bit me 4 times on my hand while I had these gloves on if I didn’t have them on he would of tore up my hand worked very well my dog isn’t a large breed but gloves did it’s purpose
5.0,Fit perfectly where it for the holidays.
5.0,"These slippers are very comfortable, so I bought 2 morel pair in other colors"
5.0,"Long and comfy fit, runs narrow in torso. Quality top! I own at least a dozen in various colors and really find them very versatile. Buy one size up if in doubt. Love them!"
5.0,Support is great. I was looking for some this with wide straps at a good price. I have been wearing this for over a year and still holding form great.
5.0,I love love love these watch bands!!
5.0,"I own about a dozen Casio digital watches (I'm kind of a collector) and this one is tied with my G-Shock DW-5600E as being my favorite.  Casio makes and sells tons of F-91 watches for a reason, and have done so for a long time. The beauty of this watch is that it is so light and thin that it almost becomes a part of your body and you forget that it is on your wrist. At the same time the F-91 is quite accurate, reliable, and sturdy considering it's super low cost. Even if it does break, which would require significant abuse, the low price means getting a new one is painless. The batteries on these things will last a good long time. As far as accuracy, my F-91 actually does much better than my DW-5600E. The style isn't for everyone but I personally love the retro look. The only down side is that you don't want to be caught in a warzone wearing one because ownership of an F-91 could get you accused of being a terrorist bomber and sent to Gitmo. That aside, for anyone who wants an inexpensive and / or retro style watch the F-91 is the clear choice."
5.0,"I really love this sweatshirt! It does run a bit small but if you follow your measurements you will be fine. I like my clothes fitted so I bought a large that has a bust 39.3&#34;  and a waist at 34.6&#34;.  I have a 40&#34; bust and a 33&#34; waist and this fit me perfectly. The fabric has a bit of stretch and soft so it accommodates my bust despite the minor size difference. It came with a small hole at the bottom seam which can be easily fixed and it has a bit of a wait for transit time (I think it was about 2 weeks) and  which is the only downside. The cut is very flattering and it looks far nicer than your average pullover sweatshirt. I wish they had better colors, I would buy several!"
5.0,Wears them all the time
5.0,"I'm a HUGE fan of the classic Coach, Dooney & Bourke, and Fossil (to name a few) handbags and wallets. So when I say this inexpensive red compact wallet is one of the best buy I've made in a long time, you can believe it. Excellent quality; great buy!"
5.0,Perfect weight and texture.  Very comfortable and stylish.
5.0,I love it! Very comfortable & fit great
5.0,Realistic and good quality.  Great custoner service!

5.0,Have been looking for something like this for a long time. This one is very nice.
5.0,Great cute gift for friends!
5.0,"My bra size is 36 A and I use the last hook. Try finding a bra that size, but there're scads of 34 As. If I buy a 34 A they're so tight it squeezes my eyeballs out. These bra extenders are a godsend."
5.0,"Love this dress! Fits perfectly! I am 5'4"", 192 lbs, pear shaped and ordered a size large. Soft material, flattering for my shape."
5.0,These look great!
5.0,I had been watching this purse for a while and finally took the plunge. I love it!!
5.0,"These belts are incredible! Every time I wear one I receive compliments. Other buyers said they have a problem with the belt fastener opening when they wear them, I have not experienced this problem at all. I would highly recommend this product."
5.0,"This is such  nice bag! I have my wife's old one next to it in the photo and you can really see the difference and quality of this beautiful cross body bag. The bag size is just right to fit a phone, full size wallet, hand sanitizer, glasses,  small notepad, plus a few other things. It's not too small where you can barely get your stuff out nor is it so big that everything gets lost. It's jut the right size! The material seems tough and will most likely withstand some wear and tear. I'm pleasantly impressed with this bag."
5.0,I cannot tell you how much I LOVE this dress !!
5.0,Item arrived on time and was as described
5.0,"Lovely, delicate pendant."
5.0,Love it! Very pretty and fun to wear.
5.0,"I got these for my preschooler to wear outside. Both pairs come with carrying bags and seem to be pretty good quality. My daughter finds them very comfortable, and the heart lenses are pretty cute. These would probably be too small for an average sized elementary kid, but they are perfect for my preschooler."
5.0,I got it for my son and he won’t take it off he loves it soooo much!
5.0,Perfect fit.  I love it!
5.0,My wife luvs luvs everything about this item

5.0,"Love my eyerings, bought them for myself! Arrived on time and are exactly what I expected"
5.0,"I am pleased with these earrings . They look &#34;real&#34; and unique . They are a bit smaller than I expected but actually that makes them more perfect  . I think they would make a very nice gift also but I will be keeping these babies for myself. I like also that they are easy and comfortable to wear , I don't feel that I have them on at all.  They have nice back pieces too , substantial and won't slip off .  The box they came in is okay but I think a better box would improve the overall gift presentation in my opinion . Fast ship directly from China , took about 10 days or so ."
5.0,Meet my expectation
5.0,"I love this shirt. It fits well, has a nice texture and doesn't fade. I ordered another shirt in a different color."

5.0,I love this dainty necklace.
5.0,Very nice watch love the look and comfortable fit
5.0,"This case is well-printed with vibrant colors that are true to the pictures. The strap is not something I would trust a phone with though, so I removed it altogether. The phone fit in well and cards and money also fit in well. The wallet side has enough flexibility to make it easy to slide things in, but enough hold to make me not worry about things just falling out. I bought this as a mothers day gift and she was very happy. The cats are so cute!"
5.0,It sits right on me..

5.0,"I love it. Warm, soft, washes well. I use for hat and neck."
5.0,"My son loves his new socks! He put them on right away, they fit perfectly and he tells me they are very warm. He loves to run around barefoot on our wood floors but then tells me his feet are cold. With these he can still run on our floors without falling and keep warm at the same time! He puts them on along with his pjs so his feet stay warm throughout the night as well. They were soft and very stretchy so he'll be able to wear them for a long time. Very happy with this product.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,My family loves Keens - these are an excellent shoe for a much better price for kids whose feet are growing daily

5.0,"I’m very skinny. 5’7 & 127 lbs. The x-small was not skin tight, but it what you would expect an x-small scrub to be like. I like my clothe tight and although this isn’t pressing up against my body, it’s still good. I approve ! Also, the colors are beautiful !!! Thin material too, but not cheap. Perfect for Miami weather."
5.0,The dress is of good thick quality material.  The dress does stretch to every curve in your body. It's above knee length dress.

5.0,I bought this watch as a Father's Day gift for my husband who didn't own a watch with a leather band and he absolutely loves it. It can be worn when he is dressed down/casual & he can also wear it & it looks nice when he is dressed up. It works great for any kind of look & its a conversation piece because of the clear dial.

5.0,For an XL it's it's nice fit. It's not skin tight; it's comfortable as it should be. I'm 5'8 and wear size 14. I like the calf length as it's often too short on me - these really are mid length. It's a soft material and it has pockets! The print is fun. I'll wear this with a long black tee or loose tank top.

5.0,Matt feel is great.  I have a bunch of ray bans but wanted some for a bachelor party I don't have to worry about trashing
5.0,"Arrived folded but was okay when removed from box.  Had no fold crease, and was able to shape and wear as indicated.  Excellent style, nice color, very stylish.  Excellent for blocking sun off face and neck area.  Nice for summer or very hot sunny spring day."
5.0,"I bought this for my daughter's 9th birthday, and it's just such a sweet, simple thing to share with her. I attached it to my keychain and put hers on her backpack, and she couldn't have been happier with it. It's so pretty and simple, but sweet."
5.0,I received a lot of compliments on this dress when I wore it to Vegas. The skirt is a little see through but manageable. It is inexpensive and worth it.

I've bought several rings from this seller and I've never had an issue and none of my rings, including this one, have ever turned my finger green. I love it. Will buy it again if needed!  **please excuse my fat fingers.. They're an inheritance from my dad... thanks Dad!! 🥺**"
5.0,My son loves this toboggan anyone who is an among is fan needs this!!!
5.0,Not normal tshirt material which makes it super hot to wear.
5.0,I bought these bright green tags for my families luggage because they are large and bright to help make it easier to identify our luggage (normal black luggage like everybody else). The tags were easily visible and made it extremely easy to identify our luggage at baggage claim.
5.0,These are great. Comfy and sturdy
5.0,"It is the perfect size. It holds full size wallet, sunglasses case, iphone 11 pro, kleenex packet, small hand sanitizer and a couple other smaller items with room left over. You can wear it in the front, back or slung over your shoulder (but it doesn't stay as securely without being crossbody). I even ordered it in another color because I loved it so much!"
5.0,"SojoS makes a great product, this is my second pair of sunglasses made by this company and these fashion shape are some of the best quality and stylish sunglasses you can by and the price is awesome to. I highly recommend these aviators or any other style by sojos  I'll definitely be buying more."
5.0,These shoes fit perfectly and they are very comfortable
5.0,"Not much to say, it gets the job done and looks good while doing it."
5.0,Bought as gifts and the guys loved them!
5.0,I love my Fabuxry! I will be using it starting today. I am finishing up my vacation and need a smaller bag for work. Especially on night shift. Something closer to the body. My large floral tote is too showy. I like the many pockets it has to offer. Especially that they are inside of the straps where people can't see them. It is a lightweight bag which is good on my arm. I like the hobo style because of the long handles. It will fit over a light coat or jacket when weather cools. I bought the black for the nighttime. The two side pockets are big enough for my travel pass and work ID. It is short enough where I don't have to fumble around looking for things. Plus I extra organize with small pouches for different items. I don't do loose anything at the bottom of my purses.
5.0,Great handbag - bigger than I thought it would be.
5.0,I llike it
5.0,I'm 5'5&#34; and weigh 126 lbs I bought this in a size small and it fits perfect! I'm very happy with my jumpsuit! Highly recommend y'all to buy this. . Oh and it came before the date it said it would get here.
5.0,Works awesome!  Only had 1 write in for our 12 team draft!<br /><br />The poster is a little flimsy tho.. ripped just trying to open it up.. nothing tape couldn’t fix..<br /><br />All in all everybody liked it!
5.0,"Arrived today and couldn't be more happier.<br />It fits beautifully. The fabric is light but not see thru. The style is so very sexy.<br />I tried it with sandals for casual look, it is so pretty. I tried it with heels and it's va va voom!!<br />You will not be sorry, just order!  I'm 5'4 and it's a tiny past my knee.<br />The colors are true! I ordered the flowers and also the black."
5.0,Excellent quality silk.  Beautiful picture.
5.0,This was intended for a wedding but when it arrived it was too small for an extra large and the fabric inferior.
5.0,Kept my hands really warm in Chicago And it was nice that I didn’t need to remove my gloves to use my phone!
5.0,Looks great and it arrived on time
5.0,"Fit as expected, great quality shipped fast"
5.0,Fit perfectly and so cute and comfy
5.0,"Headbands normally give me a headache, but these ones don't pinch my head too much, which is great! I liked the gold antlers and was surprised that the dots on the antlers are actually small jingle bells. They sit on a post, and sometimes the antler comes off the post, but I could snap it back on. There was also some residual hot glue strings, not a problem, since I could pull it off, but a little unfinished looking when it first arrived. Overall, a fun addition for parents or children. Both of my boys liked playing with them (on their heads and also on mine!)."
5.0,"So, I recently got put into contacts. For the first time in years, I was out of glasses and could wear my big, bug-eye sunglasses. I was so happy. I went out and immediately bought a pair of sunglasses that I wore for two months straight. I never left the house without my sunglasses.<br /><br />When I saw these, I thought about my kids. I thought ""I can get these for the boys and they can pick out sunglasses to match their outfits."" The day these were delivered, just before the mail ran, my 8-year-old picked up MY sunglasses, and broke them.<br /><br />So, we split these. They aren't dark enough for my liking, but I love that I can match my sunglasses with my outfit. They fit well on my small face and are comfortable when I push them up on my head. I do miss my old sunglasses, but these work well and the boys love them!"
5.0,"Great boots, very warm durable fantastic color. And unbelievabley comfortable. When you first get then they do have a very strong smell that is like gasoline but after a day or two of wearing them it goes away."
5.0,The bag met the expectations !
5.0,The material is super soft and flowy like some of the more expensive brands. They are very roomy and run a little big. I usually wear a size 6 and the small fits well with lots of extra room. I absolutely love it and will be ordering more.
5.0,"This blouse is beautiful ! The fabric is soft and the fit is perfect. I am 5ft, 120 pounds and the small fits perfectly"
5.0,"The ring is very pretty, it has a beautiful sparle."
5.0,Amazing ! Read the reviews because it does run small. I am 5'9 130 lbs and I ordered an XL and it fits great. I love how long it is !!!
5.0,"Just as I expected.  Inexpensive, and cute.  Will be adding these to the ribbon on future gifts."
5.0,"At least I bought another belt and this one is gold (another review on another belt that was not as depicted). This one fits, is comfortable and is very chic. Nicely done. Do be sure to measure your waist to get the right fit."
5.0,They look awesome on me! The waist is high but not too high.
5.0,Warm and cozy...also pretty...I love these slipper socks
5.0,"We've had this for a few months now and it has already traveled 5500 miles and several destinations to use with our Kelty Seqouia 4 tent. That nice thing is that the corner straps are color coded so you know which way is correct with the tent. It's a glorified tarp essentially, but built well and matches the tent. I enjoyed having it and I believe it helped protect the tent."
5.0,I’m s so comfortable.  Great for work.
5.0,Received compliments. I liked it very much!!
5.0,"Excellent quality. Good cut. Flattering. Perfect as an outer layer.  Could see this as a casual, go-to shirt that could look good for a couple of decades, with minimal care."
5.0,"Nice and beautiful, still too long for me, but I want to keep it. I am 5’1” 126 lb order s size. Need wear wedges."
5.0,The new version of this product is so amazing. It’s so much smaller and more sleek and comes with the USB-C port. This product also seems to last longer.
5.0,These socks are super comfortable and bright.  Some of the best socks I have owned.
5.0,Wild rags are awesome. I use them when I'm out in the sun to keep from getting a sunburn on my neck. They look pretty good with my Stetson collection also. The rags are easy to clean and quick to air dry.
5.0,These shirts are so soft and comfortable. They are a perfect top for yoga and exercise. Great material and perfect price. I would buy these again!
5.0,Love the material and the length of the skirt.  Very flattering fit.
5.0,They arrived quickly and look even better in person. I’m excited to start wearing these!
5.0,I have used this to pull down fallen tree branches by camp i did however add about a 6inch throwing handle made from shrink tubing it helps.
5.0,My daughter loved this outfit! fit perfectly as a small.
5.0,I loved it but it was 2 small.
5.0,Perfect lightweight hoodies! These are thin and could use a lil fabric softener but well made. I bought a size up so it could be worn over clothing and they fit nicely.<br />I'm extremely happy with my purchase. I bought several of these to donate and I'm grateful to Bermo for allowing me to give back so much. Shipping was faster than expected too!
5.0,Love it. From the material to design and everything is perfect
5.0,"These are just as expected. They're wonderful, breathable, easy to get on and off, perfect for workouts. Pockets are so helpful! Would buy again."
5.0,Very lightweight and breathable great for summer
5.0,"Fit exactly as expected and very figure flattering; It will make a great summer dress.  I got the rainbow colored version and though the colors are not as vivid as in the picture nor is the black as dark, I am still very happy with the dress for the price.  The longer length hits me right at the knee which I like (I am 5'6&#34; about 150lbs) -- When I scrolled through some of the photos of others who bought this dress, I was impressed to see that every single woman looked amazing in it, so it I had to give it a shot myself.  For the price, you really can't beat it... its not often you come across a dress that is so universally flattering to women of all shapes and sizes, while still being so comfortable, versatile and affordable, but this just happens to be one of those rare finds."
5.0,Great!  Delicate and light weight.
5.0,My students loved them!
5.0,Cool for summer nice material
5.0,My son loved this mask. The quality was very good considering the Chinese origin.
5.0,Great bag love it
5.0,I have been using these gloves for 3 weeks now and I love them! I used to to clean dishes and they are anti-slippery. The dishes won't fall off from my hand. And I used them to clean. Amazing gloves!
5.0,"I only wear indian jewlery, earring are beautiful,you dont even feel them on your ear,I got alot of compliments on them. I just order another pair.please come out with more designs.thanks"

5.0,Perfect sink cleaner. No water spots.... easy!
5.0,My daughter loved these. Great party kit for a decent price
5.0,I had previously purchased a pair of these airings for myself and I wear them often. I get so many compliments on them. This latest pair that I purchased will be a Christmas present for someone who has admired my earrings since I started wearing them. They even look better than in their picture. Highly recommended!
5.0,"Love it! works perfectly, Perfect, sleek bun whenever i want. Easy to use, got the hang of it the first few times"
5.0,Warm on my toddlers feet and grippy on hardwood floors.
5.0,I love these headbands. They are super soft and stay in place while running and kickboxing. They wash up well.
5.0,Arrived in perfect condition!
5.0,it's very simple to use my mom loves it but where is my 2 year warranty
5.0,I have been searching high and low for not only the perfect maternity dress but the one that meet my expectations for my winter wonderland and this dress is it! The dress style is a little open and lose fitting in the back so you may need to use double sided tape to keep everything in and the tops is very sheer but it’s what I wanted! Must buy!
5.0,"Very cute! I received too many compliments :) if you're looking for a med/large bag to fit 1000 things in I wouldn't suggest this one, there's plenty of pockets to organize the necessities but that does make shoving useless crap inside difficult"
5.0,Love this jacket. Wasn’t sure how the fabric would feel but it’s really soft and warm! Seems well made and zippers work smoothly. The style is cute and different from other teddy jackets. Just toss in the dryer for a few mins to get the wrinkles out from packaging and you’re good!
5.0,Appreciated the customer reviews on this watch. I also am pleased with its look and fit. Can't speak to accuracy or longevity because I just received it but a lovely watch for a reasonable price; nice packaging for presentation if purchased for a gift.
5.0,"Possibly the best value I've ever found on sunglasses.  Great, quality build which actually has some weight to it.  The polarized lenses work perfectly in practically every light.  Why spend anything more on sunglasses!"
5.0,Great shorts
5.0,"The color is very vibrant and the material feels very good.  The dress is pretty and sexy.  Nice and comfortable.  I'm 5ft2in and even when I wore 5in heels with this dress, it was still a tad bit too long.  It is a little large so I recommend getting 1 size smaller.  I am very curvy with a small waist and the entire dress fits like I ordered 1 size larger."
5.0,Looks good and doesn’t hit my eyelashes
5.0,Loved it! Got tons of comments when I wore it out!
5.0,"Me encantó el diseño, muy elegante, igual se siente de buena calidad. Espero sea duradero, ya actualizaré mi reseña cuando lo use por mucho tiempo."
5.0,This product is just as it appears.  Lots of variety rings!!!  I have not worn any to the club yet (or near a black light) if they do not glow in the light I will come back and let you know.
5.0,Very cute and the material was nice and not thin at all. True to size!
5.0,"It's about forever 21 quality but 1/3 of the price, awesome.<br /><br />It was actually stretchy which I think helped. The small waist strap on the bottoms was less stretchy and hard to get over my butt.<br /><br />I'm 36&#34; 25&#34; 36&#34; 32D and got the small, thought medium would've worked too."
5.0,"Fits really well, doesn’t sit in the top of the head like an American trucker! Fits round head nicely"
5.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; 120lbs ordered size 5. They are a perfect fit, nice & tight on the thigh, comfortable around the waist, & not too long for a shorty like me. I machine wash & hang dry to avoid shrinking & they remain a perfect fit."
5.0,"These leggings are perfect!  Very comfortable.  The fabric is soft and the design is beautiful.  I love the pockets, they are perfect for your keys or a credit card.  They also arrived very quickly!  I recommend it"
5.0,"This is such a great deal. You normally can't find a tongue ring in the mall for under $13. For everyone that is thinking about purchasing these i would highly suggest these ones. I got a couple stupid ones, but there is a lot more that i like than the ones that i don't like. The top and bottom balls both come off, but they do stay on really good. I play with mine a lot and check on it, and its never loose. For the people that say that the ones that they ordered don't twist off, try using some elbow grease, kuz they're twisted on pretty tight. Over all very happy with this. I might order again so see if i can get some different ones, just because they're only $13!"
5.0,I bought this necklace stand for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it!  Now her necklaces and bracelets are neatly hung on the stand and displayed on her dresser.  The jewelry stand is expertly made and very sturdy.  I'm glad I made this purchase.
5.0,"Much softer then I expected! It was the perfect secret santa gift for my fencing clubs president. Thank you! Definitely recommending it, might get one for myself too!"
5.0,"I get so many compliments with these earrings. Super cute, light weight, perfect size, bright colors, totally 80's vibe. Everyone is asking for the link to get their own. You will not be disappointed."

5.0,My nephew loved this!
5.0,My husband loves this watch it looks real nice and works great.
5.0,These slippers are well made and very comfortable. The soles are thick and are holding up well. I like them so much that I will be buying another pair.
5.0,"Very good quality, and fast shipping."
5.0,I absolutely love this band it’s very versatile and goes with a lot. Very comfortable band
5.0,"Wasn't to sure what to expect about the outfit.<br />I give it a 5 start the material is amazing, the tutu is not thin at all, the shirt is stretchy. I got it for my 4 year old turning 5 soon and it fit just right. It's a beautiful outfit.<br />Great purchase"
5.0,"Tried several brands, this one is of geat quality. Comfortable, lightweight and breatheable. When used to protect the face, they can be worn covering nostrils without creating a smothering sensation. They are also great when growing out bangs, as I currently am."
5.0,Warm but run a bit small
5.0,I work as a manager at a large Grocery store near a college campus and we have to constantly be checking for fake IDs.  I was sick of the poor quality company issued magnifying glasses and decided to give these a shot.  These Loupes are the best investment I have made in awhile for the job.  My other managers can now keep these on their key chain and we easily can check an ID for micro-printing on the fly.  The magnification is excellent and the fact that they have a loop to hook onto a key chain is excellent.
5.0,Great shirt fit ver well
5.0,will it on the last cruise it was a blast love it
5.0,I love this so much
5.0,Very cute and stylish fit!
5.0,"I really like this dress. I am 5'3&#34;, 140lbs with a large chest and the 8/10 fit me great.  I ordered it for a wedding but I wear it to work or out on the town."
5.0,"These are great quality and fit my son perfect. He's a tall 9 year old, size Medium in youth pants."

5.0,Fits good for this proce
5.0,Exactly like the picture!
5.0,Replaced the laces in a decade-old pair of Converse All-Stars. These look PERFECT! The white have a texture like a lace to them and look perfect. Comfy and easy to do. Will be buying more for all my lacing needs.
5.0,"Love these shorts for their light weight feel, their style and the zipper pockets that add security to items in my pockets."
5.0,terrific birthday party giveaways
5.0,I love the size and they look real

5.0,I really love it..
5.0,"After ordering this brown band, I received a black one instead. After contacting the seller, they apologized and immediately sent a replacement. The quality and workmanship of this band, as well as the black band, is top notch as far as I am concerned. I must also say that the seller, Kensington Watch at Amazon.com, was very supportive in insuring I was satisfied with my order. I highly recommend this band and seller."
5.0,Vivid colors. Comfortable. Received numerous compliments- they stand out. I love them
5.0,It fit as expected and got a lot of compliments in the dress. Great value for the price.
5.0,"Love the design, very pretty.."
5.0,"A solid depiction of His Noodliness. Well crafted, not glamorous or glittery. 2 solid pins with rubber attachments. Pinned it to my shirt during my Holiday shift on December 25th.  Would Recommend."
5.0,"I normally wear a size 12 dress (10 in pants)because my bust is large plus my waist measures 35 and even though this size state for 31-33 I think, I still fit in this fine.  It's longer on me than photo but I liked it that way because of the fullness of the bottom(I'm 5'2&#34;).  Only part I don't get was why the red and green around the waist lol..Very comfortable also, all I needed to do is press the skirt part and I was off to a wedding."
5.0,Great product and the quality is better than expected. The workmanship is quite high and the unit feels very solid. The lid is solid and seems to have some sort of mechanism that prevents it from slamming down when closing...it’s smooth. The motor is smooth and quiet as advertised...this is an awesome deal for a Japanese motor . The unique thing about this watch winder that I’ve been searching for is that there is an outer sleeve for the cushions that allow not only a larger wrist but also for ladies watches. I may get another one.
5.0,As described fast ship
5.0,The size of it
5.0,"BEST pair of sunglasses I've ever bought from Amazon...and I've bought dozens through the years.  These sunglasses would have been worth the $25 retail price, but for only $5 you're really getting a great deal.  I just ordered 8 more pair as I'm constantly leaving them lying and around and having them stolen."
5.0,It's a quality watch at very reasonable price.. While ordering I had a doubt in my mind but when received it got clear and it looks really nice when put on the hand..
5.0,Nice material for the cost.
5.0,Pretty and durable
5.0,It fit well and came in on time.
5.0,loved it. I was just what I needed as a base for my Halloween costume!
5.0,"A gift for my cousin...she loved it, matches boots that also gifted to her. Thanks for making her heart smile"
5.0,"Looks really good, a little small so Oder up on size"
5.0,Just what i needed
5.0,I loved it so much I’m getting another one in a different color
5.0,its an awesome watch looks exactly like the pictures
5.0,Love this pearl.  Was much prettier in person.  Totally a m amazed by its size.  Beautiful necklace.
5.0,Love these....
5.0,When I received the leggings at first I was a little bit hesitant because it looked like it was too small but when I tried them on they were quite comfortable. I decided to wear them on a run and in all honestly I didn't even realize that they didn't ride down at all.
5.0,"I got this for my dad for Christmas, he needed a new wallet and he is completely in love with it. He tells me every day that it his favorite thing ever and it holds everything."
5.0,Gave it as a gift.
5.0,"These glasses are great. Truly polarized, have not tried the photochromic lens or whatever it’s called, but I love these. They are a bit wide but my head is tall and skinny. These are ski goggles as sunglasses. They keep the brow of the glasses off my eyebrows which is awesome. The arms of the glasses may press out on the tops of your ears if your head is like mine, but it isn’t truly noticeable or bothersome."
5.0,These leggings are super comfy & super soft. Spent the first time wearing them just rubbing them cause they felt so good 😂 just wish they had side pockets instead of the hide a pocket in the waistband
5.0,"This is a really pretty bracelet, It is nice that you can pick the birth stone.  I received the April color and love it.  The tree is very intricate. The bracelet fits my wrist perfectly and it is stretchy so it should fit most people (probably not people with very small writs). I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion.  If you are looking for a stretchy bracelet to accessorize with this is it."
5.0,love the color is looks perfect
5.0,"Order came in way ahead of estimated time, as usual with anything I order from Amazon. Lock pins were exactly as advertised which totally met my expectations"
5.0,"I'm a size 16, 2x works great! Love the adjustable straps, not see through at all!<br />Looove the pockets - going shopping for another one, maybe two!!!"
5.0,Perfect.  Easy install...
5.0,Very pleased with these....would order again!!
5.0,It looks the same as in pictures. It's super cute I love the color and use it all the time!
5.0,I bought this for my son who likes to listen to his music as he walks to school.  He is very happy with the hat because not he doesn't have to take his headphones to school.  He charges the hat at night and the battery lasts for a long time.  It looks like a regular beanie; the only indication that he's listening to music is the little blue light on the side is on.  I ended up buying two more to give as gifts.
5.0,Great product. Very nice packaging! Fast shipping. Good customer care. Highly recommend this seller!!!
5.0,love the top
5.0,"Rarely do I find things that actually fit well, but this does. It's quite versatile in the fact that you can wear in open with stretchies, or closed as a dress. I love it. I'm gonna order it in every color lol"
5.0,nice size and plenty of slots.  learned my lesson always fly with all your documents within easy reach. this definitely does the trick and the added security puts worries to rest.
5.0,"Bought these for work, I'm a decorative painter.  Very comfortable and thick enough that they are not see through.  Loved them so much I bought 2 more packs.  Some reviewers had sizing concerns, for reference I am 5'2"", 34D cup and weigh 112 lbs.  and the small fits me well."
5.0,"Fits perfectly.  The molded cups, sturdy straps, and comfortable band provide great support without tge cone effect. I definitely recommend this bra if you are heavy chested."
5.0,"I love this knitted beret, it's a good size, very easy to style. I can't wait for mot=re colors."
5.0,Well made and warm. Love them!
5.0,"These were exactly what I was looking for! I was worried these would be too long for my ear, but they fit great! I do need to pinch the right one to make sure it stays up on my ear properly throughout the day for some reason. The left one stays in place no problem. They look fabulous though and are a great price 😊"
5.0,all good timely delivery
5.0,I love this!!!! Perfect sith outfit
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted, fits well into the watch face, and has stood up to tons of sweat and physical activity.  Great buy!"
5.0,I enjoyed receiving these pins.  i wear them often.
5.0,Very pretty hat. Fits well.
5.0,fit perfectly
5.0,"I am very pleased with EVBEA good quality jewelry,  fits great and i always get compliments on their jewelry"
5.0,"Awesome, cheap, well made and fashionable. Dope."
5.0,Liked them but would have ordered smaller
5.0,"I'll just say this Parka is very warm. Perfect for almost  any Winter activity, the fit may be a little large for some wearers. I find mine fits like a glove. I tried on both a Large and the Extra Large sizes of this parka. The size difference did not seem to be too great. According to the Patagonia size guide I should be wearing the XL or the XXL, but the Large is just  right for me at 5'3'' 183lbs.  The Underwater Blue color is actually more blue than blue green as the picture shows, and I am not really concerned about the color. Just how well this parka performs.  I would have preferred more control over the hood adjustment than just the one device on the back of the hood. Other than that no complaints.  It does come with a stuff sack, but I was taught to put the whole parka into the hood, which turns it into an instant pillow."
5.0,it is extremely well made and my daughter in law loved itas a gift
5.0,This was a perfect gift and fit as expected.
5.0,Loved these but they were just too small.  I love Vivicastle clothes!
5.0,This is so adorable! My daughter loves it and looks so cute in it! My kids love playing dress up and this was a huge hit. Love it!
5.0,"The product look nice and shiny, but the size is  small , for women this is perfect looking."
5.0,This was very pretty. I really liked it. It says casual but I think it is very versatile. I would use it for casual or for something nicer. It really was very pretty and very flattering. It was also soft and provided warmth. I think this would make a very nice gift for someone. It would be good for a birthday or Mother's Day. I would recommend it.
5.0,It is exactly what it looks like in the picture (which is great)!  It is adjustable and seems sturdy.
5.0,"The Jogal products run small.<br />Shirt is the bomb, many compliments for crazy design."
5.0,I like this swimsuit cos the stripes look cool on it.
5.0,"I bought the black pair and I'm in love. If the pink pair were available in a 12 or 13, I would buy those too."
5.0,"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!! SUPER CUTE! MY MOM LOVES IT, #1 GIFT ON HER LIST!"
5.0,Beautiful jewelry and arrived within a reasonable time.
5.0,"Perfect, just like the picture"
5.0,My 7 year old son is a huge Brady fan! This was his favorite Christmas present.
5.0,"I love this shirt!!! I’m a college girl and it works for everything. It’s cropped but goes down right above my belly button. It’s breathable, I wear it for game days and going out with friends. Very versatile!!!!"
5.0,Excellent Quality
5.0,I am very pleased with these stockings. They are very comfortable!! I have ordered more.
5.0,Absolutely loved this dress! Who can resist a dress with pockets. Nice material and great fit!
5.0,"The price is right and they didn't fall apart the first time I put them on, they're super adorable and make me feel like a princess! I'm totally happy with them!"
5.0,"I love how the band is 5 rows of blingy chains but it looks like one solid band. It’s really comfy and they give you the matching screen protector and lots of extra hinges to extend the band and make it as big or small as you want. I used one extra link, for a total of 2 as you can see in the pic of my wrist. I’m not sure about how it will hold up washing my hands every day but I’ll update my review in a couple months to let you know!"
5.0,"I bought these for myself, my daughter and granddaughter. They are well-made and awesome looking."
5.0,Me gustaron mucho espero que a mi hermano y sobrino también
5.0,"Nice, heavy band.  Much better than bands of similar style I've worn in the past.  This a good one.  100% satisfied !"
5.0,Bought this for my daughter who's been bugging me for a New York hoodie for the longest. The spatter is very colorful and the picture is a good representation of what the hoodie actually looks like. She loves it so I love it.
5.0,This is the cutest little key ring that I got to go with my new car..wish I could find one for a ford too..
5.0,"These are really good quality which was a bit surprising to me because of the lovely cheap price. I bought some identical nose rings from icing and from some websites online and the little diamond stud aways ends up falling out after a few weeks of having it in. I've had my nose ring in for 2 months now and the diamonds still in and shining!! i love the colors in this pack, would definitely recommend."
5.0,Great for price. Comes with a weird smell but as you use it the smell fades
5.0,"I love this dress and how versatile it is. The perfect dress for work but also a night out when you wear it with a leather jacket and combat boots. I bought the Small size and it fits perfectly. For reference, I’m 5’3 and about 120lbs. The material is not see through and very comfortable!"
5.0,"Like the material, satin finish! Easy to clean and good quality product."
5.0,"My Oakley Probation fits well into the case, even with the cloth bag. The case is somewhat hard, which is good."
5.0,great shirt/jacket
5.0,I bought this scarf for my husband and the colors are awesome and just what he was looking for. He loves it. It is also a very soft scarf. I would buy from Seth Roberts again for sure.
5.0,This is a gift for someone so I am not sure of the fit but I am very pleased with the quality.
5.0,"These make my waist, butt and legs look awesome! I feel so confident walking into my office wearing these!"
5.0,They're comfortable and better looking than my old black plastic ones.  I'll buy more.
5.0,I absolutely love my leopard dress! It’s beautiful and such good quality. I got so many compliments too!
5.0,Very heavy and thick keys. Perfect for what I needed
5.0,"I got the ""Multicolored"" pattern, which is basically horizontal rainbow stripes on the body of the dress and then long sleeves in black and white stripes.  This is such a unique looking dress.  I thought it was cute.  I showed my 3 year old, and she said that she likes it, so I got it.  Because it's so unique and is a quirky-cute / ugly-cute look, I think that you should show the child first.  I feel like it's a love it / hate it dress, and I could see a child disliking it.<br /><br />Material and construction:  The product description says 95% cotton and 5% spandex.  This is inaccurate.  When the dress comes, the tag sewn in the dress says ""100% cotton"" and the dress feels like 100% cotton.  5% spandex is a lot of stretch, and this does not have that lots of stretch - it stretches like a 100% cotton jersey knit, but not as much as a spandex blend.  It does seem to be somewhat wrinkle resistant, which may be the thickness of the fabric.  The fabric is all cotton jersey knit.  Fabric is yarn dyed (ie. dyed before it's knit), so colors should stay bright through lots of wear and washing.  Stitching and construction is OK.  All the hems are folded over and then serged in place.  The interior seams are sewn together and then loose edges serged together to prevent unraveling or snagging.<br /><br />Size:  With these no-name-brands, sometimes they run very small.  I have been burned in the past, and gotten a super cute dress that was way too small.  So now I go really big, and my daughter can grow into it.  I prefer that to ordering her correct size, and getting something labeled in that size but obviously much smaller.  For my 3 year old, who is going on 4 in a few months, I got size 7 years.  The dress came labeled 140, in case that helps know the size.  (140 is a Chinese size, and enough clothing comes with the Chinese sizes on the label, that I actually now know the Chinese sizes for my kids.)  It is a good fit for the 3 year old (going on 4), and she is average sized for her age.  This dress has some stretch, but will look better with an accurate fit, and if you get it too small, it almost certainly would ride up or be too short.<br /><br />The look:  Multiple styles of dress are sold on this same Amazon product page.  I got ""Multicolored"" which is rainbow stripes.  It's a very unique look.  I think it's a love it / hate it look.  I love it and think it's very cute.  I liked it online, and was not disappointed when it arrived.  I do think that you should show the child this specific dress first, and make sure they like it, because it is so unusual and quirky.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice 100% cotton dress.  It arrived looking just as expected.  The fabric is a good weight and the dress is well constructed.  It runs very small, so go up a size to where you feel uncomfortable and then go up another size after that."
5.0,I love these so much that I got two. They help support Thailand women and are hand made. The adjustable strap has three holes along with a little button made of coconut. It’s so comfortable and doesn’t get in the way. Everything is very sturdy and good quality.
5.0,"It really is very comfortable, very soft and good value for the money."
5.0,"Super cute, well made - exactly what I expected!"
5.0,"Went to Aruba, love love!"
5.0,"Thin, flexible and light. Good product"
5.0,Was a great gift
5.0,These bras are so comfortable and holds me in great. Love the feel. I have bought multiple.
5.0,These headbands are so soft and the floral patterns are just adorable.  My 2 year-old daughter loves to wear them!  I found the price super reasonable and they are of great quality.
5.0,"Got an XL for myself but it was huge and kind of scratchy. However, it fits my husband great (he wears 2X/3X) and he loves it. He wears it over t-shirts and it's his warmest sweater. It also looks really good. It's worth the price."
5.0,"Their tassel looks different every time, I recommend sticking to the bright tassels"
5.0,Perfect compression and a lovely design
5.0,The wait was soooo long that when it did arrive I was both surprised and blown away!<br />These are BEAUTIFUL! I look to be able to pass these to my son someday and he to his...<br />I wish this on anyone looking to add an heirloom set to his accessory wardrobe.
5.0,Just as expected Beautiful
5.0,"These are good and they come with a little white card , if you look at it with these , Glasses there is a car...if that's your thing"
5.0,Love it. Fits great. Feels great.
5.0,"I ordered a size Small because that is the smallest size listed.  It is very roomy on me - just as expected.  I LOVE this sleep shirt.  I previously ordered the short sleeve/ boxer short set, and decided I had to have this one as well.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE both!<br /><br />I do want to mention that when I read the reviews I saw a message stating that this is not silk.  That person is wrong. It did have a bit of a glossy sheen when I first opened it, but that disappeared after washing. I love sleeping in silk - and I love this night shirt!"
5.0,Great Shoes!  My most comfortable going out shoes!
5.0,I am a collector of things like this. I absolutely love this one. The red stands out against the black tag. I am keeping this in the box as a collector's item. I usually collect peanuts stuff but this tag was too cute to pass up. Coach makes the cutest stuff and when you can catch them for a good price on Amazon snatch them up!!
5.0,Looks great and is warm in sub 55 weather. I was borderline sweating with it on.
5.0,Me fascinó y fue la atracción de su graduación de 4to año Gracias
5.0,"This is such a cute workout set. It’s very stretchy and comfortable. Looks better in person. I absolutely love the material and color of this fabric. The delivery was fast, I honestly can’t wait to wear this to the gym."
5.0,Almost tossed a pair of $119 slippers due to the fact that the inner sole was falling apart.  Thank goodness for the replacements!
5.0,satisfecho
5.0,Love this shirt.  Nothing bad to say about it.
5.0,I love it!  You don’t have to cross the steps and it can still work.
5.0,Really good material. Got it as a gift and the person really loved it. Sizing is a little big so I would order size down.
5.0,Nice quality... light weight<br />work watch
5.0,Beautiful pin! My co-worker/friend loved it!
5.0,"Good combination of pearls and silver, for a classy look!"
5.0,This may be the most ridiculous looking thing I ever bought. . . but I absolutely love it! I have fibromyalgia and it makes my eyes very light sensitive. I wear this inside to block the glare of florescent and other over-head lights. It's just what I needed! I wish I'd know about this years ago!
5.0,I really like the shape and feel of the leggings!
5.0,A nice easy to wear thin fabric that breaks in very fast. A perfect forest green. Great hardware.
5.0,"These are great for running, they are light, don't bounce, block the sun.  They also have lots of fun colors and designs.  Great price."
5.0,"Muy linda pulsera, tal cual a la imagen"
5.0,I love Reef flip flops theybhave more cushion then regular flip flops the last pair I had lasted five years!
5.0,Daughter loves these rings
5.0,Pretty happy with the size of these. Haven't used them but they look cute.
5.0,Happy with the shirt and stickers:-)
5.0,"Love the color and design, fits as expected.  Overall an adorable shirt for any southern lady! I'm attaching a photo of the front since at the time of this review the product page doesn't include one."
5.0,My friend loved it! Wish it was a little bigger though.
5.0,"This shirt was a gift and the recipient loved the wicking action and long sleeves. He's a Florida surfer. The shirt provides protection from sun, surf, & board. Color was perfect!"
5.0,I liked it alot
5.0,I loved the lace sleeves. Looked great on.
5.0,"I'm a little obsessed with moon and star themed anything. For some time now I've been looking for a moon/star necklace. I was particularly fond of the y lariat necklace with the star going thru the moon.. which, btw, I also made a truthful yet comedic review for... I found this under things I might like and thought it was cute and affordable so ordered it as well. Once again, the product I bought as a backup (which would be this) ended up being the superior item. I never expect much when purchasing inexpensive jewelry and know the chances of it being broken and lost or turning my skin green are pretty good. This exceeded even my low expectations! I have to clean it every few days to bring back the shine but that's bc I rarely take it off."
5.0,Beautiful. Should only wear while walking around. My daughter tried to wear it for a dance performance and it broke. But it's very pretty.
5.0,"The sweater is a great buy. I have had it about a week. It is well-made, stylish, comfortable and warm. It is even lined with an interior pocket. It is true that the zipper is on the “wrong” side, but it is Irish. A minor point. Don’t they drive on the left over there?"
5.0,Love it thank you so much!
5.0,Got these for the gym showers. Can't beat them for the price. They fit and work as expected.
5.0,"These are a perfect replacement for the Fitbit Alta band.<br /><br />The large that I bought, are slightly shorter than the original but that even makes them better for those with smaller and medium wrist sizes - they might fit them just fine, too, should family members share from the same band order.  Also, these bands fit flush to the display of the Fitbit Alta - the original band rises slightly above it.  Don't know if that was intentional to help protect the Fitbit Alta from scratches, but I have had no trouble whatsoever with these replacement bands.  With normal use of my Fitbit Alta for over a year now, I have yet to scratch the display, and I wear it all the time everywhere.  Also, the connector that fastens the bands together appears to be made of aluminum or an alloy - it will not rust from perspiration or rainy weather.  I highly recommend these to anyone wanting replacements with a good color choice.  (I had to laugh when I bought a set for my daughter and she said she would never use all the colors.  I told her she could change them to suit her outfits when she went out, if she wanted.  Ladies do that kind of thing, don't they? lol)"
5.0,Perfect if you are a person that gets hot wearing a shirt under a sweater
5.0,Do not know about fit as I bought it for a good friend for a sleep shirt. I noticed it was soft and decoration looked goods. She loved the shirt.
5.0,Loved the shirt. It is not cotton but material feels nice and cool.
5.0,"Nice inexpensive pair of polarized glasses, they even come with a case for safe keeping."
5.0,I got these tops in grey and black and I love them. They are exactly as pictured. I went up a size because other reviewers claimed this product runs a bit small. I normally wear a small and the medium fits perfectly.
5.0,Remind me of my club master ray bans. I got these bc they are polarized.
5.0,great purchase for the price
5.0,"I was looking for the perfect pendant necklace at a great price.  I wanted a substantial pendant and a thicker chain with some detail, and this is perfect!  Looks very expensive, nice wright, and the quality seems very good.  Rhinestones look nice and not cheap.  This is as pretty a pendant as I have seen anywhere.  Will definitely be ordering more jewelry from this seller!"
5.0,Fit as expected and I am pleased though they are a bit pricey.  I have since found others just as good but considerably less expensive.
5.0,"I loved them fits perfectly, and they're durable"
5.0,"I am 5'-4&#34; and weight ~120 pounds. I typically wear a US Size 2 or a small in similar women's styles. I ordered the iGENJUN Women's Casual Sleeveless Midi Tour Dress Vintage Dresses in a size Large based on the provided dimensions from the seller. The Large is WAY TOO BIG on me! I am returning the Large and am waiting for a Small to ship. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND ORDERING YOUR NORMAL US SIZE. The dress, although wide, is a great conservative style for the workplace during the summer months. The wide sleeves offer enough coverage to avoid needing a sweater or jacket over the top. The skirt hits mid-thigh and is an appropriate length for work or a date with my husband. I would definitely wear this dress to work on a day when I know I am going out to dinner with my husband. The cowl neck is flattering, yet provides full coverage for my chest. I can't wait to get this dress in the right size and wear it to work! I will post an update on the fit once my new dress arrives.<br /><br />The style of the dress is exactly as photographed by the seller. The material is a heavy weight jersey cotton material. It is soft against the body. The hems and seams of the dress are all very well constructed and smooth. They do not irritate. There is some stretch to the material, which allows for some play when you order your size. The cotton material is easy care in the washing machine. It washes and dries on normal cycle. The dress includes pockets too, which is a great bonus. I love being able to stick my phone or my work ID into my pocket when I leave my desk on my lunch break. Most of my dresses don't have a place for me to stick these things. Having a pocket is always a great bonus, in my opinion.<br /><br />Despite my trouble finding the right size originally, I love the style of this dress. It is chic and classic, yet conservative enough to wear to work. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new addition to their daily work wardrobe. It ships quickly and since it is Prime eligible, is easy to return in the event that the fit is not correct. I recommend ordering your normal US size (disregard the measurements from the seller). This dress makes a great gift for the friends, girlfriends, wives and moms in your life.<br /><br />Update (7/20/16): I received the dress is my true size (small) and it fits perfectly. The wide sleeves are great to wear to work on a hot summer day. The length is office appropriate. It hits just above the knee. The waist hits at my natural waist. It is snug but not too tight. Same goes for the chest. The elasticity of the material makes for a great fit.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful. If so, I'd appreciate you clicking the &#34;helpful&#34; button!"
5.0,Love it! Great product at a low price!!
5.0,I love this piece so much ! It is cotton and the size is true. Perfect for lounging or the beach . Feels good on ! I recommend it.
5.0,"It's a gift for my daughter, Meredith."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:14686f4c8fc8b165ed628f8fbef830fd]] My husband is a trucker and he goes through wallets a lot. He only likes trifold wallets and it has to have a lot of different slots. This has it all I think, I'm just hoping he feels the same."
5.0,"True to size! Super comfortable, stretchy, and light. I love it so much!"
5.0,"I was super weary about sizing issues, so I ordered an XL. I'm almost 5'4, ~140 pounds with somewhat broad shoulders so I didn't want to get a size that would squeeze my arms. I probably should have gone with an L; the length was long enough where I have to wear heels for it to barely sweep the floor, and I would have liked the body to be a bit more snug. Seems like the size chart is correct in this case.<br /><br />I did like the dress itself, but I didn't really like how it looked on me. Maybe it was the pattern I chose. Anyhow, buy from amazon verified sellers if you're worried about consistency. They have more motivation to give you a product that looks like the photo!"
5.0,So many compliments - great top for a good price.
5.0,"I've worn the watch that goes with this band every day for years, so I was so sad when the little piece that holds the band flat snapped off. Instead of getting a whole new watch I just replaced the band, and this one was much cheaper than the identical one on the swatch website. Like the previous reviewer I also bought the original watch/armband in Europe, but I haven't noticed any major quality differences. I've only been using this one for about a month, but so far I'm perfectly happy with it and it's doing its job just like the old one."
5.0,"The feel and sizing are perfect. High quality. Get plenty of compliments.<br />I got a large and it fits well. I am 5'9"", 183 lbs."
5.0,It is cute and I love it.
5.0,"My 3 years old grandson loves wearing this mask, the design is very cool, lightweight, and most importantly it is comfortable on his face, the ear straps are easily adjusted.  It’s a great reusable product I would say!"
5.0,Beautiful and dainty. Don't buy if your looking for an earring that really stands out.
5.0,I love them.  They fit me very well and the color is the same as advertised.
5.0,"Such a great buy! Super cute. Good material and the fit is true to size. I'm 125 5""2 and bought a small."
5.0,"I love this hat!!!!!!!!  Great price for a great hat.  I removed the décor and added my own flowers and feathers in darker colors and sewed up the front for a 1920's look.  It was a huge hit and got me lots of compliments and a photo on the event site by their professional photographer,  that I went to."
5.0,My daughter is obsessed over cats so this was puurfect 😂😅 she loves them even more because our cat is white so she thinks it’s him on her shoes hehe the quality is good and the product is a 8/10
5.0,Too tight around my waist getting a bigger sizes
5.0,This is the right item if you are looking for bling.
5.0,Sprayed CREP on my sneakers before the hike.  Got home after walking through a muddy trail - used the included brush - sneakers look like new.  Great product!  It's worth the extra few bucks.
5.0,Great for a costume especially when you are worried about sizing for a mail shirt. One size fits all. Light weight aluminum and riveted so no worried about links falling off. Highly recommend.
5.0,My Mother loves it.
5.0,"I would highly recommend. I wear these religiously in the fall and winter with my tall boots, booties, loafers, tennis shoes etc. Don't hesitate. Purchase now."
5.0,Feel Nice

5.0,love this blouse!
5.0,"These gloves are great.  While I haven't had them for long, they seem very durable and are comfortable to wear.  Would definitely buy again."
5.0,I bought this for my car keys and it lasted for over a year didn’t fall sort or anything I just recently through it away because I bought a new one

5.0,perfect for Easter!
5.0,Like the band; certainly long enough. A little stiff but I guess that will change. Just wish there was a way to remove metal rings not used for my watch.
5.0,Perfect for my bling business! Cute little well made shoes!
5.0,best bag I've bought!
5.0,Perfect fit. I got this at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I got it for my husband and it fits perfect.The design is wood with black trim. It Fit him perfectly.
5.0,Beautiful and well done dress
5.0,I love these pants. Ordered these after receiving a white pair. The lightweight fabric is not too sheer at all and is very comfortable especially in warm weather. The fit is perfect and the pants did not shrink in the dryer after washing. These have been my go to staple in my summer wardrobe. I can dress them up with a nice gauzy tunic and a long necklace or keep it casual with a knit top and sneakers. Thinking I'll order a black pair for fall since it stays warm til mid October here in NC. I've been so pleased with my purchase and I think you will be too!
5.0,"Very beautiful colors, comfortable, & came quickly!"
5.0,"Item is beautiful and would like to buy more. However, the shipping is getting in the way. You pay the same for the shipping as you do for the product and no credit for buying more than one."
5.0,This is beautiful.  Perfect for summer.  The colors are nice and muted so not gaudy.
5.0,I love these!  Really nice and high quality sunglasses! They're definitely comparable to Ray-ban.  I like that these are oversized because I have a larger face.  You can adjust the nose pieces so you know you'll get a good fit.  They look fantastic on and they are lightweight but sturdy and comfortable to wear.  Very good construction.  I do recommend.
5.0,Super cute. I love the silicone but these are much more feminine and give my arm the ability to breathe but seem super secure
5.0,They are more like fleece lined sweatpants than leggings. Which I actually like better. These will for sure keep your kids warm and look good.
5.0,I like it has a lot of stretch you can size down
5.0,Very large and holds well. Very pretty. Kid is very happy with it.
5.0,Love this little cuff!  Stays on with no issues and is very pretty.
5.0,Slimming

5.0,"Ordered my regular US size M. The shirt fits like the model. Roomy & so comfortable. Soft material. Reversible too. The Grass Green is as shown, a beautiful Jade Grass Green. I rarely wear anything with a V at the back as my I am sensitive to seams but this one is sewn well & feels good."
5.0,Love this dress! Ordered two more!
5.0,cute and durable. you will like it. looks better physically
5.0,"Adorable purse!<br />Purchased for my daughter and she loves it.<br />Two carry options, long chain strap or two small handles. Glitter seems to stay put.<br />Note, this is not an adult size purse; but perfect for a small child."
5.0,I am size L in US and bought size L and it fits great and looks beautiful.!
5.0,"Amazing! It's perfect to wear all the time, reduce body fat and work your posture. A+++++<br />Loved it! The customer service ever as well!<br />Thank you!!😉"
5.0,This looks great!
5.0,Looks exactly like the picture . I love it!
5.0,Arrived on time and as expected in new condition
5.0,I run obstacle course races and needed something to keep me warm in the middle of the night after I got wet.  I didn't want to spend hundreds on a name brand wet suit top so I decided to try this one.  I was extremely happy to find that this top warmed me up and kept me warm through the night.  What's night about it is the jacket design is easy to put on and take off.  Definitely will but one again if needed.
5.0,Love the colors and durability of these - sounds each one makes puts a smile on your face
5.0,"Super cute key chain, just like the picture!  Durable as well!  Would buy again !"
5.0,I used to wear a straw hat while working in the yard.  This works better and gives me more protection from the sun.  My face is shaded and my neck.  The tie keeps the hat in place.
5.0,"Beautiful design but disliked you can’t adjust the chain strap for a short person, it’s too long. Overall, my auntie love it so much, I had to order her sister one too."
5.0,It’s a nice band.  Easy to adjust.
5.0,Love them....gonna order more for gifts.....
5.0,"Good quality seems like and the size I was expecting! Came in a day before the expected 3-5 day wait and in the same package as the other 3 sets I bought, pretty convenient! Thank you."
5.0,It's very normal and nothing about it is a quality. It's very annoying is that there's no space for Tasbih at all . I'll have to re do it all over again. It's worth 2$ maximum.
5.0,"These are just like the picture. The fabric is light and breathable, perfect for hotter days. They run small, but I expected that so I ordered a size up and they fit great! Very comfortable."
5.0,Just as I expected ! Very nice.
5.0,These shirts are made very nice and good quality. I cannot believe how nice they were for the cost. I would definitely buy them again in different styles or designs
5.0,"I love it! It's light weight, it's comfortable to carry, it's roomy inside with open & zipped pockets. The price is nice too!"
5.0,Really pretty lanyard. Seems very well made.  Lightweight yet sturdy. The milky beads and crystals make it look more like a necklace.  I use it to wear my medical alert button.  Much prettier than that plain black cord!
5.0,Brought this jacket for my husband and he loves it the size was perfect material is great looks just like the picture
5.0,Very stylish and up to date frames. Love it.
5.0,I wore it to a wedding and got a few compliments. It's a tie so I don't know what you were expecting from a review. It came as advertised.
5.0,Put on my shell and matches great with Ranger jerseys !!!
5.0,Love the scarf great colors!
5.0,This scarf is beautiful as it looks in the picture.
5.0,"I liked the style, they were just too small"
5.0,It look the same as in rhe picture nuce and unespencive just like i want it
5.0,Gorgeous and look forward to wearing it.
5.0,"Wore my hat have a Juneteenth event! Everybody loved it including me! Great material, great quality, great work!"
5.0,"This dress is so beautiful!  A nice soft fabric, with a slightly tapered in waist with irregular fabric accents, and a pencil skirt with 3/4 inch sleeves make you look sleek and professional. The fabric isn't see through or itchy, and the whole piece covers you and makes you look chic in any circumstance. The skirt hits at my knees and I'm 5'8"", and can be paired with any shoe or belt. Feels solid, sturdy, and is one of my favorite pieces."
5.0,"Love this tunic top, the fit is perfect the material is great it is very comfortable. I highly recommend purchasing this top. Sorry the picture of me is not so good, had a long day of travel and was still tired, lol. Get this top you will love it."
5.0,Very thick and cute!
5.0,Great gloves. Fit well and sturdy
5.0,Quality was great . It was a gift for a teen and he is loving it. Was a little bit to big he is size 10 1/2 only offered whole sizes so I took the 11. But bought the stick inside silicon ring sizers worked great.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:56848966de57bed03b76be8679756984]] I absolutely love this band.  I get complements constantly! Great quality,  easy to fit to the wrist by removing pieces with included device."
5.0,"I wear pants with a 40-inch waist, so this belt just fits.  I had trouble putting it on at first because the prongs get caught in my belt loops.  The trick is to put it on “backwards”, that is “buckle” first.  Then there’s no problem with it catching."
5.0,"Wife loved it, pretty cheap, would recommend"
5.0,Extremely nice belt. You're sizing advice resulted in a perfect fit. Your husband picked a great name for your company. Thanks and good luck.
5.0,Great looking pair of white shorts that are well made and well priced.<br />These shorter styles are very flattering if you have nice legs like I do.<br />Most of the time all the stores have is ugly junk for sale.<br />America has become a place with no fashion sense and a lot of fat ugly people wandering around.<br />If you are good looking like me do your part to beautify the area and buy a pair of these shorts.<br />It probably makes all the ugly people jealous which is exactly what I like doing.<br />Hey I'm just being a wise guy get over it.<br />If you can't take a joke go find a safe space and have a nice cry.<br />Is this too political a review to be on Amazon?<br />I'll find out in a week if they post it ha ha.
5.0,Gave as 60th gift. She loved it! Good weight and looked REAL!
5.0,"My favorite pj's.  Bought some for my 94 year old Mother also and she loves them.  She is on hospice and wears them like lounging clothes, all day and all night.  They are very comfortable.  They keep you warm enough, but not too warm as fleece would."
5.0,"This is an extremely comfortable watch to wear. Weighing in at just 21 grams you don't even feel you are wearing anything. The display is easy to read and the watch with all its functions is easy and intuitive to operate. The retro classic design is timeless (no pun intended!) I've been wearing this watch for a week now and am very pleased. The only criticism is the light on it doesn't illuminate the face well for easy reading in dark settings but it's still OK. With its ~$12 price tag, this watch is, hands down, the best value watch I've ever had. Casio is a respectable name with a long tradition in digital watches. I highly recommend this watch to anyone."
5.0,"Love it.  It’s soft, nice fit and attractive. I got the teal in medium.  I’m 5’6” and 125lbs. Highly recommend."
5.0,The stone hasn't fallen out after weeks of wear.  That is a major win for me.
5.0,The shirt was perfectly sized and comfortable!
5.0,They are just like the are pictured. Very cute! I like them!!!
5.0,Only received 11 in pack
5.0,Granddaughter loves them
5.0,I have tried two other waist trainers and they had boning in them that poked into my chest and made them very uncomfortable. This one doesn't have that so I prefer it since the Velcro straps make it easier to cinch to the size I want. I will say that it you have sensitive skin and live in a hot climate this may irritate your skin- min was a bit chaffed since I live in Florida and can't avoid sweating so I put a very thin tank top on and this over it. That helped protect my skin and I'm able to wear it for hours and be comfortable.
5.0,These boots are beautiful!!! Perfect color to transition into Fall! True to size ( if anything a tad on the bigger side but I prefer that w/ a pointed toe ) . Quality is amazing ! Highly recommend!
5.0,"I'm 5'4.5"" a 130lbs the dress fit great. The hem came right above the knee. I ordered a med."
5.0,Second one bought...wore first one OUT!
5.0,They are well made and feel great.
5.0,THE LINKS ARE GREAT BUT NO SANTA CLAUS CHRISTMAS ARRIVED WITH THEM. THIS WAS DISAPPOINTING AS I PLAN TO PUT THE LINKS IN MY BOX OF GIFTS FOR NEXT XMAS. MAYBE THE LISTING IS A BIT CONFUSING.
5.0,This bag is huge. My husband had to go out of state for work and it easily held a whole week of his clothes. The fact that it zips up so small when not in use makes it easy to store. I just hung it on a hanger and but it in our coat closet!
5.0,"I love how loose and flowy it is. It has the perfect amount of coverage over my swimsuit. There are sleeve holes, so I don't have to constantly hold on to around my shoulders. It's sheer and classy."
5.0,"This shirt was brought for my 11 year old and he loves it. He's 5ft 109 pounds and the extra large fits great with some space in the mid- section. The design on the front is so unique, I love it."
5.0,This top is quite vibrant and goes great with jeans.  Nice weight top.  Washes up beautifully.  I have at least a dozen Jess & Jane tops as they are consistently great quality.
5.0,"Perfect, so Beautiful"
5.0,She loves wearing this
5.0,"Fast shipping, arrived on time, and very happy that it's soft and color matches the picture! Thanks!"
5.0,I used it to help wit my weight lost and it does great haven’t had a problem wit it yet
5.0,extremely comfortable and prevents foot blisters in weekend warrior.  Firm elastic fit that holds socks up.
5.0,It's just right.  Not too scrunchy but droops in the back just right.  It's warm and snuggly.  Has a nice design to it.  I like it a lot.  Might get another one in another color.
5.0,Even prettier in person. Looks like expensive earrings
5.0,"I got the matching Relleciga sports bra and high waisted shorts and I love the set. Great material, well sewn, so stylish and easy to move in. The shorts do run a little small though, so double check their sizing. The outfit is absolutely adorable... I would recommend getting the full set!"
5.0,Matches my style so well. I get so many compliments on this band.
5.0,Love the rose gold color.  Hope they make more snaps in the rose gold.
5.0,"Quality, stretchy, cool!"
5.0,"If you are a flat chested, plus size woman, you know how hard it is to find a good push up bra without those gawd awful wires!!!  The insert pouch is so perfect! You need not look any further! This had the large enough rib cage band combined with the less than massive cup size you normally have to settle for."
5.0,"could not find a two fold in this style for years in local department stores. could only find the conventional kind,with the card slots running horizontal,(open the wallet,half the cards fall out),will be buying a back-up of this same style for future use..............."
5.0,Material seems durable however it is see - through
5.0,Perfect! Just what I was looking for
5.0,"These are perfect for driving. Fast shipping,too."
5.0,"The fabric of this pant is a cotton/poly mix, and is very comfortable.  I notice that the pant does have moisture wicking properties.  It is a very slim fit, bordering on the skinny fit side, but the pant does come true to size.  Absolutely LOVE the pieced accents on the fronts and side.  Generous pockets both in the front and back.  Fabric is thick enough, and not transparent.  The pant is very comfortable, and warm on a cool morning jog.  A very hip look that isn't all hype.  Great with a sweatshirt or tee, yet still light enough to wear in the summer as well as winter."
5.0,My little granddaughter likes these!
5.0,Nice price for all everything you get! Color and quality is Good!
5.0,"I got a size medium. I'm 5'0, have an athletic build, small waist, big thighs and big butt and a size 34A in bras. I usually wear a size small in normal clothing but with my butt, I was worried it was going to dig into it and make it look unflattering. Anyways, I was very nervous that getting a medium would be too big but it fit PERFECTLY! The material is great and has two thick layers so it is not see through. It is honestly such a great material bathing suit that it may even be better than the bathing suits at Forever 21. This is my most favorite bikini yet and with that price I would recommend this to everyone! Don't hesitate to get this bathing suit. If you are worried about it being too small on the bottom, I recommend that you size up. You can always adjust the top anyways."
5.0,Love this top!!  Have others and this one is Perfect!
5.0,I really have enjoyed the benefits that the bracelet offers. It has made a difference in my health(rest and sleep). Thank you
5.0,Dealer great to work with!
5.0,LOVE THIS
5.0,The mask are very shiny and blingy and fit is perfect and they are very breathable
5.0,These are probably one of the most comfortable flip flops I have ever owned!  Size was perfect.  Have gotten them wet with no staining.  Comfortable with no slipping.
5.0,I bought this with a petticoat to go underneath. I wore it for a wedding and have never gotten so many compliments on an outfit. I would buy from this company again.
5.0,Beautiful high quality earrings I bought both gold and silver you can wear them dress down or when stepping out to high end event.
5.0,"This necklace was just what I was looking for as an alternate to the shorter chain that came with the original necklace.  I'm not sure how they got the stainless steel to look golden, but it's great!  Thank you."
5.0,These are awesome! Great quality and value. The fit both adults and kids wonderfully and are soft and comfortable. I highly recommend them. These are the best ones I have every used.
5.0,i love this jumpsuit it is just really cute
5.0,"Pretty, pretty, pretty...Love it!"
5.0,I like what I got
5.0,They fit nice and can be used for exercise or casual dress
5.0,Cheap and cute cute! Got medium. I am 5'3&#34; 121 lbs. 35-27.5-34.5.  Not finished hem. Sort of cheapy Halloween costume material but it hangs well and you can't tell.
5.0,Muy buen tamaño
5.0,"Very nice fit, fabric just right. I wore these at Palo Duro Canyon in TX, it was 104 degrees and I was comfortable!"
5.0,"FYI I bought these actually for Oakley Chainlink even though they say it's for Crosslink.  Same fit, I checked the measurements.  The only thing about these is they say it's soft, but it's much harder than the OEM Oakley soft silicone.<br /><br />This isn't really a problem, as the nose pads fit fine and are fairly comfortable, but they aren't grippy like the originals.  If that matters to you, choose accordingly."
5.0,I wasn't really sure how these were going to look but I was pleasantly surprised at the heft and weight! Great feeling and great looking. Lots of variety as well. Works great as a charm for my handmade dice bags.
5.0,Love it fits great i got a 2 x
5.0,Love this top also love the back the opening is perfect so it Fall nice on you if you wearing pants or a skirt .I adding a beautiful sparkly brooch to the front  And back it look so classy and gorgeous got so many complements.
5.0,"Liz at the company sent me a new one because the one I had originally bought came in a knot. Now that I can wear it, it is beautiful. Customer service was A+!"
5.0,delivered faster than originally told it would be - was a gift and he loved it!
5.0,I get lots of compliments
5.0,"Totally love this necklace!<br />It will never tarnish and is so sturdy.<br />I never take it off, not even when I sleep or shower. Awesome gift idea too!"
5.0,great price !! quick shipping too
5.0,Love it. Great fabric. A good deal.
5.0,Checkbook cover colors were vivid and beautiful and it was made well.  I would definitely order another.
5.0,This jacket is super cool. I thought I bought a large but turns out I bought a xLarge so whoops. Oh well just means it will last longer and keep my hands warm.
5.0,Awesome key necklace. I wear each one separate and they both are very nice.
5.0,"This dress is so great! It fit perfectly, it's super soft, and really cute on. I'm so happy with this purchase."
5.0,"Was a little smaller than I expected,  but it's a quality item"
5.0,"This dress is a vibrant green and white dress.  The fabric of the printed versions of this dress is a lot more stable (less stretchy) than its solid versions.  Bust coverage is good, but if you have girls like mine that seem to have a mind of their own, you need to make sure you have on a good bra or there will be a cleavage show for sure.  Bustier gals please keep that in mind when purchasing.  The cap sleeves are awesome. This is a light to medium weight fabric with some stretch, as previously mentioned.  I really like this style of dress from MUXXN!"
5.0,"I like this cap because it’s comfortable and cool. It stays put at night and during the day, and it’s attractive,"
5.0,My daughter fits a size 2-2.5 shes just about to turn 7. I got a size 3 . perfect fit with a half inch of room to grow.  Will purchase again in the future.
5.0,Comfy! Love it!
5.0,"Love this sweater, is so super soft & fit perfect."
5.0,Fits well and stay in place
5.0,"Holds all my credit cards. It has a light weight, but very sturdy and has the look of a much more expensive item."
5.0,"Great product, better than conventional cock ring, stay hard long."
5.0,Beautiful bracelet - I will be wearing it when I visit the Rescue in February!
5.0,Nice lightweight scarf very big scarf felt good onmy neck material soft and easy to work with
5.0,Love the color. Goes good with anything my lo wears. My lo runs in them. And i can have them for when im rushing and dont have to tie shoes.
5.0,I just purchased my 4th pair of these leggings. I love them so much!!! They're the perfect length that they sit right above my ankles (I wear a Small and I'm about 5'3).
5.0,I highly recommend this shirt.  It fits perfect.  It's very light-weight and great for exercising.
5.0,"I saw a review where someone said to use kiss nail glue as the adhesive and thank you for that because it worked perfectly!! Love the shine, love the way they look. Will update when, and if, they fall off!"
5.0,I love it and the price was so cheap for this quality.
5.0,I wish it was a little bit wider so I could get some folding money in it as I have started using this instead of my wallet.  It is very nice I also wish it had a place for a stylus but once again I do love it Just a few hints for the maker in case they want to make it with these hints.  I woould buy another one then.
5.0,Love these computer glasses. Even got my husband to wear them
5.0,Nice and comfortable  for clients
5.0,Don't waste your money on expensive 5.11 tac pants.  These are great quality if not higher and some of the most comfortable ones I own.
5.0,Love it... came in a timely manner and also very stylish plus very easy to use. I will buy more
5.0,Great quality. Super soft
5.0,I love them great. Quality for the price I was very impressed I need to get used to wearing them they are a little tight
5.0,Look just like the real thing
5.0,"Great little wallet, good quality."
5.0,I use this in my ears when I shower because it does not absolve water like cotton does.  Works well
5.0,"Bought a large,, I wear a 38DD  and my boobs fit great and the dress doesn't slip down. Good length, good pockets size and placement. So comfortable"
5.0,Actually better quality than I expected for the price.
5.0,We keep this hanging on our pantry door knob and use it for chopping onions!  Works great. Doesn’t fit over glasses though that’s to be expected.
5.0,love the feel of these...like butter!!
5.0,"Great dark green, softness, length and feel. Warm and cozy. Fits loosely."
5.0,Dress up your jeans with this beautiful blouse
5.0,Very nice shirt and great material
5.0,We used these little warm guys as a prop in a show then donated them to a shelter.
5.0,"This costume is amazing, high quality and very well made. The red dress is a bit loose up top, I ordered a small. Its nothing that can't be adjusted and the seller did ask for custom sizes. For me, I didn't have time to provide my specific measurements and went with the standard.<br /><br />The estimated shipping time was 17-30 days, but I received my much faster than the actual estimated delivery date (about 10 days). There are no instructions on how to put on the black / white overlay, but after a bit of tinkering, its easy to find the two clear snap buttons on the dress.<br /><br />I would recommend getting another red petticoat to use under the dress to get that *poof* effect. The red dress from the seller is just the top layer that sits flat when worn alone."
5.0,was great product
5.0,"Love this sweater.  Warm, soft and snuggly."
5.0,"The bee itself is quality made, but the pin behind glued cheaply, came broke 1 side, and other broke while trying to fix the 1st side. Very disappointing, the brooch itself is really cute.<br />Wish the pin was attached more securily. Now it's no use for me. Too much hassle to return... too bad.<br /><br />Update Oct 14:<br />They sent me another exact brooch at no cost. This one is perfect and lovely! Happy Customer!!!"
5.0,Love it. Follow measurements chart. Fits perfect
5.0,"I have a LOT of these types of yoga pants  - some are really good, and others not as good but still useable.  The Due East Apparel High Waist Yoga Capris are almost exactly like my Champion brand black yoga capris.  They are soft. stretchy and very easy to move around in.  I received the large size for review and I'm 5'9"" tall, and 141 pounds. These fit me well and cover my belly button making my stomach look a little flatter than it actually is.  I wear these mainly underneath tennis skirts."
5.0,beautiful  light weight  I received several compliments when  I wore out it out ..
5.0,Gorgeous bag
5.0,"The stone and wiring is BEAUTIFUL! The chain is a little too pink to be considered rose gold. I know that probably sounds like an oxymoron, but trust me it's more of a metallic pink than rose gold. It also comes with a black necklace that is super cute. Overall, I would buy another one."
5.0,"I was looking for a inexpensive hoodie for work. Had to be inexpensive because it will have a short hard life. It looks good and fits just right, nice fuzzy inside. I think it may be nicer than my expensive one. Gonna get another one in a different color."
5.0,Love this jacket!  It was even better than I had expected!
5.0,"Excellent customer service, great product and great quality. Amazing large size fitting 5-6 diapers and wipes, very happy with this purchase.  Highly recommend!"
5.0,Best purse I have ever purchased.
5.0,"I love my frames, very sleek and retro. Always getting compliments when I wear them. Love love love them!!!!"
5.0,"The earrings were a great style but they are not a true white, they are cream or vanilla."
5.0,Got this as a gift for my lady. It is a very nice cloak and well made. It is NOT the cheap type of quality that one typically finds for Halloween costumes.
5.0,Love these!!! Great socks to wear to bed!
5.0,"Fabulous head covering which will fit comfortably even on my large head. Had to wait several months for purple to come in stock, but it was well worth it because that is my favourite colour.<br /><br />This head covering is lightweight, breathes, fits well, is very comfortable, what can I say? I recommend hand-washing and drying though because I feel it will have a longer life that way."
5.0,So cute!! Love it. Love love friends. Cute gift idea :)))
5.0,Used in place of elastic straps for face masks.
5.0,"This is probably my favorite piece of jewelry now, so awesome! It only attaches at one point on the top (as you can see in the pic) but that's been enough for it to stay securely on my ear."
5.0,Great fit for adult women.
5.0,The cutest rocks ever! All came in great quality. Perfect for teens
5.0,Leather has a wonderful feel.  Good quality.  Love them.  Only negative is the tag that sticks out the side.
5.0,TOOK THESE ON VACATION WITH ME AND ABSOLUTELY LOVED THEM !! They look exactly like the Burberry ones
5.0,I have nothing but great things to say about PattyBoutik brand. The material is well made and very soft. I thought the small would be too small when I took it out of the package but it stretches nicely and fits great.
5.0,"I absolutely love love love thus dress ! I am 5'1 149 pounds and it is the perfect length for me. As an elderly woman, I don't like dresses above my knees and this covers my knees. I have to buy another...which they had more colors."
5.0,Stylish and cute
5.0,"My daughter is 5'10&#34;  145 pounds, thin athletic build.  This was just a bit short on her which was upsetting b/c i is SO cute.  She can wear it to the beach over a bathing suit or something, but too short for regular wear, although it fit perfect everywhere else.  If you are tall I'd suggest ordering a size up, however if you are same build as my daughter and a few inches shorter, this would be perfect, and I would definitely recommend, and I would buy again from this seller, just knowing to order up.  Not the sellers fault, with her height clothes buying can be tricky lol."
5.0,My daughter loves her new pair of shoes. Would buy them again.
5.0,Product was as described. Fast shipping and excellent service
5.0,I use them for my husband's everyday jeans.
5.0,"The quality of these surpassed any idea of what I expected! They fit my youngest at 2 and 24 lbs, and seem a little small on anyone bigger, but they’re really cute and designed well."
5.0,"10/10. Material is like butter, and the pockets are perfect."
5.0,"Yes, a very tiny bit of modifications were made to the strap to accommodate the weirdly 23mm lugs, but it wears beautifully against the stainless steel case and face.  The thickness of the strap is just right to not appear too weak or too rugged allowing the watch and strap to maintain a bit of style as a whole without being drawing attention to the strap or watch case as outweighing the other.<br /><br />In order to make this 24mm strap work (and all other non-metal straps for that matter) you must remove a very, very small amount of material around the strap bar hole.  I used a diagonal cut to remove half a millimeter from each side making it a trapezoid.  This aided in getting the band on, accessing the strap bars, and blending the cuts into the remaining strap."
5.0,This product allowed my very sensitive skin daughter to once again wear her earrings without skin irritation. So very nice!!!
5.0,How cool to wear this nice looking belt and open a bottle?  Great fit and secures well. Looks great for casual and work use.
5.0,outstanding !!!!!
5.0,"Its a nice soft material, it fits well, & looks very nice over the dresses I wanted to wear it with."
5.0,These sandals are the cutest!
5.0,"Excellent quality, earring variety, and color ranges!"
5.0,I bought this for niece she is a fan of this band she live it and it fit perfectly
5.0,A great bargain for the price. Lots of compliments .
5.0,"Very tight fitting, almost compression. Wear this running in 20 degree weather quite regularly with no additional layers on top or below and they keep me nice and warm! Wore for a tough mudder obstacle course run in 50 degree weather and withstood the abuse and kept me warm! Fits true to size to slightly small."
5.0,"This is a super sturdy bag that looks amazing. It isn't too heavy and it has a lot of interior space, and it's perfect for someone who does a lot of traveling. The material is really smooth and looks awesome and it's actually bigger than we anticipated. Highly recommended. Full disclosure, I received one of these bags discounted in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"very nice, but smaller than expected"
5.0,"First I have to state, I despise jewelry.  The scheme pricing mass produced, essentially worthless trinkets at a huge multiple of their manufacturing cost is insanity.  This neckless appears scavenged from an aerospace mechanism of great cost.  The closer you look the more you'll be impressed.  A unique gift that will draw attention from every engineer, machinist, and gear head."
5.0,This is a wonderful product! After having my fitbit over a year I looked at my wrist and it was gone! Luckily it was in the yard! With this bit belt that won't be an issue again!
5.0,Excellent product quality. My wife loves it :)
5.0,Didn't think slippers this huge would be too small! Lol! I ordered the wrong size!<br /><br />Super cute though! But apparently they're a little difficult to walk in being as though they are full fledged stuff animals on the front!
5.0,My grandaughter loved the earrings that I got her for her birthday.  The earrings were very pretty.
5.0,"I like Zerogrand, it’s onr of the best model from Cole Haan"
5.0,When I opened the package I was immediately struck by the pleasant colors and the hood looks of the braided cord which is very flexible and therefore comfortable. The cord’s connectors effectively attach to the glasses and fi not flip off. Glasses are secure and you don’t lose them. The length allows you to adjust how they hang from your neck. There are no CONS that I have found. They do what I need them to do without a problem.
5.0,my sister loved it for christmas! not sure how durable it is yet but its cute
5.0,This looks really nice ! I used them on winter for a skiing family trip and they were able to keep my feet warm with a 20F  Fahrenheit weather. i will recommend this to anyone !
5.0,"Me encando apesar Que le quedo un pico grande a mi bebe de un año, buena cualidad para el precio y llegó a tiempo"
5.0,Nice feels good.<br />Good quality.<br />Love it.
5.0,SUGOI
5.0,Love the wrap band. A little thicker band then expected but very nice. You can feel the quality in the product
5.0,Super cute!! Material is soft and the size is true to size. I ordered a size 5 and it fits perfect. Not to tight or to loose and it comes to my daughters hips. Love the saying and the style of the shirt. Nothing like sporting bible verses in style💗
5.0,I love this dress. So comfy. I'm 5'5 120 and a small fit great. Plus it has pockets!!!
5.0,THANK YOU!
5.0,It fits. Love the style too. It took me awhile to get it on.
5.0,indescribable
5.0,"These were such a hit at a birthday party. They are bright and last a long time. Great quality, and everyone loved them!"
5.0,"I love it. Glad I purchased it, very soft and fitting. Will buy another"
5.0,We wore it with style!
5.0,great socks simple as that
5.0,The best belt I’ve ever owned
5.0,yes!!
5.0,Its durable and I like the colors
5.0,"I typically wear a 10/12 and have wide hips and a bit of a bum. I ordered these in a large (size 6) and they fit PERFECTLY. They are super comfortable. I wear a lot of high waisted pants and hate having two different wastebands. These makes it feel like I only have one. They also look great. Not like “granny panties”.  They also feel like they are made with quality, not like they will fall apart after one wash like some amazon clothes do. I highly recommend these panties and will be buying more!"
5.0,Love it shirt! I did a large and it fits perfect. Would order again
5.0,The bride loves it
5.0,GREAT WATCH.  Looks great and is actually reliable.  I actually lost mine and I'm coming back to buy a new one.
5.0,By far the best belt I have ever owned.
5.0,I love this pendant. Ever since the first one I got brought me good luck I wore it everywhere until I went to move and lost it. This pendant has a great design and the quality is consistent. Your experience and taste may vary but I recommend getting this pendant.
5.0,"I got these gloves for my wife and they are exactly what I was looking for - the gloves are warm and work great on all screens. They run a little small, my wife is petite and the medium gloves fit her well. I am very happy with these gloves."
5.0,Bought these for my daughter. She has purchased quite a few pair. Very durable! Wash up nicely
5.0,Love how it looks with high waisted jeans
5.0,Talk about such a flattering set! I bought this as an under layer initially. However it is so flattering that it can be worn as a monochromatic casual outfit or simply for lounging. Very stretchy too!
5.0,"This dress is very pretty, and flattering! I am 5'7, usually wear a size 14 but I have broad shoulders so I was worried it wouldn't fit. I ordered a size XXL and it fit perfectly. Falls just below the knee. As other commenters have mentioned, the accent color is blue, not purple, but I don't care, I love the dress."
5.0,I love this cover up.
5.0,"This is my first leggings with this brand and they are really good not only for the price. Incredibly comfortable, thin, and breathable. Love that has two pockets."
5.0,My daughter loves her new nightgown. Super soft and fits perfect
5.0,"Boy friend loved it, and look good in it too."
5.0,Quality and sizing is good.<br />Look nice
5.0,This is an attractive band to add to my Fitbit acccessories.
5.0,"These gloves kept my hands comfortable driving a scooter 35 mph in 30 degrees F for years. Then I took them to the Rockies where they dealt with lots of snow and wind. I almost lost them in a gust when I was adjusting my snowshoes, after 20 mins of chasing them down, they should have been soaked and frozen. Instead they were EXACTLY the same inside as before. They are most definitely water and wind proof. I’ve never had another glove that did what it claimed. But these!!!!!"
5.0,"Great durable bag.  This is actually the 2nd bag I purchased.  The first one was stolen, and I liked it so much I bought it again.  The strap is completely adjustable.  Very comfortable."
5.0,Perfect little charm to add to the wedding favors for our daughters wedding.
5.0,Carries with her everywhere says it’s light and comfortable
5.0,The bottoms are great and the top is good. I love the suit overall but I wish the top had a little more coverage. The deep V can be dangerous if you have a big bust or if you want to move around a lot in this suit. Its still super cute but its more of a lay around the pool suit because of the top if you got a lot to support up top.
5.0,I like this wallet as it is quite thin with plenty of card pockets that are tight unlike my previous wallet that would let cards fall out. I am not sure I like the Swiss logo button as it does not add anything to the wallet.
5.0,"Really nice jersey!  Good quality, was shipped really quick.  My son loves it!"
5.0,The necklace came just as described. thank you! Super fast shipping.
5.0,"Looks and feels very good, not stretchy enough around the wrists and feels like It might rip there. I thought a LG would fit me but the M fit better and maybe even the small would fit even better. And it is an oversized jersey that is meant to be tucked in."
5.0,"nicely made, washes well, perfect for summer ... works with or without leggings"
5.0,"This is a great watch! Not too big for my wrist as I am petite. Beautifully crafted, it has the right amount of weight added. I would definitely recommend!"
5.0,It is a very lovely chain.  I put my cz pink pendant on it.  I love that it has the 3 lengths.  That makes it very versatile.  I have ordered another one.
5.0,Amazing shirt. Fits great. I like the cooking effect and the vents are great in the wind. Highly recommend.
5.0,Delivered fast. Comfortable material.
5.0,everything i wanted in a gym bag
5.0,Fits as expected. Washed well.
5.0,"They look just like the photo and work well, it was the perfect addition to my daughter's rainbow tutu for her 1st birthday party!"
5.0,Works great for what it is. The replaceable faceplates  will ensure that you're wallet will last a long time. Materials hold up great and look great. I did add an automotive ceramic coating go the plates to ensure they hold up to sliding in and out of my pocket.
5.0,"Arrived quickly, exactly as described.<br />Thank You!"
5.0,este es lo mejor de lo mejor se me quedan mirando jajaja cuando la llevo puesta lol
5.0,"other reviews state to order a size down. I ordered a medium and it fits good. I'm 5'7, 185lbs. I usually order a L."
5.0,Works as expected and I like that because it is tie dyed it will go with every color I wear!
5.0,It is very comfortable over my work gear and light weight.
5.0,being large for one person.
5.0,"Perfect, fits great and is very beautiful. Ordered a size 2t. My daughter is 2 years old, wears 24m-2t, and is 24lbs."
5.0,The coat fit just right and keeps mom warm when she watches her grandkids play
5.0,Very cozy and soft  I own this sweater in 3 colors.  I ordered the large.  I like my sweaters roomy. Highly recommended.
5.0,Excellent fit so comfortable!
5.0,I love it! Fits good and very comfortable. Color is rich.
5.0,"Fits well, soft material, very comfortable."
5.0,"Love, love, love these dresses !  They are too cute and easy to get comfortable in.  My fav summer hanging out in dress.  Happy camper !"
5.0,These are so cute and super comfy.
5.0,Super pretty! Order a size up if you have normal feet and 2 for wide. Heel is not bad at all.
5.0,These leggings are very comfortable and I love the side pockets.  They were a great buy.
5.0,"I purchased this bag specifically for carry-on.  It was exactly what I needed.  It has several places zippered locations to pack specific items such as toothpaste, electric razor, folded shirts, etc."
5.0,I have had several gowns over the years from Lanz.  Highest quality has remained the same over more than 20 years.  My only complaint is that the large is too big for me.  Going to make a guess here that it would make a roomy 1x
5.0,"I got this for my son, he loves it"
5.0,It was awesome
5.0,Made you look slim
5.0,So glad to have these.  They fit well over glasses.
5.0,very good and nice watch
5.0,Nothing bad comes to mind. Would give a 6 out of 5 if I could.
5.0,Arrived in excellent condition. Item is as described. Nice color.
5.0,Nice quality for the money. My son loves them.
5.0,My son loves it and so do I he fell asleep in that the first night 😁
5.0,I have gotten about four people to buy these just from seeing me in them. I wear them weekly if not more. They’re so comfortable! When I got them they were huge as other reviews have mentioned. I washed and dried and they fit great. I’m 5’2 and about 170lbs and I got the xxl. Fits great! They’re long on me but I just roll them which I like that look anyway. They’re very stretchy and after some washes have gotten nice and soft. I would recommend trying them on as soon as you get them and if they’re huge wash and dry. If they fit perfect wash on cold and hang dry so they don’t dry up too much.
5.0,This top fits perfectly and makes me look and feel good!
5.0,"When we ordered it we didn’t imagine the quality and workmanship in the entire piece. Impressed! Also, instead of sending a paper how-to read the sundial, it’s engraved on the back which is great."
5.0,It is see through but very cute
5.0,"Great hat, very happy with it!"
5.0,Absolutely the best thing I've ever bought. Easy to clean. Blends everything super smooth. I love that I can take it anywhere. It's not super loud. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a portable blender.
5.0,"I needed some plain black capris for Burn Bootcamp and these fit the bill, Plus it has the thigh pocket. Pockets are essential!  Good stretch not 100% squat proof, but I wear shapermint boy shorts underneath to smooth out my extra rolls and loose skin (progress isn’t always pretty). Anyway, these fit in a way that  I look like a curvy queen. They are somewhat compressive, but not so tight that you can see dimpling. So it looks sleek. I recommend these to anyone on a budget who needs body coverage while they work out, hike, bike, whatever. These are ready to move with you."
5.0,This makes such a difference looking at the computer screen. My eyes already feel better. Fantastic purchase!
5.0,Looks great and I can hardly wait to wear it in next year's Turkey Trot
5.0,"Love this top! Need a deep plunge bra if you’re gonna wear one, and lemme tell ya it wrinkles super easy. Must have an iron or steamer or whatever. I would definitely buy this again!"
5.0,"Got as a gift for my niece. She loves them! Very cute, especially since there is a heart on the lobe like a stud and the strawberry dangles below it."
5.0,"Nice wide band and super soft feel.  My girlfriend purrs when she runs her fingers across them. Wink wink.  And the no fly is so, SO much better."
5.0,The headband is a little weird but other then that it’s GREATT
5.0,Looks great! Inexpensive
5.0,"We've had some really cold weather in Florida, and these have kept my hands warm. Look very nice and appear to be sturday."
5.0,Wore these on my wedding day and they were perfect!!
5.0,Feliz con este producto funcional al cien
5.0,"I’m 5’3 and 115lbs, size S fits perfectly! The teal color is so beautiful! I can’t wait to wear them to my yoga class tomorrow!"
5.0,It works. I wanted large baggy sweats to wear over my uniform and this gets the job done.
5.0,Smart idea with the belt holes along the belt.  This design is the best I have seen about belt.  Description about the belt is accurate. Looks well with any style of pants.
5.0,I really love this dress it fits all my curves perfectly!
5.0,"Nice, stretchy fit and very comfortable. I love cargo shorts as I’m the type of guy to carry lots of things with me, from phones, keys to wallets, pods, etc.<br />made of soft material, it is wrinkle free. A plus in my book.<br />Length is just right and is not too big although it does fit on the more snug side."
5.0,"Love this top. Soft, non clingy super comfy material. I wear a size large and ordered an xl just in case. Fits perfect. Ordered a light gray one too."
5.0,Love this hat to protect our baby's face from the direct sun. The quality is great and it dries quickly when washed.
5.0,These are so cute. Great quality and just the right size.
5.0,Item is not a second it is well worth the money
5.0,Have held up nicely for over a year on a wild toddler!
5.0,My daughter travels all the time and she said this is wonderful. She loves how she can hang it on the back of the bathroom doors at the hotel rooms and it fits everything wonderfully. It does gap and slag so everything falls forward like other ones she has. It holds up right nice and she loves the bright aqua color.
5.0,sturdy and functional
5.0,This bag is super cute.
5.0,Super soft and warm!
5.0,"Good quality, good material, not cheap.  Its printed on a regular T-shirt, but the print is top quality.<br />Will purchase more in different colors to show the world ""Hate You 2"" in all colors lol!<br />Give it 5 stars!  Definitely a conversation starter shirt!"
5.0,I really like my sunglasses they really very attractive on my face and they do a very good job of stopping the sun from coming through to my eyes. I highly recommend a sunglasses
5.0,Love the fit An style
5.0,"LOVE this shoe.  I had never heard of Olukai before but after getting this shoe I immediately researched them and their products.  Very impressive! I loved this shoe so much I purchased it in both brown and black and plan to buy their Italian leather flip flops.  This is a men’s size 8 and although I’m a woman who wears a 9 1/2 - 10 in a women’s shoe, this was a great fit.  This loafer is very well made and the leather is gorgeous and it looks very chic. I love the arch and the shoe is one of the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned... right out of the box it felt awesome.  Buy this shoe!  I promise you, you will be very glad you did."
5.0,These undergarments are of high-quality and are warm. They are lightweight but are very warm to wear to help block the cold. Machine-washable and do not fade. We bought 3 of them and they are holding up very well with no issues.
5.0,"I’m glad I found this Apple Watch arm band. It’s super easy to slide on and off, is perfectly compatible with my Apple Watch, and I think has the perfect level of stretch to where it stays put on your arm but is not suffocatingly tight. I’ve been wearing it five days a week for several months now and I think it will last many more. The cat even got a hold of it one day and managed to yank a few pulls out of the elastic. It doesn’t look like new anymore, but it held up without tearing and still works perfectly. I have noticed that over a couple weeks the tightening slide piece does tend to get looser, however this does not bother me. When I notice it feels a little loose, I just tighten it a bit again. I only have to do this once every few weeks."
5.0,These pjs are so soft and comfortable. Very high quality. The ribbon detail is so cute. I am 5’2” 114lbs. I ordered the medium and they fit great. I just wish they had more colors. I would buy them all!
5.0,I wear this daily. I love it.
5.0,"Fit great, wore to a wedding and got so many compliments!"
5.0,"Im 5’1 and it ran taller than me by an inch or so. I wore heels to make up for it.<br />Other than that, it was cute and completed my costume look"
5.0,I bought this dress for my 5 year old.  It fits perfectly and after a wash didn't shrink at all.  I will be buying more!
5.0,Exceeded my expectations.  Purchased on a lightening deal and was not disappointed!  Good sound quality and plenty loud!  Easy setup and pairing to iPhone.  Easy to change tracks and raise or lower volume.  Very happy and totally re omen day to anyone working out or needing hands free.
5.0,This shirt was a thicker material than I was expecting. It fits great and I have got quite a few comments on it.
5.0,Excellent hat - color was perfect
5.0,Big and just what I was looking for.
5.0,keeper
5.0,"I got these because I needed sunglasses to fit over my prescription glasses. Before I would wear only sunglasses which relinquish my ability to see far away scenery and objects. Unfortunately, I slighty do not have the proper face shape to rock theses sunglasses, its a bit too wide. But it works and I love it! I now have UV protection for summer days and I can still see far away things simultaneously and it all fits comfortably even when I wear my hunter's baseball cap."
5.0,"Great fit. One small issue is if the rim on top was wider it be a more comfortable  fit, kind of digs in your leg after a while wearing them."
5.0,I was tired of the paper mask and getting fibers in my mouth. I decided to try the NYBEE Face Mask and I found it to be very comfortable. I am happy with how it fits and find it to be cooler. I appreciate the rib as it keeps the mask off of the mouth.
5.0,"It is easy to use, requires no special skill or tools."
5.0,This scarf is amazing. The material is so soft yet durable. Love it.
5.0,Love them but were a little right. Not see through!!
5.0,"Bought size medium in the rich navy, wow what a coat for the winter season! This one has ALL the bells and whistles. It's very warm, heavy some may say but not for me. The hood fits well, stays on your head with a snap right under it so it stays up (fur removeable if you want). Cuffs on sleeves, perfect, pockets are deep, length for me is perfect too at 5'4"", just above the knees to keep my legs warm.<br /><br />Best feature? The (men's wear) pocket on the inside of the coat. Why designers for women's wear do not do inside (chest) pockets in women's coats, jackets, blazers is totally beyond me. I LOVE an interior pocket, this is a winner for me!<br /><br />Good price on this too and it's machine washable. I did buy a medium, tried it on with 2 tees and a turtleneck on, it fits nicely but I could easily put on a large and it would not be too big. Consider this when you buy this coat. I highly recommend this one if you're looking for a great warm winter coat."
5.0,"The hat is as shown. But it is massive. It's literally the biggest size hat of any hat.<br />With the brim sitting on my ears, the top of the hat is like 2 inches above my head.<br />Totally unusable as a hat. But it will look nice on my wall."
5.0,Very pretty and lightweight.  I can also wear this as a spring/summer dress.  Doesn’t look like a nightgown.
5.0,Nice watches we love them
5.0,I Love it ❤
5.0,These are soft and beautiful. I did order a size larger because others said to do so. Glad I did.
5.0,"Good size, soft after a couple washings."
5.0,My son loves his hat and mittens. He also loves how the Fortnite changes to purple color in the sunlight!
5.0,Bought this for my older sister for Christmas. She loved it and it looks super cute and funny! Material is very high quality and soft. Amazing purchase.
5.0,Absolutely love this skirt! It fits like a dream and the quality is great; much better than expected! I wore this high waisted and was so pleased it fit my tiny waist! It's also will show every bump or wrinkle on you so make sure you have the correct undergarments. Overall would recommend this skirt to everyone! I ordered a size small and it fit wonderfully-I'm 5'2'' 100 lbs for reference
5.0,I bought this dress and and absolutely fell in love with it. It has a bit of elasticity and I was able to nurse my baby without unzipping. Great fit and perfect length! I can't WAIT to buy more dresses.
5.0,The hat is well done and looks fantastic.
5.0,Love this dress. It is flattering. Will get a small instead of medium- 5’5” -130 next time
5.0,Swaggggg
5.0,"I was looking for a very light weight & high quality robe and was confused by the dramatically mixed reviews. So I read them all and took the risk. I love this robe and just ordered 5 more for gifts, which by the way cost a fraction of what they would be if sized normally.<br />These are truly awesome but I agree that the sizing is way off on the label. I’m just glad they give clear sizing within product details."
5.0,"Hey girls, you know that sexy black dress with a low cut front, well this bra is for you. You want cleavage you got it. However for me it does not matter as I am 80 years old and past the cleavage stage I just want comfort. This bra also offers comfort and closes in front which is great."
5.0,"Good quality for price! I could have ordered a size small, but I really enjoyed the outfit and compliments received."
5.0,Make sure to check out the hoop dimensions. They are listed. I wasn’t expecting the larger hoop to be as big as it is but I still love this. Well made for the price.
5.0,Used this as a shawl with a dress i had to match.  Love it.  I also found other colors to match dresses.
5.0,"I had doubts about this ring but once it arrived, I absolutely love it. Yes, it is dainty (aka: small) but it is exactly what I wanted. It is comfortable and smooth, so I don't think it will get caught on anything, I plan on wearing this daily as my wedding band. I ordered a size 7 and it fits true to size."
5.0,Great feel and I love the pockets.
5.0,I will never hike in any thing but this skirt or the one I will replace it with if I ever need to.so comfortable. cool in the desert. easy to move in. merino shorts allow you to breath without binding underwear. washes great and dries fast
5.0,"i got this backpack as i needed a hunting pack.  i love this pack!!! i has five pockets, it has more than enough pockets has more than enough room to store what i need for hunting. the fold out clear pocket is big enough to put a hydration pack in it and it has a built in door thingy on the top to run your nozzle through. i recommend it to any outdoors enthustiest and would recommend it to anybody"
5.0,"Very nice product, fabric seems very soft after the initial try on, and I really liked the wider waistband with the higher rise. Definitely worth it for the price I paid, I may come back for more of these if they hold up after washing a few times."
5.0,"very nice, this is my first one. Will buy it again for others."
5.0,I love the fit of this top. It's comfortable and not clingy.
5.0,"I am 5’0ft and weigh 120lbs. This fit just right. I am a 32D and it does fit a bit tight in the chest area, but it’s manageable.  I love how it looks but I feel that if I were taller or weighed more, it definitely would not fit."
5.0,This is a beautiful and super strong band!
5.0,The only thing is that the mask does smell of plastic a little.
5.0,"Easy to adjust with one hand, sparkles like the real thing, and is very comfortable to wear!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:900b206c36ec2ea51b0b042f1389c6c2]] I really like my steel band-since other ones purchased have shown an uncanny ability to snag on things.  So far this one hasn’t.  Easy to clean ( I take off my Apple Watch and soak with a denture tablet, warm water abt 60 seconds, pull out and dry with a towel).<br />Pros-great at holding with a powerful magnet.  Doesn’t bind, catch on things.  Very durable.<br />Cons-the magnet is so strong-it catches on metal objects.  Maybe a mag resistant paint on the back portion?<br />  Either way a good deal on a nice watch band."
5.0,"Has a heavy feeling; but this is what I like.  Very nice  look, and comments all the time."
5.0,es ideal para actividades informalez
5.0,This is a lovely basic Swatch that you can change the battery on yourself.  It is more lavender than pink with a glittery glow to the strap.
5.0,"These earrings are much nicer than I expected. I ordered them because I love to wear leopard print and I thought these would match my clothing perfectly. I was very pleased to find that they do match and look very nice on my ears. I hesitate to order jewelry on-line because I cannot physically see the quality of the piece, but I took a chance with these earrings. I'm so glad I did! I thought they might look like costume jewelry, but instead they have a quality look that would be appropriate to wear anywhere.They arrived in a sheer black drawstring jewelry bag. The 8mm earrings are bright, with shiny crystals. They are lightweight and don't make your earlobes droop. The silicone backs are small and difficult for me to grasp, so I had to replace them with other ones, but backs can be easily purchased. These earrings are a great addition to my wardrobe."
5.0,"Love, Love it so soft and light  weight fabric.. really cute.."
5.0,Nice object.t.
5.0,"This pin is a cute small sized butterfly. It was smaller than I had anticipated. However, overall I was satisfied with the purchase. It served the purpose for which I ordered it, which is to secure a sash. It is pretty but not as vibrant in color as the picture depicts."
5.0,It's pretty and comfortable drees
5.0,I like this because it is fun.  I plan to use it in a vacation bag to put things I want to identify quickly.
5.0,super comfortable and flattering.
5.0,"Great shirt, great fit..."
5.0,Not sure why its called a sweater but I LOVE IT!  I got one large up to get that loose flow and I'm happy I did.  So if you want a perfect fitget your size. I love this and can't wait to wear it with everything. Definitely buying a few more.
5.0,Perfect casual summer dress
5.0,Great for short trips
5.0,Ordered the couples masks for a 50th party with a masquerade theme. I loved how comfortable they felt and how fashionable they looked. They have string ties which helped with giving a good fit.
5.0,"This is my favorite brand of socks. Their quality is so much better than others. You know you'll pick up some cute socks from target or the like but they have loose strings inside or they'll start to unravel quickly? No worries with socksmith. Their socks are comfortable and soft and no loose strings! I have some socks that are years old from them and they're still holding up great.<br /><br />Now for these socks specifically,  this is the cutest Halloween themed sock I think I've ever seen. I love the candy corns in their costumes! I'm pretty much washing these every other day so I can wear them as much as possible this month (October). Having a fun pair of socks on your feet can make your whole day better."
5.0,Beautiful dress. A nice change from the long maxi. The full skirt with the tapered waist makes this dress a hit. Quality fabric with a good weight to it. I'm going to get this in 2 additional colors.
5.0,I love these earrings!! I get compliments on them all the time. Great for work or a night out.
5.0,Nicely made!! Looks just like it is in the picture.
5.0,"I bought this for a gag gift but it ended up being a very nice quality robe which the man wears all the time. The colors are bright, and the robe is a soft plush. It was a steal for the price."
5.0,Perfect prop for on-stage policeman character
5.0,Good for dressing up as Wednesday Addams
5.0,I absolutely loved this outfit! My babygirl looked so cute in it! Thank you so much for the fast delivery and the good quality material! I’d definitely order from you again!!
5.0,Even though I have not tried them on yet I got a rating scale so I may as well rate them because I am going to continue to get bugged. I have not worn them yet because I am pregnant and I got them for after I am done being pregnant. But I do like the way they look and they look like they may fit.
5.0,"Great summertime hat, cools and protects without getting a sweating head"
5.0,"This was a gift to a great school office clerk who always greeted me with ""Good Morning Mr. Johnson."""
5.0,I love that it matches my purse and is more comfortable than the strap that came with the purse
5.0,Very well made for this incredible price.
5.0,"After our daughter kept having unauthorized purchases on her card, we bought her this RFID wallet for protection and security. She loved the design and so far, no more breaches of her card!!"
5.0,Absolutely love this shoe! They are perfect for getting wet in and just running around the yard. Both my boys love them!
5.0,"Great dress. Only issue I had is that after one washing, the spaghetti strap came apart from the dress. I ended up having to sew it back together. Otherwise, fit is true to size and super comfy."
5.0,"Absolutely gorgeous on my partner. The ivory lace gives a vintage, classy elegance to her outfit.  It is a huge, but wonderfully light scarf that can easily be worn all fall through spring.  I cannot wait until summer is over so I can be at her side while she wears this.<br /><br />The fabric is loose knit and the lace does not contrast with the fabric, more just gives a hint of detail.  It is very subtle and classy.  It should accessorize with almost her entire wardrobe.  Absolutely love the ivory color."
5.0,"Give me all the colors! This dress is super adorable, comfy, and the perfect length. You can't beat it for the price either. Fits as expected."
5.0,These pins are amazing. I'm glad I purchased two bags because we used them up immediately. They are easy to use and hold your pins on securely. No more loosing Scout pins or amusement park pins. Love them and customer service was top notch. Highly recommend.
5.0,"I use this as a wallet during the day and then a small purse at night. There's around 10 slots in the back for cards and cash, and a slightly bigger spot for your things. I usually can keep my phone, lipstick, and a few smaller items in there. It's definitely not a day bag but if you have only a few things to carry and like small, compact purses, then this is great! The colors are very bright and I get tons of compliments on this bag every day."
5.0,Nice shirt and love how it's stretchy..
5.0,"After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit concerned after making this purchase, but I am so glad I did! The dress was very comfortable and it was a light fit. I received so many compliments! Love the dress!"

5.0,My granddaughter loves these shoes for school
5.0,These shoes are awesome! I have plantar fasciitis. These shoes are very supportive and provide great stability with a great arch support but feels like a gym shoe on the bottom so I can wear them while playing with my3 year old and feel supported
5.0,I absolutely love these dresses!  I now have 4 in different colors.  Since I have been from home they are perfect to pair with a cardigan or shrug for meetings online and are so comfy!  Best part....they have generous pockets!  I will be buying a few more before summer ends!

5.0,Perfect fit for Oakley M-Frame Sweeps.<br />Offical Oakley box
5.0,"Bought for my son, when his sister was born. He loves that it was superhero. Fits true to size."
5.0,"I bought this for a white night party and am super excited to wear it. The advertising photo does not do this dress justice at all. For reference - I'm 5'7"", 128lbs. I ordered the medium to accommodate my 36DD boobs. If you don't have such a large chest, and you are about my size, you'd probably be better off with the small"
5.0,AMAZING for the price! I love these shirts. My only complaint is they're a bit thin and good for weather 60-70 degrees.  Not winter shirts but good for early fall or spring.  These hide my postpartum tummy and hips while leaving plenty of room to breastfeed.
5.0,"Bought it for my 5 1/2 year old granddaughter which wears a size 6 went but I went up a size hoping it would give her a little more room and the 8 looks like a 10, but other then that she loved it, material was good, worth the purchase."
5.0,Love it! Looks expensive. I get many compliments on it!
5.0,It came the next day.  I wasn't expecting it so fast so I let my son open it; needless to say he got an early B-day present lol. He absolutely loved it and was super excited. Thankyou!

5.0,"Excellent quality, great features, good looking. Very happy with purchase"
5.0,"I love these leggings. Soft, not see through. True to the picture"
5.0,"I cannot wait for warmer weather to wear these to work. The weather is just getting nice and I'm so excited to be able to wear these out! For one, pockets in leggings that actually work! And they don't look like those tights that stick to your skin or are too thin. These can pass as pants. I am in love ❤️"
5.0,Very cute and comfy. I get a lot of compliments for this!
5.0,Perfectly packaged in a nice box along with a pouch  and tiny screw driver these glasses are perfect! The lenses are super dark. The frames are sturdy. You can tell this product is quality. I'm highly impressed. I also gave a pair as a gift and the recipient was equally impressed with the packaging and quality.
5.0,"The AN KINGPiiN Men's Yellow Smiley Pill Lapel Pin Is very cute. To me the smiley face looks like it was made with miniature LEGOs. (Since I am a fan of LEGO kits, this strikes a nice chord for me.) The pin appears to be well made and has no trouble staying in place. It adds some flare to a jacket or shirt."
5.0,"Great price, good quality, and fit the kids perfectly!"
5.0,I like the fit and the price.
5.0,Came in pretty fast. Thumbs up
5.0,Inget so many compliments!!  Soo pretty!
5.0,Colors are as shown and it’s a great quality bag. I am obsessed!!
5.0,"Was packaged well, worked well with my Samsung Actve 2 watch."
5.0,I wasn’t sure what it would look like especially since it said child size. My son looked like a king for prom . I loved it 🥰. I would definitely recommend.
5.0,These are the go to socks for my husband and daughter.  They hold up and are very comfortable.
5.0,I wear them 24 7
5.0,I gave this as a gift and the person I got it for seems to really like it and said it fit well
5.0,"I own the silver/black version and man this watch is a beauty. I love how Casio did a fantastic job fitting both analog and digital in one watch. It looks nice in both casual and formal fashion. It is a log simpler to set and adjust the watch compared to the other Giez watch models. The solar feature is a great reason to buy this watch if you're looking for something that you can wear in any environment. This is by far my favorite G-shock. I've owned 10 G's in the past such as the Frogman, Mudman, Gulfman...etc. and this beats all of them. It's light, slim, and not bulky."
5.0,I absolutely love this bag
5.0,Length is great a little tight across the chest but great arm length
5.0,The quality was much better than expected for such a reasonable price and they were delivered quickly
5.0,"These tank tops are so great that I’ve bought several colors and replaced my favorite red one twice having worn it out. They’re stretchy and comfortable, flattering and nice."
5.0,"I really like this eyeglass case. I was carrying the fugly one they give you at the eye doctor.  Now I have a vibrant, snazzy case that shows people how fabulous I am."
5.0,I would buy them again
5.0,Fits perfectly and looks great! Excellent choice and price. Looks better in person and wearing it!
5.0,This suit really performs miracles.  I love two sizes smaller.  Too bad my wedding dress can't be made out of this material.
5.0,"I bought this set just because of the jade colored ring. The color is great, and the others are very cute as well. They do not look cheap or juvenile like a lot of navel rings you see online. Shipping was also fast."
5.0,It works well and feels good. I would recommend.
5.0,"All links are solid metal except for the two end links that go in the watch.  Doesn't feel as heavy as some other watches I have but it feels reasonably in line with the watch. The color is a perfect match for the 360.  The claps is probably the cheapest grade part, but it still much better than most $40-50 watches have."
5.0,Seems like good hardware on a decent strap. This is a good value.
5.0,"Let me just say, you are going to need help putting this on the first time it is so tight. Once you wear it for a few hours for about a week it will fit. It really helps me eat less and helps my posture. I’d recommend this waist trainer. It’s really exceptional quality and I appreciate how it came in a plastic pack that has a seal so it stores easily! It has really shaped my waist. But the first time I put this on I had to lie down and my boyfriend had to close it for me. It’s really impossible to do put this on by yourself the first time, so plan accordingly! After time it has stretched to my curves and its comfortable now, I can’t even tell I’m wearing it. It’s smooth under my clothing so no one can tell I’m wearing it. I’m going to increase the hours of how long I wear it after this week. I know this is going to help me achieve the waist I want with diet and exercise. The price on this waist trainer can’t be beat. I have been doing my research and similar trainers are usually anywhere from 75 to 95. I was skeptical about how the quality of this trainer would be because the price is so low. Well let me say the quality is amazing. Purchase this waist trainer you won’t regret it!!"
5.0,Theses are great for keeping the cold out!
5.0,Cool tactical watch. Solid operations and built tough.
5.0,headband is sturdy. tail is short but of high quality material. nothing looked dirty or tampered with. worth the price.

5.0,Love it and its cheap!
5.0,"I like these sunglasses because they cut the glare, fit my face and are lightweight"

5.0,works good<br />better than the walmart ones
5.0,Great Light layer
5.0,Love it! My favorite watch. This is my third one. It's super comfortable and durable.
5.0,"I bought two colours. Both in XL. As you can see, both stated XL but one the navy blue/black is a real XL and fit very nicely. The blue was huge like 2XL or even 3XL. It's a manufacturing error and not the seller. I will try to see if can have it altered.<br />Other than the size, it fit well and good material.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Customer service is great. After they saw my review, they emailed me and now they are sending me the correct size. I totally recommend this seller."
5.0,These were a gift for my bff. She loved them!  There’s a color to match every outfit.
5.0,"I bbn purchased this as Christmas for my brother in law, I loved it"

5.0,Nephew wore these during chemo treatment they were a huge hit with his infusion staff.
5.0,"Cute shirt! Comfy and was compliments often.  Love this style of shirt, and the glittery pocket.  Size is as marked"
5.0,"Let me start by saying that my daughter is obsessed with all things Washington Capitals. On the very rare occasion, she'll agree to wear something else, but it still needs to be hockey and the first request is always one of the handful of &#34;other&#34; favorite players... So we quickly got to the point where she was wearing one of about five shirts over and over and over again...<br /><br />Then we discovered 500 Level!! =D<br /><br />I was hesitant at first... I mean, first off you never see NHL shirts at that price and what kind of quality could you possibly get. Surely the image will be bad or the shirt itself will be cheap and uncomfortable... I was so wrong!! The image is so crisp and clean. The shirt has yet to shrink despite easily a dozen washes in probably what's been little more than a month. The shirt was soft, yet sturdy and clearly quality made. The image hasn't faded or peeled either.<br /><br />Now, my daughter has tons of options for her most favorite players and we get stopped every time we're out by someone asking where I got a shirt like that!! From the huge selection of unique designs for your favorite player or team, to the incredible quality, to the price, to the beyond-reasonably-fast shipping... You just won't find anything better for your fan! (Or yourself, for that matter - you have to check out the adult items too!) And believe me, when it comes to Capitals' shirts for kids, I can say that with all of the confidence in the world!<br /><br />* In case you were wondering, we've been back several times and even given a handful as gifts to her hockey team! All of the parents have begged to know where we got their child's shirt so because both kid and parent loved it so much!"
5.0,Very light refreshing to the skin and comfortable.
5.0,"El colgante es tal como se muestra, es muy bonito"
5.0,"Very cute and dainty, good quality for price"
5.0,I'm 5ft4in 180 ordered size large..
5.0,"I’m in Nevada which can get very cold. These are without a doubt, the best pair of winter shoes. No breaking them in, I just put them on and hours later they still felt comfortable. Very light, but very warm. However I do recommend buying 45” shoe laces. They come with 63”, which are way to long and I dislike having to double knot."
5.0,"Great set. Ordered for my daughter who wears size 18 month clothes. The 18 month size in this set is a little big on her, but that's fine with me since it leaves her room to grow. Nice quality and has kept her wark and dry in the Alaska winter."
5.0,"Love the shirt, fits perfect 128 lbs Small (mine), good matereal, 100% recomended!"
5.0,"This bracelet is actually really lovely considering the price. The quality is nice and the design is pretty. My 10 Yr old daughter passed away this year, so I wear one and I added one near her favorite swing. Beautiful for a Mother/Daughter."
5.0,"I love the feel of this top! It’s very comfortable, and the design is pretty!"
5.0,Is amazing looks awesome just love it!!
5.0,My husband loves these slippers.  He has a lot of trouble with his feet and these help.
5.0,Luxurious feel; warm; loved it.
5.0,Love it love it love it!!!! So comfy I'd buy in every color! Haha!
5.0,"Love my shorts they are so comfy and most of all is that they can be washed and dried and are wrinkle-free. I mostly wear indoors and love the fit. I really wish more colors would be made available, not much of a selection in this style. They are true to size."
5.0,"Bought these to wear inside my ski boots and they work well.  My boots are a tiny bit loose and these thick socks helped to make my foot/leg more snug, which is great.  Love the 3-stripe style too.  Could also be used for soccer to give extra protection to your shins."
5.0,"So far it seems to be a good product. I've tested it and the shock doesn't seem painful but it does make you jump a little (50%). The app allows you to increase levels in 10% increments which is helpful for getting over the nervousness of getting the shock. Charge time is only 2 hours. App has many options but is slightly complicated in layout, but definitely not a deal breaker at all. Will update within a week after testing."
5.0,This is a very pretty necklace that matches a lot of clothes I have. Very happy with the quality too.
5.0,This hoodie sweatshirt is the most comfortable thing I own. I would wear it more if I didn't live in Florida :-(<br />I need to move to a colder state!
5.0,Adorable dress and great value for the money!  Just as adorable as some of my Kate Spade dresses which cost 10 times as much. Loved this one so much I bought three other ones. :-)
5.0,👍🏻👌🏼
5.0,"I got this for my mom for mother's day and I'm excited to give this to her! Her taste in jewelry leans toward dainty and this is perfect for her. It's beautiful, exactly as pictured and can't wait for her to try it on."
5.0,This Lanyard is beautiful! The photo of it doesn't do it justice. I'm very pleased.
5.0,The boots seem a little snug. I’m hoping they will conform to my feet before long.
5.0,These little charms worked well in my resin pens
5.0,they are cute! :D I love them :D
5.0,I bought this as a joke but my husband loves them.
5.0,"I ordered a medium I’d usually get a small but I wanted a comfortable fit. I got that for sure they fit good and the pant falls right at the ankle for me not above, I’m 5’7 135lbs and these are high waisted for me. I’d say the are bulky at the hip but that’s sort of the style that goes with joggers/sweats with pockets on women usually. Also perhaps too warm for summer but still good pants for lounging. The crotch is not low or hanging for me like other reviewer mentioned which I was worried, I like them a lot I think looks nice with a crop top. Glad I took a chance to try these."
5.0,Muy buena calidad y excelente servicio.
5.0,So cute! Thank you!
5.0,The parents loved the PJ's for their kids so much that they immediately put them on to take them home from the Christmas party! When I ordered them I loved these so much that I got 3 pairs!

5.0,I originally received a huge size but I contacted the owner and they immediately fixed the problem by sending me the correct size which is absolutely perfect.<br />Thank you so much. Great customer service.
5.0,"These arrived a day early.  They are super soft and comfortable.  They were shipped in a box, in a nice little drawstring bag so you can put them in the bag when you pack for a trip and they will not get your clothes dirty."
5.0,I like the fit. You can even let it fall off your shoulder just a little
5.0,"Used daily, very well constructed, durable. Cannot fit full-size laptop, perfect for chrome book or something similar in size."
5.0,"Happy with my purchase so far, only issue I had was it would not swivel at first.  I loosened up some of the screws on the base and seems to work fine now.  Put it together by myself, pretty clear instructions. Looking forward to enjoying sunny days on my back deck now !"

5.0,Very flattering after having a baby. Accentuates all the right places.

5.0,Very cute I bought it for Halloween but it was so cute I want it on different occasions. I wouldn’t say it’s sturdy but it’s definitely not flimsy it’s somewhere in between.

5.0,This was just what I needed!!!! Perfect!!
5.0,I bought these for staying power.  All other headbands slip off of my head.  These do not.  They are comfortable to wear all day without adjustments.  I’ve not used them to work out.
5.0,Tons of compliments. I'm short though so this is a maxi on me based on the length and I didn't adjust the straps much. Lots of compliments.

5.0,This is really cute and looks great!
5.0,"OoooRah. This money clip is great.  I didn't think I was going to like it at first as it's shorter than most money clips.  I've gotten used to it and appreciate the spring tension.  It is definitely well made and it saves me from pulling out my wallet whenever I need bills.  Can't beat the EGA graphics, OoooRah."

5.0,I love them! Fit great and come up high!
5.0,We are having the time of our lives with these prayer shawls.  I have purchased many and given for gifts.  Love them.
5.0,"Hello all those who are paralyzed by the amount of options available on Amazon for just about any product.  I have purchase many things and been disappointed at the garbage that was received and spent way too much time ""researching"" my purchases, but this one was worth the effort.<br /><br />The band is great.  It fits my charge 3 perfectly and hold it securely.  Aside from being very inexpensive, it is comfortable (not bulky at all), very breathable compared to the band that came standard with the Fitbit, and after about 6 weeks has been very durable.<br /><br />Absolutely great purchase, recommended 100%."
5.0,It is perfecto 👌

5.0,"Love, love this dress .... only wish it had pockets."
5.0,"I purchased the Crosstown Tote as a backup to my well-loved and favorite Turnlock tote. Since this will be used for work, I needed something that would hold my laptop and various work-related items.  Although the bag is designed vertically, as opposed to the horizontal design of the Turnlock Tote, I was impressed with its capacity to hold my items and the ease with which to retrieve them.  I was also very impressed that the inside zip pocket held my Dell 13&#34; laptop with no problems, didn't take up space, nor made the tote uncomfortably heavy.  So far, I love my tote!  Next test is to see how it fits underneath an airline seat."
5.0,Good for every day use & very comfortable.
5.0,"I ordered the Navy blue dress. I recieved so many compliments at my HR conference and I felt great in it. Its true to size. Not much stretch to it, but the material feels like this dress could have cost at least $100!"
5.0,better than i expected
5.0,"I enjoy the softness of this gown.  I did have to alter the hemline in the back since I am short and the back panel tickled the back of my knees when I walked.  States on tag that it is 100% cotton, but it has a bit of stretch in it, so not convinced it is full cotton.  However, i do like a bit of stretch so am fine with the material."
5.0,Adorable and handy.  The seller delivered the product as advertised and quickly. Greatly appreciate that!
5.0,I bought this for a teen titans raven costume and it works perfect. I was afraid that it would be to skinny in certain parts and I wouldn't be appropriate to wear with my son on holloween but it is perfect.
5.0,Our 3 year old
5.0,It's beautiful.!! it arrive on time. I can't wait to display my sunglasses and my watches.  My boyfriend is so jealous he wants one now.  It's really well put together. My very please with selection. I'm redoing my bedroom.I can't to put on my dresser.
5.0,Christmas and haven’t heard any bad news about it. So it must be good. Lol
5.0,I am enjoying these earrings.  They are small enough that I can leave them in while I'm sleeping.  They are light weight but thick enough to not break easily.
5.0,"If you like Owls these are perfect, just the right size and so pretty!"
5.0,GREAT SHIRT and great service
5.0,the color is pretty
5.0,Amazing! Soft and comfortable! Bought plus size and it fits perfectly. I'm 5 foot 7 and 200 pounds. I carry most of my weight in my buttocks.
5.0,Ordered same size in beige but the black came too small
5.0,great outfit for doing gym and running. Very fast dry and moderate skin pressure.
5.0,"I love this dress! It's very comfortable, and I can wear it out and about and to work. I get tons of compliments, and most importantly pockets! And not just any pockets, deep pockets.<br /><br />You need to carry around your smart phone around? No problem! It'll fit fine. Want snacks for later? Don't worry, you'll have room. Want to bring a drink to go with those snacks? That's fine! These pockets are big enough to fit a can, and not just any can, a big Arizona Ice Tea can. I checked. Ok, if you carry around cans than the dress looks a bit like awkward, but the important thing is that you can."
5.0,Was looking for a dress for my son's upcoming wedding this fall.  This dress fits perfectly and is so comfortable! You cannot beat the price.
5.0,"Beautiful top, arrived quickly, LOVE Free People! FP fit is usually a bit large, I normally wear size large in other brands. I already own this top in a different color in a size medium, it has a nice flowy oversized fit. I bought this in small and it fits perfectly. Very happy with my purchase!"
5.0,Fit great but I wish it came in different colors
5.0,[[VIDEOID:d93d55ba652e6e5db0ba0b5e37ecb1ea]] My son lovesss them! Wears them everyday and I only need to charge them every other. Bunch of different color options. Very easy to charge (comes with cord) fit him a little tight wish I would of gotten one size bigger
5.0,So beautiful. I love these earrings. Even better in person.
5.0,"Perfect Kelly green color and extremely soft/comfortable fabric. I love the pockets! Perfect to wear around the house, or over a pair of leggings."
5.0,Very comfortable and feels loose while tightly on
5.0,Love these socks.
5.0,"This is a great travel bag. Took on a recent trip, I could get everything organized, with all the zippered compartments."
5.0,"Really great show, not advertised as waterproof or a snow boot, but works great as both. Becomes even more comfortable with wear."
5.0,Im happy with this purchase
5.0,Really pretty charm
5.0,"very good quality, my girlfriend love it!!!!"
5.0,Love these tees they are soft and super cute
5.0,My girlfriend loved them.
5.0,"I like the tshirt, a  few people told me-I like your tshirt!"
5.0,Best Maui Jim sunglasses I ever use
5.0,"So cute!  Feels great on and it's comfy.  I could see myself in the office with a cute blazer over it. Going to the beach in it. Date night or go straight out after work for cocktails. Dress it up dress it down with white flat sneakers or some flashy sexy pumps. I can even get away with full commando, comfy and free or maybe just to share the secret with your man for a little tease ;)<br />5'1&#34; 140lbs 32x28x40"
5.0,These are great. Fit true to size.
5.0,This dress will be prefect when the weather warms up. Very light material and it has pockets!!!! The front is a bit low but I put a shirt under it so I’m not showing myself too much. The only thing wrong with this dress and I’ve noticed it with all dresses on amazon that are made in China are the zippers getting stuck. I would highly recommend this dress for anyone looking for more of a retro/vintage look that doesn’t break the bank.
5.0,Striking.
5.0,These are very thick and well made. I love the nonslip bottoms
5.0,"These jeans are my wardrobe staple, and I was delighted to find them at such a low price. Lower even than CostCo, where I was first introduced to them. Size 34 which equals a 14 is difficult to find, so when I see them available, I snatch them up. Hope they don't stop making this style, as it is perfect for me."
5.0,Loved this shirt even monogrammed my initials on it. Great fabric.
5.0,Runs small but made well
5.0,"Many compliments,  Love it"
5.0,"Small, but my daughter still loved em!"
5.0,Very nice & bigger than I thought.
5.0,"What I love about this bracelet is that it benefits the work being done at BCR in Tampa FL.  I like too, that it goes with almost anything I wear, that it doesn't pinch, that it stands out, and best of all, people ask about it.  THAT gives me an opportunity to let so many people know about Big Cat Rescue!  I wear this alone, but most often with other bracelets I've purchased from BCR.  Wearing it makes me feel good."
5.0,"Band fits perfectly and seems to be of great material. Only issue is, it doesn't hold up to oem band. It chips, making it obvious that the clasp is painted. Seems too cheap for me. I will be ordering one directly from Garmin."
5.0,Love all the choices!
5.0,Excelent material!
5.0,"Necklace was what it described and was perfect for my wife's heart locket. She wanted something sturdy and this fit the bill, plus nice to look at."
5.0,I love these socks need more of them will buy again
5.0,These have become my new favorite earrings! Absolutely love them
5.0,My boxing gloves look great in the cases. Great product. Would definitely buy again!
5.0,"Gift for niece,,,she loved them!"
5.0,"These little girls pajamas are so cute! The cat print is adorable and the fabric is very soft, stretchy, and comfortable. They even come with a cute matching sleep mask. The fit is perfect and snug."
5.0,Awesome gift!
5.0,These are perfect for a small face.
5.0,Awesome mask! Replaced the ribbon with elastic for a better fit and to take on and off easily. Received compliments the entire night and intend to work this into future costumes!
5.0,"The shirt is baggy, but it fits as shown in the picture.  Shipping was on time, and the material was very soft and comfortable.  There was a sewn in slit in the back that I didn't remember seeing in the picture, but it makes the shirt even cuter!  I bought it for my sister - who is 5'2 and about 115 lbs.  She loved it!"
5.0,Cute!Perfect fit..
5.0,Absolute adorable
5.0,"Just in time for a beach vacation, this was easy to install, put on, and comfortable to wear."

5.0,I've had this wallet for a year not and I still love it Great buy very well made
5.0,Great length and quality

5.0,"beautiful stones, cut and color"
5.0,"Comfy, cute and soft"
5.0,Love the Unakite bracelet. It’s so colorful hopefully it will help me get pregnant
5.0,Just as expected - it is a plastic black hat with brushed felt - it is a bit big for my head - there are no sizes to order but it is for a gag not to wear everyday - a great costume hat that will look good for Halloween - the price is right at $6.99- great for the costume box for your kids also - In the photo it might look small but it fits my head with room to spare and I have a large head -<br /><br />I like the hat better then I expected from the photo and look forward to costume party opportunities to wear it in the future - my teenagers will have fun with this at school functions and parties with friends - maybe even prom for that matter - a good hat for fun and a great price -<br /><br />A fun party hat and at the price you could buy a bunch and give them out as party favors and everyone could look great for the photos - I love getting dress-up favors at parties it makes the photos all the more fun to look at and remember later -  Photo props at parties are a hit right now and this hat and other hats in this line would make great props to go along with the mustaches and glasses everyone is wearing in photos -<br /><br />I am a reviewer and received this item for an honest review. .
5.0,These are amazing!!! They work so well please keep in mind do not put these in the dryer it clearly says it on the label if you put them in the dryer it will mess up the pad hand wash or put them or put them in the washer machine but only use cold water and hang them up to dry i love these so much I have completely stopped using pads and tampons which I was a bit worried about at first because I do bleed heavy but no issues I have not leaked once while using these
5.0,"I use gloves to clean bathrooms, cat litter boxes and scouring the sinks, and for any chores where I need to protect my hands."
5.0,Fits perfect will work!

5.0,Great price and good quality.

5.0,FIt perfect
5.0,"Beautiful vibrant colors,  very good quality. I love my order. Thanks"
5.0,Got these because they won't snag on anything
5.0,My 12yo daughter is a baby yoda lover so we got this for her to wear in Disney. She needed a baseball cap for the sunny hot days and this was perfect. She's very petite and it fit her nicely and the print is very cute.
5.0,"Good quality to, exact fit."
5.0,These captain items are decent quality for the price. The pipe is a nice touch. I bought them for a Titanic themed party and they worked well for a Captain Smith costume.
5.0,Nic1.<br />2.<br />3.<br />4.<br />5.<br />6.<br />7.<br />8.e
5.0,It's a little snug around the top. I would order a size bigger next time. But my 4year daughter loves them so much.
5.0,Very pretty panty girdle.  Lacy and handsome.
5.0,Exactly what I expected. Ooo
5.0,They are wonderful. A little thin for my needs but I wear a pair of ankle socks under them and they fit perfectly
5.0,I love them the pockets are deep that's what I like about them

5.0,Really good wig...got a lot of compliments
5.0,Wow...these look amazing...worth the buy for their price...love them
5.0,I luv thi$ RUN DMC Dooky Rolp Chayn A.K.A. Gangz$ta Bling!
5.0,"I love snails.  I just think they're super cool, cute little critters.  I saw this cute, little pendant and picked it up because it's really inexpensive and adorable.  I wear it at least a few times a week.  The chain is a little weak, so my handy and mechanically inclined husband helped me put a more durable ring around the little loop on the pendant and I replaced the chain with something more durable as well.  Cute little piece that I love to wear.  Not just for little kids, and I wouldn't call this a toy, as it's a piece of jewelry."
5.0,Intentionally bought a little large and the size was not larger than needed.
5.0,look nice and look nice on
5.0,ok .
5.0,Disliked nothing
5.0,These are a great addition to our growing Harry Potter costume collection.  This year we'll be doing a two-face type of costume with one half being Harry Potter and the other half being Draco Malfoy so this two-pack of socks was the perfect buy.
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted and what was advertised.  It is a thinner/lighter material, but that is what I was looking for, so if you want something that will keep you warm, this isn't it.  I got the lavender color and it isn't see-through at all."
5.0,"Very soft leather and wallet itself very flexible and that was very important for me.<br /> I bought similar wallet to my mom (different brand) and there is big difference with leather quality (feels like plastic) and wallet not flexible (you feel it in your pocket), not flexible means not easy to get the money and cards from it. So my point is, by the picture only, it is not possible to find out how soft and flexible the product can be.  But if you looking something soft and flexible it is your choice."
5.0,I’m a little smaller (5’9 160lbs) so the belt is rather large on me BUT the crafting is AWESOME the leather of the belt and brass of the buckle is amazing! Perfect for holding a sword as it can be worn on either side!
5.0,I love these chains! They are absolutly stunning.
5.0,"I love the way this skirt falls, the overlap and the wavy hemline. I wish they made more colors! The cotton is medium-weight- for fall and winter.  A summer version of this skirt would be great. It's expensive, but I know it's a skirt I'll have for years to come. I'm petite height, and it isn't too long. I have other items by Fair Indigo, but this is by far the best item."
5.0,"Loved them, needed one size smaller than regular size. Nice feeling material and quality!"
5.0,"Lovely, soft, warm and bright.  Matches my cap and gloves very nicely."
5.0,"This shoe chains really worth the price and in good quality, dazzling rhinestones in the sunlight, coupled with the unique design of the circle chains, perfect for any CROCS shoes and suitable for parties or daily leisure! And it is with shoe buckle, so the installation is done in one click, that is pretty good."
5.0,"The blue was a little darker than you would expect for Tarheel Blue, but it worked out because it goes well with this adidas jacket. Fit is like your standard men’s shirt. Easy gift. Hubby loved the outfit!"
5.0,"I like the fit, length and material. Beautiful<br />Can wear for many occasions"
5.0,I love this key cover but it's gotten very discolored with normal wear and tear and I've tried cleaning it - no luck! :( LOVE IT!!
5.0,Love this sunglasses have to buy another pair cause I lost my pair rideing a jet ski
5.0,Great stuff.....
5.0,I have like 10 of these now! I workout in them and wear them under open back shirts!
5.0,Cute backpack to use during the summer for ball games and beach runs. Great size with a lot of pockets. Love the navy blue color.
5.0,"Love the material, fits great"
5.0,"These wraps are lightweight (cooler on the head than polyester). They are much easier to accomplish a good-looking style wrap because they are pre-attached at one end that makes it so much better when wrapping your head & hair(if you have some!) into various styles. I find it much easier to style, plus the styles stay put when open cloth styles don’t stay put for me.<br />Don’t stop making these please! Can we have more patterns, geométrica, ikat, etc.<br />Thank you-you have saved me from daily hats!"
5.0,"We've have tried a lot of masks so far these are the best.  They are comfortable, fit well and they don't fog up your glasses.  I have to wear a mask all day at work and these have been by far the most comfortable."
5.0,"I bought those Ikon lenses from a product link that is outdated now, but it's the same product! I had them in storage for a while. But now, when I tried to fit them into the frames, I found that they were too loose in my Spy General glasses frame and would pop out very easily... SO<br />I contacted help@ikonlenses.com and they shipped a replacement lenses that fit very nicely! Great to look at the sunny world through! Great customer support. THANK YOU!"
5.0,Love them! Thanks!!!!
5.0,waited a few months to post but these are so durable. The ring is a flexible silicone and is comfortable. No signs of wear at all. The tassle is well made. No stretching of the fringe or pieces falling off.
5.0,"I hate costumes with long sleeves. Surprisingly, the design of this outfit didn't have the sleeves in my way at all"
5.0,Love these. Quality is great. In the picture it looks like you are getting two charms but it is just one double sided.
5.0,Perfect for what it was needed for!  My golf foursome was to represent China.  Bonus for July hot sun as it is functional too
5.0,Love this dress!  It was a hit and I got a lot of compliments.  Perfect and comfy cocktail dress.
5.0,Size was correct . My son loves it .
5.0,I bought this for my mother and she loved it. It came with cloth case too. It was a great buy.
5.0,Great tie!  Looks as good as ties that are three times the price!
5.0,These are one of my favorite pair of earrings!  They are just the right size for your ear and not heavy at all.
5.0,"These earrings are fabulous. They're a bit large, but they look exactly like the pictures!! Well-made and beautiful."
5.0,Fits great....just snug around the stomach area and hip area
5.0,"Very Beautiful dress with a nice stretch!! Colors are very vibrant... I am 5 feet and 140 pounds and it fits me pretty well, except its little long which is obvious considering my small height!! I will get it altered to my height :)"
5.0,Thus was a quality product. I got it personalized for my daughter and she loves it.
5.0,"The product is great, if a glow in the dark Batman symbol belt buckle is what you're looking for, then this is for you.<br />You have to quite literally hold it up to a lamp for it to then glow, but it does what is supposed to.<br />All in all I am very happy with my purchase."
5.0,It is exactly what I was looking for
5.0,"They r like a feather, they r beautiful!!? Luv them!!!!😀😀😀😀😀😀"
5.0,I get so many compliments on this skirt!! Will order another!!
5.0,Our grandson wanted the glasses. They fit and he loves them
5.0,"These earings are very nice, they go along with my charm, and ring!<br />Thank You!"
5.0,"Beautiful dress. I am very happy with this order, quality and the complete look of this dress."
5.0,Loved my band!! A must try especially for the price
5.0,Feel so sexy
5.0,"I love love love loveeeeee my glasses! As soon as they came I tried them on and instantly ordered another pair, even tho I knew I shouldn't have spent anymore $$ this weekend 😂🤦🏽‍♀️"
5.0,It fit my daughter perfect but my daughter is slim and tall and wears clothes a size smaller than her age. So take that into consideration if you will when ordering.
5.0,I am very satisfied with this purchase.
5.0,Besides the price I love the hard case. It doesn't allow your glasses to get scratched or damaged. Going back for additional colors.
5.0,"Super cute. I usually wear a medium, but after reading reviews and looking at sizing chart, I ordered a xxl. Wish I would have ordered a medium. Runs large."
5.0,This is amazing. My daughter does so much better with her glasses with these.
5.0,"Got it as gift for a lovely cousin and she was delighted. Such a pretty small earrings, just like a wild strawberry."
5.0,Comfortable. And it gives a seamless appearance. Well done
5.0,Different and cute. Do not snag on my clothes
5.0,The sleeves do their job of keeping my arms protected while I’m outside or driving.
5.0,Feels so soft and warm excellent choice
5.0,"good quality, son loves them.  good price too"
5.0,"Cute design, comfy and fits perfectly"
5.0,"I was extremely happy with the way that this hat fit. I did not expect it fit as perfectly as it does. The quality of the hat is very good and it fits nice and snuggle and has plenty of adjustable room if needed with the strap. I have had this product for about a month now and it shows no signs of wear and tare and is still in just bought condition, and I'm a rough person haha and dancer so it been through some things. The material does not get oily which i was afraid of because i have very oily skin when i touch my face then touch my hats sometimes it leaves the silly afterwards. overall this item was a very great purchase and i do plan on being a continuous buyer with this supplier!<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FIS3H4O/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0"
5.0,A couple are softer than others in the package. I however like them and they work fine.
5.0,"This shirt is adorable! The sleeves are a little long but my arms are short and aren’t usually straight. It’s so flattering! I want every color! I’m 5’2, 135 pounds and very busty. I got a M but could have pulled off a S. All I have to say is BUY THE SHIRT!"
5.0,"I am 30 weeks pregnant and purchased this skirt in my usual pre-pregnancy size (M) to wear to my baby shower in a few weeks. The skirt is lovey and light, but it definitely needs a slip underneath it. The elastic gives me enough wiggle room that I feel comfortable with the waste situated above my bump, and the fullness of the skirt fits my current bump with room to grow. Plus I feel confident that I will be able to wear it beyond pregnancy thanks to the flexible waistband, which is an added plus."
5.0,"I love the leopard print and the cut is really flattering. I'm 5'0"" about 140 lbs - I bought a Medium. I usually wear a small or medium in Anthropology, 28 in Madewell jeans to give you a reference point for sizing.<br />Based on other reviews that said it runs big, I probably should have bought a small, but many times when buying made in China from Amazon I have to size up.<br />I'm going to return this one and trade it for a Small.<br />This is a great jumpsuit for going out, but  I'll also wear it with a blazer for work."
5.0,I bought two of these as a gift for relatives who are traveling to Scotland and Ireland soon.  I also bought one for my husband and me since we go to Mexico once or twice a year to save on prescription drug costs.<br /><br />I used mine on a recent domestic trip and I liked it so much I am still using it on a daily basis.  I like the fact that it's so thin and doesn't make my purse feel bulky or heavy like it does when I carry a full size woman's wallet with a zipper. The RFID wallet also allows me to carry just  the cards I need for a particular shopping trip which eliminates the risk of losing the wallet and ALL my credit cards and insurance cards. Having additional space for papers was a plus as well.<br /><br />I like the feel of the leather as well.  It's soft and pliable so the cards can be taken out and put back in easily.
5.0,The mask is nice to wear on a summer day. The disposable mask does not absorb the sweat so the sweat goes back into your skin.  This soft cloth mask absorb the sweat. I brought 2 packs so I can have 1 per day for work.
5.0,I purchased this jersey for my grandson for Christmas.  Very well made and arrived quicker than projected.
5.0,Beautiful color and fits true to size but I could go a size smaller since it has a little give.
5.0,"They say you get what you pay for, but at 10 bucks these weren't bad for the money. They were right at first, but they stretched out after a day or so. They are very warm and the hard bottomed sole is great for running outside to check the mail or whatever. Very pleased."
5.0,very niiiii iiiiiii iiiiiiiiiii iiiiiiiiiiii iiiiiiiiii iiiiiiiii iiiiiiiiiiiii iiiii iiii iiiiiiiiii iiiiiiiiii iiiiiiiiiii iiiiiii iiiiiiiiiiiii iiii iiiiiii iiiiii iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice product!!!
5.0,Super comfy!! The material of this romper was super soft and comfortable. True to size and flattering on my body. I loved my first purchase of the blue romper so much that I bought a second pair in green. Really like how you can wear it casual or dress it up!
5.0,"These boots are extremely well made and, though they are expensive, they are worth the money. This is &quot;High End&quot; stuff. I used too think that only Italian made shoes could be of this quality. Well it is nice to know that these are made here in the USA. I have to agree with all the reviews that say to purchase a half size smaller. I am a size 9 in shoes and boots of this type. I purchased a size 8 1/2 in these boots and there is still room to spare. I should also mention that these boots were comfortable as soon as I put them on for the first time."
5.0,"Fits as expected. I wear a large shirt, but generally buy an XL jacket to allow for layering, etc."
5.0,"Beautiful top but more fitted than the normal size. I wear a large or xlarge.  36 D bust and this large is nice and form fitting. If you want a loser fit, go up."
5.0,Replacement to wallet
5.0,Great quality and good fit. Lavender looks the same as what's shown in the picture. The texture is very similar to the original band of my Fitbit. Easy to change too.

5.0,"Aún no los uso, en donde vivo está comenzando el verano, pero los probé y son prácticos y con buen look, fue una buena elección, gracias."
5.0,"This was a great purchase, it fit my daughter perfectly!!!"
5.0,The best leggings that I ever used... as my Husband said: “great for my Brazilian butt”😂😂<br />I just ordered 2 more 💕

5.0,Fit great looks cute.
5.0,Very cute dress! I wore it on our cruise.
5.0,So comfortable and warm. I live in Michigan so winters are brutal I’m on the road a lot so I’m not a fan of being bunched up in a heavy coat.

5.0,"Great set, just wish the chain was a little longer on the pendant. I still love it though the emeralds look great with my red hair and everyone is always complimenting."
5.0,These bracelets are really amazing. High polished stainless steel with a very elegant shine. The boxing they came in is perfect for gift giving. Absolutely wonderful!
5.0,"Very soft leather. The buckles are a bit oversized, but overall I like this Nato very much."
5.0,Size was correct and nice material
5.0,"Great socks. They definitely are thigh high. I had looked for long cotton socks, but until finding these I was always disappointed when I put them on and found they reached only to just above my knees, and I am only 5'. These are actually too long, but I just fold them. The socks are soft and washed very well on a gentle setting using cold water. I even put them in the dryer on a lower setting. Happily they survived my test. Happily my Halloween costume needs led me to this purchase, because I now have a source to buy more."
5.0,I really like this product.  It worked perfectly for me.
5.0,"Probably my favorite Allegra K purchase so far! The material is pretty thin, but since I live in a hot climate I find that ideal. It isn't transparent though  (at least not in black) and it fits in all the right places. It's also super soft and comfy.<br /><br />I'm on the busty side, so I sized up just to be safe. It fit perfectly without being baggy around the waist. Couldn't be happier."
5.0,Great quality and vivid color!
5.0,Love the band and very stylish.
5.0,Queda perfecto y muy cómodo
5.0,"they are very pretty earring and very comfortable to wear. I like the small size jewelry; so, I can wear them all time. It came in time. it could be good fro young girls , too. I am wearing them since I got them in the mail."
5.0,My daughter loved it and cannot wait to use it for prom.  Very cute.
5.0,They fit my leg but not my stomach so if you have a smaller waist I think you should size down because they have awesome stretch. Otherwise you will constantly pulling them up
5.0,Shorts are soft and true to size.  &#34;Medium&#34; shirt is actually an X-small (I'm about the size of the model).  Strange disparity.  The material is amazing!
5.0,"Beautiful and good quality, have to my 12 yr old nice and she loves it, wears every day and gets lots of compliments"
5.0,wish i had bought 10 pairs!
5.0,new
5.0,"When I started jiu-jitsu, I found that the tops of my feet would get ""carpet burns"" from the mat. I got these, and the problem went away. They were durable and had good traction."
5.0,"My husband and I have had these for almost 2 years (I know it’s been a while but a review is a review) I will say this was a fantastic buy!! We had to change the chain on the key because it was a little to thin for my husband to wear at work, but my bracelet has been on for almost 2 years and has only been taken off once because of a surgery. No tarnishing, or color change."
5.0,No defects. Clasp works as it should.
5.0,I have worn this brand of mittens for years to wear when I sleep because of my poor circulation.  Just purchased my 3rd pair.  I am glad Amazon is carrying them again.
5.0,"Gift for my niece, she loves it!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:198ec2d2270e637af3c5fe65c06e9af5]] No problem here am hands down in love with this dress ....I felt really sexy.....it made my knocked knees look sexy....👌
5.0,Ordered these Element Eight Pro Polarized Sunglasses because I have been in search of the perfect fitting sunglasses. These were shipped very quickly and received quickly. The mirror and tint on these are so great and the fit is so great they are nice and snug so will work perfect for when I'm on my motorcycle riding. Overall I am super happy with these. I recommend them to everyone looking for a style of sunglasses like these.<br /><br />I received these with a discount for my honest review
5.0,"This fit my Fitbit versa 2 perfectly, I get so many compliments on it, and it hasn’t had any wearing or chipping of the design no matter how rough I am on it!"
5.0,"wonderful, colorful and fits just right"
5.0,These clogs fit ad work great in the shower.
5.0,"Love this T-shirt. Good quality fabric, great printing. Totally adorable."
5.0,Love this bag. Very low profile. Great functionality. Love the material. Super bag for my guy! He loves it.
5.0,I used these on the back of my daughter's Girl Scout vest. They worked perfectly!
5.0,Love it! Fits perfectly. Usual Pandora quality.
5.0,Was very pleased with this set.  I thought they were plastic but they are really nice and heavy metal and beautiful stones.  Will be getting more.
5.0,"This is a good looking and comfortable watch band. Any user of leather watch bands will attest that you must buy a new one when the old one wears out, or before if you want to maintain a good look to your watch. So if you have to replace one, why not get one that looks good and is comfortable. I have an inexpensive, under $40, Timex watch that has a gold-tone case and a white face. After I combined this band with the Timex I received several compliments for such a nice watch. The band makes it look a lot more dear than it actually is. I've only had the band for a couple of months so I can't tell how long it will look nice but it seems quite durable and hasn't shown any sign of wear, other than where the buckle rests where there is a slight indentation. I found the band easy to install. It came with spare pins and a tool to remove the old pins as well as install the new. I found the tool somewhat less than capable. I don't think the tool is of much value but it takes nothing away from the nice look and feel of the band. I am pleased with the purchase. I recommend the band and would purchase it again."
5.0,"Ordered this dress in an XL in black. I absolutely love it!  I am 5’6” and normally wear a size 16-18. The XL fit perfectly. It’s a little roomy, but I’d prefer it that way-it hangs better and doesn’t look sloppy. I’m wearing it tomorrow night to a birthday party! 😊<br />My only complaint would be that it’s recommended to hand wash-yuck! Lol.<br />I think I’m going to order another one (royal blue) since I loved this one so much!"
5.0,Love this band<br /> Will buy more.
5.0,"I am 5'4&#34; and weight 145 and I got a med, which I like my shirts a little loose so not to show my belly and it fits perfectly!! Love this shirt!!"
5.0,My daughter loved this shirt
5.0,"If you have small feet, look no further! I wear a women's size 6-6.5 shoes and the size SMALL fits great!<br />I was hesitant to buy these at first because a lot of the other popular, more affordable compression socks looked like they ran big. But I mean, their smallest size was S-M. In my opinion, that's just too broad. I knew my feet wouldn't feet in them because they're on the smaller end of the spectrum. I liked that this brand offered more specific sizing! I will definitely be buying another pair in the future! These socks are super comfortable! I haven't tried wash them yet, so I'm not sure how well they'll hold up, but I guess time will only tell."
5.0,"RFID protection, style, color, & size were all winners for this wallet / purse. My wife needed something that was small, yet could hold her license & cards that was safe. This was it!  She loves it. So, must have done something right."
5.0,This dress is so flattering! The material is thick and stretchy. I'm ordering more and more work clothes from Amazon. Can't beat it for a pretty reasonable price!
5.0,The cap is cute.  My hair is short so I needed a more feminine cap and this fit the bill.
5.0,"It fits very true to size! Might be a little loose, that is the kind of material it is&#62; Which is great and breathable-since I ordered it for summer wear!!"
5.0,My granddaughter just loves this apron.  She is 3 and helps her mommy in the kitchen a lot.  She put it on the day we got it and had a fit when Mommy tried to get it off her that night!
5.0,I received theses beads and was please. The shipping was high.
5.0,"The Serling Silver Spring-Back Moneyclip is a perfect gift for<br />a man.  The spring-back holds the money securely in his pocket.<br />It is a masculine, useable gift.  The quality was excellent.<br />Everything I expected."
5.0,Like the hoody
5.0,Love it. Great quality. True to size
5.0,"Loved this, perfect fit and size!"
5.0,The socks are made of good quality material. Good compression and comfortable. They fit tight and are a little difficult to put on and take off. The customer service is awesome!
5.0,We purchase these for gifts and they have always been a good choice.  The background is a dark blue - between royal blue and navy blue.
5.0,Fits an iPhone 6 Plus! Highly recommend
5.0,"I gave these to my son to use as driving glasses. He just got his license and car. Everyone needs good sunglasses to drive with. He absolutely loves them. They are over-sized and definitely large, almost goggle sized. But, they are lightweight, comfortable, and they wrap around the side of the eyes to protect him from the sun suddenly peeking out from behind a hill. We all love the look and quality of these sunglasses and won't hesitate to get more of them when needed."
5.0,Runs a little big but so nice! So cute with boots!
5.0,The dress fit great. the material is soft and thick enough that you dont have to wear a slip underneath. the length is appropriate for work. I brought an XL for the lenght because I'm 5 &#34;9 with hips and it worked great!!
5.0,Very soft! Husband loves them
5.0,"comfortable, good vision"
5.0,I love the earrings. I wore them to the theater and they looked lovely.
5.0,I love it!! Probably going to order it in another color! So comfy
5.0,"Arrived nicely packaged, and as pictured. They fit great. They block the sun without being dark! Love them! Would recommend and buy again in other colors. It comes with a nice soft case too.<br />As for other reviews saying something about a sticker on one or both of the lenses that leaves a mark when removed - my sunglasses arrived with no sticker on either lense and no damage to lenses. They are just perfect and I'm sure I will wear them until they can't be worn anymore! 😂"
5.0,"Cute and compact. Plus the shoulder strap is the perfect length. It's pretty small inside, but that's excellent for me, otherwise it'd be full of junk."
5.0,"Love this, and use them with driving due to a tinted windshield"
5.0,Very good Dress !
5.0,These are very comfortable. Fits as expected and very reasonably priced.
5.0,Excellent choice.
5.0,Beautiful dress the fabric is a little thin but overall it's beautiful
5.0,Fast and very good
5.0,"Cute top!  I ordered a size up to get a bit more length, and it like the fit."
5.0,They actually make my chubby body look good! I love the pattern and the fit. Very satisfied.
5.0,They all match in size and color. It's nice to see earrings that are not so small you can't' see them. Great price and quality.
5.0,This cap is larger than the standard surgical bonnets and great for braids and long hair.
5.0,"Love, love, love these sleeves. My son has eczema on his face and will scratch himself to soothe to sleep. These fit SO well and has great stretch. I like you can fold back the sleeves to have access to hands without taking off the sleeves, though that wasn't a feature I ended up using for my son. The silk is soft, but it can wear through after a few months if my son had a rough time sleeping otherwise my son could potentially outgrow them like he has previous sleeves. I'm sad this company hasn't been actively making more to sell."
5.0,Just got these yesterday and replaced my old Oakley lenses that I had pretty beaten up. So far I really like looking through these. We will see how they hold up in the long run.
5.0,Super cute!We loved them.
5.0,Good value and Cute shoes.
5.0,I get so many compliments on my earrings. I love them so much!
5.0,I love this product. They fit perfectly.
5.0,"It's priced so good , you should buy more then one! I ordered 2 more after trying the first one, so I had time to clean them in between uses. You will absolutely sweat while working out!  I also like the zipper better then hooks , much easier to put on. You  probably could wear this under your clothes to smooth your figure and lift your chest if you purchase the right size. ."
5.0,Purchased these for my trip to Jamaica and they were awesome. Comfy and I was able to wear them with flip flops as well!
5.0,"Beautiful dress, true to color (got the wine color) as well as true to size."
5.0,"It’s always nice to find a bra that fits you well and offers the best support. The quality, style and fit of this bra is great. I feel super confident while wearing it. Highly recommend."
5.0,Loved it. Super cute.
5.0,Love the fit. Love the style. Love the color. Love the price. Will order again in other colors.
5.0,I like the way they make me feel
5.0,"I am very happy with my Dirndl, it looks and fits great, shipping was very fast too."
5.0,I bought this band for my Fitbit Charge 2. Super cute and I love the color. I wear this to work out in and doesn’t bother me at all. Love the snap of the band. The color is a little more on the gold side but looks good when you’re dressing it up.
5.0,The first package I received fit small but the company was very helpful and sent me some of the newer socks and they fit great and are really comfortable. I would order them again. This company went above and beyond to make sure that I was happy with the product.
5.0,Super cute and great quality!
5.0,"This chain is really beautiful.  I love it, and wear it a lot.  What a bargain, too."
5.0,I bought as a little surprise for my boyfriend he loved it. Not too flashy but enough style and still manly looking.
5.0,They are confronted
5.0,"These came with a size tag on them that said M, which I suspect is because they actually only come in three sizes: S, M, and L. I already have a pair of uskees overalls (black) so I already knew what the sizing is like. I selected a '34' on the size scroll, though I am actually a 32 - I like a loose feel. So these would be a little loose on someone who is actually 34, I think. They would be tight on a 36 waist. As a 32 they have that nice, 90's baggy look. They are nice quality and a nice color and the straps give you a lot of room to adjust."
5.0,Quality product well made
5.0,Very cute and just what I was looking for.  It will be nice to wear once I get to the beach.
5.0,"Comfortable dress. A little revealing up top, but I wear a 36D bra, so for some it may not be an issue. A little tank underneath solved my problem. I ordered another print also. Great dress."
5.0,Good coat. Warm.
5.0,"I loved this for my fairy godmother costume!!!!! It was poofy and magical and not too long, even for my 5&#34;1 frame. Although I was wearing 3 inch heels, so that helped."
5.0,Great quality for the price. My husband loves it.
5.0,"Cool item. Takes a little getting used to, but once you do, it’s awesome."
5.0,"Nice looking, sturdy, and comfortable band for everyday use."
5.0,Got these as best friend necklaces for my daughter and I. We both LOVE them so much and the glow is crazy bright!!
5.0,Fleece is not too heavy- perfect for fall/spring weather :)<br /><br />Fits as expected- might want to go up a size if adding heavy layers
5.0,I loved it more than I expected
5.0,"A nice sized chain link, not delicate, and the ""cousins"" charm is large enough to be noticed and be read easily."
5.0,Fit okay at waist but seemed a bit long/ below knee.
5.0,I got this for a costume party and i was a hit. I was asked to take so many photos. This costume had just the right amount of sexy. I did have to purchase my own tights and the legs straps came lose once or twice but nothing major. I loved this costume with i had a reason to wear it again
5.0,These were absolutely amazing.  They are very warm and waterproof.  I typically freeze when hike in freezing temperatures. These pants kept me warm and dry the entire day.  I ordered a 27 and they fit great!
5.0,Fits perfectly. Great quality. Love it 😍
5.0,I had to get a 3x and I'm a size 16 up top.  It stretches so not a big deal.  It's nice.  I'll order more.
5.0,"I am very pleased with the iwatch leather band.  It is a pretty burgundy and is very comfortable, soft leather. I would recommend it to others and would buy it again. Thanks TJT"
5.0,Beautiful dress! Very comfortable and great material!!! I added a short cardigan to it for a cool night. Perfect dress and I felt the the belle of the ball.
5.0,Large fit perfecr
5.0,"Great product, great packaging, came with a case, cleaning cloth, and mini screwdriver, would and will buy this item again"
5.0,I ordered one XL but it was just a bit snug so got 2 more XXL. Nice soft nightshirt.
5.0,Get a bigger  size than what you wear.
5.0,Love the vibrant colors and the fabric is super soft! Fits bigger than anticipated but I love putting it on after a long day.
5.0,They look fantastic! The cut of the stone is brilliant and the earring base is very sturdy and well made.
5.0,Fits better than imagined. Super stretchy and over all good quality for the price. I’m 5’8 and 140lbs give or take and the medium fits great.
5.0,Nice looking boot
5.0,I wear these as undershirts and they are very comfortable. They are also long and stay in place so no issues with it becoming untucked.
5.0,"I really really really love these plugs, despite the fact they aren't actual stone they are a very reasonable price and great quality for glass"
5.0,So vibrant 💐
5.0,Beautiful dress. Glad I bought it
5.0,"Very Cool looking!! Sweet not into ""jewelry""prefer more natural look +"
5.0,"Absolutely love this little dress.  Super comfortable, I got so many compliments today. I’m 5’7”, 165 lbs. I typically wear a ladies size 10 - the large fits me perfectly."
5.0,Very Nice.... would be fun for a Bride or a Tea party / bridal shower-tea party.
5.0,Very cute and dressed up my watch for a wedding.
5.0,Such cute glasses love them
5.0,"Great mask to use with everything going on right now. Fits great and looks even cooler when being warm. I use it, my kids use it, and my wife. Great price."
5.0,The dress fits like a glove. Can adjust how short you want it with the drawstring at the bottom. The top also scrunches down more as you pull.
5.0,This sweater was warm and not itchy. I got a lot of compliments when I wore it.
5.0,good quality.  impressive.
5.0,Very nice polarized sun glasses for the price. Fit well and work great.
5.0,"I'm in no way a cape aficionado but this cape is awesome! It's soft, silky, and a great green color. I'm not going to lie...it make me feel awesome and I'm 25. If only I had more reasons to wear a cape in public this would be my go to"
5.0,My grandson loves this sweatshirt!
5.0,"Very stylish watch, for a decent price. The functionality of the watch is sub par, however the sleek style and easily adjustable band make this watch a no-brainer for the price. Functionality- 4/10. Style- 9/10.  Price- 8/10. Average- 7"
5.0,Nice dress I love it
5.0,"I really like the fabric. It's a little thick and very soft. The fit is nice, too. I got a small and I'm 5'3"" and 150lbs. It is just baggy enough to be super comfy and still look good on me."
5.0,"Just as described, comfortable to wear, I forget they're even there. Can't complain esp for price. If your contemplating or thinking, just get them they're cheap, doesn't turn green, and not overly sized and huge. Honestly can't think of a reason to not like."
5.0,"Love this dress!!!!  5'5&#34; 225 lbs.  I ordered an xl because I normally wear a 16.  Can't button it all the way without pulling, but it works with a cami."
5.0,This t-shirt definitely fits absolutely perfect no matter if you're lumpy or your flat like it really doesn't matter like it's a super comfortable shirt that just fits and it doesn't fit too snug it doesn't fit too big like I got the size that I regularly wear in most t-shirts which is a little snug around my chest area but this one it just fits So comfortably.
5.0,Sturdy and good quality
5.0,"The neck gaiter fit well around my neck, but more importantly they feel great.  I use them as a sun block when taking rides in my convertible.  I generally don't care for something around my neck, but these are soft and not to tight as to be restricting.  A great buy for the price!"
5.0,Very good purchase for me. Well made and attractive.
5.0,"It was just as pictured. Even a little bigger than I thought it would be, which is great!"
5.0,"Super cute and looks great on the actress I bought it for! The polka dot detail on the  fluttery sleeves is a great touch. The fabric of the dress itself is nice, too."
5.0,They are really pretty :)
5.0,I love the colors. They look really nice on.
5.0,"Very warm, soft and cost effective.  Machine washable - always nice."
5.0,Best glasses that I own...love them!
5.0,I love these little moccasins! They are super cute on my 15 month old (she’s tiny so I had to order down in size). She’s able to run around and do her little twirls all over the house without falling as they have the perfect amount of traction on our tile/wood floors. I would definitely recommend. The quality of them is fantastic. Will be purchasing other colors in the future
5.0,"A gift for grandma, and she loves it! The pendant looks high quality--even more breath-taking than pictured here. The stones shimmer and play with the light. The presentation box is also beautiful."
5.0,Those boots are great. they are very comfortable and the size description is accurate. It fits beautifully.<br /><br />I loved that it's warm without leaving my feet wet or suffocating.
5.0,Very happy to have a 3-ply mask.  I no longer feel the need to double-mask in public places.  Only 1 set of ear elastics to deal with!
5.0,"I was really surprised how fast I received this! But most importantly the wings are perfect.  I love that the fabric is a sheer pearlescent color and it doesn't drag on the ground (I'm 5'2'').  There's a ton of different light settings and colors that you can easily switch between with the hand held button.  It also comes with an arm band for the battery box which I prefer, rather than having the battery attached to the neck piece and making it heavier on your neck.  The neck band is pretty wide but not a problem, I'll just readjust where I need the Velcro to fit my size better.  Altogether great item!"
5.0,"I love this one, it has good quality and the color is beautiful. I had received a lot of compliments."
5.0,Great shirt. Great fit.
5.0,"I love these. I hate masks, they don’t work, this is all ridiculous but for places that I must go that require them this mask is awesome. Can breathe right through it. Obviously it does nothing but no one has given me a hard time when I wear it. Looks ‘protective’ enough I guess"
5.0,Love these earrings! They are very comfortable to wear and look great.  Not too bulky either.  I have had quite a few real peacock feather earrings but they don't last long.  These will definitely last much longer.
5.0,Wow I assumed it would be a loose fitting mask<br />fits snugly  great for the bus
5.0,"What caught my eye with this cardigan is the material and overall look of texture. I'm a huge fan of the oversized look and this fit the bill. The fit is perfect, it's cozy, and warm!"
5.0,Great product will buy again!!!
5.0,kids love this light glove...leave it in the jacket pockets and they're never without.
5.0,"Soooo cute. Love it. I tie a knot in the front to show a little belly, paired with denim shorts. Super cute summer look. Comfy and free-flowing."
5.0,"No complaints, no more mask ear irritation or flinging glasses to the pavement when removing my mask."
5.0,Looking great on me
5.0,Love em. I even like wearing them inside. They make everything seem a little brighter. Cuts down on the glare of on coming headlights. They are not however a magic bullet for driving at night.
5.0,I purchased the size 4 short these pants fit amazing I have a hard time finding work pants that fit right with length and size along with material. These hit all the mark I even went and bought them again
5.0,This hat is well designed and manufactured. The image quality is great!
5.0,These can break in the wind and it is nice to be able to buy a replacement rather than a new shade. The Coolaroo sun shades are a life saver from the summer sun on West facing windows.
5.0,"Son-in-law needed new ties for job interviews. While these are not high end, they look like they are. They served the purpose. He now has a job (but doesn't need a tie)."
5.0,"Very soft, light weight, comfy and sexy feel. I bought a larger size expecting it to fit small and it's a little big. I would say that item is true to size. I need to buy my regular size next time."
5.0,She loved it!
5.0,"The fabric is really nice quality, and it fits really well"
5.0,"Real soft, great for wearing winter boots"
5.0,"Love, love, love this dress. Excellent quality; great fall dress. Fits true to size. I will be purchasing additional colors. Would definitely recommend."
5.0,Wow this is so comfortable to wear. I highly recommend it.
5.0,I did have to return for sizing purposes but it is a super cute bathing suit that covers my mommy stretch marks
5.0,I love everything about this and get tons of compliments when I wear it!
5.0,Beautiful this is a gift for my Grand daughter who has a new baby boy so just perfect
5.0,This dress is well made and the material is elegant.  Much nicer than I expected.
5.0,It's a good-looking replacement and gives me a better sense of security for my I.D.
5.0,"These are perfect!! Super flashy! I have been wearing them with my new green dress. They are simple but flashy. Very lightweight and didn't irritate my ears, even though my ears are sensitive."
5.0,This backpack was just sooooo good it had ample room for a 2in binder gym clothes and a couple books great bag for school... Just honestly the color isn't as good as it seem on here the grey/red one
5.0,Both granddaughters thought their MOSISO bags made ideal ballet bags.
5.0,"Great shirt, for these always go one size up."
5.0,"New kids trend, what a money saver."
5.0,"Not too big- just a simple bag, blue is muted and not bright, looks modern. I can fit keys, wallet and phone easily. Can stick a book too if needed but I doesnt look empty if I only have a few things. Sits crossbody nicely."
5.0,It's a gift but it's so cute it makes me wish I had a sister.
5.0,love this hat
5.0,It fits him on the tightest setting.  Alarm and other features are handy for daily routines. Easy to read and we set it to synchronize with the atomic clock.
5.0,"I adore these, but there are some specifics to know-<br />Fabric: Stretchy polyester fabric, not fleece or french terry. Wonderfully light & incredibly soft, but not a very durable fabric. I do expect a few small holes within a year of regular wear. Excellent if most joggers are too warm.<br />Sizing fit: I am 5'4"" & 150, medium is still generously sized but not baggy, the fit looks almost exactly like 80s stirrup pants, in between leggings & OG sweatpants. Bought them for my 5' mom, way too long. On me, very high waist (or can be worn at natural waist with baggier ankles), very slim silhouette, but not right to the skin. Very flattering if you don't love bulky clothes<br />Other notes: Good pockets, but don't overload, they aren't designed for heavy wear & tear. Nice long ankle cuffs, made of doubled fabric, not ribbing. Lightly gathered waist lies flat & works well for a high waist fit.<br />Appropos of nothing, when I put them on, they seemed very familiar from long ago, even tho the slim, light jogger style is fairly new in the US. Then I remembered my awesome super stretchy pink pants with pockets that I brought home from China in '91...joggers are just a version of very, very, very inexpensive but comfy, colorful pants that Chinese people were wearing as they transitioned away from the ""Communist Party"" uniform look, toward modern fashion, before anyone but the VIPs had money."
5.0,This top was even better than I expected. The color is as vibrant as the picture. The material is not thin at all and  it will look cute dressed up or down.
5.0,This sunglass holder are great because I am able to use them for many things. I can put my cell phone in it to make sure it does not get scratched while in my purse. Also I like that I can put my earbuds in this so that way the cords don’t go all over the place. The material is nice and soft and this is great because I am able to use it to clean the smudge marks of my glasses as well. Overall these bags are a great product.<br />I did receive this item for free or at a discount price in exchange for my honest opinion.
5.0,Great quality dress. I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and it is perfectly modest for our Christian meetings and out in the ministry. I am 5’ and 190lbs and an XL fit perfect. Of course most dresses are longer on me due to my vertical challenge.  It is a little thin but definitely not see through at all. Perfect for our hot and humid Kentucky weather.  I will definitely repurchase in other colors.
5.0,Absolutely perfect just what i wanted  ！
5.0,"This is an awesome shower curtain that is guaranteed a compliment whenever someone new sees it. It came with nice hooks, not the cheap plastic ones that some people have received. It did come wrinkly and is a little thin, but it is a shower curtain and the wrinkles are less apparent with a few hot showers. Overall, a fun purchase that brightens up the bathroom."
5.0,"Super comfortable, doesn't show feels great with athletic shoes.  Highly recommend."
5.0,Perfect size. Wear them daily
5.0,Love these frames and great protection for my eyes. Nice case and great quality.

5.0,Our son loves these.  They keep him very warm and he prefers them over any of his other jammies.
5.0,This dress was bomb for the price I wore it for Valentine's Day and felt unstoppable. This dress has very good stretch and didn't crawl too much while walking. Ladies this one is a must have
5.0,The material is so soft and I love the message!! I would buy from them again.
5.0,Very comfortable!  Classic
5.0,"Love, love, these socks I work 13 hour shifts. My feet and legs never hurt with these!"
5.0,"I followed the other reviewers comments and went down a size. Right now I would be an XL and I ordered L. Fit was good, slightly shorter than I expected but not terrible. There is some slight tightness at the shoulders when I go to take it off or put it on so I do have to be careful. Overall perfect cover-up or outfit with a belt and leggings."
5.0,Great short.  Comfortable and not see through.
5.0,"Best hat I ever bought! Perfect fit, feels great. I may even start wearing it to bed cause it is soooo comfortable!First leather style hat I have ever owned. I would buy this hat again!"

5.0,"Everything I wanted! Great for running, ventilated and stays put."
5.0,I love these! They stay out and are super cute! Best I've found. I highly recommend!!!
5.0,"Pros: The jersey fits as I expected (I have a bit of a gut and the XL fit great). Did multiple script styles on the jersey, and it came correct. Letters/numbers are screened on, but that’s expected for under $40.<br /><br />Con: Wish they were a little easier to communicate with.<br /><br />Conclusion: Highly recommended!"
5.0,"Cannot beat the value of this package.  The quality is good and the color variety is excellent - with the exception of the pink/reds.  They are a little more similar than I would have preferred.  Nevertheless, if you're beginning a collection of lapel pins, this is ground zero."
5.0,My daughter loves them!!!
5.0,Very happy with material and fits to size.
5.0,"And great gift!!! He said it was very comfortable, so thanks<br />for a nice product!!!!"
5.0,"Heavy material and beautiful. Very sturdy. Came in a box but isn't quite tall enough for the center piece so I had to bend that back up. Not a big deal tho.<br />Definitely not quite ""purple"", more like a burgundy/purple. Gorgeous anyway."
5.0,I bought one in the fall of 2015 and wear it during cold weather driving a forklift outside in all kinds of weather.  I stay warm and dry.  A new co-worker saw mine and liked it so much I ordered him one.  He loves it.
5.0,"Wow, great product!!"
5.0,"As described.  I bought a medium, I wear a size 31/32 regularly, and the fit is good.  Maybe a little tight.  Its the right size though, as most clothes I buy are mediums.<br />Nice large pocket that runs down the crotch all the way down deep.  Comfortable fit.<br /><br />I used to always put things in my briefs and it would be quite uncomfortable grinding against my junk and moving around.  This is a great solution."
5.0,very cute dress..
5.0,Great product!  Very comfortable!
5.0,Fits perfectly (I ordered petite and have small wrists) love that they clasp in the back rather than having to squeeze your hand through!

5.0,Fit as expected. Excellent quality.
5.0,Very good quality and good cushioning for the chrome book. It’s a little big for my 11inch chromebook but I don’t mind it as you can put the charger and mouse inside it. It does have pockets also where the headphone or other stuff can go .<br />I really like it the quality is very good . It’s not flimsy at all and the straps are connected to the cover through proper buckles so all in all I give it full points

5.0,"This was super cute and arrived on time. I did learn that you had to be careful undoing the snaps. The material around the snaps is soft but not strong, and I accidentally pulled the material away creating a small hole trying to undo the snaps. The outfit still worked and overall I was pleased. My girls looked adorable at Thanksgiving!"

5.0,"I'm a big fan of the movie ""Kill Bill"" and I loved when Japanese actor 'Sonny Chiba' played<br />the role of Hanzo Hattori i.e. samurai sword smith and Sushi chef. Funny thing though is that<br />people don't recognize the shirt from the movie but actually they think I vacationed in Japan<br />and ate sushi at a famous restaurant."
5.0,The material is high quality and I love that it can be casual or add a cardigan and make it more dressy!

These are still some of my favorite leggings from this brand. They've really improved the waistband so it does not gape. Go with your normal size, size down if you’re in between sizes."
5.0,"Great lookin cap,love it"
5.0,"Nice pair of goggles, they fit on my Hemet perfectly. I really liked the way they packaged them so they would receive minimal damage during shipping."
5.0,"First off - I love socks. A little bit of a sock snob. The package was small and tidy - so super environmentally friendly. Big Plus for me.<br />I have never bought Balega before and may never wear anything again. These socks are made from little pieces of clouds, clouds from heaven. The little flap in the back - oml this is what has been missing from my life. No more blisters!<br /><br />I am super happy and will be purchasing more!!"

5.0,liked pjs
5.0,"A month ago, my two-year-old fell in love with a pair of lace-up sneakers, despite my attempts to persuade her into a velcro pair. I'd heard about &#34;no tie&#34; laces, but I'd never tried any. Forgive my skepticism, but I really can't believe how well these work. When I put them in, they seemed pretty loose, and I worried the shoes wouldn't stay on her feet. I was wrong. The shoes stay on her feet just fine. Even better, she can easily slip the shoes on and off by herself, saving time when we're trying to get out the door. As you can see by the picture, she's played hard in her shoes over the past month. But her laceez are holding strong (and still remarkably white)."
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by how soft these are. I almost didn't order these because the pattern & the material didn't look very good. But, they are!"
5.0,Wish the material was a little but thicker but my daughter wears jackets and hoodies year round so she loves it. I am really happy with the design especially with all the runes around the bottom. Definitely a good value for the price.
5.0,"very Earthy tones, nice selection of beading.  prettier in person then the picture.  good construction and materials, have a 6.5 wrist fits perfect completely drawn closed."
5.0,Hermoso acabado
5.0,This purse is great! It is now my daily bag as it is roomy and comfortable to carry.  The dark cranberry color is very pretty and is perfect as either a casual or more business related bag.  My iPhone 7plus fits into the side pocket so it is easily accessible while I'm out and about. Highly recommended!
5.0,Excellent little bag.Ive used the full size bags before but don't need that for my current job. This bag fits the bill. Small but sturdy.
5.0,Exactly as described! Went well with my baby’s overalls.
5.0,This shirt is really comfortable and is flattering. It's great for work during winter and it holds up well in the wash.
5.0,"I love the dress!!!! It fits like a dream, it feels soft as silk, it drapes perfectly and moves beautifully. I love dresses and this is the most comfortable dress that I own. I will definitely purchase from this seller again."

5.0,I bought this for my son for Christmas and he is totally thrilled with it.<br />Thank you for selling an item that has made my son a very happy camper!
5.0,"First of all, I own long sleeve version of this shirt already. And when it's time to get a new shirt for vacation but not fancy and just casual one and when I saw this I just had to get it. I love lace I love blue and I love horizontal lines lol so this shirt was perfect!! I'm usually size 6-8 for shirt and 8-10 for pants and I'm 5,1&#34; 155lbs right now and prettt short lady. I got size Medium and fits perfectly. Since I'm short, the shirt looks longer but it's not too long and actually it's just long enough to cover my hips which I like. Materials are thin-ish and if you don't wear anything underneath, your skin can probably see through on white part. I would suggest wearing camisole or something if you don't want to show your skin. Overall I like it and I'm planning to take this shirt with me on vacation this summer."
5.0,"Lip rings themselves are great.<br />Came in a box with another item, and the box had been ripped open, and very badly taped back together. Idk if it was UPS or amazon. All the items were there, just a crappy way to get my stuff."
5.0,I'm in love with this purse. It's a perfect size purse\backpack . It's soft. The straps dont dig into your shoulders. Its perfect..very happy with my purchase. I get a lot of compliments.🥰
5.0,Bought this as a gift for someone who has varicose veins and occasional swelling in legs and got feedback that it is perfect! Originally had gotten them the 20-30mmHg and was told that was too tight so I kept the higher compression for myself and got this lite version for them.
5.0,The runner girl was larger than expected and of very good quality.
5.0,"The questions asked are not relevant to this product.However, I love my CardCubby.  We are required to purchase a certain number of gift cards for my daughter's school.  This organizes them so well."
5.0,My kid likes it for Halloween
5.0,5'6 and 175 lbs. I ordered a large. Still very flattering and tight on the tummy but flowy on the bottom!
5.0,I received this product sooner than expected and it works perfectly. I thought the rod would be too long but it wasn't and it looks beautiful when dancing. The product is really well done.
5.0,This is a beautiful bracelet.  It runs a little big my wrist are a 7 1/2 and this was a little big but is adjustable.
5.0,"These earrings are so beautiful, I get lots of compliments on them. I have a very easily triggered nickel allergy, but these are high quality and contain no nickel as stated - I have no reactions to them when they're in even for several days at a time! They stay in place securely without me feeling like my ear is pinched or restricted. They're even comfortable enough to sleep in! Highly recommend if you're looking for inexpensive, high quality statement earrings for everyday use"

5.0,Excellent item very useful highly recommend!

5.0,I love them I want more!11
5.0,"I loved the dress, so comfy and fit perfectly!"
5.0,"I had adult ""goodie bags"" this year that I handed out to adults. They fit a carton of Aspen Mulling spices, two bottles of apple juice, two insulated paper cups with lids, a travel bottle of rum, and directions perfectly. The hit of Halloween!"
5.0,I didn’t expect this outfit to be as gorgeous as it is. It looked really pretty but in person it is really beautiful and well made.
5.0,Even nicer than I expected especially for the Great price-very nice quality.price. I’d actually purchased it as a gift and ended up keeping it and buying another one!  Not convinced the stone is real though.
5.0,"Love it!!! I bought this for my teenage daughter and she gets so many compliments on it!! Has a gorgeous blue glow on it. It's super creepy but in a cool way, not in a I'm a serial killer way"
5.0,"Overview:<br />As described, medium weight, predominantly cotton, sizing is accurate.<br /><br />Experience:<br />Socks are very comfortable. Have some middle support and the heal and toe have extra padding. Fabric is soft and stretchy. Ordered the 6-9 size and fit is good (6.5 in shoes).<br />Conclusion:<br />Really great socks, made well, fit well. breath well, have some arch support all at a reasonable price."
5.0,"These are Great! I followed the advise of the other reviews and got a size bigger than I normally would,  and they fit perfect! Look really good and are very comfortable. I highly recommend."
5.0,Love! Got these because my feet were super sore during pregnancy! Just amazing for long walks!
5.0,"I got this for Christmas from my husband, but I picked it out.  I did replace the necklace due to it only being a 16inch I think (maybe a 17).  I needed an 18inch.  Beautiful necklace though"
5.0,Me encantó el traje
5.0,A stretchy and cheap dress for large chest area. Really happy I bought it.
5.0,Very nice quantity watch for the price
5.0,"I love love love the look of this suit even my husband who prefers me in skimpy suits loved this suit however, I listened to everyone who said to  buy a size larger, so I did and it is great until it gets wet then its too big!  I am a size 8-10 (sometimes a 6 sometimes a 12) so I got the 10-12 size and am totally regretting it.<br /><br />The suit itself is cute, it is lined so the lining is pretty tight and then the other fabric is looser which is nice!  it is so super cute I am going to buy another in smaller size to see if that works better and keep this one in case we get preggo again!"
5.0,When I first took it out of the packaging I thought I messed up and bought something for myself. It is pretty big. My little 6 month boy fits into well though. The material is thick and well done. It will be very warm for the winter. If its a windy day you might want to try something else since this is knit. The soft and stretchy material is perfect for the little one. He really loved it too. I am thinking of buying another one or two in order to have backups. This is going to last him a long time.
5.0,Very very soft. Color is a tad dull.
5.0,I originally bought this dress in May for my granddaughter's wedding. Dezzal shipped it to me from China ASAP so it could be there for me on time. It is a beautiful dress and everyone commented on it at the wedding.<br />I am so happy I bought this dress for a granddaughter who asked for it. The color is a little darker and because of this even more beautiful. She is thrilled. It was shipped to me within a couple of days so she now has it for the holidays!!!<br />  Thank you Dezzal so much. I have purchased other dresses from you and have always been very satisfied .

5.0,The dress fit well and is light weight
5.0,It’s one of my favorite masks. I’m an adult and it fits my face.
5.0,Beautiful necklace and quality!!! My goddaughter is in love with this necklace.  The pineapple is 3D and hollow!  Would defiantly suggest to others.
5.0,I liked these better than my Allen Edwards and Woodlore shoe trees. Fit great in the toes and the heel is nice and wide. Quality seems just as good as the others I have. I decided to put these in my Allen Edwards and other higher end shoes. I will definitely buy more as the need arises.
5.0,This is a great sports bra. I like that I don't have to fight with the straps to get into it or feel like a contortionist. It fits perfectly.
5.0,Beautiful necklace. Everything you could want. Excellent!
5.0,"Works as expected, but buy two of you have a full length outback jacket."
5.0,"The hat fits snugly and isn't too hot. I really hate jogging in cold weather because you have to find a very delicate balance between over/underdressing. This hat meets that balance. It's a little small and doesn't cover my ears as well as I would like, but I also have a pretty big head so no surprises."
5.0,So freaking cute. Very lightweight and comfy. Throw these together with some galaxy inspired outfits and take it out of this world!
5.0,"My sister got me this Coach pill carrier that came with three clear pill containers, which is such a big relief for me. Now I don't have to carry my original pill bottles everywhere I go because I can place the prescription lables from my pharmacy onto the little bottles and not worry of accidentally being stopped and questioned if my medications are were prescribed by my doctors. This is awesome."
5.0,"Lovely color, nice and cool in hot weather and I LOVE the logo, OF COURSE!<br /><br />Would purchase this brand, again!<br /><br />♥️💗💜"

5.0,The strap fit perfectly and with the enclosed parts was easy to put on
5.0,To much beatiful¡ elegant its perfect!
5.0,"This is PAPER straw, not real straw so its folds are bends, not breaks.  The folds pop right out right after you open the package & pull the hat out.  And, since it's paper, you can decorate it if you wish."
5.0,Excellent my grand son loves them.
5.0,They’re shorts. The cover you below the waist but not below the knee.
5.0,Very comfortable. The material is soft and washes well. I have had so many compliments about how cute this shirt is. Definitely buy it!
5.0,Great product! Quality good
5.0,so far I love it. very flexible to fit almost all fingers. havent had it long enough to see if stones fall out or if it hold up long term. but it looks beautiful and fits great.
5.0,"Good material, design exactly desirable. Little larger, but that what I wanted! My grandson is very happy!"
5.0,This was a gift for my mother who is a bee-keeper it's very cute and affordable. Customer service from this company is wonderful. Thank you.
5.0,Bellísimos. Tal cual que en la foto
5.0,Had these for a year now and still going strong (and they've taken a beating)
5.0,Well crafted and glows very brightly when charged
5.0,Very great quality
5.0,"This is a very eye-catching and attractive watch that also doubles as a pro-Paris statement in light of the recent terrorist attacks.  The watch is easy to read, keeps time well and is water resistant.  The band, however, is a woven cloth band as opposed to leather, so I am very careful with it, as it may be more prone to fraying over time and the white section can more easily show up dirt or smudges. You can also set the date, which can be read through a small window.<br /><br />The packaging is very impressive if you plan on giving this as a gift.  It comes packaged in a thick brown box with BUREI printed on it and the watch is set on a vinyl pillow.  It coms with a warranty card, instructions, and tag.  In addition, it comes with its own rope-handled shopping bag, which makes it look as if you just went out shopping and bought it from a luxury retailer.  Very nice.<br /><br />I've never heard of BUREI before but I'm impressed with this reasonably priced, well-made and eyecatching watch.<br /><br />I received this item in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
5.0,This was surprisingly nice. It is very soft. My teen daughter loves it!
5.0,"We love Robeez and these were a great price. Good quality, I bought them as a gift."
5.0,Absolutely stunning. Will be ordering more!
5.0,Very nice and warm!!! Would definitely purchase again!
5.0,Beautiful and fun
5.0,Just so beautiful
5.0,"This is a really great bag. I've had it for several months now, taking it back and forth to work daily. It's durable and looks good. At first, I thought it looked a little bit more ""purse-like"" than I wanted, but it quickly weathered and relaxed its shape a bit, and it's now clearly a man-bag lol. The only issue I have with it is that because it only has a shoulder strap, and no handle, it's a little bit annoying to initially pick it up. You have to fumble a bit to grab both parts of the strap to lift it, or grab the bag with one hand and then sort out the straps with the other. That said, I like the design as it is (without a handle) and despite this issue I would easily recommend it."
5.0,"This is a great aluminum wallet for the money! I had a previous one that I paid almost 3 times the price for. The Clasp on this model is far superior to the other aluminum wallet I purchased. The previous aluminum wallet that I had, the clasp broke after about a year and if it fell out of my pocket, all of my cards would go everywhere. I do not see that happening with this one. The clasp is far superior, as I mentioned before. I definitely recommend this product, and the money strap is a nice addition!"
5.0,The quality is second to none!
5.0,Good quality for the price. Perfect with dresses to cinch in the waist.
5.0,"I LOVE THIS! It is perfect, exactly what I expected and wanted. It fits my wrist perfectly and so far doesn't stretch-out my hair tie to much!"
5.0,Beautiful rosary great price very happy with my purchase.
5.0,A good value for light flexible frames and clear lenses.
5.0,I absolutely love these bras!
5.0,I am on my 4th pair of these in 6 years. Would definitely buy again.
5.0,these socks are great.  it helps my LO not to slip on hardwood floor.  They are really cute too!
5.0,Exactly as described! I would recommend to a friend.[[ASIN:B0189IV6X4 YQB0104 Dark Grey Metal Mens Set of 5 Sizes For Boys Stainless Steel Tie Clips - 4 Pcs & Money Clip - 1 Pcs Set By Y&G]]

5.0,Elegant-- prettier in person
5.0,Great top with leggings
5.0,nice links and nice packaging. look very professional.
5.0,"This hat is extremely cute and very good quality, I have gotten so many compliments on this hat! I love how it has the metal clasp in the back rather than a plastic one, it just makes it look nicer. 10/10"
5.0,"I didn’t buy it from amazon but bought it from a local store. Quality is good, design is wonderful.<br />Very fashionable."
5.0,"It Is as described, and would be a good accompaniment for any outfit. It Is soft but durable, It has compartments for quite a few cards, another pocket for cash and a separate handle that wraps around your wrist."
5.0,Comfortable and good looking are the two descriptions for your shoes! Thank you .
5.0,My favorite most comfortable beanie ever… Can be used as a comfortable sleep beanie for a cool bedroom or in general as a winter hat. Beautiful style and supremely comfortable. Of all my scarves and winter hats this is my favorite set!
5.0,Nice looking belt. Awesome value!
5.0,"I'm 5'5 128 lbs athletic build and this fit  great. It stayed put around my shoulders with a small amount of the top shoulder showing . I bought it to go with a 20s style dress and it  looked great! No shedding , nice feel. I would recommend!"
5.0,This 2 piece set is great for lounging around the house in and would look great as everyday wear too! I got the celadon green color and it looks really nice. The buttons match the color perfectly so they blend in well! It is super comfortable and the collar and cuffs are a thicker fabric which is nice as they hold their position better. Highly Recommend
5.0,"At first I was hesitant because of the price, since I will only be wearing it at the pool and beach. But I'm so glad I bought this cover up. It is worth the money, great quality, I love the colors and it is so cute!! I can't wait to wear it to the beach this weekend, I am sure I will be getting a lot of compliments when I wear this. I am 5'6, 126 pounds and it fits great, plenty of room/extra fabric."
5.0,I like the variety of colors and I wear a mask under it.
5.0,These photochromic glasses are just what I needed.  The fit is comfortable and I only need one pair of glasses for day and night.
5.0,Great product will help at work greatly
5.0,The fit was good and what I expected
5.0,Love it! Great dress- haven't figured out the bow yet :D
5.0,"These are awesome for the price. Just what I was looking for. I like the black because I sweat a lot and the black does not show sweat spots. They are thin, but again, I sweat a lot and do not need a lot of extra material. I like them also because they are long on me (they go all the way down to my crotch) and at 5'9&#34; that rarely happens. I don't know how well they hold up, I've only had them a week, but for the price I can afford to buy more and I would definitely buy these again."
5.0,It is a Christmas gift. I Know he will love it.
5.0,BEAUTIFUL!!! Loved my black one SOO much had to buy the cream one also. Very well made. Matches SOO much. A MUST have! Summer or winter...this will be out all year round & worn a lot.
5.0,This dress is beautiful and will definitely turn heads. The only thing I don't like is that it's a little too thin but it isn't see through... It definitely will be if you buy a size too small though. I'm 5'8&quot; and about 145lbs and this fit me perfectly! It's all very stretchy and fits a little below the knee. Wearing it with heels like great on a night out or at the office; throw on some flats and it looks good on a day out during the summer.
5.0,"Quality was better than expected, very soft and looked well made. My niece loved it and said it was just what she wanted."
5.0,Liked the feel and fit and the soft inside fleece!
5.0,Absolutely love these! I wear my hair up in a messy bun a lot for work so these are perfect.
5.0,These are perfect for everyday wear. They're lightweight and easy to secure. The diamond cut adds just a bit of sparkle. Very pretty!
5.0,Good sleepwear very comfortable
5.0,"Okay, it fits kind of big but I was expecting that- I just have a kind of small head. It's probably like &#34;average&#34; size though. I didn't buy this for chemo; I bought it to sleep in with my extensions.  My extensions are 24 or 26&#34; and I don't want tangles and I'm not the best about putting my hair up at night. I throw it in a quick, loose braid and then put the pretty cap over it and the hair still looks nice in the morning. The hair seems to last longer and I can spend less time getting ready. The bonnet is pretty though, the fabric is pretty soft and there's a lot of room in it in my opinion."
5.0,The driftwood was absolutely perfect! Love the shape that was chosen for me. Arrived in one piece. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase!
5.0,It was a gift from me to my granddaughter and she loved them. 🤩
5.0,Very nice costume jewelry
5.0,Very cute and what a great bargain.  Fits great and nice quality!
5.0,"Very easy to use, voice clear as my dad cannot see too well."
5.0,"Just beautiful. As a previous reviewer has noted, these are not natural stone, but seem to be some kind of composite. I see this as a positive, since that means they are lighter than natural stone would be. I strung them with a small gold bead between them, and the resulting neclace is lovely--I've had dozens of compliments."
5.0,"Have two and bought one as a gift. Cutest, easiest and styling way to go! And surprisingly doesn't mess up your hair! Love it!"
5.0,MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS HAT
5.0,Amazing key chain!!! Love it
5.0,"Bought these for my wife and she loves them.  Whenever she wears them she always gets compliments about them.  I would highly recommend this product... especially if you are a Star Trek fan.... just kidding, Star Wars fan!"
5.0,"Love it! Just what I was looking for! The material is not too thick nor thin and fits great. I am 5'5'', and weigh 143, and am toning up my body. I got a medium and it was great."
5.0,My husband isn’t a fan of PJs but we get them every year at Christmas and he LOVES these! He had worn them so much and is asking for another set.
5.0,"The shorts fit perfect and the top was a bit snug, but not bad enough to order a larger size.  Very comfortable and I love the color."
5.0,I received this a month later but now I know that it ships from Thailand. I really like this dress. It's material is light and it has you feeling fresh all day. I will be buying from here again.
5.0,Very cute. Was exactly what I wanted.
5.0,3X shirt actually fits a 3X guy!  Nice quality shirt and image even after machine wash & dry.
5.0,"I bought this because I wanted a bright, beautiful pattern. It’s even better in person. Very well made. Very happy with my purchase."
5.0,I love these bras. Perfect bit of snug and give.
5.0,"Beautiful, but my skin is too sensitive to wear cheaper jewelry and it caused infection."
5.0,"These socks, as you can see pictured, go well above the knee. My niece is a teenager and she is loving these socks worn above her boots or with shoes above her knees with shorts, something I would never wear. They fit her well and are comfortable and never slip down. She is loving them! They are just what she wanted. The size is perfect and fit a normal leg with lots of give. They are not knew length but over the knee."
5.0,Love these laces. This is my 4th pair for my toddler shoes. They make putting his shoes on and off very easy. Best yet- no laces to tie.
5.0,These sunglasses were exactly what I was looking for. They fit well. The polization makes it easy to see at any angle.
5.0,Love this walket
5.0,Work on the farm and these pants are very comfortable after a wash or two. Best buy
5.0,Fit perfect. Have nothing bad to say about them great boots
5.0,"Gorgeous print.  Nice fitting through bust, but flowing lines make it great for hiding bulges."
5.0,"Perfect for me. keeps my driver license, debit card all in one place."
5.0,Got this as a gift for my friend. She wears it all the time and loves it. The hat shipped out fast (thank goodness because I was way behind!) The quality of the hat was great and so was the price point.
5.0,The assortment of many colors was just what was needed to dress up many of my jackets.
5.0,We love our hats!! Fut prefect.
5.0,I purchased this to replace the one I had and this one was smaller than the other. Most likely due to the age as this fabric pattern is an older pattern. But my favorite so I was glad to find it. Just need a smaller phone.
5.0,nice and soft too
5.0,"Not my favorite, good for everyday wear. Great price."
5.0,"I bought this for my wife, she is blind. She is very happy I could buy a new one!"
5.0,Thank you...
5.0,"i love how this came with its own tool to take the links out cause i have such a tiny wrist i always need like 3 extra taken out, the color and quality are so nice i love it so much."
5.0,Christmas gift to a co-worker that's a fan and they loved it!
5.0,"They really work, will order more 👍"
5.0,This is one of my favorite hats! I wear this hat all the time and always get compliments. Great quality and I love the mesh. It makes it easy for my head to breathe!
5.0,I purchased three of these sweaters - will order more.  I took two on a trip to California.  Fit was wonderful - I ordered the medium - I'm 5'2&#34; medium build.  The fit draped my hips - sleeves a little long but I just pushed up my arm or turned sleeve over twice.  If you buy the black make sure you wash by hand with no other items.  It bled quite a bit - but after drying the color was still good.  A little pilling I just took a razor to remove.
5.0,fits and is warm
5.0,"Great fit, fast shipping"
5.0,This pajamas are so cute.  My grandson loves them.  They feel soft to the skin and are good quality.  I will buy again!.
5.0,"good price, good quality a little hard to breath through, but I guess that means they are working."
5.0,"A Christmas gift, and he loves them!"
5.0,Excellent gloves. Keeps fluids away from my hands.
5.0,"This is a very classy looking, good quality handbag. The patent leather look is gorgeous and I get lots of comments on how nice this bag is. Two things to be aware of: the green isn't quite as vibrant as in the picture, but I actually think it's nicer. Also, the opening is a little tight if you have a big wallet or something like that, but once again not a real problem."
5.0,Fit perfect such a different cute bathing suit I cant wait to wear it I am a mommy so this one piece is still fresh and not old mommy look
5.0,"I only wish I had found these lenses sooner. I bought Oakley replacement lenses for years. When Oakley ceased making lenses, I was forced to look for alternatives. I stumbled across SEEK and have loved them. These fit perfectly in the frame, show no distortion that I can find and hold up better than Oakley's lenses. My biggest issue with Oakley lenses (aside from cost) was that they got scratched really easily. I have a number of SEEK lenses now and find that they consistently hold up better to drops, bumps, etc. My only complaint about their colored lenses (e.g. blue, green, etc) is that they aren't a perfect match for the original colors offered by Oakley. That makes it easier to recognize that they are aftermarket lenses; however, they still look great."
5.0,Bought it for my brother and he loves it.
5.0,So comfortable to sleep in!  I have the short set ones and ordered these crop ones.  Love them!
5.0,This was a gift for my grandaughter.There are multiple nose rings. She loves the silver one.
5.0,"Secure, convenient way to carry $$, credit card and ID when traveling or attending outdoor events."
5.0,The color and fit were just as pictured.  The fabric is just what my sensory kid likes.  He wears they daily.
5.0,Plus size friendly and chest comfort! (225-230 and DDs) I could of sized down lol but even still the fit was perfect. Add a petticoat and boom! Instant fluffy adorableness! The material is easy to iron and over all it was well worth every penny spent.
5.0,Loved these shoes! My twins wore them for a wedding and didn’t complain about comfort once.
5.0,"Love the style, and the material. It's has somewhat stretch to it and it's not thin. Very comfortable... Can dress it up or wear casual. I ordered a size up based on reviews and it fit perfect, so it does run a little small."
5.0,"I've worn this dress to multiple events now, and for the price, it's held up astoundingly well! It feels luxurious without emphasizing every lump and bump you might have. Also as a bustier woman, this actually fits at the chest which I'm super happy about - because that's hard to find."
5.0,Love this purse
5.0,Nice fabric. Pretty pattern. Fit as expected. Has pockets.
5.0,Came quick..looks great
5.0,very beautiful and great material
5.0,Got these for my daily workouts. Look great and function well. Happy with my purchase.
5.0,"For a less expensive mask it is well built and quite frankly, fun to mess around with at work"
5.0,These are awesome. As a guy with long hair it's hard to find a headband that will look good and be effective. These check both boxes and at a killer price point.
5.0,My granddaughter loves this little dress and she looks so precious in it!  So glad I bought it!
5.0,Purchased a new Cub Cadet zero turn.  It had nearly solid rubber for seat springs. Rede was bad.  Threw them out and installed these.  Made the ride much better.
5.0,"i love these shoes!! i was so happy when they arrived earlier than expected and I could wear them all night long. the arch feels good, the support is strong, only issue is the ankle strap could've been a little bigger and i have slender ankles so it's not me."
5.0,Its a carhartt. Dih
5.0,This is a great simple sheath dress.<br />Fit is tts.<br />Can be dressed up or down.<br />Could be worn alone in summer or with a jacket or sweater for most of the year here in the South.<br />The material is a cotton blend and is a nice thickness.<br />Love the pockets.<br />Great staple piece!!
5.0,Cute! Exactly as pictured.
5.0,beautiful love it
5.0,"This is just what I needed. I hate carrying a big bulky wallet. This allows me to keep my essentials with me while allowing me to easily carry in my purse, hip pack, or even pocket. I love the bright colors and cheery designs. I loved it so much i bought a second one for my mom!!!"
5.0,It was ok but upon opening it was in two pieces but it snapped back together.
5.0,So soft and light weight. Can be worn in the summer or winter!
5.0,This dress is exactly the way it's described.  Fits according to size and is simple and elegant.
5.0,Cute little tower for my keys.
5.0,"I love how this shirt fits.  Looks good with having a large chest.  38DD.  I could have maybe orded a size bigger.  But, very flattering for sure!"
5.0,"I'm glad I purchased these, I was eyeing them for a while. The pattern and color is very pretty."
5.0,Very pretty! Using for a money lei for graduation 🎉
5.0,love Michael Kors purses
5.0,Sooo cute I wear the star and heart all the time their the biggest of the earrings and their so worth it
5.0,Great for couples who want matching cat ears!
5.0,"Great tank..........,...,,,,,,,"
5.0,Love the colors & what they represent
5.0,This top is so cute!! it doesnt go as far down my stomach as i expected from the pictures but i still love the fit. The material is very light weight and comfortable. the quality of the top all together is very nice.
5.0,"I'm not sure what this is going for price wise at the time of this review, but it's a cute, touristy type necklace that fits perfect on the beach and with summer outfits.  The cord has an extender so you're not stuck with a choker type necklace if that's not what you want. The shell is a real shell, cute and inexpensive. I'd pay about $5-$7 for this necklace and wear at the beach. It's cute as long as the price is right and your expectations are set accordingly."
5.0,"I bought this to use with the shoe stretcher, as the stretcher itself was not enough. I was stretching deerskin moccasins which are very resilient and the spray helps them stay in place after they have been stretched as opposed to popping back into their original location. Very helpful when you have arthritis and it hurts being in too tight shoes"
5.0,Purchased for a Kentucky Derby theme bridal shower! Looked fabulous with my outfit! Great quality for the price!
5.0,I like them but I got them big
5.0,Great size carry on bag for traveling.
5.0,Special and Lovely
5.0,"I love these earrings. They're gorgeous, distinctive, and very sturdy and well-made. The top stud is attached very well, and the thread feels like embroidery floss, nice and thick! Also, the thread of the fringe is easy to smooth back into shape if some of it gets pointed a weird way in between-wear storage - and that's something I cannot say for *any* of my 10+ other pairs of fringe earrings!<br /><br />My only issue was the fact that I bought the two-pack containing the pastel pair and the pair with magenta and bright turquoise fringe, and instead, I was shipped only the pair featuring teal and orange fringe. I really wanted the pastel pair, so I came back and purchased it separately. But I didn't even mind! What can I say - they're great earrings!"
5.0,"This is a beautiful body con Lingerie made by FIYOTE. When received the item seems very small, but when putting the item on it is apparent the item will stretch to ones body size. It comes to the upper thigh and is very durable as I have worn it several times already. Beautiful piece of lingerie that is perfect for those intimate nights."
5.0,"My kids love these shoes! They have worn them around the house and to church. There is a break-in period though as the back of my daughters' heels hurt after a few hours of initial wear. That should go away with time though. Not sure how they hold up as I just purchased, but they seem solid. They are also true to size."
5.0,"I purchased the Zebra print and it has gorgeous colors with the black background, goes with most of my wardrobe!  There's a crossbody strap included!  I have an iPhone Xs and the fit is perfect!  You can access the phone pocket on the outside of the wallet, very easy access Velcro closure.  Then when you open up the snap closure to the bi-fold, there is a top zip compartment for change or whatever, (I keep my ear pods in there and maybe earring and necklace) just in case, so, inside there's 2 see through ID slots and additional 12 slots for credit cards, there's also a pocket for your paper money or whatever you need to fit there!!!  It's a beautiful, perfect, lightweight phone wallet, with attention to detail for storage!  Just what I needed for vacation, without carrying a heavy bag.  Thank you Anuschka for creating and sharing such gorgeous art work!"
5.0,Very happy with the product.
5.0,it was too small but quality was right on
5.0,easy to wear. feels great
5.0,"A little shorter than I would like, but love these shorts. Very comfortable."
5.0,"For less than $14, this top is of excellent quality.  Not too thin, sewn properly, and was shipped very well.  It looks great, too. There's not much to lose when making this purchase."
5.0,Awesome teacher gift!
5.0,This lot better than rubber one when bought
5.0,"It’s perfect, will take it with me for a Disneyland trip ❤️"
5.0,Loved the unique design and color of these earrings. They were for my daughter and she loved them.
5.0,We were so happy that they fit my daughters small hands
5.0,Pretty jewelry starters.
5.0,Diva darling
5.0,Love this vest.
5.0,This is in fact a beutiful watch..if you have tiny wrist dont think is for you the watch is really big i have big wrist so no problem for me to use but it is really big..I love it..
5.0,The should have 100 star option I used for my weeding 5:7 170 pound I love it never regret
5.0,"Buy one size up because it runs just a little small. It's not too far off on size though. Really wasn't sure what I was going to get with this shirt, I took a chance and I'm so glad I did because it paid off! The cut is really flattering and I love that the back hangs way down over my butt. I first bought it in grey promising myself that if it didn't fit perfectly, I'd return it. I was pleasantly surprised with the actual shirt. So I bought it in orange and red. The colors are a really good match for the pictures. It arrived on time and has a slightly sour smell when first opened but just hang it to air out and the smell goes away within hours. My only complaint is that there aren't any more colors I like. The blue is a little too royal for me and I hate that shade of pink. If they had a dark purple or kelly green, I'd buy immediately. I'd take this shirt in all of my fave shades if I could!!"
5.0,Exactly as expected.  I'm looking forward to using this a lot more.
5.0,Pretty cool. My husband loves it.
5.0,"These are beautiful little pops of pretty!  These are the perfect size to add a little glam, w/o being gaudy.  The color is beautiful.  I like them so much, I bought another color, and will likely buy all the colors.  They’re leverbacks so you don’t have to deal with earring backs that get lost & they’re very comfortable to wear.  Love them!"
5.0,I own a lot of NinaQueen charms and they are all really nice.  I like this one because the little feet on the bear dangle and it looks like they move.
5.0,Soft nice looking lots of compliments on my red boots
5.0,light enuf  to not be in the way/can fit under  seat easily
5.0,Fits great and super soft!
5.0,Didn’t fit as we thought.
5.0,Given as a gift and the recipient seems quite pleased with it!
5.0,Just like the pharmacy glasses...only cheaper.
5.0,Cool comfy when walking
5.0,"Bought this hat to complete a magician's costume.  Very cute, and fits well.  Now I just need to teach my son how to pull a rabbit out of it."
5.0,Really like these but no arch support
5.0,Beautiful!  They are a perfect fit and a reasonable price
5.0,"I purchased this for my husband of two years for Christmas as a replacement wedding ring since he lost his. It arrived a bit after Christmas, which is fine because some of the things he purchased for me arrived late as well. I was so excited to see how it looked in person, as I fell in love with it from the first time I saw it (just like my husband.) When I opened it I noticed something on the top flap of the cardboard box. Much to my surprise, the sellers of the ring took their services a step above the rest by including a personal message and reminding me that if the ring didn't fit to contact them immediately. This little bit extra that they put into the packaging made me smile from ear to ear. I opened the cute, little red ring box and couldn't believe my eyes. I was almost in tears by how beautiful the ring had turned out to be. I was so pleased with the turnout that I took pictures of the ring for a good 30min to an hour. After getting some &#34;glamour shots&#34;, I began wrapping the box in not one, not two, but four different layers, just to build the suspense for my husband. I couldn't help but to smile like the Cheshire cat at him as he unfurled the layers of wrapping paper. I believe he was speechless for a few seconds because all he did was look at the ring and smile before saying thank you to me. I pointed out the inscription on the inside of the cardboard parcel and he thought it was very thoughtful as well. I am glad he was as pleased with his new ring as I was. :)"

5.0,Does exactly what I wanted it for
5.0,"Material was just as expected. It is very sheer, so recommend wearing shorts underneath. Perfect fit. I'm 5'6 and about 145 lbs. Size S. It was also a lot shinier than I expected."
5.0,Bonito color.
5.0,Delivered very fast!! Very cute and I like that you can adjust them to different sizes depending on how you want to wear them.. would recommend this to people
5.0,Great color great fabric and great fit

5.0,I love this dress! The material is smooth and doesn't feel cheap and arrived promptly. I get compliments every time I wear it and have been asked where I ordered it. Looks a lot nicer than what you would expect to get for the price. I would order from them again
5.0,its cool didn't even know it glowed till I was looking in the mirror in my moms truck
5.0,absolutely beautiful - might even order one for myself next time
5.0,"I wear a 40 D and my breast can be too heavy for many of the sticky bras. However, They stick very well if you make sure that you do not use lotion or oils. I wore them for 10 straight hours in the Texas heat and they didn't fail me. I did play with placement and found that aligning the nipple with the bra gives my breast a weird shape. This was easily fixed so do not get discouraged. I did not cut it because not every outfit is the same and I didn't want to run the risk of ruining it. I will buy the other color so I can wear with lighter clothes. I'm in love."
5.0,I’ve used this for about four months now. Pretty cool I’d buy it again
5.0,"They are very comfortable, I love them"
5.0,Super cute pair of pants I get a lot of compliments when wearing them. They fit as expected I purchased a small (I am 5 foot in about a 110 pounds) but I can imagine if you're on the taller side they would be a little bit short.
5.0,"Awesome product ,fast shipping , my teenage daughter loves it !!!"
5.0,"I refuse to order a pin from my college and pay an upward of 40$ plus, um no. This is perfect and will work just fine."
5.0,Used at end of the season and they loved them!
5.0,Very causal comfortable.
5.0,Easy to wash. No wrinkles
5.0,Granddaughter loved them for her cosplay.
5.0,This is a nice hat for the money.
5.0,Love the ring!
5.0,"Love these belts, and I have already ordered it in four colors, no matter the long shipping time and the fact that they aren't prime eligible. They can upgrade the look of a basic dress or tunic. FYI, the white color is an off-white, and doesn't match too well with bright white shoes. Still like it though"
5.0,Very good quality and cheap glasses. I would recommend to anyone ...
5.0,I got this for both my kids and my 4yr old loves them they are cute and colorful she doesn’t take them off
5.0,"Very comfortable,stretchy, would love it in black or even red. It’s also a good length not a mini- very flattering."
5.0,Cute outfit!
5.0,"Actually large enough to wear! I ordered 6 similar items and these pants from Tropic Bliss are the only ones that seemed to understand how big American women really are (I'm 5'8&#34; and 155lbs). I also like the fabric, the style,  and seeing that the person who made them had suitable working conditions & earned a fair wage. Definitely ordering more from Tropic Bliss."
5.0,I saw this style on an actress the other night on TV and said to my wife &#34;Do you like that look necklace?&#34;  &#34;YEAH&#34; she replied. I had it in my wish list already. I bought it for my Queen and when I actually got to handle it I liked. It's really nice and I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this fun inexpensive costume jewelry.
5.0,It's a tad smaller than I thought it'd be but it's adorable and I wear it all the time. It glows really well too
5.0,Really great glasses for the price! Well made and very flattering!
5.0,"Olivia Welles' Penelope Sparkly Gold Plated Crystal Rhinestone Cuff Bracelets for Women is sparkly, gorgeous, and unique.  I am so happy that I ordered it!  Olivia Welles' jewelry is always nicely boxed, making beautiful gifts; however, this one was for me.  This gift box one was no different--when I received it and opened it, I got a big smile on my face.  The bracelet was so pretty.  Then, I tried it on, and it was perfect and sparkly.  I recommend Olivia Welles' Penelope Sparkly Gold Plated Crystal Rhinestone Cuff Bracelets for Women."
5.0,Very great quality and sturdy!
5.0,I liked them and decided to order again
5.0,These are perfect - fit great and are comfortable.  Makes rings fit perfectly and not slide around.
5.0,"Great accessory for your Ghostbusters costume! Worked perfectly - recommend changing the batteries as soon as you get it, as it does have a 'demo' mode which can cause a drain."
5.0,Great colors. Excellent fabric
5.0,perfect except for the size being a little small.  My grandson is nine an he will not get to wear it long.
5.0,It’s very beautiful and cane a little bigger than I thought it would.
5.0,I like these socks - I bought two packages because of a disappearing sock problem which leaves me with just one sock and no matching sock. Now I have four socks of the same color for every color. I hope this solves the problem
5.0,"Got this for my VPK grad as a gift. She loved it, it’s feels like a special gift"
5.0,It fits perfect.  Easy to clean.  Inexpensive.  It is comfortable.
5.0,"Well made shoe that allows you to wear the shoes on flat pavement without having to actually step on the clip. This shoe includes a set of SPD cleats in the box, so you do NOT need to purchase another set unless you want to upgrade or change to a different style. Overall I'm happy with the purchase."
5.0,This is Amazing!! No more ear pain for me
5.0,"Nice fit, nice fabric, nice color. I am not a thin person but I consider this blouse to be very useful for wearing with jeans...I really like it."
5.0,"Beautiful piece. Came in a very pretty pouch, arrived in a timely manner. Very pleased."
5.0,I needed another long sleeved dry-fit shirt. Since I visit Yosemite several times a year this was perfect. I love the color and that there is an image on the front and the back.
5.0,Fantastic will buy again next season no questions!
5.0,mom & son very pleased with this purchase.
5.0,Great product and gift!
5.0,Exactly what was needed to complete a simple Cheshire Cat costume.
5.0,great results with my boots
5.0,Great nose piercing
5.0,Looks good. Secures well.
5.0,These gloves were exactly what I expected. They are the color shown in the picture. The cigarette however was crap. It fell apart the first day I got it. The order did come very fast  however.
5.0,Exactly as described and a perfect fit.
5.0,"This is the second time I bought this dress, just a different color. And oddly, it fit perfect! Soooo comfy, I was able to wear it for a full shift at work while doing a promo on a product! Compliments lije crazy! My only struggle was that the fabric wrinkled easily...and held the wrinkles. (Photo taken at the end of the day.) But I LOVED it and felt super adorable in it!"
5.0,"I have done a lot of traveling lately. I wish I had this item long ago!!!  I love it. Very well made. The pictures do not do justice!!  It looks scuffed but it isn't. Smells like new leather - MY FAVORITE!!  This is a fantastic way to keep up with a wallet, phone, & keys for a minimalist like myself. I'm going to the beach in a few weeks and I can't wait to take it with me!!!<br /><br />The product came with a dust bag for safe keeping.  I got this item at a discount for an honest review. I would have absolutely paid full price. I can't say enough how much I love it!!!<br /><br />I am editing this review because I discovered something new and so great about this bag.  I can fit my iPad mini & phone (wallet case included) inside this bag!!  I am also going to order a computer bag for my husband for Christmas. The whole Tiding line is so great. CHECK IT OUT!!<br /><br />I was given this product at a discount for an honest review. I did gibe five starts because I like items that really go above and beyond what I expect when shopping online. My review has not been bias, sellers have to earn their stars. If you find this review helpful at all, please click the &#34;Helpful&#34; button below 👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼!!! Thank you for your time ☺️"
5.0,Bonita y buena calidad
5.0,I love this dress so comfortable...the pockets are a big plus. I got an XL and it for great..will order again in more colors
5.0,Very pretty. Fits perfectly on my bracelet.
5.0,"Love this back pack, currently using it as a purse and love the amounts of storage, just wish the drink holder was actually large enough to fit a bottle."
5.0,It's a wonderfully warm coat!
5.0,My 13 year old son loved it!<br />Nice shine and very elegant too. Qlty much better then the $135 one I saw in Macy's.
5.0,"I ordered the shirt in Rosy color, size XL.  I usually wear between XL-1XL.  This fabric is perfect for Florida summer weather.  It's not loose but not tight,  perfect fit for me. Will order more when able too!!"
5.0,Looks like the picture! Feels good.
5.0,Beautiful piece. Product exactly as described. I love it!
5.0,Very soft material. Comfy.
5.0,"Despite the appearance of the picture, the gloves aren't excessively slouchy unless you want them to be. I'm 5'11 and 145 pounds, my arms are fairly lean, but then pulled all the way up the elastic is tight enough that the gloves don't slack but also aren't cutting off the circulation in my hands. They seem fairly warm, though I'd probably wear a second pair of thinner gloves once the cold comes in earnest. Overall, I can't say that I actually needed these, but the price was very attractive, shipping was fast and at the end of the day I want to stay warm because summer is dead...and Winter is Coming."
5.0,Es espectacular me encantó
5.0,I love this sweater. I get so many compliments! It fits exactly as expected.
5.0,Horse show
5.0,I love these boots!! I would just recommend getting your own insert for support!
5.0,Sturdy and stylish.
5.0,Fit was great. My granddaughter hasn’t stopped running and playing since she put them on!
5.0,"I got this watch from Amazon almost 2 years ago and it's still going strong. It's been through many things: bumps, underwater, dirt, daily wear. It still keeps time perfectly and hasn't run out of battery yet. Best little watch ever!"
5.0,This bracelet is durable and will surely last a LONG time.  The wording is not simply painted on so that adds to the durability.  It showed up quickly and well packed.  I would recommend the the product as well as seller !!!!!
5.0,"Very pretty two piece. Fits almost as expected. I'm middle age, 5ft 6 and about 130, typically wear medium. However, I prefer to buy seperates and when I do I get a large top and medium bottom (most always). Since this came as a set, I opted for medium - as typically that is what fits best as a set.<br /><br />Bottoms fit well and are full coverage.<br /><br />Top fits OK. Cups are not quite large enough for me but works OK. The cups are molded. It does smash my breasts in some due to needing to be larger but do not believe that is fault of the product so didnt deduct on star rating as that wouldn't be very fair.  Hubby said was wearable in public so can't look too bad/small but would like it better if the cups were a tad larger without the band being larger.<br /><br />I did get this at a discounted rate for an honest review. This bikini fit 2nd best out of 5 I've purchased in Amazon so it's pretty good on sizing, unlike some that were unwearable. Worth buying unless your typical size varies alot with seperates. If my review was helpful in any way, let Amazon know by clicking helpful below."
5.0,Perfect size and can hold a sizable amount of groceries.
5.0,LOVE this product. Every mother should have them for their toddlers.
5.0,"This sweater is very soft and well made. The material is a little thicker and should help keep you warm during cooler months. I am 5'5"", 145lbs, 34C and ordered a Small for a more fitted look."
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress! It is a bit long, so you may need it shortened if you are short. However, this means a maxi dress that is actually long enough for those of us who are a bit taller. I am about 5' 7"" and think it's a good height- would be perfect height for someone who is 5'8"". Fit is very flattering, even for someone who has no curves. I am 5'7"" 120 pounds and a small was perfect. Definitely would recommend. Super cute and super comfy! I also have this same company's maxi skit which I also love."
5.0,Nice lightweight top.  Very comfy and lose fitting
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress. I have never ordered a dress online before so I was of course very nervous on if it will fit. I am a curvy girl so buying things without trying it on is a bit of a gamble. I went through other reviews on the dress and followed the advice to order a size up, which I am glad that I did because the dress fits great. I feel awesome in it. Now I want all of the dresses! I know I will stand out in a great way when I wear it. The length is a good length, I love wearing tights with dresses but this dress isn't to long or to short, So I do not feel as though I would need tights.  I would say it is a little above my knees, I am 5*3 if that helps. You will have to get a specific bra to not show in the front as the one I had did, but it does look fine without a bra as well."
5.0,These arrived in a timely fashion. They are well packed and came in great shape. The product is sturdy and well made. Job well done and thank you kindly.
5.0,"these are all very pretty and eye-catching! i don't care much for the fact that they screw into a base to secure and the screw / hole is quite tiny... even so, very lovely earrings and a great variety for the price."
5.0,Keeps my arms very cool indeed. They really work.
5.0,"I love this cape, it is large enough to completely cover my client and their shoes keeping hair off of them."
5.0,I needed some darker glasses to cut the glare on my morning routes.  This work perfect for me.
5.0,"love these, they soak up a lot of sweat and keep it out of my eyes, and the colors are awesome"
5.0,"Love them, they look and feel great."
5.0,I love THIS.
5.0,"Classic sterling silver starfish pendant with box chain.<br />I really love the modern but classic design, this will make a great gift."
5.0,"This cap is simply amazing. It is carefully crafted of genuine materials, no junk. The leather looks and feels great. The lining covers the entire inside of the cap and it is very warm without making you sweat. This is an investment in your warmth and wellbeing. One note on sizing, be sure to order at least one size larger. I measured 60mm and ordered the XXL (62mm) which is still just the tiniest bit snug, though not uncomfortable by any means. The only issue is having the patience required to wait for the cap to arrive.  They are all shipped from Poland very promptly, but will still take a week or two be delivered. If you want a classic look that honestly keeps you warm, get one of these."
5.0,"Love these and will definitely purchase again.  They are crazy durable even though they are bendable!  And I love the style too, they are super cute and get compliments on them often"
5.0,I bought these for my mother in law and she loved them.  I actually wanted to keep them.  They are a great size and nice and bright silver.  A plus is that they are light weight.
5.0,"As advertised. It allows me to wear my medical bracelet all the time, even in the shower."
5.0,"Very pretty necklace. I have gotten a few compliments on it, and I got the stud earrings to match, so it looks very sophisticated and nice. No one can tell that it is a cheap, &#34;fake&#34; necklace, but I know that I didn't have to pay a lot for a beautiful necklace and earrings. Worth every penny so far."
5.0,The material is a b it thin. Perhaps would go great in the spring and fall months. But the length was great.
5.0,Lite weight - love the shape - quite comfortable to wear and didn’t break the bank.
5.0,The sunglasses are beautiful. They have great side eye coverage.
5.0,Delivered quickly and fit as expected
5.0,Muy buena calidad por un pequeño precio
5.0,These keychains are just as described!
5.0,Grandson loved it!!!!!
5.0,Love the fit and looks great whistle out on the town.<br />Cheers!
5.0,She like them
5.0,Very comfortable and chic! I need a pair in black now!
5.0,Muy bueno y muy bonito.. no produce alergias
5.0,The color of this 1/4 zip pullover is beautiful. The quality is outstanding. The price is very reasonable.
5.0,Fantastic. Was able to convert a clutch into a crossbody. Well made and the screws actually work unlike many of the other amazon products. Bit on the expensive end but you’re paying for quality.
5.0,I want it in silver
5.0,I love it! Good quality. I recommend it
5.0,Tiny but cute (:
5.0,"This a fun little/big poofy hat. I purchased this as a gift for a child, so it was a little big, but he loved it! He is a huge Super Mario Fan and is excited to wear it for fun hat day at school! The quality is comparable to that of most costume wear, it is not thin and inexpensive feeling. Nor is it super plush, but it does &#34; poof&#34; up as it appears in the picture."
5.0,"Very cute rings, and they don't discolor my fingers because they're stainless steel."
5.0,So much fun and I get so many compliments on it.  A wonderful summer addition to my wardrobe
5.0,Very nice!!!!
5.0,"This is the old gold color size 8. My real ring is size 7.5, and this 8 fits well. It doesnt constrict my finger like a rubber band and isnt loose enough to fall off. Its soft and light on my finger. I suggest sizing up a half size so its not tight. Great buy."
5.0,Really cute  swimsuit cover up at a really great price point! I’ve only used it once but so far I’m very satisfied with this purchase.
5.0,"Although they don't look exactly as the real badges, (e.g Cascade badge & Earth Badge) overall, everything looks really nice. It's exactly as pictured. The box is neat, and it makes a very nice gift for any collector.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Nice packaging<br />-Very Cheap price you are paying<br />-Makes great present for anyone who loves Gen 1 Pokemon<br />-Shipping was quite fast<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Some of the badges aren't exactly down to the tee. (Casual people won't really notice though)<br />-Badges COME not in order. (My OCD kicked in an I had to arrange them in order lol)"
5.0,Not suitable for kids under the age of 7. Unless they have a wide face. Overall it is great quality and does the job
5.0,It was what I expected. It fitted real good unlike others that are loose and have to twist the bands so it could fit. This fits well.
5.0,"This t-shirt has probably the least insulting picture among all other t-shirts featuring Stewie, so I can wear it at work."
5.0,Gear was a bit tight around eyes and that was bothersome . After some adjustments it great when riding a motor cycle.  Cold weather that is necessary.
5.0,Love it. Easy to put on. Wear it all the time.
5.0,Good to wear for that bohiemien look.
5.0,Nice apron came fast
5.0,"Shipping was really fast! The box it came in was dented and scratched, but that doesn't matter to me. It comes with batteries already too. stan exo :')"
5.0,"Super cute and comfy! Have already received many compliments and have had people ask where they can get it! Ordered a size medium, fits great!"
5.0,Great fabric and fits well
5.0,"Very nice, flirty yet sophisticated everyday dress up"
5.0,A great Pair of socks!
5.0,"Loved the one in black I got, had to have in white.  A slight bit sheer but a white slip I have on hand will do the trick.  I am going to Southern Italy in July, so this will travel perfectly, be crisp and cool, yet my arms are covered.  As with the black one, I ordered up a size per instructions.  Makes sense as the armholes fit perfectly.  I'm putting a small dart under each breast in the front so the top will look a little more fitted.  Just love it.  Dress it up or down."
5.0,Son loved this!
5.0,"There are so many options for plain-colored hoodies on Amazon, but this one is amazing. I ordered the Sand color and was a little skeptical because of how ""makeup foundation"" colored it was in the picture, but based on the reviews for how soft it was I went for it. The sand color is a beautiful darker tan with a little hint of a heathered effect for some dimension. The wrist and waistbands are pretty stiff but can be fixed with a little stretching. In men's hoodies, I typically buy a Large so that it fits, but I wanted oversized but not huge and the XL is great. Highly recommend."
5.0,CUTE.  GO TO TOP  QUALITY!!!!
5.0,My sister is a pin trader and she said she liked it. Good enough for me.
5.0,happy.
5.0,"Loved it but sizes are not correct, it was smaller for my daughter"
5.0,I have bought 3 pair of these.  They are super cute and comfy.  They wash and wear great.  I have washed and dried them at least 10x and they are like new.  Everyone needs these pants!
5.0,Matches several outfits
5.0,Firm support and good fit. The tops  don't bind or roll.
5.0,perfect for children
5.0,"They are so comfortable and fit perfectly.  I liked the tan ones I got so much, I came back and ordered another pair in black.  I get lot of compliments on them and it's nice to be able to wear a heel.  I quit wearing heels a few years ago after having foot issues and they are ongoing so I just can't tolerate a heel.  This shoe has a great platform and makes it easy to wear.  Did I tell you I love these shoes??!!"
5.0,Simply love it bought it twice
5.0,Fit as expected. Well tailored. Exactly like pic. Very happy with my purchase
5.0,Excellent fit and doesn’t ride up the crouch like other name brands.
5.0,The material is exactly what I needed for the hot muggy summer days in the real America’s southern states.  The patches are perfect and the alligator with the tennis ball in his mouth is classic and snoopy looks disappointed as he walks away!
5.0,Different style but I like...nice and sturdy.
5.0,I got the thumbs up from my friends 11 year old
5.0,It’s good for my mom. Very clear.
5.0,"&#34;Awesome, Thanks!&#34;"
5.0,Great for wearing on a bike with a skirt.
5.0,A+++business. Would do business with again. Thanks!
5.0,"good quality, and looks great"
5.0,LOVE this dress!!! Wish there were so many more.
5.0,"Saved my everything,  after my mastectomy these really came in handy. It helps kept my jp drains out of the at night while I slept.<br /><br />Keep in mind do not get rid of it bc as a survivor you just never know when you may need it again."
5.0,Gave to my neice as Birthday gift and she loved them! They look exactly like pictured.
5.0,I really really like these. I ordered more. Too bad they didn’t have more colors
5.0,"These are a bit heavy for extended wear but are a good quality. The ear wire is held very tightly in the earring with a fair amount of tension, which makes them sturdy but a bit difficult to hook and unhook in ear. These earrings will not unhook or fall open.<br /><br />The matte black coating is almost rubbery in texture. It is well-coated all over. The ear wires are silver tone.<br /><br />The overall size is roughly 3” from top of ear wire to tip of planchette and 1.5” at widest part of earring.<br /><br />I like how matte the finish is. They do not glint or shine at all."
5.0,"I wanted a new sleep set that was short sleeved but long. This is perfect! I can wear the top alone or with the shorts. I usually wear a L to and XL and decided to get the XL for extra room. It is exactly what I wanted! It has a very lose cozy fit. I am 5'7"" and wear a size 12 jeans. I highly recommend and love the price!"
5.0,Like it because its SpaceX
5.0,I love the style and softness of this top and have received compliments both times I wore it.
5.0,"Shirt arrived quickly, good quality, son loved it for his birthday!"
5.0,"El producto fue más de lo esperado, colores perfectos, la talla perfecta 👌🏽"
5.0,Purchased his (black) and hers (red). Very attractive and very solid. Highly recommend this.
5.0,"I love love LOVE the wash and style of this skirt. I’m giving it a five star review because of how great of a piece it is, **HOWEVER** I recommend sizing down. I am a 26.5” waist and ordered the small, and it’s just a tad big in the waist and hips. I wish I would have gone down a size, but it’s still cute and has me looking forward to spring! Nice quality denim, pockets on the front and back, and distressed detail. I definitely recommend this one if you’re wanting a cute warm weather skirt and don’t want to break the bank."
5.0,Love love!
5.0,Just adorable!
5.0,Cute Soxs.  My nieces loves them.
5.0,"I can't really comment on these white gold studs, as I gave them to my daughter who likes the white metals.  However, I am wearing a very similar yellow gold stud with the small screw-on backs, and they are so comfortable I'm not aware I have them in.  I am considering buying myself a pair of the white gold ones.  I love the screws keeping them in my ears, and not scooting across the room when I brush my hair.  Wonderful feature.  RWD"
5.0,"It's very cute and adjustable, too! I love it!"
5.0,"Love the bracelet!  Not too big, not too small -- perfect fit!<br /><br />wish there was a different clasp, but still love it!"
5.0,Fits true to size and comfortable
5.0,Looks are the exact in person
5.0,There super cute pins
5.0,STYLISH GLASSES
5.0,"Great little necklace.  Was purchased for my 3 year old niece.  I will be purchasing another one, if still available, for my other niece."
5.0,"I'm a tall lady at 5'10"" and suffering a bit of home isolation pudge so was worried this skirt would be too short or too skimpy to comfortably wrap with enough coverage. (I'm wearing a size 14 at the moment, usually a size 10 or 12!)<br /><br />This skirt has two different openings in the waistband to run the tie through so it will fit ANYONE from a very small size to my size or even a size or two larger<br />. I have plenty of coverage with the wrap and it's a super cute casual/hippy style skirt. I got tons of compliments the first time I wore it! The fabric isn't heavy, but isn't see through and I'll wear this a lot!"
